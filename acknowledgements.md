# Acknowledgements

This thesis represents not only over a year of academic inquiry but also the culmination of significant support from numerous individuals and institutions. I am deeply grateful to all who contributed to this work, directly and indirectly.

First and foremost, I wish to express my profound gratitude to Professor Matthew Connolly, my primary advisor, for his steadfast partnership throughout this journey. His candid feedback proved invaluable in refining both my arguments and methodology. As the leader of my thesis seminar, Professor Connolly fostered an environment that encouraged innovative approaches to historical research, particularly his support for employing digital methods and data analysis in historical inquiryâ€”an approach that became central to this project.

I am equally indebted to Professor Adam Tooze, my second reader, whose exceptional guidance regarding data analysis and presentation significantly shaped this work. His vast knowledge of economic history and the German war economy provided crucial context for interpreting the patterns revealed in my dataset. Our conversations consistently challenged me to sharpen my analysis and consider broader implications of my findings.

This research would not have been possible without the exceptional assistance of the staff at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland. Their patience and expertise were instrumental in locating and accessing the thousands of USSBS documents that form the empirical foundation of this thesis. I am particularly grateful for their willingness to accommodate my unorthodox requests and accelerated timeline as I worked to digitize the complete operational record of the bombing campaign.

Though they appear less prominently in the final product, I also wish to thank the staff at Columbia's Butler Rare Book and Manuscript Library for their assistance in locating materials related to public opinion polling and other secondary sources. The resources of the Columbia Libraries system were indispensable throughout my research process.

On a personal note, I extend my sincere thanks to my friend Wes Clark, who generously provided housing during my extended research visit to the National Archives. His hospitality made an intensive week of archival work both possible and pleasant.

Finally, I owe a special debt of gratitude to my girlfriend, Rachel, who patiently endured countless impromptu lectures on strategic bombing far beyond what any person should have to bear.
