# Chapter 1: The Character of the Strategic Bombing Campaign

The historiography of strategic bombing presents us with several compelling narratives about how the campaign should have unfolded. The Realist perspective suggests an inexorable progression from precision to area bombing driven by operational necessity—as bombing accuracy proved elusive and losses mounted, military leaders would naturally shift toward less precise but more survivable tactics. The Moralist perspective similarly predicts a dominance of area bombing, but attributes it to the destructive impulses of military leadership using precision bombing merely as a veneer to mask their true intentions. Most strikingly, Fuller's omnistate theory would predict an overwhelmingly barbaric approach prioritizing destruction above all else—even military efficiency—as the emotional connection between populace and state drove warfare toward its most extreme form.

Yet the empirical evidence presents a striking paradox. Analysis of mission-level data from the European theater reveals that none of these predicted patterns materialized. Instead, we observe a remarkable consistency in the ratio between precision and area bombing throughout the conflict, with precision bombing remaining the dominant approach even as the absolute scale of operations increased dramatically. 

In our analysis, we employ the most generous definition of area bombing—encompassing any use of incendiaries or any missions temporally or spatially associated with incendiary deployment—to accurately capture the operational reality wherein ostensibly precision targets frequently devolved into de facto area raids through the combined application of high explosives and incendiaries. This methodological approach explains why the area bombing contribution graph encompasses multiple industrial sectors rather than being limited to city areas alone, as the original categorization provided by the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) proves both incomplete and potentially misleading in representing the actual nature of bombing operations.[^0.5]

The industry contribution graph for the United States Army Air Forces (Figure 1.1) provides the clearest evidence against these conventional narratives. The visualization shows the relative proportion of precision versus area bombing across different industrial sectors throughout the war.[^1] If the traditional narratives were correct, we would expect to see either a large increase in the proportion of area bombing late in the war (Realist view) or an overwhelming predominance of area bombing throughout with only token precision efforts (Moralist view). Instead, the data reveals that precision bombing accounted for 69.0% (1,211,273 tons) of all bombs dropped, compared to 31.0% (544,681 tons) categorized as area bombing. More importantly, this ratio remained relatively stable even as the absolute scale of bombing operations increased dramatically in 1944 and 1945.

The strategic bombing campaign can be analyzed in three distinct phases:

• **Phase 1 (1942-mid 1943)**: 
  - Characterized by relatively low bombing tonnage overall
  - Unexpected emphasis on transportation infrastructure targets
  - Limited operational capacity during this developmental period

• **Phase 2 (Late 1943-early 1944)**:
  - Significant escalation in overall bombing scale
  - Enhanced implementation of precision bombing tactics
  - Notable focus on the "Schweinfurt era" of industrial targeting
  - Diversification of target types to include:
    * Military industrial facilities
    * Airfields and aviation infrastructure
    * Radio and communications networks
    * Concurrent increase in both precision and area attacks on urban centers
  - Resembled the Haywood-Hansell doctrine of precision strategic bombing

• **Phase 3 (Mid 1944-1945)**:
  - Renewed strategic focus on transportation infrastructure in preparation for D-Day
  - Increased utilization of area bombing specifically for transportation targets
  - Maintenance of stable precision-to-area bombing ratios overall
  - Intensified targeting of petroleum infrastructure (oil refineries/fields)
  - Continued bombardment of urban areas, but with a decreasing proportion of area bombing tactics
  - Emergence of new priority targets: explosive manufacturing facilities and storage depots

Overall, precision bombing accounted for 69.0% (1,211,273 tons) of all bombs dropped, compared to 31.0% (544,681 tons) categorized as area bombing. More importantly, this ratio remained relatively stable even as the absolute scale of bombing operations increased dramatically in 1944 and 1945. Both precision and area bombing intensified in parallel during these later stages, suggesting a simple expansion of bombing operations rather than a strategic pivot from one approach to another.

The persistence of both bombing strategies throughout the war fundamentally challenges the traditional historical narrative, but even more striking is the increasing emphasis on precision bombing as the conflict progressed. The conventional explanation—that operational failures of precision bombing led to the adoption of area bombing—not only fails to align with the empirical evidence but actually contradicts it. After the peak of area bombing on industrial centers during Phase 2, the proportion of area bombing relative to precision bombing actually decreased throughout the final phase of the war. While area bombing did increase in absolute tonnage as operations expanded, its proportional contribution diminished—a trend that runs directly contrary to the commonly held notion that area bombing by the USAAF escalated throughout the war. This pattern reflects a steadfast commitment to precision bombing by the United States, even as the scale of operations reached unprecedented levels. To understand these strategic choices by the United States, we must move beyond the simplistic moral dichotomy—a narrative of America’s descent into evil—that previous historians have emphasized.

This evidence undermines a key justification for the campaign's civilian toll—that operational limitations forced a shift to area bombing. Instead, both precision and area bombing were deliberate, parallel strategies from the start. We first examine whether either strategy was truly necessary or effective at achieving its stated aims.

## Area Bombing

The extraordinary resources devoted to area bombing reflected an emphasis on general destruction, yet proved ineffective at achieving its stated economic objectives. This disconnect between effort and outcome raises important questions about the underlying motivations for this approach. The devastating power of incendiary weapons, particularly when combined with high explosives, made them the most destructive conventional weapons of the war. As noted in the USSBS Physical Damage Report, incendiary bombs caused "close to five times as much damage, per ton, as high-explosive bombs" in urban areas.[^2.5]

Yet despite this destructive capacity, area bombing failed to achieve its purported strategic goals. If area bombing had successfully undermined the Nazi economy through civilian and urban targeting, we would expect to see either significant labor force reductions or the diversion of resources from military to civilian needs. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey found neither outcome.

The USSBS's comprehensive analysis found no evidence supporting either of these anticipated outcomes. The Survey's Overall Report explicitly states that "bomb damage to the civilian economy was not a proximate cause of the military collapse of Germany," further noting that there is no evidence that "shortages of civilian goods reached a point where the German authorities were forced to transfer resources from war production in order to prevent disintegration on the home front."[^3]

Additionally, German civilian employment levels remained stable throughout the war. The USSBS's analysis of the German economy reveals that the total employment of Germans, including those drafted into the Wehrmacht and accounting for casualties, remained "practically unchanged throughout the war."[^4] Even more telling, Germany maintained significant untapped labor reserves throughout the conflict. While Britain reduced its domestic service workforce from 1.2 to 0.5 million workers during the war, Germany's comparable workforce decreased only marginally from 1.5 to 1.3 million. This persistence of substantial civilian sector employment suggests that Germany retained significant economic flexibility, directly contradicting the notion that area bombing had put any significant pressure on the civilian economy.

The recovery capacity of German cities further undermines the strategic logic of area bombing. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey's analysis of ten heavily bombed German cities reveals an "extraordinary ability to recover from the effects of ruinous attacks." Hamburg provides a striking example: despite losing nearly one-third of its housing stock and suffering over 60,000 civilian casualties in the devastating "Operation Gomorrah" raids of July-August 1943, the city recovered 80% of its productive capacity within just five months. When industrial output was affected, the analysis shows that worker absenteeism, rather than physical destruction, accounted for the majority of production losses. Moreover, damage to local transportation and utility infrastructure proved insignificant, with services typically restored before industrial facilities had completed repairs.[^5]

The Area Division's detailed investigation of German cities subjected to area attacks provides further evidence of their limited effectiveness. Their Hamburg study concluded that "concentrated attacks (precision bombing) on limited targets were more effective in disrupting vital production than were the area raids on workers' quarters throughout the city." More broadly, the Area Studies Division Report found that area raids generally damaged "sectors of the German economy not essential to war production" and consequently "did not have a decisive effect upon the ability of the German nation to produce war material."[^6] While cities experienced immediate declines in their labor force following raids, they typically recovered most of their industrial workforce within two to three months.

Area bombing cannot be justified based on its practical economic effectiveness. As demonstrated above, it failed to meaningfully disrupt the German labor force or force resource reallocation from military to civilian needs. Attempts to justify it based on its psychological impact are equally unconvincing. The USSBS Morale Division's findings explicitly noted that "the fallacy of the idea that all one has to do is keep on bombing and finally a people's morale will be destroyed had been documented long ago."[^6.5] More recent scholarship has further emphasized the ambiguous and often counterproductive nature of morale bombing, with "depressed and discouraged workers" not necessarily translating into reduced productivity.[^6.6]

The persistence of area bombing despite this clear evidence of its ineffectiveness exemplifies the emotional dynamics that Fuller identified in omnistate warfare. While the fog of war meant that bombing's precise effects remained uncertain during the conflict, the doctrinal foundations for precision bombing had been well-established in interwar military thought.[^7] The decision to pursue and expand a strategy of generalized destruction—targeting not just economic assets but civilian populations—represented a marked departure from this theoretical framework. This suggests that area bombing was driven more by the emotional imperatives that Fuller described than by rational military calculation.

## Precision Bombing

The effectiveness of precision bombing as a military doctrine rests on the understanding of industrial economies as interconnected systems. Developed at the Air Corps Tactical School in the interwar period, this theory—variously called the "industrial web" or "critical node" theory—posited that modern economies function as complex networks where targeted strikes against key nodes could trigger cascading failures throughout the entire system. [^8] This rational, analytical approach to warfare stands in stark contrast to the emotional dynamics predicted by Fuller's omnistate theory, making the persistent American commitment to precision bombing all the more remarkable.

The theory presumed that within any war economy there existed a limited set of facilities or infrastructure points that produced "key items or services indispensable to the economy as a whole, such as national transportation and power resources." By identifying and destroying these bottlenecks, strategic bombing planners believed they could bring an entire economy to a halt with remarkable efficiency.

However, the successful application of precision bombing doctrine depends entirely on specific conditions within the target economy. The strategy requires an industrial base operating at or near maximum capacity, with minimal redundancy in critical systems and limited ability to adapt to disruptions. In such an economy, tight supply chains, significant resource constraints, and numerous bottlenecks create vulnerabilities that, when exploited, cannot be easily circumvented. Without these conditions, precision strikes become more of a nuisance than a decisive factor—the enemy can simply redirect resources or activate spare capacity to maintain production.

In examining the potential effectiveness of precision bombing against Nazi Germany, we must therefore first understand the fundamental nature of the German war economy. Evidence from the United States Strategic Bombing Survey suggests that the German industrial base did not match the theoretical prerequisites for successful precision bombing. As we shall see, rather than operating as a tightly constrained system vulnerable to targeted disruption, the German economy maintained significant underutilized capacity across multiple sectors.

As previously stated, Germany refused to fully mobilize its workforce, particularly women. Although this has often been attributed to Nazi paternalistic ideology, the reality is that the German economy simply did not require this additional labor force. In addition, even the administrative sector remained bloated, with approximately 3.5 million workers in public administration positions that Albert Speer, as armaments minister, tried unsuccessfully to reduce.[^9]

Civilian consumption levels remained remarkably high, with the economy operating under what the Strategic Bombing Survey termed a "guns and butter" philosophy that persisted even after the initial defeats in Russia. Rather than implementing strict rationing and resource allocation, Germany maintained civilian consumption at levels exceeding those of 1929 well into the war years.[^10]

Industrial capacity showed similar patterns of underutilization. With the notable exception of the aero-engine industry, most German armament facilities operated on single shifts throughout the war, despite having the machinery and infrastructure to support multiple shift operations. The USSBS noted that "machine tool and machinery capacity was generally in excess of needs," indicating significant unused productive potential. This inefficiency extended to the allocation of raw materials, particularly steel, which remained "freely available for all current purposes," including civilian construction projects of "doubtful utility."[^11]

Under Walther Funk's Economic Ministry, this pattern of inefficiency was institutionalized. The ministry maintained excess capacity while "satisfying high cost firms" and continuing "production of superfluous civilian goods." The appointment of Albert Speer as Minister for Weapons and Ammunition in 1942 revealed the fundamental tensions in Germany's economic strategy. Initially given limited powers as an "expediter" and coordinator of urgent weapons production, Speer operated within a fragmented system where multiple agencies maintained control over different sectors of the economy.[^12]

Only after the disaster at Stalingrad, when the impossibility of a quick victory became apparent, did Germany attempt comprehensive economic mobilization. In early 1943, Speer received sweeping powers as head of the newly created Ministry for Armament and War Production. However, this belated move toward rationalization faced two insurmountable challenges. First, Germany could no longer afford the time required to expand basic industrial capacity in steel, oil, and coal production—investments that should have been made years earlier. Second, despite the growing crisis, there remained strong resistance to reducing civilian consumption. Local political leaders (gauleiters) continued to oppose cuts to civilian standards even "in the hour of their greatest peril," and industrial reports indicate that civilian orders were still being fulfilled through 1943.[^13]

Despite these constraints, Speer achieved significant increases in armament production—56 percent higher in 1943 than 1942, and more than double 1941 levels. However, these gains demonstrate not Speer's organizational genius but rather the extent of Germany's previously unutilized industrial capacity. The Strategic Bombing Survey noted that this dramatic increase was possible primarily because of "the existence of large untapped capacities in Germany's industrial establishment."The Allied bombing campaign may have actually aided Speer's rationalization efforts, as "the stress of the raids permitted him to mobilize the energies of the population" and overcome bureaucratic resistance to efficiency measures.[^14]

There was a fundamental mismatch between Germany's economic preparation and the war it ultimately had to fight. The economy was structured for a series of quick victories that would enhance German living standards rather than a prolonged conflict requiring total mobilization.[^15] This approach meant that the economy the Allies were bombing had in fact more potential energy than kinetic making it a poor candidate for precision bombing strategies predicated on disrupting highly strained industrial systems.

The strategic bombing campaign faced an inherent challenge in its targeting strategy, as it devoted significant resources to industries with remarkable regenerative capacity. USAAF bombing data reveals that approximately 83% of bombs were directed at targets with significant regenerative or dispersal capacity. Aircraft and military production facilities (24.3% of total tonnage), industrial/city areas (9.8%), and naval installations (2.1%) all demonstrated remarkable resilience through dispersal and reconstruction. In contrast, sectors with limited redundancy or dispersal options — including chemical plants, explosives facilities, utilities, and specialized manufacturing - received only about 17% of the total bombing effort.[^16] While this categorization is somewhat of a generalization, the stark disparity suggests that the majority of bombing resources were directed at targets that could be reconstructed, relocated, or substituted relatively quickly.

The transportation network alone received 38.4% of the total effort, and had some of the most considerable effects. Between August and December, freight car loadings fell by approximately 50%, while coal shipments dropped precipitously from 7.4 million tons to 2.7 million tons. By March 1945, coal shipments could barely meet the railroads' own fuel needs.[^17] As senior German officers like von Rundstedt and von Gersdorf later acknowledged, it was not the overall shortages of materials that proved most devastating, but rather "the constant attrition of these supplies en route from the factories to the front lines."[^18] Yet much of this tonnage had limited impact due to dispersed targeting. As Generalmajor Peters stated to the USSBS, "the bombing of a certain limited area, or a stretch of railway lines from north to south, or east to west, caused much more damage than indiscriminate bombing of marshalling yards and railroad stations throughout the entire German Reich."[^19] This suggests that the same strategic effect could have been achieved with far fewer bombs if properly concentrated. Most notably, he emphasized that bridge attacks were particularly devastating, stating that while damaged marshalling yards could be repaired to maintain at least two to three tracks for traffic, bridge repairs "took months," and severely damaged bridges were often abandoned entirely. Peters concluded that had the Allies "confined themselves to bombing bridges only, throughout Germany, transportation would have come to a complete standstill."[^20] This testimony suggests that even in a case where strategic bombing proved ultimately successful, it was far less efficient in terms of effect per tons dropped than it could have been.

Another example of effectiveness came with the campaign against Germany's synthetic oil plants provides perhaps the most striking example—production of synthetic fuels, which accounted for 90% of aviation gasoline and 30% of motor gasoline, collapsed from 359,000 tons in early 1944 to just 24,000 tons by September. Aviation gasoline output specifically plummeted from 175,000 tons to a mere 5,000 tons during this period. The oil campaign had cascading effects across other vital industries, as these same facilities produced synthetic nitrogen, methanol, and rubber—by late 1944, synthetic nitrogen production had fallen from 75,000 to 20,000 tons monthly, forcing cuts in both agricultural use and explosives manufacturing.[^21]

Still, there were other vulnerable industries could have been effectively targeted but were not. Haywood S. Hansell Jr., a key architect of American air strategy, makes a compelling case in his memoir that targeting Germany's electrical power system could have achieved decisive results before the Normandy invasion. He argues that "the Combined Bomber Offensive could have included the destruction of most of the German powerplants and the disruption of the power distribution system by demolishing the switching stations" and that this, combined with attacks on synthetic petroleum, nitrogen production, and transportation, "would have produced in May or June of 1944 the chaos which characterized the German war industry and the German state in January, February, and March of 1945." The fact that this strategy was not pursued, Hansell suggests, was largely due to political rather than military considerations.[^22]

The presence of officers like Hansell within the USAAF who recognized these strategic shortcomings raises profound questions about why a more efficient approach to precision bombing was not adopted. While some might attribute this to bureaucratic inertia or organizational politics, Fuller's omnistate theory suggests a deeper explanation: the emotional dynamics of warfare in mass societies created pressure toward destruction for its own sake rather than purely instrumental military effectiveness. The remarkable aspect of the American bombing campaign is not that it succumbed to these pressures—as evidenced by the inefficiencies in target selection—but rather that it resisted them to the extent that it did, maintaining a persistent commitment to precision bombing despite the emotional imperatives of omnistate warfare.

Some might argue that such precision targeting was impractical given the operational capabilities of the time. Hansell's analysis challenges this notion. Using the example of the utilities industry, he describes how two combat wings (108 bombers) attacking a power generating station would achieve "virtual assurance of at least 1 hit in the powerhouse, a 96.5 percent probability of knocking it out with 2 hits for several months and 89 percent probability of 3 hits, knocking it out for 6 to 18 months." To target two-thirds of German electrical power would have required approximately 35,000 to 48,000 tons of bombs - "a small portion of the total effort available in March, April, and May of 1944," when U.S. Strategic Air Forces dropped 198,000 tons of bombs, with only 6,080 tons directed at oil targets.[^23]

The testimony of German industrialists further confirms that precision bombing could have been more effective with better target selection. As Hettlage, a German economic official, noted to USSBS interrogators, most German industrialists were "inclined to invest only for the purpose of post-war business" and "opposed the purchase of new machines, especially single purpose machines" for war production.[^23.5] This reluctance to fully convert to war production created vulnerabilities that could have been exploited through more focused precision bombing of critical industrial bottlenecks.

What emerges from this analysis is a picture of precision bombing that was neither as ineffective as its critics claim nor as efficient as it could have been. The persistent American commitment to this approach, despite its imperfections and the emotional pressures of omnistate warfare, represents a remarkable exception to Fuller's prediction that warfare would inevitably trend toward maximum destruction. This tension between the rational, analytical approach of precision bombing and the emotional dynamics of mass warfare helps explain the paradoxical coexistence of precision and area bombing throughout the conflict.

## Conclusion

The strategic bombing campaign presents us with a remarkable paradox. Despite the theoretical predictions of the Realist, Moralist, and Fuller's omnistate frameworks—all of which would anticipate a campaign dominated by area bombing—the empirical evidence reveals a persistent commitment to precision bombing throughout the conflict. This commitment persisted despite significant operational challenges and the availability of more destructive alternatives.

Our analysis reveals that both area and precision bombing could have been significantly more effective. Area bombing, while devastating to civilian populations, failed to achieve its stated economic objectives of reducing labor availability or forcing resource reallocation from military to civilian needs. Precision bombing, while theoretically sound, was often misdirected at targets with significant regenerative capacity rather than critical bottlenecks in the German war economy.

The inefficiencies in both approaches cannot be attributed solely to incompetence. As we have seen, officers like Haywood S. Hansell Jr. advocated for more focused targeting strategies that could have achieved decisive results before the Normandy invasion. Hansell's analysis of the electrical power system as a critical vulnerability suggests that the knowledge for more effective bombing existed within the military establishment. The fact that this knowledge was not fully utilized raises profound questions about the factors driving strategic decision-making.

While elements of area bombing reveal the temptation of total war seeping into military thought—particularly in the transportation sector where incendiaries were used despite their tactical ineffectiveness against rail infrastructure—what stands out most about the American bombing campaign is not its destructiveness but its restraint. In a conflict characterized by unprecedented barbarism on multiple fronts, the persistent American commitment to precision bombing represents a remarkable exception to Fuller's prediction that omnistate warfare would inevitably trend toward maximum destruction.

This exceptional restraint becomes even more striking when we consider that it persisted despite the emotional pressures of total war and the operational challenges of precision bombing. The question of why the United States maintained this approach—resisting both the operational logic of the Realist perspective and the emotional dynamics of omnistate warfare described by Fuller—will be explored in subsequent chapters. What is clear from our analysis is that the strategic bombing campaign was neither a simple story of pragmatic adaptation to operational realities nor a predetermined descent into barbarism, but rather a complex negotiation between military necessity, technological capability, and moral restraint.

[^0.5]: We define precision bombing and area bombing based on tactical implementation rather than stated intent. While the USSBS narrowly defined area raids as those "intentionally directed against a city area by more than 100 bombers with a bomb weight in excess of 100 tons, which destroyed more than 2 percent of the residential buildings in the city," our methodology categorizes any mission using incendiaries—or any mission temporally and spatially associated with incendiary use—as area bombing. This approach captures the operational reality of how supposedly precision targets often became de facto area raids through the combined use of high explosives and incendiaries, a reality the USSBS itself acknowledged when noting that precision raids targeting facilities within cities "had the practical effect of an area raid against that city" even while being recorded as precision attacks [(USSBS Overall Report)](https://bomberdata.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Archive/Reports/BOX_47/FOLDER_2/OVERALL_REPORT/IMG_8271.JPG).

[^1]: This analysis draws from a comprehensive digitization effort of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey's original mission records. The project involved processing 8,134 photographs of original USSBS computer printouts, using Azure Optical Character Recognition and Document Intelligence to extract 31 distinct fields of data per raid. These fields included target identification, mission details, operational parameters, and detailed bomb loads. The extracted data underwent multiple stages of validation and correction, combining deterministic rules based on known bomb specifications with context-aware large language models to ensure accuracy. A final manual review process helped identify and remove summation rows that could have led to double-counting of mission data. The resulting dataset contains over 54,608 individual bombing missions. The complete dataset, along with all code used in its creation, has been made publicly available to enable further research and analysis (you may find the complete the complete dataset [here](https://github.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing/blob/master/attack_data/combined_attack_data_bombing_type.csv), the github repository [here](https://github.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing) and the index of primary and secondary sources [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing/refs/heads/master/s3_bucket_index.md).

[^2]: Our classification system identifies area bombing through the presence of incendiary munitions. This approach is justified by the fundamental difference in destructive capacity between high explosive and incendiary weapons. As documented in the USSBS Physical Damage Report, high explosive bombs primarily damaged structures through blast effects and falling debris, with fires being a relatively rare secondary effect. Their lethality stemmed mainly from fragmentation, which required either direct exposure or insufficient structural protection. In contrast, incendiary attacks could create widespread firestorms with massive civilian casualties, as evidenced at Hamburg where "the great fire attacks burned in excess of 12 square miles – 4½ square miles in a single night – and 100,000 persons perished in the fire area" [(USSBS Physical Damage Report)](https://bomberdata.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Archive/Reports/BOX_75/FOLDER_134b/PHYSICAL_DAMAGE/IMG_10499.JPG). While both types of bombing could target civilian areas, only incendiary-based attacks achieved the kind of indiscriminate mass destruction that truly distinguishes area bombing as a fundamentally different form of aerial warfare. For a detailed breakdown of the classification methodology, see [categorize_bombing.py](https://github.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing/blob/master/attack_data/categorize_bombing.py).

[^2.25]: The one notable exception to this stability was the transportation sector, where we observed a substantial increase in area bombing from late 1943 onwards (see Figure 1.2). This trend is particularly striking given the tactical ineffectiveness of incendiaries against rail infrastructure. The USSBS Transportation Division Report clearly indicated that "systematic line cuts (preferably bridges, underpasses, and viaducts)" and "throats of yards and other choke points" were the most effective methods of disrupting rail transport [(USSBS Transportation Report)](https://bomberdata.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Archive/Reports/BOX_59/FOLDER_64a/LOGISTICS/IMG_9689.JPG). Even when incendiaries successfully destroyed freight station structures at "Köln Gereon Yard, Essen central freight station, and Munster," their "very heavy concrete platforms... were still sufficient for the volume of traffic which continued to move" [(USSBS Transportation Report)](https://bomberdata.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Archive/Reports/BOX_59/FOLDER_64a/LOGISTICS/IMG_9690.JPG). Several scholars have noted this pattern: Lucien Mott highlights the targeting of civilian populations under the guise of military objectives [(Lucien Mott 2019)](https://bomberdata.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Readings/corpora/lucien_pinpoint/chunks/lucien_pinpoint_0036.txt), while Robert Anthony Pape discusses how transportation targets often served as nominal military objectives for broader civilian targeting [(Pape 1960)](https://bomberdata.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Readings/corpora_cited/pape_coercion/chunks/pape_coercion_0177.txt).
