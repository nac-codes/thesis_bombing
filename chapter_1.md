# Chapter 1: A New Approach to Strategic Bombing Data

The historiography of strategic bombing in World War II, as demonstrated in the literature review, has largely relied on aggregate statistics to support broader arguments about the nature and evolution of the bombing campaign. Scholars frequently cite total tonnage dropped, overall accuracy rates, and casualty figures to support their positions. However, these aggregated statistics, while valuable for broad analysis, obscure the granular reality of how the strategic bombing campaign actually evolved over time. This thesis attempts to bridge this gap by creating and analyzing the most comprehensive raid-by-raid dataset of the European theater to date, based on the original computer tabulations of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS).

The USSBS represents a unique moment in military history—the first large-scale attempt to use mechanical computation to analyze warfare. Using what was likely an IBM 405 Alphabetical Accounting Machine, the USSBS Tabulating Service processed detailed data for every recorded bombing mission "FROM THE FIRST ATTACK TO 'V-E' DAY," as stated on the cover of each folder[^1]. These original computer printouts, stored at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland, contain unprecedented detail about each raid, including target location, air force and squadron identification, number of aircraft, bombing altitude, visibility conditions, and precise bomb loads broken down by type and fuzing.

While summary statistics from the USSBS and other sources like the USAAF Office of Statistical Control (OSC), British Air Ministry, and British Bombing Survey Unit have been widely available—showing aggregate tons dropped by year, month, air force, or bomb type—the more granular, raid-level data has remained largely inaccessible and unanalyzed. This is not surprising given the era's technological limitations. The period of interest was one of bureaucratic paper, where even simple summations required significant computational effort. The resulting tendency toward aggregation and averaging, while practical, has left significant gaps in our understanding of how the strategic bombing campaign evolved at the tactical and operational levels.

This thesis seeks to fill these gaps through the creation and analysis of a comprehensive digital database derived from 8,134 photographs of original USSBS computer printouts. Each photograph was processed to extract 31 distinct fields of data per raid, including:

- Target identification (location, name, coordinates, and code)
- Mission details (date, time, air force, and squadron)
- Operational parameters (number of aircraft, altitude, sighting method, visibility, target priority)
- Detailed bomb loads (numbers, sizes, and tonnages of high explosive, incendiary, and fragmentation munitions)
