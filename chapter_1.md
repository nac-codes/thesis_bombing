## A New Approach to Strategic Bombing Data

The historiography of strategic bombing in World War II has largely relied on aggregate statistics to support broader arguments about the nature and evolution of the bombing campaign. Scholars frequently cite total tonnage dropped, overall accuracy rates, and casualty figures to support their positions[^1]. Most of these statistics come from the first few pages of either the Summary Report or Overall Report of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) (e.g. [Overall Report](ussbs_reports/OVERALL_REPORT/IMG_8235.JPG) and [Summary Report](ussbs_reports/SUMMARY_REPORT/IMG_8218.JPG)), displaying a relative lack of depth in previous historical analysis. While these statistics are valuable for broad analysis, they obscure the distributed nature of how the strategic bombing campaign was conducted. This thesis attempts to bridge this gap by creating and analyzing the most comprehensive raid-by-raid dataset of the European theater to date, based on the original computer tabulations of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS).

The United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) was established by Secretary of War Henry Stimson in November 1944, following a directive from President Roosevelt. Led by civilian chairman Franklin D'Olier, the survey brought together over 1,000 civilian and military personnel with the ambitious goal of conducting an impartial and expert study of the effects of aerial attacks on Germany. While officially independent, the survey was closely tied to Army Air Forces leadership who hoped to use its findings to advocate for an independent air force [Delori](/corpora/delori_memory/chunks/delori_memory_0004.txt).

Using what was likely an IBM 405 Alphabetical Accounting Machine, the USSBS Tabulating Service processed detailed data for every recorded bombing mission "FROM THE FIRST ATTACK TO 'V-E' DAY"[^2]. These original computer printouts, stored at the [National Archives in College Park, Maryland](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/561292), contain detailed information about each raid, including target location, air force and squadron identification, number of aircraft, bombing altitude, visibility conditions, and precise bomb loads broken down by type and fuzing.

The Allied strategic bombing campaign represented a form of warfare that was unprecedented in its diffusion across time and space. While some narratives attempt to pigeonhole strategic bombing within traditional pitched battle abstractions like "Battle of the Ruhr" or "Big Week", strategic bombing was in fact continuous and diffuse in nature. It was recorded mission-by-mission, not battle-by-battle. Thus historians must move away from the Thucydidean tradition of historicizing warfare in terms of grand battle narratives, and instead analyze warfare computationally, holistically, and granularly. This thesis attempts to take a step in this direction.

While summary statistics from the USSBS and other sources like the USAAF Office of Statistical Control (OSC), British Air Ministry, and British Bombing Survey Unit have been widely available—showing aggregate tons dropped by year, month, air force, or bomb type—the more granular, raid-level data has remained largely inaccessible and unanalyzed. Historically, this is not surprising given the era's technological limitations. The WWII era was one of bureaucratic paper and tyrannizing statistics, where even simple summations could only be performed by those with access to the resources, data, and computational power of the state apparatus. Today, given that an individual with a laptop and an internet connection has the power to perform more computational work than the entire US Government did in 1944, it is unacceptable that historians continue to rely on the authority of more than eighty-year-old state-generated statistics and summarization.

In that spirit, this thesis will open-source all necessary data and code to enable further analysis of the strategic bombing campaign. Along with a fully digitized collection of the summary reports of the USSBS, this includes the creation and analysis of a comprehensive digital database derived from 8,134 photographs of original USSBS computer printouts. Each photograph was processed using Azure Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Document Intelligence to extract 31 distinct fields of data per raid, including target identification (location, name, coordinates, and code), mission details (date, time, air force, and squadron), operational parameters (number of aircraft, altitude, sighting method, visibility, target priority), and detailed bomb loads (numbers, sizes, and tonnages of high explosive, incendiary, and fragmentation munitions).

The extracted data underwent multiple stages of validation and correction, combining deterministic rules based on known bomb specifications with context-aware large language models to ensure accuracy. A final manual review process helped identify and remove summation rows that could have led to double-counting of mission data. The resulting dataset contains over 54,608 individual bombing missions. [The complete dataset](attack_data/combined_attack_data_checked.csv), along with all code used in its creation, has been made publicly available to enable further research and analysis. A detailed description of the methodology, including specific validation rules and data processing steps, may be found here: [methodology_attack_data.md](methodology_attack_data.md).

Our analysis of World War II strategic bombing data reveals strong alignment with historical records for United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) operations while highlighting significant gaps in Royal Air Force (RAF) records. The dataset's totals for the Eighth Air Force (681,076 tons) and Fifteenth Air Force (284,482 tons) closely match the figures reported by both the Office of Statistical Control (692,918 and 312,173 tons respectively) and the United States Strategic Bombing Survey Tabulating Service. This consistency validates our dataset as a reliable foundation for analyzing USAAF strategic bombing operations. However, our RAF Bomber Command total of 669,623 tons falls significantly short of the Air Ministry's reported 1,066,141 tons, with the majority of missing data concentrated in industrial target categories—primarily city areas. While this discrepancy requires careful consideration when drawing conclusions about RAF operations, the dataset still provides valuable insights into bombing patterns and strategic priorities. The temporal and categorical distribution of raids, choice of munitions, and evolution of targeting strategies can be analyzed with confidence for USAAF operations, while RAF trends can be studied with appropriate caveats regarding the underrepresentation of industrial targeting. For a comprehensive breakdown of the data, including detailed charts, tables, and temporal analyses, see the [full results documentation](results_attack_data.md).

While it is the hope of this researcher that the compiled dataset may prove useful for future historians for a variety of forms of historical analysis, in this thesis our focus lies in observing whether the oft-noted strategic shift from precision to area bombing actually occurred, especially in the context of the USAAF. This will be explored in the next section.

## Evaluating the Strategic Shift from Precision to Area Bombing

We are interested mostly in understanding the relationship between the tons of bombs that were dropped that may be categorized under the a strategy of precision bombing and those that may be categorized under a strategy of area bombing. To begin we will use the proxy of tons of high explosive bombs dropped vs the tons of incendiary bombs dropped[^3].

[^1]: Examples include: [Davis 1993](/corpora/davis_spaatz/chunks/davis_spaatz_0854.txt) analyzes the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces, citing 1,005,729 tons of bombs dropped (with 28% on marshaling yards, 13% on oil targets), along with RAF Bomber Command's additional 1,047,412 tons. [Webster and Frankland 1961](/corpora/butler_v3/chunks/butler_v3_0298.txt) focus on aggregate statistics in their analysis of the final Battle of the Ruhr (October-December 1944), citing "14,254 sorties... 60,830 tons of bombs... and only 136 bombers failed to return". [Knell 2003](/corpora/knell_city/chunks/knell_city_0293.txt) likewise emphasizes total tonnage, noting that "well over 1 million tons of bombs rained down on Europe in 1944". Most of these statistics come from either the Summary Report or Overall Report of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (e.g. [Overall Report](ussbs_reports/OVERALL_REPORT/IMG_8235.JPG) and [Summary Report](ussbs_reports/SUMMARY_REPORT/IMG_8218.JPG)). Note that these statistics are from the first few pages of the USSBS reports, displaying a relative lack of depth in historical analysis.
