# Conclusion

What is interesting about this thesis is not what it has found, but what it did not find. We began with a theory tracing the evolution of modern warfare from the French Revolution, anticipating a trajectory toward total barbarism, complete dehumanization of the enemy, and unrestrained destruction.

Indeed, with certain belligerents in the Second World War, this grim prediction was fully realized. Some argue vehemently that the United States was no exception to this rule.

Yet, the empirical data tells a different story—a story of American exceptionalism. If the United States had truly succumbed to the bloodthirsty impulses predicted by Fuller's omnistate theory, the bombing data would reflect a starkly different reality. We would see a pronounced shift toward indiscriminate area bombing, escalating dramatically as the war progressed.

But the numbers are clear: precision bombing overwhelmingly dominated the American campaign both in reality and rhetoric. This empirical data challenges conventional narratives and compels us to reconsider our assumptions about the nature of American warfare.

Thus, the critical question emerges: what is it about the United States—not merely its institutions and structures, but its people, its culture, its very mores—that fostered this proclivity for precision? What inspired this almost romantic vision of warfare, a vision where conflict could be waged with surgical precision, minimizing bloodshed and human suffering? This was warfare reimagined as an intelligent endeavor, marked by efficiency, strategic clarity, and moral restraint rather than barbaric excess.

As we transition from the modern era into the information age, it becomes imperative to revisit and deeply understand these uniquely American impulses. We must identify precisely what differentiated America in the modern era and consciously amplify those qualities today. For as humanity's destructive capabilities have exponentially grown, so too has our capacity—through advanced computation and precision technologies—to wage war in a manner that is intelligent, targeted, and humane.

We must therefore ask ourselves: what truly makes America exceptional? Was it our capacity to wage industrial-scale warfare, unleashing destruction on an unprecedented scale? Or was it our commitment to waging war intelligently, with restraint and precision? Was it our zealous crusade to impose democracy through force, or was it our resistance to the seductive allure of total war, in our collective insistence on ethical constraints and strategic clarity?

These are the questions this thesis raises. They are questions not merely of historical curiosity but of urgent contemporary relevance. As we stand at the threshold of a new era, armed with unprecedented technological power, we must consciously choose the path forward. Will we succumb to the darker impulses of omnistate warfare, or will we embrace a more intelligent and humane approach to warfare?
