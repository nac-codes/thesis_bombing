The main utility of applying this theory Is that it takes a sledgehammer to the whole idea purported by Garrett and others []
This evolution is often presented as inevitable—the natural result of total war's brutal logic. As Garrett (1993) argues, this shift reflected "the tendency in war, and particularly in total war, of military operations escalating to the use of all conceivable means."
] that total war is somehow an inevitable outcome of industrialization, meaning technological development or just the means that were available at the time. And the sort of realist idea that this bombing in some ways had to be done. Blaming this sort of outcome on technological progress and industry is not only wrong, but it's extraordinarily dangerous because it blames these horrific outcomes on a dynamic in our culture and society that is generally extremely beneficial to all. 


While remaining ignorant of the true dynamics of our society, like those uncovered by Fuller, that lead to this dehumanization this villainization of the enemy...




When warfare becomes an expression of the general will, it inevitably tends toward totality—not because of military necessity or strategic calculation, but because of mass democracy's fusion of popular sovereignty with tribal psychology creates forms of warfare that pursue absolute victory through absolute destruction.

As we confront new forms of conflict in the information age, the challenge is not merely technical but fundamental: how to channel democracy's martial energies without succumbing to the temptation of righteous warfare. Only by recognizing these deeply rooted democratic tendencies toward total war can we hope to channel our society's martial energies toward more limited and intelligent applications of force.
