planners and leaders. This relationship and constant collaboration pro- duced a common understanding of why the EOU selected specific targets and how those targets supported political objectives.  Chapter 5 demonstrates the interaction between the EOU and the USAAF leadership through the review of three case studies. First, the paper examines the selection of targets following the Casablanca Conference, particularly targets selected in support of Operation POINTBLANK. A quick reflection on the methodology used by the EOU to select targets precedes a close examination of the interaction and collaboration that occurred between the EOU  and air force leaders. The paper highlights how this cooperation and integration produced a check and balance system to align aerial bombardment targets with political and military objectives. The second case study explores the Oil Plan recommended by the EOU. An in-depth review of the priorities identified by the EOU, and how these priorities aligned with strategic guidance follows. The third case study investigates the targets selected and the prioritization of targets in preparation for Operation OVERLORD. The paper emphasizes the EOUâ€™s effects-based approach and specifies how this ap- proach produced a solution that garnered the backing of senior USAAF leaders.  The final chapter summarizes the findings of the monograph. The paper reviews the operations research techniques and effects-based methodology employed by the EOU before highlighting the importance of integration and cooperation between the EOU and USAAF leaders and planning staffs during WWII. This partnership ensured targets selected by the EOU for aerial bombardment sup- ported political and military objectives.
