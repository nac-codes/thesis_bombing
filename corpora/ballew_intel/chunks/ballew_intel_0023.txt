, the aiming point reports needed to answer “importance of plant within industry, function of buildings, vulnerability of processes, probable rate of recovery after successful attack, and the sections of the target which should constitute the proper objective of attack.”“4*! Thus, the aiming point reports sought to demonstrate those targets whose destruction would have the greatest and most lasting effects on output. 2%  In order to develop the aiming-point reports, EOU members had to become experts on German plants and installations in order to identify critical vulnerabilities. The EOU lacked an internal intelligence capability so they relied on outside agencies for intelligence support. Thus, in addition to learning to look at industry as a target system, the aiming point reports drove EOU members to forge relationships with outside organizations. Since the United States lacked a robust intelligence capability, the EOU relied heavily on British intelligence, particularly, the Ministry of Economic War- fare (MEW).2221  While the EOU gladly accepted intelligence data from the MEW, it did not use any of the findings from the MEW’s Enemy Branch target selection study.@2! The MEW Enemy Branch held the same role for the Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command as the EOU performed for the USAAF. In 1940, the MEW Enemy Branch conducted a target selection study that resulted in RAF Bomber Command targeting German petroleum.23! However, the intelligence community lacked precise information on Germany’s oil infrastructure and the assessment overestimated the ability of the RAF bombers to strike German petroleum targets.24! This produced a negative opinion of targeting by economic analysis in London. To prevent being cast in the same light as the MEW Enemy Branch, the EOU only used intelligence data provided by the MEW, electing to work independently during target analysis.
