Colonel Hughes and the Eighth Air Force specifically did not provide detailed guidance to the team on which industries they should focus their efforts. They wanted the full range of German industry open to this analysis.2%  The EOU conducted detailed analysis of each industry in order to develop the thorough understanding required to populate the aiming point reports. According to the EOU’s War Diary, the aiming point reports needed to answer “importance of plant within industry, function of buildings, vulnerability of processes, probable rate of recovery after successful attack, and the sections of the target which should constitute the proper objective of attack.” Thus, the aiming point reports sought to demonstrate those targets whose destruction would have the greatest and most lasting effects on output. 2  In order to develop the aiming-point reports, EOU members had to become experts on German plants and installations in order to identify critical vulnerabilities. The EOU lacked an internal intelligence capability so they relied on outside agencies for intelligence support. Thus, in addition to learning to look at industry as a target system, the aiming point reports drove EOU members to forge relationships with outside organizations. Since the United States lacked a robust intelligence capability,
