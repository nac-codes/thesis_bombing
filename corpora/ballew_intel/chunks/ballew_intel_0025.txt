g to look at industry as a target system, the aiming point reports drove EOU members to forge relationships with outside organizations. Since the United States lacked a robust intelligence capability, the EOU relied heavily on British intelligence, particularly, the Ministry of Economic War- fare (MEW).21) IS  While the EOU gladly accepted intelligence data from the MEW, it did not use any of the findings from the MEW’s Enemy Branch target selection study.22! The MEW Enemy Branch held the same role for the Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command as the EOU performed for the USAAF. In 1940, the MEW Enemy Branch conducted a target selection study that resulted in RAF Bomber Command targeting German petroleum.22! However, the intelligence community lacked precise information on Germany’s oil infrastructure and the assessment overestimated the ability of the RAF bombers to strike German petroleum targets.24 This produced a negative opinion of targeting by economic analysis in London. To prevent being cast in the same light as the MEW Enemy Branch, the EOU only used intelligence data provided by the MEW, electing to work independently during target analysis.  The intelligence the EOU collected came from ground reports, prisoners of war interrogations, and photographic interpretation.23 While this information provided the economists key insights into German industrial capabilities, it did not provide the comprehensive understanding needed to complete the aiming point reports. To supplement the collected intelligence information, the EOU members travelled to similar plants in Britain.2 These visits provided a more thorough understanding of the plant in question and provided key insights into how each plant figured into Germany’s industrial system.  The EOU members spent their first few months working solely on producing aiming point reports and continued to generate them during the course of the war. By May 1944, the EOU produced 285 aiming point reports.2” The Eighth Air For
