January 14, 1943, the two parties agreed on a combined approach to keep the pressure on Germany.“! The Casablanca Directive endorsed a “sustained and unremitting air offensive, calling for a Combined Bomber Offensive.”!5} The USAAF and their doctrine of high-altitude, precision bombing struck targets by day while the RAF used area bombing to strike targets at night. It was under this pretense, that the EOU selected targets for the USAAF, particularly for the Eighth Air Force and Fifteenth Air Force.  OPERATIONS RESEARCH, EFFECTS-BASED OPERATIONS AND THE EOU  While producing the aiming point reports, EOU members also developed a sound understanding of USAAF doctrine. This understanding of USAAF doctrine coupled with the experience gleaned from producing aiming point reports provided the EOU members the foundation needed to develop a theory on and methodology for target selection. Nevertheless, before addressing EOU method- ology, this paper explores two significant areas of study that shaped operations during the war and figured prominently into the processes used by the EOU. First, the monograph examines the role of operations research before addressing the significance behind the concept of Effects-Based Operations (EBO) and its impact on planning in World War II.  Operations Research in World War IT  Operations Research is the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions.“ The use of these principles in the military realm first arose during the First World War, but was not fully adopted by militaries and incorporated into military organizations until the Second World War For the purpose of military operations, operations research analysts used scientific and mathematical methods to help make military operations more efficient and effective.47! Although the influence of operations research spanned all facets of the military during the war, it significantly influenced the application of airpower at all levels of war. Both the RAF and USA
