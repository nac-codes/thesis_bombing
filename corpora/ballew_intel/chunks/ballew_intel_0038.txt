of flak and approach the targets straight and level in their group formations. Through their analysis, the Oper- ations Research Section proved this approach was more effective and greatly improved bombing accuracy.  Not only did this method improve accuracy, but it also minimized loss rates of aircraft and aircrew. Operations research analysts discovered that evasive maneuvers did not improve the bombers chance of avoiding flak while it increased the chance of mid-air collision. Further, maintaining a tight formation improved the formations’ defensive capability since it provided overlapping fields of fire. Overall, these tight formations improved the aircrews’ chance of survival and decreased the number of times aircrews had to restrike targets. While the tight formations provided many positives, they also increased the risk of fratricide.  In their search to find ways to minimize losses, the Losses and Battle Damage Subsection discovered that the waist gunners were shooting up their own aircraft and identified the vulnerability  Page 10 of 52 19%  preserve the force, the RAF transitioned to a philosophy of night-time area bombing of cities hoping to undermine the German workforce’s productivity and morale.*#! This change in philosophy set the stage for the establishment of the Combined Bomber Offensive after the United States entered the war.  While the RAF had switched to night-time area bombing against cities, the USAAF remained steadfastly committed to high-altitude, daylight, precision bombing. When President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill met in Casablanca on January 14, 1943, the two parties agreed on a combined approach to keep the pressure on Germany.*! The Casablanca Directive endorsed a “sustained and unremitting air offensive, calling for a Combined Bomber Offensive.”!45! The USAAF and their doctrine of high-altitude, precision bombing struck targets by day while the RAF used area bombing to strike targets at night. It was under this pretense,
