this approach was more effective and greatly improved bombing accuracy.  Not only did this method improve accuracy, but it also minimized loss rates of aircraft and aircrew. Operations research analysts discovered that evasive maneuvers did not iProve the bombers chance of avoiding flak while it increased the chance of mid-air collision. Further, maintaining a tight formation improved the formations’ defensive capability since it provided overlapping fields of fire. Overall, these tight formations improved the aircrews’ chance of survival and decreased the number of times aircrews had to restrike targets. While the tight formations provided many positives, they also increased the risk of fratricide.  In their search to find ways to minimize losses, the Losses and Battle Damage Subsection discovered that the waist gunners were shooting up their own aircraft and identified the vulnerability of the hydraulic and electrical systems in the B-17 and B-24.2! Another major finding from the analysis was that the aircraft engines were extremely susceptible to catching fire from enemy anti- aircraft artillery. To improve the survivability of the aircraft, the analysts recommended modifications to the aircraft such as additional armor around the engines.&3! The USAAF concurred with the recommendations and incorporated the changes in the aircraft production facilities. These few examples provide a solid illustration of the tactical impact the Operations Research Section had on Eighth Air Force bombing operations.  In addition to affecting operations at the tactical level, operations research also impacted operational and strategic planning. General “Hap” Arnold, commanding general of the USAAF, established the Committee of Operations Analysts (COA) to examine which targets would erode German strength sufficiently to allow for an Allied invasion. While military planners knew how to destroy targets, they needed help from operations research analysts to know which targets to hit.
