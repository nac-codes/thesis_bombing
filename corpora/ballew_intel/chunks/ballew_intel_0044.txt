ode German strength sufficiently to allow for an Allied invasion. While military planners knew how to destroy targets, they needed help from operations research analysts to know which targets to hit. Without all the data available at the tactical level and without a complete understanding of the German economy, analysts addressed this problem at a higher level of abstraction.* As opposed to the EOU, which searched for industrial targets that would grind Germany’s war making capacity to a halt, the COA focused on targeting munitions plants and war materials to limit Germany’s ability to defeat an allied invasion.& Consequently, although their objectives were different, both the COA and EOU incorporated operations research in their target selection methodologies.  Effects-Based Operations in World War IT  EBO did not officially enter US military lexicon until the Persian Gulf War in 1991, but its origins go back to the Second World War 7! EBO, as defined in US Air Force doctrine, are “operations that are planned, executed, assessed, and adapted to influence or change systems or capabilities in order to achieve desired outcomes.”{8! Simplified, EBO focus on the results, desired outcomes, achieved through action, not on the means, or platforms, weapons, and methods.& Thus, from an airpower perspective, EBO provide a methodology for determining which targets produce the greatest effects in line with military and political means.  During World War II, airpower strategists attempted to prioritize targets based on the expected impact destroying a target would have on the German war economy. However, since the USAAF lacked in-depth intelligence on all German industries, the planners had to avoid falling into the trap of the ‘blueprint availability syndrome.’ With this ‘syndrome,’ planners overemphasize the importance of targets on which they have information at the expense of targets where information is lacking {© To help overcome this pitfall, air planners placed great emp
