To improve the survivability of the aircraft, the analysts recommended modifications to the aircraft such as additional armor around the engines.”* The USAAF concurred with the recommendations and incorporated the changes in the aircraft production facilities. These few examples provide a solid illustration of the tactical impact the Operations Research Section had on Eighth Air Force bombing operations.  In addition to affecting operations at the tactical level, operations research also impacted operational and strategic planning. General “Hap” Arnold, commanding general of the USAAF, established the Committee of Operations Analysts (COA) to examine which targets would erode German strength sufficiently to allow for an Allied invasion.&! While military planners knew how to destroy targets, they needed help from operations research analysts to know which targets to hit. Without all the data available at the tactical level and without a complete understanding of the German economy, analysts addressed this problem at a higher level of abstraction.* As opposed to the EOU, which searched for industrial targets that would grind Germany’s war making capacity to a halt, the COA focused on targeting munitions plants and war materials to limit Germany’s ability to defeat an allied invasion.& Consequently, although their objectives were different, both the COA and EOU incorporated operations research in their target selection methodologies.
