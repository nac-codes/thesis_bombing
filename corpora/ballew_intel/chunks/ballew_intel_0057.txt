seventh factors addressed the amount of redundancy, or ‘cushion’ as the EOU coined it, in a particular German industry. If the Germans could repair the industry quickly or another plant could quickly make up for the loss, then it was not as attractive a target. Factors eight through ten addressed the ease of striking the target. Would the USAAF be able to find the target and if found and struck, would the attack significantly damage the plant? The last factor addressed the risk associated with pursuing a particular target. This essentially became a cost-benefit analysis of whether strik- ing a certain target was worth the risk to aircrews. A thorough understanding of each of these factors provided the source of comparison between target systems.  To compare the different industries the EOU members assigned a score (e.g. anumber from 0 to 10) to each of the factors.{5! However, the EOU recognized that target selection was more complicated than a simple mathematical equation. They understood the inherent flaw of arbitrarily assigning numbers to each of the factors and knew senior leaders would not select targets based on the scores. Further, it was not a simple additive process. The targets had to satisfy three simple tests to be considered:  1. You must be able to reach it and drop bombs on it. 2. You must be able to damage it when you do hit it. 3. You must be able to impair the war effort, directly or indirectly, when you damage it.  Therefore, even if a target received high scores for two of the tests, if it could not satisfy one of the tests, then the EOU removed that target from consideration.!# In general, while recognizing the limitation of quantifying each targets’ potential, the scores provided a source of discussion and a means to compare various targets and target systems.  The EOU members not only needed to be experts on each target within a target system, they also needed to understand the interrelationships within an industry. Only with a broad underst
