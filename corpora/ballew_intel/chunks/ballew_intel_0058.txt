arget systems.  The EOU members not only needed to be experts on each target within a target system, they also needed to understand the interrelationships within an industry. Only with a broad understanding of these interrelationships could the EOU grasp the effect bombing a particular industry would produce.! This boiled down to being able to answer four questions:  1. How large an attack’s effect would be within its own sector of the economy or military system? 2. How quickly would the effect be felt in frontline strength? 3. How long the effect would last?

Strength of defenses at target and en route.‘7t  With respect to the second factor, specialization of use pattern, the EOU worked under the assumption that it is better to target those industries where the output goes into essential uses vice a wide variety of uses.!2! For the fourth factor of importance of indirect effect, the EOU favored those industries that, if targeted, would produce widespread effects rather than a single isolated effect.) The sixth and seventh factors addressed the amount of redundancy, or ‘cushion’ as the EOU coined it, in a particular German industry. If the Germans could repair the industry quickly or another plant could quickly make up for the loss, then it was not as attractive a target. Factors eight through ten addressed the ease of striking the target. Would the USAAF be able to find the target and if found and struck, would the attack significantly damage the plant? The last factor addressed the risk associated with pursuing a particular target. This essentially became a cost-benefit analysis of whether strik- ing a certain target was worth the risk to aircrews.
