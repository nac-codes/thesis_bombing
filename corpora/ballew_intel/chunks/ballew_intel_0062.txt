ing point reports and the analysis that went into the assessment of various German industries provided the EOU a solid understanding of the German industrial base. Additionally, the team knew and supported the USAAF doctrine of daylight, precision bombing. The EOUs knowledge of USAAF doctrine coupled with their experience gathered generating aiming point reports laid the foundation for developing a methodology to select and prioritize targets.
