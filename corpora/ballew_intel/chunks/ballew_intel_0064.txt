saw this as a great opportunity for like organizations to share and test their ideas. The EOU members and their channels of communication reached out all over London.® In fact, there was no Allied ‘air war discourse’ in which the EOU was not a participant. This interaction with other organizations coupled with the professional aiming point reports thev produced gave the EOU a good reputation. US air and ground leaders requested the presence of EOU members on their  Page 22 of 52 39%  Answering these questions demanded rigorous intellectual work. As Walt Rostow recounted from his time in the EOU, “It required taking fully into account the extent to which the military effect of an attack could be cushioned by the Germans by diverting civilian output or services to military purposes or buying time for repair by drawing down stocks of finished products in the pipeline.”&% The team had to anticipate Germany’s response, appreciating that they were facing an adaptive enemy with a robust industrial complex.  Overall, the EOU’s methodology to select targets for aerial bombardment was time intensive but thorough. This approach allowed the EOU to assign a value to each target and the various target systems. While these numerical values provided the basis for comparison and facilitated discussion on the merits of one industry vice another, EOU members knew the final decision on which targets to attack and in what prioritized order had to be made based on judgment {#1  The production of the aiming point reports and the analysis that went into the assessment of various German industries provided the EOU a solid understanding of the German industrial base. Additionally, the team knew and supported the USAAF doctrine of daylight, precision bombing. The EOUs knowledge of USAAF doctrine coupled with their experience gathered generating aiming point reports laid the foundation for developing a methodology to select and prioritize targets. Although EOU members were economists, they di
