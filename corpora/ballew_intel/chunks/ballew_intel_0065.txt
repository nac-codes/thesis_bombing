coupled with their experience gathered generating aiming point reports laid the foundation for developing a methodology to select and prioritize targets. Although EOU members were economists, they did not seek targets for economic or political purposes. Rather, they targeted industries that satisfied explicitly defined military aims.®2! In sum, the EOU’s methodology was “a doctrine of warfare, not of economics or politics.”  NS  ENSURING TARGETS ALIGN WITH MILITARY AND POLITICAL AIMS  The EOU’s target selection methodology was an intellectual process that required intelligence on enemy targets, an understanding of USAAF bombing capabilities, and a sense of military and political aims.!@4t The EOU did not develop this methodology solely in the confines of their office. This doctrine of warfare emerged from the interplay between the EOU, Colonel Hughes, and USAAF planners and leaders.®5! The EOU understood the importance of personal and professional relationships and thus, sought to build relationship with all US and British organizations involved in the Al- lied bombing campaign. Consequently, to ensure selected targets aligned with military and political aims, the EOU regularly collaborated with the air planning staffs and top USAAF leaders.  Integration with Air Planning Staffs  General Donovan, of the OSS, established the EOU out of necessity. The Eighth Air Force did not have the internal capacity to analyze Axis target information and select German targets for aerial bombardment. Therefore, the EOU’s main purpose stood to assist US Strategic Air Forces with target selection. While the primary mission was to support the Allied bombing campaign, the unit was formally assigned to the US Embassy in London. This afforded the EOU the opportunity to develop independently their doctrine for target selection.£7! However, without military backgrounds it was important for EOU members to collaborate regularly with military officers to get a better understanding of their mi
