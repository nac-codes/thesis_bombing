directives and evaluated targets against those directives.24  Moreover, many times Colonel Hughes had the EOU members present their findings directly to USAAF leadership. EOU members felt very comfortable in those settings to speak their mind and offer suggestions on the best way to carry out aerial bombardment against Germany.Â®! Through these interactions, EOU members developed professional relationships with many USAAF leaders, to in- clude General Carl Spaatz and General Fred Anderson.  General Spaatz began the war as the Eighth Air Force commander. It was during this initial assignment that General Spaatz became familiar with the EOU. In effect, the EOU became the de facto target planning staff for the Eighth Air Force.!2% When the Eighth Air Force started bombing EOU recommended targets, the EOU felt a great sense of satisfaction and pride in their work and it proved that their proposed targets aligned with military objectives. When General Spaatz returned from North Africa to take command of US Strategic Air Forces, he and his deputy, General Fred Ander- son, again relied on the expertise of the EOU to assist with target selection. The EOU was an acknowledged part of the team that shaped policy for the heavy bombers in Europe!)  Overall, to ensure targets selected met established guidance, the EOU first studied existing directives. Nonetheless, it was the constant collaboration and integration of the EOU with military leaders and planners that ensured selected targets supported military and political objectives. While discussed in general terms in this chapter, the following chapter provides three detailed examples during the war where the cooperation between the EOU and USAAF leaders and planners ensured EOU targets supported military and political aims.
