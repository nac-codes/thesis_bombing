top priority, ball bearings received a secondary priority since they played a large role in aircraft production. “12 The wording in the POINTBLANK Directive highlighted the importance of aggressively pursuing German fighter aircraft: “Ifthe growth of the German fighter strength is not arrested quickly, it may become literally impossible to carry out the destruction planned and thus to create the conditions necessary for the  ultimate decisive action by our combined forces on the continent...”22  The POINTBLANK Directive was critical since German single-engine fighter production had risen from 381 aircraft in January 1943, to 1,050 in July 1943.24 At this rate, the Allies’ plan of conducting a cross channel landing in 1944 would be in jeopardy. The increased focus on the German aircraft industry began paying dividends by the end of the year as German aircraft production in December 1943 fell to 560.{122  On the whole, the incorporation of the EOU’s proposed targets into the POINTBLANK Directive represented a major success for the EOU. By producing this directive, Allied leadership bought off on the EOU’s targeting philosophy that a high degree of destruction in a few essential industries produced a greater effect than a small degree of destruction in many industries.422! Most importantly, it validated that the targets proposed were valid objectives, and that they aligned with military and political aims. The POINTBLANK Directive established the relation between the EOU’s target recom- mendations and the war strategy as a whole.

With the continuous influx of bombers, the strategic bombing campaign began gaining momentum toward the close of 1943 and the USAAF in Europe had reached its full strength and capabilities in February 1944.24! with t
