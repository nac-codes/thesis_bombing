e logical next step.  Not only did oil affect all German war production, but it also limited the fighting capacity of German air, ground, and sea forces.424 In the EOU’s view, destruction of oil refineries and storage facilities would bring the entire German war machine toa halt. With an overwhelming number of bomber aircraft available, the Allies could systematically attack the twenty-three synthetic plants and thirty-one refineries that accounted for over ninety percent of the total Axis refinery and synthetic oil output.22! Moreover, from a targeting standpoint, oil refineries seemed unusually vulnerable as they were easily identifiable from the air and were located in open areas away from densely populated towns.!23! From the findings of this research, the EOU generated a memorandum on 28 February 1944 titled, “The Use of Strategic Air Power after 1 March 1944,” that they staffed through USAAF leadership 134  The plan aligned with guidance provided by General Spaatz and was well received by USAAF planners.“2! The plan discussed the strategic importance of oil, vulnerability to attack, and the  anticipated effects of striking specific targets.3® Colonel Hughes hurried the plan through the staffing process and presented the plan to General Spaatz on 5 March 1944.{137! General Spaatz recognized that the EOU’s plan was essentially an ‘Oil Plan’ and he agreed that a radical reduction of German oil supplies would substantially degrade the fighting capability of German ground and air forces.{38! General Spaatz immediately accepted the draft plan and directed his staff to prepare it for presentation to General Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe. The final plan sub- mitted to General Eisenhower contained only minor changes to the EOU’s original plan and included the EOU appendices in their entirety.42%  Ata25 March 1944 meeting with General Eisenhower and his deputy, Air Chief Marshal Tedder, General Spaatz presented his plan. He argued that oil
