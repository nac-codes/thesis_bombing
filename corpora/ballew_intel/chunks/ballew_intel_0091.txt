With that option unacceptable, the German Air Force would interdict Allied bombing missions and with the arrival of a long-range fighter escort, the Allies would inflict intolerable losses on the German fighter force. While many agreed with General Spaatz’s presentation, General Eisenhower did not select the ‘Oil Plan’ since it could neither guarantee success nor that these attacks would have an effect on German strength in the West prior to D-Day.{42!  The EOU was very forthright in their plan, acknowledging that due to their storage capacity, if Germany chose to allocate stocks to the Western Front, attacks on oil would not affect the opening stages of Operational OVERLORD through D+30.!*!

As the date of invasion came closer, General Eisenhower focused on actions that would ass
