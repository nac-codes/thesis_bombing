ated a memorandum on 28 February  1944 titled, “The Use of Strategic Air Power after 1 March 1944,” that they staffed through USAAF leadership.13  The plan aligned with guidance provided by General Spaatz and was well received by USAAF planners.“35! The plan discussed the strategic importance of oil, vulnerability to attack, and the anticipated effects of striking specific targets.3% Colonel Hughes hurried the plan through the staffing process and presented the plan to General Spaatz on 5 March 1944.{37!

If they elected to preserve their fighters, the Allies would face little resistance as they destroyed a key strategic resource needed by the G
