General Spaatz recognized that the EOU’s plan was essentially an ‘Oil Plan’ and he agreed that a radical reduction of German oil supplies would substantially degrade the fighting capability of German ground and air forces.38! General Spaatz immediately accepted the draft plan and directed his staff to prepare it for presentation to General Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe.
