no position to contest the Allies’ invasion on D-Day.45% In addition to directly reducing Germany’s ability to defend against the Allies invasion from the air, the strategic attacks on German oil targets greatly affected the German war effort by the end of the summer. In March 1944, Germany was producing 180,000 metric tons of fuel, but by September, fuel production was down to only 10,000 tons.“4=1 Additionally, in that same period, Allied bombing reduced German fuel supplies from 981,000 tons to 281,000 tons.452! Overall, the attacks on oil severely hampered the German war effort and validated the recommendations provided by the EOU  The EOU was behind the decision of the USAAF to attack oil. In helping guide the decision to pursue oil and in developing a system of comparative target analysis that indicated oil as the optimum target, the EOU was more useful to the strategic bombing campaign in the weeks following “Big Week” than at any other point during the war.!“2! The EOU took General Spaatz’s guidance and reviewed existing documentation before selecting the oil industry as the most lucrative target system.  The EOU staffed a memorandum through USAAF leadership to ensure the German oil industry aligned with strategic objectives. The fact that the text in the final version of the plan drew heavily on the EOU memorandum and used the EOU appendices in their entirety illustrates how successful the EOU was in selecting a target that aligned with military and political objectives. The next problem for the EOU revolved around whether the Allies should target bridges or marshaling yards to obstruct the Germans from sending reinforcements to counter Operation OVERLORD.  Bridges versus Marshaling Yards  Concurrent with their analysis and research on how best to use the strategic bomber force following “Big Week,” the EOU received a tasking from Colonel Hughes to determine how best to use allied tactical air power to support Operation OVERLORD.!! In particular, Hughes wa
