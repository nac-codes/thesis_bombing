the invasion area was the complete destruction of the bridges leading to northern France.!18! This required a major effort by the EOU to gather intelligence on the different routes and bridges in France. The EOU sought to identify which targets would prevent German reinforcements from reaching the beachhead. In addition to passing their findings to Colonel Hughes, the EOU produced papers and attended briefings and conferences to share their findings and convince those in charge that bridges were more lucrative tar- gets than marshaling yards.S)  On 17 February 1944, the EOU produced a plan entitled “Outline Plan for Air Support to OVERLORD” that they staffed to General Spaatz.!1§! The plan argued that bridges stood as more lucrative targets than marshaling yards. Bridges were cheaper in terms of effort and the effects from destroying a bridge lasted longer than blocks on marshaling yards. Specifically, the EOU’s analysis indicated that a bridge blockage required 196 tons while a marshaling yard required 456 tons to stop traffic.“ Thus, to provide maximum support to Operation OVERLORD, the EOU recommended isolating the Normandy battlefield by taking out three rings of bridges above the Seine-Loire complex.{8! Medium bombers and fighter-bombers would take out the bridges freeing un the strategic  Page 36 of 52 62%  Bridges versus Marshaling Yards  Concurrent with their analysis and research on how best to use the strategic bomber force following “Big Week,” the EOU received a tasking from Colonel Hughes to determine how best to use allied tactical air power to support Operation OVERLORD.@*! In particular, Hughes wanted the EOU to review Professor Solly Zuckerman’s, Air Chief Marshal Tedder’s scientific advisor, plan for attacking marshaling yards. Professor Zuckerman believed marshaling yards offered the greatest opportunity to degrade the flow of German resources and limit Germany’s ability to move forces to counter the Allies’ invasion.“ Air Chief Marshal Leigh-Mal
