hes, the EOU produced papers and attended briefings and conferences to share their findings and convince those in charge that bridges were more lucrative tar-  gets than marshaling yards.)  On 17 February 1944, the EOU produced a plan entitled “Outline Plan for Air Support to OVERLORD” that they staffed to General Spaatz.®8 The plan argued that bridges stood as more lucrative targets than marshaling yards. Bridges were cheaper in terms of effort and the effects from destroying a bridge lasted longer than blocks on marshaling yards. Specifically, the EOU’s analysis indicated that a bridge blockage required 196 tons while a marshaling yard required 456 tons to stop traffic.“ Thus, to provide maximum support to Operation OVERLORD, the EOU recommended isolating the Normandy battlefield by taking out three rings of bridges above the Seine-Loire complex.{*! Medium bombers and fighter-bombers would take out the bridges freeing up the strategic bombers to strike oil. The plan resonated with General Spaatz, but since he did not have operational control over the tactical forces, he did not feel comfortable presenting the ‘Bridge Plan’ to General Eisenhower.{6%  At the 25 March 1944 meeting with General Eisenhower, General Spaatz only lobbied for the strategic bombing of oil targets. From a professional standpoint, he felt it was wrong to propose how to employ forces not under his control. While General Spaatz argued for attacks on oil targets at this meeting, Professor Zuckerman presented a course of action that focused on marshaling yards.  Despite the mounting evidence in Italy, Professor Zuckerman claimed that bombing accuracy was not exact enough to strike and destroy bridges without using an excessive number of aircraft.27% Further, he stated that while only a direct hit counts on a bridge, any bomb on a railway center causes damage and since marshaling yards were expansive, bombers were more likely to hit something of value.{711 since Operation OVERLORD stood as General
