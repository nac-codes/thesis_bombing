nts on a bridge, any bomb on a railway center causes damage and since marshaling yards were expansive, bombers were more likely to hit something of value.{711 since Operation OVERLORD stood as General Eisenhower’s number one priority, General Eisenhower chose the marshaling yard plan since he felt it would have a greater immediate impact on Germany’s ability to counter the Allies’ invasion. This decision disappointed General Spaatz and the EOU, yet they continued their research and analysis to determine which tactical targets would have the greatest effect on German movement in Northern France.  The EOU continued to collect and analyze data from Italy that supported the bombing of bridges. Towards the end of April 1944, General Spaatz and his deputy, General Anderson, went to Italy and saw first-hand that a modest number of bombers could successfully destroy bridges.7! Upon returning from the trip, General Spaatz was strongly behind the bridge plan even though it was a tactical vice strategic target. He took the view that attacks on marshaling yards would not provide the lasting effects needed to prevent German reinforcements from reaching Northern France. In early May, General Spaatz presented General Eisenhower an alternative to the marshaling yards plan and recommended experimental attacks to prove the effectiveness of bombers against bridges.173!  On 7 May 1944, the Ninth Air Force conducted experimental attacks on six Seine bridges with less than fifty P-47 fighter-bombers.” The attacks proved unexpectedly successful with three bridges badlv damaged and a fourth dropped into the river.7* Air planners placed pictures depicting the bridge dropped into the river on the desk of everv maior figure concerned with the bombing business  Page 36 of 52 62%  SOULALIIIE, LLID INULTLIAIIUY UALLICIIEIM UY LANs UUE LIME 111159 UL ULIMBES QUUVE LLID CELIO VIS CULL PIC A  SRC EEE UME AIIM LIB AILELSUUITLUELS WUE LARS VUE Le ULI ESS LLRCills Mp Lie oli altel bombers to strike oi
