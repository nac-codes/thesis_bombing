The plan resonated with General Spaatz, but since he did not have operational control over the tactical forces, he did not feel comfortable presenting the ‘Bridge Plan’ to General Eisenhower.{62t  At the 25 March 1944 meeting with General Eisenhower, General Spaatz only lobbied for the strategic bombing of oil targets. From a professional standpoint, he felt it was wrong to propose how to employ forces not under his control. While General Spaatz argued for attacks on oil targets at this meeting, Professor Zuckerman presented a course of action that focused on marshaling yards.  Despite the mounting evidence in Italy, Professor Zuckerman claimed that bombing accuracy was not exact enough to strike and destroy bridges without using an excessive number of aircraft.27% Further, he stated that while only a direct hit counts on a bridge, any bomb on a railway center causes damage and since marshaling yards were expansive, bombers were more likely to hit something of value.!241 since Operation OVERLORD stood as General Eisenhower’s number one priority, General Eisenhower chose the marshaling yard plan since he felt it would have a greater immediate impact on Germany’s ability to counter the Allies’ invasion. This decision disappointed General Spaatz and the EOU, yet they continued their research and analysis to determine which tactical targets would have the greatest effect on German movement in Northern France.  The EOU continued to collect and analyze data from Italy that supported the bombing of bridges. Towards the end of April 1944, General Spaatz and his deputy, General Andersqn, went to Italy and saw first-hand that a modest number of bombers could successfully destroy bridges.2”2! Upon returning from the trip, General Spaatz was strongly behind the bridge plan even
