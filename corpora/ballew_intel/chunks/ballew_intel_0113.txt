int reports, the EOU became experts on the German  industrial complex and were prepared to assist USAAF planners with target selection and prioritization.  The EOU took an effects-based approach in identifying and prioritizing targets. Lacking a robust air capability at the beginning of 1943, the EOU understood the need to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of US airpower using limited available bomber assets to produce the greatest effect on the German war economy. In the EOU’s estimation, multiple strikes on targets within a single industry would have a greater effect on Germany’s war production than striking a key target in multiple industries.“ Taking this approach, the EOU pursued those industries where the minimum  number of targets would have the greatest effect on the German war effort 81  Page 41 of 52 69%  The bridges turned out to be extraordinarily efficient objectives and made a major contribution toward obstructing the German war effort. By D-Day, the interdiction of the Seine was complete, significantly impeding Germany’s efforts to reinforce its forces in Normandy from the Calais area and elsewhere.274 Additionally, as the EOU intended, the effectiveness of the bridge campaign enabled the heavy bombers to pursue the oil targets {178  Once again, the EOU took higher guidance, conducted thorough research and analysis, and developed a plan outlining targets that best aligned with higher objectives. While in this instance the EOU focused on tactical rather than strategic targets, they understood the strategic importance of establishing a beachhead in Northern France, and thus sought to identify the target system that would best support that operation. To ensure their recommendations aligned with military and political objectives, the EOU worked closely with Colonel Hughes and the rest of General Spaatz’s staff. Although not adopted initially, the EOU’s ability to understand the environment, conduct in-depth research and analysis, and develop detai
