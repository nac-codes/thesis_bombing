chain of command offered opportunities as well as challenges.  By not falling directly under the command of Eighth Air Force, the EOU could independently develop its target selection methodology.482! However, since EOU members lacked military experience, Colonel Hughes assigned liaison officers to work inside the EOU and foster the relationship between the two organizations. The liaison officers proved extremely beneficial. Not only did they relay mili- tary guidance and help the EOU members understand USAAF doctrine, but they also facilitated the interaction between EOU members and senior USAAF leaders and planners.  Overall, it was this integration and constant collaboration between the EOU and USAAF leadership that resulted in a shared understanding of political and military objectives and ensured EOU’s target recommendations and priorities supported strategic goals. Both the POINTBLANK  Directive and the “Oil Plan” support this assertion. The incorporation of the EOU’s proposed targets into the POINTBLANK Directive demonstrated that the EOU’s recommendations aligned with military and political aims.

In the EOU’s estimation, multiple strikes on targets within a single industry would have a greater effect on Germany’s war production than striking a key target in multi
