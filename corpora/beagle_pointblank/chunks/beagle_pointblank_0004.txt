As soon as industrial attacks resumed with P-51 escorts, thetoll on Germany was unmistakable; and Big Week (20–25 February 1944)culminated a decisive tactical Allied victory from which the Luftwaffenever recovered, though there would still be Allied losses to the end. Once the Anglo–American air forces achieved their “overriding interme- diate objective,” it became apparent that––though many airmen believedairpower alone could strategically topple Germany––this view was not con-trolling the overall Allied strategic plan. In the months preceding D day, itbecame increasingly apparent to Allied air commanders what theCasablanca Directive authors intended when they wrote, “to permit initi-ation of final combined operations on the Continent.” 12While Gen Carl A. Spaatz, commander of the US Strategic Air Forces in Europe, believed theAAF should exploit daylight air superiority by destroying vital German tar-gets––namely oil––which would significantly shorten the war, Gen DwightD. Eisenhower, supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces,was not completely convinced such targeting would yield the promisedreturns. Consequently, when the strategic air forces fell under his com-mand in March 1944, the demands of the invasion received priority fromall Allied air forces and he called for a transportation attack plan todirectly support Operation Overlord. 13Even then, however, Eisenhower deferred to Spaatz’s judgment somewhat and allowed American bomberforces to devote a small number of their raids to oil production facilitiesduring the invasion preparation. Following Normandy, these effortsbecame the primary aim of US strategic air operations. Combined with theongoing assault on German transportation and the u
