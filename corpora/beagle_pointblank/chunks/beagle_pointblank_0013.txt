to refocus their attacks on oil.36 One of Tedder’s responses to a piece of refinery strike intelligence exem- plifies how influential effects-related information was in the Allied deci-sion-making feedback loop. In April 1944, Fifteenth Air Force raided theoil refineries at Ploesti, Romania. Eighth Air Force followed several weekslater, substantially damaging a group of oil targets in central Germany.Intelligence, including ULTRA, revealed intense German distress concern-ing these losses. Tedder, an avid proponent of attacking German trans-portation, opposed making oil a priority because he felt the Americanscould not deliver on their precision-strike promises. Nevertheless, inresponse to the intelligence, he replied, “I guess we’ll have to give the cus-tomer what he wants.” 37Future intercepts validated that decision. As early as June 1944, the German operational staff informed individ- ual units that because of “encroachment into the production of aircraftfuel by enemy action . . . it has been necessary to break into the strategicreserves.” Less than a month later, Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring decreed: “Drastic economy [in fuel use] is absolutely essential.” Shortlythereafter, the German High Command ordered fighters not to fly awayfrom bases under anticipated attack, due to fuel shortages. Based on thisprogressively more revealing intelligence picture, Spaatz advised that theGerman aircraft industry no longer be the primary target because Germanair operations were being hindered, not by lack of airframes, but lack offuel and qualified pilots. 38Hindsight, via intelligence feedback in this case, once again proved to have greater acuity than foresight; and otherresults would confirm this finding. Results in Retrospect According to the US Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS), the CBO deliv- ered almost 2.7 million tons of bombs while flying an equal number offighter sorties and more than 1.4 million bomber sorties. The eventualcosts included 79,265 American and 79,281
