A large body of writing has been devoted to the subject, especially pertaining to its history in Britain and the United States. Indeed since 1980 the pace of inquiry has increased, producing at least 20 noteworthy studies.1 For the most part these have focused on particular issues or time periods, and have not been explicitly comparative in nature.

Such an approach will illumi­ nate the way in which each nation interpreted the 'lessons' of World War I and carried them into the future; it will highlight both similiarities and differ­ ences in thinking, and the reasons for them; and finally it will facilitate a better understanding of the operation of the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO) of World War II. A particular focus of this essay will be to explain the genesis and evolution of the 'selective bombing' policy pursued by the Americans in the Europe theatre in World War II, and the 'general area bombing' pursued by the British. The former postulates that 'it is better to cause a high degree of destruction in a few really essential industries ... than to cause a small degree of destruction in many industries. '2 The latter argues by contrast that no one target or target set is more vital than another, and that one best uses airpower to cause a general level of destruction which will overwhelm the enemy's war economy and, es
