es by contrast that no one target or target set is more vital than another, and that one best uses airpower to cause a general level of destruction which will overwhelm the enemy's war economy and, especially, his will to fight.' While this difference was in many respects a result of the prevailing circumstances and available resources within each air service, it also was determined by patterns and predispositions which can be traced back to each organisation's experience during and after World War I. Superficial stereo-  File: --- biddle_origins.pdf --- Page 2 --- 92 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE types of British 'terror bombing' and American 'precision bombing' are oversimplified and misleading; the courses and channels of thought -as well as the actual flow of bombardment practices -often overlapped and are not easily categorised. Nonetheless, it is possible to identify different trends in the evolution of ideas within the two air services which ultimately did influence the way each organisation fought World War II. These trends allow us to see, as well, how optimistic assumptions about airpower were often out of step with the realities of air warfare as it ultimately was practiced between 1939 and 1945. Both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) went into the war with mistaken ideas which would only be worked out through costly and often bitter experience. The 'Moral Effect' of Bombing In a dispatch published in January 1919, the commander of Britain's Independent Force (IF), Major-General Sir Hugh Trenchard, rather boldly asserted that, 'At present the moral effect of bombing stands undoubtedly to the material effect in a proportion of 20 to 1 ... •• Instead of the word 'moral', Trenchard might have chosen the word 'psychological'. Indeed he viewed the terms as essentially interchangable, but, as he explained later in his career, he shied away from the latter because he had difficulty spelling it.5 The ratio itself (20 to 1) ha
