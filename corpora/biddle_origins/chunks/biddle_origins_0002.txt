Indeed he viewed the terms as essentially interchangable, but, as he explained later in his career, he shied away from the latter because he had difficulty spelling it.5 The ratio itself (20 to 1) had no basis in anything scientific. Trenchard used numbers liberally but never based them on anything except his own hunches.6 A little drama was probably necessary at the time, however, as the independent status of the newborn RAF was already coming under challenge. In his dispatch, Trenchard was trying to explain why he had chosen to employ the bombers available to him in 1918 for widely dispersed attacks on German industrial centres. He argued that since he did not have the bombers to do sufficient material damage 'so as to completely destroy industrial centres', he chose instead to 'attack as many of the large industrial centres as it was possible to reach' in order to maximise the all-important 'moral effect' upon the enemy.7 If his mathematics were correct, then bombing for 'moral effect' would have been the most efficient strategy no matter how many bombers were available, but it is not clear that Trenchard had thought through the full implications of his own statement. As General Officer Commanding in the field, justifying his use of resources was more immediately on his mind. It is certainly true that he did not have enough bombers to do serious damage to German industry. Constant production delays and demands arising from the ground campaign ensured that, during the five months it operated, the IF never had more than nine squadrons of aircraft, and many of those  File: --- biddle_origins.pdf --- Page 3 --- BRITISH AND AMERICAN STRATEGIC BOMBING 93 were unsatisfactory. While the planners of the British air campaign initially had high hopes for the destruction of key German war industries through repeated attacks, the shortage of resources caused them to modify their expectations. In September 1917 Major Lord Tiverton, who would become one of the Air Staff's key
