German war industries through repeated attacks, the shortage of resources caused them to modify their expectations. In September 1917 Major Lord Tiverton, who would become one of the Air Staff's key planners, wrote a paper offering a programme of objectives for strategic bombing. He divided bombing objectives into four groups (the Dusseldorf group, the Cologne group, the Mannheim group, and the Saar Valley group), all of which offered key military and industrial targets - especially chemicals, machine shops and steel production -and therefore promised the greatest possible impact on the German war effort. Tiverton had in mind the 'systematic destruction' of the German munition works.8 As it became increasingly clear, however, that genuine 'material damage' could not be achieved, Air Staff planners hoped that bombing at least would have a 'moral effect' on Germany. They shifted their focus during 1918 from obliteration Of Germany's 'root industries' to trying to cause enough dis­ ruption and dislocation to hinder German industrial output, and to cause the German people to reconsider continuing the war.• Though the Air Staff realised that the latter goal was a less tangible one, they saw it as a viable plan under the circumstances. Tiverton noted candidly, 'Moral effect is strongly reminiscent of that sweet and blessed word "Mesopotamia". It is used most loosely to embrace all manner of different enterprises.'10 In 1918 Air Staff planners hatched a variety of schemes to enhance the 'moral effect' of bombing, including attacks on worker's housing, and the use of newly-developed incendiary weapons. In August Tiverton requested- in an interesting foreshadowing of World War II-a list of towns with concentrated workmen's dwellings, which he considered 'a reasonable target'. Plans were drawn up as well to use a new long-range bomber, the Handley Page V1500, to play a part in producing a 'moral effect' in Germany.11 Still, many of those planners believed that the material e
