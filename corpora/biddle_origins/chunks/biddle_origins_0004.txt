lans were drawn up as well to use a new long-range bomber, the Handley Page V1500, to play a part in producing a 'moral effect' in Germany.11 Still, many of those planners believed that the material effect of bombing was the most important, and they hoped that once an adequate force was ready, it would be possible to re-focus IF efforts in that direction.12 As it turned out, the war ended before the feasibility of any of these plans could be adequately tested. Air Staff schemes, however, never had much of an impact on Trenchard. To a great degree he operated without undue influence from his colleagues back in London.13 Formerly the commander of the Army's Royal Flying Corps (RFC), he had come to his new position through a circuituous sequence of events that ultimately allowed him the freedom to report only to the Secretary of State for Air. 14 His interest remained largely in his former responsibility -using airpower to support armies in the field. Indeed, he attempted genuine 'strategic' bombing only sporadically, directing most of  File: --- biddle_origins.pdf --- Page 4 --- 94 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE his bombers instead to the attack of nearby railway stations (in an effort to hinder German mobility on the ground) and aerodromes (in an effort to minimize losses to his own forces)." His colleagues in London, including his successor as Chief of Air Staff (CAS) Major-General Sir Frederick Sykes, criticised his unsystematic and apparently ambivalent approach to his task, his insubordination, and his inattention to critical operational details such as navigation and weather prediction.'6 Though he frequently frustrated the advocates of strategic bombing back in London, Trenchard could not entirely dismiss their expectations. Public opinion also demanded dramatic results. His frequent news releases and monthly dispatches revealed the emphasis he gave to aerodromes and railway stations, but they also highlighted his occasional efforts in the direction of other tar
