To a government obsessed with economies, Trenchard was an attractive candidate for CAS because he was willing to accept plans for a modest-sized postwar RAF.20 Once in his post, however, he took an increasingly protective stance toward the new service he now headed. He became especially determined to keep the fledgling RAF from the eager grasp of the Royal Navy, which was determined to re-acquire its air arm.
