of the enemy.42 To a great extent the British projected their own behaviour under enemy bombardment upon their German adversaries. During 1914-18 the British government and military had been impressed with the urgency and scope of defensive efforts the modest German bombing offensive had provoked in their homeland. Lecturing to his students, the first Commandant of the RAF Staff College (the then Air Commodore Sir Robert Brooke-Popham) used somewhat more precise figures to argue that, in order to meet a German offensive which at no time constituted more than 50 machines, Britain had to tie up over 270 aeroplanes and 13,000 men. He further explained that the British flew I ,882 sorties in order to cope with 452 German aeroplane flights over Britain.<' In retrospect, during the Great War the actual physical damage of bombing had been modest on all fronts. It nonetheless had caused occasional disÂ­ ruption, delays and work shortages in the vicinity of target areas. Such disruption, though not usually debilitating in and of itself, caused states to commit high levels of resources to defend their cities and sites of strategic importance. These resources, both men and materiel, represented a potentially significant loss to the critical offensive aspect of the war effort. This seemingly disproportionate defensive diversion had a tremendous impact on the thinking of many both inside and outside the RAF. The wartime experience had revealed the very steep, early portion of a marginal returns curve, so that those studying it tended to extrapolate linearly. Indeed, Trenchard ultimately used this as the underpinning of his service's postwar strategy. He argued that through the prosecution of a relentless air offensive against enemy 'vital centres', one could gain the initiative and ultimately bring an enemy state to collapse as its internal demands for protection became increasingly shrill and it was forced further and further on to the defensive.44 This conception tended to con
