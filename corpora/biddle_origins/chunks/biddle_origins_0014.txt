ps using modified bombers for the purpose.47 After the war, though, Trenchard gradually seemed to forget the level of resistance he faced. He eschewed the construcÂ­ tion of escorts in order to maximise the number of bombers available to the force; he was less interested in dealing with the enemy air force than in simply getting the largest possible number of bombers to the enemy's vital centres. Finally, while he did not dismiss fighters altogether, he argued that the construction of short-range interceptors for defence -which he saw as a concession to the demands of an ignorant populace -ought to be kept to a minimum!' During the interwar years not everyone could so readily dismiss the issue of defence. But, in taking up the issue, the Committee of Imperial Defence's (CID) first committee on Air Raid Precautions parroted Trenchard's rhetoric, claiming (in 1924) that the 'moral effect' of bombing in a future war will be 'out of all proportion greater' than the physical consequences.'9 Like Trenchard's 20 to I rule, this estimate was based more on extrapolation and reflexive fears than anything else. Sometimes cited were the number of people sheltering in London underground railway station during 1917-18, the disruption in the city of Hull during Zeppelin raids there, the work stoppages among the railways, and the number of industrial manhours lost due to air raids. But there was little genuinely systematic analysis behind it.

These expectations had been fueled for a long time by popular science fiction writing on the probable effects of aerial bombing, and had revealed themselves dramatically on occasion, as in 1909 with the 'Pha
