xpectations had been fueled for a long time by popular science fiction writing on the probable effects of aerial bombing, and had revealed themselves dramatically on occasion, as in 1909 with the 'Phantom Airship Scare'." Aerial bombing engendered a kind of primal fear based on the notion that in the wars of the future there would be no place to shelter or to hide. This was fueled and exacerbated by the assumption that gas (chemical) bombs would be widely used. The public debate on airpower became inextricably intertwined with the military and political debate.

Using a metaphor from biology, Liddell Hart explained that: 'A nation's nerve-system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops, is now laid bare to attack, and, like the human nerves, the progress of civilizaÂ­ tion has rendered it far more sensitive than in earlier and more primitive times.
