Even events like the 1926 general strike and the 1929 financial collapse seemed to cast a shadow on the idea that governments could control the masses. The atmosphere of civil-military tension aroused by the costly war and its after­ math gave an added edge to these issues. By 1935 Air Commodore L.E.O. Charlton argued (in the public debate) that: ' ... it will be the labouring masses ... themselves the most difficult people to control (factory employees in particular), who will be more susceptible than most to dismay and stampede when the air-raid warning goes.'" The Trenchardian solution -to bomb the other side harder -came to dominate RAF thinking in the 1920s, despite the fact that it downplayed the vulnerability of London to air attack. When he retired as CAS in 1929 after a decade of service, Trenchard had pretty well inculcated the 'moral effect'  File: --- biddle_origins.pdf --- Page 11 --- BRITISH AND AMERICAN STRATEGIC BOMBING 101 into the heart of RAF thinking and planning. His ideas were promulgated at the RAF Staff College, which had begun training officers in 1922.56 The 1928 RAF War Manual ('Operations' section) stated unequivocally: 'Although the bombardment of suitable objectives should result in considerable material damage and loss, the most important and far-reaching effect of air bombard­ ment is its moral effect.' The Manual continued: 'A single air raid on such vital centres may bring work to a standstill over a large area during the whole period of the raid and prolonged attack consisting of air raids at short intervals may be expected to result in such dislocation and confusion as a consequence of the continual stoppage of work and the strain on the workers, that supplies essential to the successful continuance of operations will not be forthcoming. '57 Besides hyperbole, a key problem with such confident rhetoric was that it was almost completely divorced from the reality of the late 1920s RAF. Labouring under the budgetary contraints influ
