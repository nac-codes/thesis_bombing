attention was paid to fox­ hunting than to target finding and bomb aiming. While the RAF was not alone in this-Britain's Army suffered similar interwar doldrums- the lack of attention paid to operational detail would become a particular problem for a service that had been born of technology, and whose future rested on developments in that realm. Sir John Slessor, who would become RAF Chief  File: --- biddle_origins.pdf --- Page 12 --- 102 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE of Staff in 1950--52, described interwar military service as 'an agreeable part-time occupation for a gentleman' .61 The traditional British aversion to developing war-fighting doctrines in peacetime held sway in Trenchard's RAF. As Commandant of the RAF Staff College in the late 1920s, Air Commodore Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt actively eschewed an 'over-reliance' on planning, telling his students: ' ... we must avoid being impressed too much by the actual letter and figures of our calcu­ lations. In peacetime the material factor is always liable to become more prominent and the more one deals with material things the more prominent the material factor tends to appear.' He went on to warn against developing 'a habit of mind which calculates results purely in mathematical terms ... '62 While it is certainly true that peacetime training does not substitute for wartime experience, the RAF was too willing in this period to rely on rather vague assumptions about the 'moral effect' of bombing -assumptions which sometimes skewed the results of the aerial exercises they did hold.63 Trenchardian rhetoric, better suited to deterrence than war-fighting, had the unfortunate consequence of putting the RAF in a frame of mind similar to what European armies had embraced through the 'psychological battlefield' paradigm prior to World War I. Trenchard's assertions depended upon the unsubstantiated assumption that the British (now meaning the entire nation) would be better able to endure an offensive contest of wills becaus
