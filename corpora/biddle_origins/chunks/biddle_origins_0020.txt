By 1928 he argued that such counterforce work, though not completely avoidable, would be a distraction from the main task at hand. In the age of long range bombers and total warfare, the issue of what con­ stituted a 'military target' was a particularly vexing one; attempts to work it out at the Hague in 1922-23 had led to a set of draft rules which attempted to protect civilians, but they had not been ratified by any nation.67 Trenchard felt he was clear in his own mind about the issue: he believed that the civilian in a factory producing war materiel held a different status than the man on the street. But his steady emphasis on the 'moral effect' was inherently vague and led many to think that this distinction was more apparent than real. That this issue was not settled in the RAF either was indicated by the commotion kicked up by an appreciation written for the ADGB Staff Exercise of 13-15 March 1933, in which the Air Officer Commanding-in­ Chief based his air war plan on breaking the morale of the enemy civilian population by 'striking at targets located in thickly populated areas'. 68 Some of the reviewers had no major problems with the appreciation, but the then Group Captain Charles Portal, who reviewed the document later in the year, stated that the language was 'about as unfortunate as it could be', since it 'leads directly to that idea that we can "make war on our own" by "indiscriminate attacks on the civil population," which is exactly what ... we have told the Government that it would not pay us to do.
