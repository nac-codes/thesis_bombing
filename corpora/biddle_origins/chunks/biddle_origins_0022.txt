ould do it. In addition, the 'locust years' had taken a toll on the British aircraft industry, and it could not be retooled overnight. And if this were not enough, the tech­ nology of air warfare was by then changing at such a rapid rate that there was genuine fear of building an air fleet that would be obsolete even before it was completed. Economic issues entered the picture in a profound way, too, as Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain was deeply fearful of bankrupting Britain while trying to re-arm her. Ultimately British air rearmament policy aimed at building aircraft so as to maintain parity with the Germans (and thus deter them) without provoking them into further expansion. This policy, how­ ever, surrendered the initiative, and kept Britain in a reactive stance.72 In these years, the RAF's faith in the power of the offensive continued to hold up.73 By 1935-36, with increasing developments in radar, there was evidence that defensive air power had more to recommend it than previously had been acknowledged. The RAF, as historian R. J. Overy has pointed out, 'accepted the development of defensive capability with an ill grace'. 74 Still, they had had the foresight to hedge their bets by spending rare research money on defensive techniques, and creating a communications net for fighters and anti-aircraft weapons -two decisions that would would prove critical during World War IP' Despite developing an air defence net, the Air Staff continued to be sceptical about providing escorts for bombers. In part this stemmed from the sheer faith in the bomber's ability to 'get through', and in part it stemmed from a belief that there were technical difficulties in building a fighter that could stay with and defend a large, fast bomber. In 1936, responding to reports about escort fighters being used in the Spanish Civil War, the RAF's Deputy Director of Operations suggested, if unenthusiastically, that the question of escorts be taken up, and that specifications
