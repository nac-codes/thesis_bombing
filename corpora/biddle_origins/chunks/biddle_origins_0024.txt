review of defence policy, resulting in what became known as the 'Inskip Report', which one historian has called 'the single most important document produced on defence matters in the 1930s. '78 The report, which became a blueprint for British grand strategy in World War II, took on the whole counter-offensive orientation of RAF policy. Inskip, whose prior experience of defence policy was limited, argued what he believed to be a common sense approach to defense policy; he felt that Britain initially ought to adopt a defensive stance in war, endure German attempts at a 'knock-out blow', and prevail eventually through a long-term strategy of attritional warfare based on the economic strength of the Commonwealth. The report reconciled airpower with the traditional tenets of British military strategy, and put the spotlight on air defence.7" The Air Staff did not welcome this rather radical tum of events, and accused Inskip of holding 'misconceptions' on airpower. But if Inskip's re­ orientation of air policy was a 'calculated gamble' with respect to both the ability of fighters to stop bombers and the ability of the Luftwaffe to over­ whelm Britain in the air, it was one that turned out to be sensible."' The Air Staff's hostility to it may have been ameliorated by their own increasing awareness of the weakness of their offensive arm, which had since been designated 'Bomber Command.' When Air Marshal Sir Edgar Ludlow­ Hewitt, now Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command, set off on a tour of his organization in September 1937, he found it to be 'entirely unprepared for war, unable to operate except in fair weather, and extremely vulnerable both in the air and on the ground'." He began taking the steps that would rectify the situation and put Bomber Command on a better war footing, but there was much work to be done -and many calculations now to be made. To his credit, he set out to undertake this work with relentless energy.  File: --- biddle_origins.pdf --- Page 16 --- 106
