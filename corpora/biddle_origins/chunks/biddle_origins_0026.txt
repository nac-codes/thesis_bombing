aimed at and cut off the necessary supplies without which the armies in the field cannot exist. '85 He saw long-range bombing as a kind of deep interdiction which would keep needed material out of the hands of the enemy's army. In discussing specific objectives, he followed Tiverton precisely -calling for attacks on four main target centers in Germany's industrial heartland as the best and most efficient way of seriously impairing the German war machine.'6 Gorrell's plan also took from Tiverton an emphasis on systematic bomb­ ing. Changing Tiverton's wording only slightly, Gorrell wrote that, 'From both the morale point of view and also that of material damage, concentration of our aerial forces against single targets on the same day is of vital impor­ tance since it tends to hamper the defense and also to complete in a thorough manner the work which the bombardment is intended to perform.'"' The plan appreciated the potential for the 'moral effect' of bombing too. Again following Tiverton's lead, Gorrell wrote that in a prolonged bombard­ ment against a German target, the breakdown of order might cause results 'out of proportion to the immediate effects of the bombs'."' With respect to the 'moral effect,' Gorrell was influenced directly by Trenchard as well; he incorporated several of Trenchard's ideas into a paper he wrote later called 'The Future Role of American Bombardment', which argued that, 'the  File: --- biddle_origins.pdf --- Page 17 --- BRITISH AND AMERICAN STRATEGIC BOMBING 107 appearance of only one or two machines over London is the equivalent of a loss of manhours which results in the loss of production of more airplanes than the whole of the enemy aerial forces destroy over the period of a fortnight on the front, and the loss of production of shells and cartridges amounting to those necessary for a good size battle by the Allies, to say nothing of the material and moral damage that the enemy airplanes cause in addition.
