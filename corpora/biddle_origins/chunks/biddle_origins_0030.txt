'95 Of course it is impossible to know how closely the Americans would have followed their own advice, especially in the face of the very real technical difficulties posed by bombing in the Great War. Ironically, the Americans' virgin status with respect to bombing gave them the freedom to be critical of their allies' efforts. The problems that Trenchard was up against, including primitive technologies and aircraft shortages, ought not to be underestimated.

What is interesting to note here is that some of the distinctions between the American and British views of bombing- distinctions that would last through World War II-were already beginning to emerge, if in a rather rudimentary way, by the spring of 1919. But there was no absolutely clean divide; many of the views that took hold in Britain under Trenchard were repeated on occasion in the United States. For instance, the 'Aerial Tactics' manual pro足 duced by the Director of the Air Service in June 1920, simply repeated (with足 out attribution) Trenchard's 20 to 1 rule on the 'moral effect' ofbombing.96 In 1923 the Commander of the US 1st Pursuit Group, Carl A. Spaatz, pointed out in a letter that, 'The first bomb dropped by an enemy on one of our cities will cause such a clamor for protection that no executive would be strong enough to withstand it. '97 Immediately after World War I the US Air Service -which was still very much a part of the Army -was forced to accept constraints on its con足 ceptualisation of bombing in future wars. The Army's top leadership con足 tinued to conceive of the Air Service as an auxiliary arm. The Secretary of War, Newton Baker, was hostile to strategic bombing for several reasons, not the least of which was that he thought it immoral; American foreign policy w
