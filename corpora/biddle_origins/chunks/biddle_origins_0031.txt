The Secretary of War, Newton Baker, was hostile to strategic bombing for several reasons, not the least of which was that he thought it immoral; American foreign policy was isolationist, and official American security policy was defensive in orientation.â€¢' In the early 1920s official publications on the role of the Air Service emphasised its position as an auxiliary service, and focused on support missions including observation and defensive pursuit.99 With no experience of long range bombing behind them, the men of the Air Service had little leverage to apply towards gaining independence from the Army.
