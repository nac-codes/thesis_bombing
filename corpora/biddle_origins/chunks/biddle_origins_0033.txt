They sought the central threads which would unravel the intricate web of a modem industrial economy. By the mid-thirties these ideas were well-developed, and by the late thirties they were established. The text for the 1938 'Air Force' course text summed up the concept very well, explaining that: '. . . the economic structure of a modem highly industrialized nation is characterized by the great degree of interdependence of its various elements. Certain of these elements are vital to the continued functioning of the modem nation. If one of these ele
