ed land­ based and naval aviation between the Army and the Navy, gave the Army an officially-sanctioned, defensive use for long range bombers: defenders of the American coastline. The need to hit a ship at sea put a premium on 'precision' capability.109 This need dovetailed nicely with the arrival of the Norden bombsight, and the advanced Martin B-10 bomber aircraft, which, with its sleek design, speed over 200mph, and altitude ceiling over 20,000 feet, pointed out the direction that future bomber aircraft might take.110 Also, the memory of Secretary of War Newton Baker lingered; the defensive nature of American security policy meant that US airmen had to be very careful in their statements, and they had to be especially care-  File: --- biddle_origins.pdf --- Page 22 --- 112 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE ful not to imply that they were interested in anything that smacked of indiscriminate bombing. Finally, the trend of thought may have come from a momentum which developed when ACTS moved from Virginia to Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, and set out consciously to become the hub of air force thought and theory. As a centre for 'air power' thought, Maxwell brought together a group of men -including instructors Kenneth Walker, Donald Wilson, Laurence Kuter, and Haywood Hansell -who tended to think along the same lines, and to share their ideas with one another. Removed from the immediacy of the air threat in Europe and its social overtones, they began to think about strategic bombing in economic terms. The onset of the Great Depression -which had a particularly harsh impact in America -had reinforced the notion of the intricate interdependence (and thus the essential frailty) of advanced industrial economies. Interpreting this through the lens of economics, and combining it with con­ cepts of concentration and efficiency (ideas important to them as military men), they developed a way of thinking which they viewed as uniquely and distinctly theirs -a product of ACTS bu
