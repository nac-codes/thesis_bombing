rk out many of the scientific problems vital to successful bombing. It was pointed out that a similar proposal had been made at the second, third, and tenth meetings of the Bombing Committee (which had begun meeting in 1934), but 'nothing had eventuated.' 125 The issue that seemed most pressing as the clouds darkened over Europe was: how might Bomber Command find a way to identify and strike 'military targets' only, so as to give the Germans an incentive to do the same -at least until the initial crises could be weathered and Bomber Command's strength built up? In the event of war, some air action would certainly be required, but the priorities -and constraints -of the new grand strategy were different than those Trenchard had imagined. Defending Britain -which now seemed especially vulnerable because London was such an accessible and critical target -and conserving the bombing force for a later day were the new guidelines for action.126 The government encouraged the Air Ministry to tighten, as far as possible, the definition of 'military' targets in order to encourage the Germans to do the same. The Air Staff's attempts to pick specific targets from the broader set marked 'Ruhr industrial targets', brought them, in essence, into line with the American search for 'key nodes'. In many ways this was a return to the views promulgated by Air Staff planners in London during World War I, whose first instinct had been to find a way to shut down the German war machine most efficiently. In the summer of 1940 the Air Staff argued that, 'moral effect, although an extremely important subsidiary result of air bombardment, cannot in itself be decisive. There must be material destruction as a primary object.' 127 The Trenchardian insistence on the primacy of 'the moral effect' of bombÂ­ ing had been abandoned, but only for the moment. The change in emphasis would be neither total nor permanent. Its revival was, in part, tied to the legacy of the Trenchard years: inattention to the
