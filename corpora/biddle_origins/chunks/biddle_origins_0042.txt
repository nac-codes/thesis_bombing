Its revival was, in part, tied to the legacy of the Trenchard years: inattention to the fundamentals of target find­ ing and bomb dropping. The problem, soon to be painfully discovered, was  File: --- biddle_origins.pdf --- Page 26 --- 116 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE that the inherent weakness of Bomber Command in the early years of the war precluded a successful campaign against any specific military targets. Ironically, some of the same issues that had helped to prompt a focus on the 'moral effect' of bombing in World War I would do so again in World War II. The Luftwaffe's failure in the Battle of Britain did not seem to erode Air Staff enthusiasm for attempting an air campaign against the Germans, but perhaps this is not surprising since the RAF was in a desperate situation and facing facts too fully would have meant despair.128 Despite their best efforts to find and hit specific German military targets in daylight, however, the British simply could not achieve success. Without long range escorts, British bombers could not fly in daylight because their losses to German defences were too high. At night they proved capable of finding and striking only very large targets. Already by June 1940 Air Marshal Charles Portal, who was then AOC-in-C Bomber Command, was told to strike oil targets as a first priority, but, in the event that these could not be found, his crews were to attack 'any self-illuminating target or targets which are otherwise identi­ fiable'.129 As the 1941 photo-reconnaissance survey known as 'the Butt Report' ultimately revealed, only about one in five crews were getting bombs within five miles of their intended targets.130 'Area bombing' was the only feasible use to which Bomber Command could be put. As this situation and its consequences sank in, arguments increased for using bombers to attack German morale. While serving as Chief of
