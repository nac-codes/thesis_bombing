July Deputy Chief of Staff Air Vice-Marshal Norman Bottomley wrote that the German weak points were morale and transportation, and that recent attacks on cities had had an impact on morale.132 In October Air Vice-Marshal John Slessor, then AOC of Bomber Command's No.5 Group, wrote to his commanders, '. .. the strength of a chain, however mighty it appears, is the strength of its weakest link, and that link in the chain is the morale of the German people.' 133 By the end of 1941 the Air Staff was preparing to recommend a general area offensive against Germany.
