hich supported the notion that bombing Germany's 58 principal towns would 'break the spirit of the people'.138 Another prominent scientist, Sir Henry Tizard, took issue with Cherwell's calculations at the time. After the war, Sir Solly Zuckerman claimed that Cherwell had grossly misinterpreted the data on which he had allegedly based his minute. 139 Nonetheless, as the official historians have pointed out, the timing of the minute and the nature of Cherwell's relationship to the Prime Minister meant that the document would have an effect. 140 Just as the Butt Report's revelations were derailing any hope for selective industrial targeting by the British, the Americans were codifying their commitment to it in a plan called A WPD-1 (Air War Plans Division - 1 ), written in August 1941. The plan, triggered by President Roosevelt's request for information from the newly-designated US Army Air Forces (USAAF), was developed by four men who were heavily indoctrinated into the 'selecÂ­ tive attack' mentality of the Air Corps Tactical School. It designated 'key  File: --- biddle_origins.pdf --- Page 28 --- 118 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE node' targets in the German war economy for destruction by American bombers flying in self-defending formation in daylight. The main targets systems included: electric power, transportation, oil, and aircraft produc- tion.141 Even though AWPD/1 was based on 'selective targeting,' it also incorporated the continuing attention paid to the 'moral effect' in American thinking. The plan made a specific concession to psychological targeting by allowing for the possibility of one big push at the appropriate moment -once the enemy was already worn down -in order to send him over the edge into surrender. The idea ultimately would be carried out in practice against the city of Berlin in February 1945.142 The authors of A WPD/1 also suggested that escort fighters might be necessary to protect the bombers. But the authors misjudged the type of aircraft
