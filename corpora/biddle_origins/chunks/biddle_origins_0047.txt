They felt that they had tapped into a bit of genius down in Alabama, and they were determined to try it out.l46 By the summer of 1942 the Americans were ready to commence their offensive, but the early raids were mere pinpricks on the verges of European airspace. The need to build up the infrastructure of the air arm at British  File: --- biddle_origins.pdf --- Page 29 --- BRITISH AND AMERICAN STRATEGIC BOMBING 119 bases, and the drain on resources to support the North Africa invasion took their toll. By the autumn Churchill was deeply concerned about the limited capabilities of the American force, and the Americans' tenacious commitÂ­ ment to daylight bombing. On 16 September he wrote directly to Roosevelt urging him to support and prioritise the production of aircraft, so that the Americans could begin a substantial contribution to the air campaign. 147 One month later Churchill wrote to Roosevelt's special assistant, Harry Hopkins. He diplomatically informed him that the British were not so optimistic as the Americans seemed to be about the initial efforts of the USAAF over France, and warned that there was a danger of committing too fully to the production of bombers suited only to daylight work.148 In London, a debate over 'what to do about the Americans' raged between Churchill and his leading air advisers, and the exchange of letters it produced makes for fascinating reading. 149 Both Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) Sir Charles Portal and Churchill had grave fears that the Americans would commit resources to a campaign they could not ultimately carry out, at which time it would be too late in the day for a tactical volte-face. Decisions made in 1942 would determine what could be done in 1944. In a memo of 26 September Portal asked rhetorically if it were not 'essential' to persuade the Americans to at least lay the
