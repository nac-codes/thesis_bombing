e-face. Decisions made in 1942 would determine what could be done in 1944. In a memo of 26 September Portal asked rhetorically if it were not 'essential' to persuade the Americans to at least lay the foundations for night bombing.150 Assistant CAS Sir John Slessor, who had been in America on a special mission in the winter of 1940-41, was by far the most optimistic about the Americans' prospect for success with their preferred approach.
