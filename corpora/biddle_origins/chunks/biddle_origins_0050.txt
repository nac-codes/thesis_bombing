obbied hard for the American case, taking with him a lengthy and detailed memoran足 dum offering seven reasons why it was critical for the Americans to do day足 light bombing, and answering questions like: 'Why have there been so few missions?'157 Despite some optimistic and high-sounding rhetoric about 'round the clock' bombing, the Casablanca conference essentially papered over the cracks. The resulting directive was, in essence, an agreement to dis足 agree. It stated that the 'primary object will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic system, and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.' Such general language contained in it something for everyone, and gave a good deal of latitude for interpretation to the commanders in the field.

American operational plans, drawn up by Eaker, assumed that 'precision pattern bombing' was tactically feasible from high altitude [20,000 and 30,000 feet] in the face of enemy defences. Eaker hoped that British and American planning could be coordinated so that RAF night足 time strikes would complement and reinforce American daylight strikes. He realised that the success of his plan would hinge on the achievement of air superiority, and thus he designated the offensive against German fighter strength an intermediate objective second to none. This was reflected in the 'Pointblank' bombing directive
