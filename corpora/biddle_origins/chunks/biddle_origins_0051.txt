achievement of air superiority, and thus he designated the offensive against German fighter strength an intermediate objective second to none. This was reflected in the 'Pointblank' bombing directive of June. But trying to defeat the Luftwaffe by bombing aircraft factories (and components factories) would prove to be no mean feat. 159 While Harris posed no major objections to Eaker's plan, he would allow himself to be pulled only so far in the direction of selective targeting. His formal response was positive, but he continued to make sure he had the practical latitude to continue his general area offensive. (Indeed he showed a particular talent for subtly re-arranging the wording of the Casablanca directive and Eaker's plan.) In order to maintain the area offensive, though, he had to produce results. Thus, 1943 became, in the words of the British official historians, a 'bombing competition' rather than a combined offensive.'60 The years 1942 and 1943 had brought some successes for Bomber Command, including the devastating fire raids on Hamburg in July 1943. The RAP's strategic arm had grown much larger and had developed radar and electronic aids (including Gee, Oboe, and H2S) that enabled it to become a vastly more destructive force. In addition, special units proved themselves sporadically capable of remarkable bombing accuracy. But 1943 was also a year in which both the British and the Americans would suffer severe set­ backs and would be forced to cope with the inescapable problem that air forces could not proceed repeatedly to 'vital centers' without first defeating enemy forces in being. The American 'Waterloo' was Schweinfurt, chosen as a 'key node' target for its anti-friction bearings industry. In two raids against the city's ball­ bearing works, in August and October, the theory of the self-defending bomber was severely tried. During the second mission 60 of the 291 Fortresses sent out did not return, and another 138 came back badly damaged.'"' In four ra
