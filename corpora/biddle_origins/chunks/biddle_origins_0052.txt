October, the theory of the self-defending bomber was severely tried. During the second mission 60 of the 291 Fortresses sent out did not return, and another 138 came back badly damaged.'"' In four raids carried out over six days in October 1943, 148 American bombers had failed to return to their bases, and the German fighter  File: --- biddle_origins.pdf --- Page 32 --- 122 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE force was increasing in strength. 162 There could be no sustained selective bombing campaign until air superiority was won. 163 The crisis for Bomber Command came in the area campaign waged against Berlin between November 1943 and March 1944, in which Air Chief Marshal Harris had placed great hopes. A poor target for the H2S radar aid, Berlin proved elusive and increasingly costly; rates of damage diminished while bomber losses continued to rise. Some 9,000 sorties were flown, but they brought Britain no closer to victory. There was no clear decline in the war economy, and no crack in morale. German night fighters were taking an ever increasing toll on British efforts, and Bomber Command had no answer to them.164 But the Americans were already working on a solution that would go far towards saving the day for both air forces. In their moment of crisis they decided to switch tactics rather than targets. Reassessing their earlier assumpÂ­ tions about the penetrative power of bombers in formation, they concluded that fighter escorts were required after all. Outfitted with drop tanks for long distance flying, planes like the North American P-51 Mustang helped to tum the tide in the air war.'65 Relying on their now enormous industrial production base, the Americans built escorts and brought them into the European theatre in large numbers. 166 Over the winter and spring the USAAF fought furious and costly battles of attrition in the skies above Germany. By flying to strategic targets which the Germans had to defend, the American bombers drew the German fighters into the sk
