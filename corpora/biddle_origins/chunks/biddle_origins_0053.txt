AAF fought furious and costly battles of attrition in the skies above Germany. By flying to strategic targets which the Germans had to defend, the American bombers drew the German fighters into the sky. The ensuing battles of attrition ultimately led to the defeat of the Luftwaffe, which not only made possible the Allied amphibious invasion of the Normandy coast, but also made possible a more sustained offensive against selected targets, which in tum helped the advance of Allied armies.167 This battle for control of the skies also helped pull British chestnuts out of the fire, since victory immediately affected the German night fighter forces by dislocating its training and practice flying, and more important since it triggered events leading to the full defeat of the Luftwaffe. 168 In April 1944 command of the Anglo-American strategic air forces was put under the control of General Dwight D.

In September, control of the forces reverted to their respective commanders: Harris of Bomber Command, and General Carl Spaatz, who commanded the newly-designated United States Strategic Air Forces (USST AF), comprised of the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces. 170 A lively debate over targeting, begun in spring, resumed in late summer.

In the end there was no real conÂ­ sensus, and the effo
