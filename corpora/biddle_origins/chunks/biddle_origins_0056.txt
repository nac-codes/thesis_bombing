ensitive because, as time went on, the Air Staff became increasingly concerned about how far it had strayed from its initial intent to bomb only military targets narrowly defined. Certainly they believed that their own actions had been justified by German attacks on Warsaw and Rotterdam (1939--40) as well as the bomber and V-weapon attacks on British soil; but as Germany began to founder, the question became more sensitive, and there was concern about public perceptions of the role of Bomber Command. Indeed, the Secretary of State for Air had been deflecting uncomfortable questions for some time.175 Harris, for his part, was utterly unconcerned about such things, and in fact had contempt for those who tried to depict the British bomber offensive as anything other than what it really was. Indeed, his opinion had not changed since October 1943, when, in a letter to the Under Secretary of State, Air Ministry, he had made himself jarringly clear when he stated: 'The aim of the Combined Bomber Offensive, and the part which Bomber Command is required by agreed British-US strategy to play in it, should be unambiguously and publicly stated. That aim is the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilised community life throughout Germany. '176 This singlemindedness of Harris was a pity, because when Portal did prevail upon him for strikes on selective targets, the results were unfailingly dramatic. With a big bomb bay, a crew of only seven, and less weight of armament for self-defence than their American counterparts, Lancasters could carry a more sizable bombload than B-17s. With their increased accuracy, and having less to fear from the Luftwaffe, they were a staggeringly potent force.177 Had Harris been persuaded to put the full weight of the resources at his command on German military targets, victory in Europe conceivably might have come sooner than it did.m But just as the Air Staff in London had failed to control Trenchard
