The phrase 'marshalling yards', however, often served as a euphemism for area bombing. An unarguable example of the American turn to the 'moral effect,' however, can be found in the USAAF attack on Berlin, staged 11 days earlier, and designed to see if one last big strike on the heart of the Reich might cause German collapse.'"'
