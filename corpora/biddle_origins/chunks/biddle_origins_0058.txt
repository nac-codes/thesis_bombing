bers all across Germany to attack transport targets, and targets of opportunity.'"2 A similar change in orientation took place, at roughly the same time, in the US air campaign against Japan. During the winter of 194~5 the Americans had grown frustrated by their inability to carry out a policy of selective targeting in the Far Eastern theatre. Their failure was due to the constant cloud cover over Japan, and the prevailing winds which made it difficult for bombers (in this case B-29s) to keep and hold formation. Under pressure from Washington to make headway in the air campaign, the commander on the scene, General Curtis E. LeMay, opted to change tactics and to carry out what constituted an area offensive against Japan's urban centres. The Americans did not cite 'undermining enemy morale' as a key reason for the shift to the night-time incendiary attacks in March 1945; while they recog足 nised that their tactics represented a 'radical departure from the traditional doctrine', they argued that they were still trying to destroy Japanese industry and war materiel -if somewhat less efficiently than in Europe. But their willingness to make the shift at least indicates that they held no categorical prohibition against urban incendiary strikes, and were prepared to use tactics which, compounded by the ongoing naval blockade, were to bring extra足 ordinary hardship to Japanese civilians.183 If, due to cloud cover, the distinction between American and British bomb足 ing in the European theater was not always apparent, it is nonetheless true that the Americans remained committed to the theory supporting selective bombing. And they sought every opportunity to engage in 'product differenti足 ation' with respect to their British cousins. The Americans embraced the term 'precision bombing,' and made sure to emphasise it to the audience back  File: --- biddle_origins.pdf --- Page 36 --- 126 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE home -an audience which. would soon help to decide if the air for
