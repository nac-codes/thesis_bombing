ndence and organisational flexibility; the overriding conclusion that domestic populations would be a weak point for all states in future wars, but that the British population could be relied upon somewhat more than others; the interwar emphasis on deterrence rather than warfighting; and the anti-empirical mindset that brought 'moral' factors to the surface in an exaggerated way. Many of the ideas which had defined the offensive a l' outrance prior to the war seemed to have been absorbed by Trenchard, adapted slightly, and applied to the air. Between the wars the air forces of both nations were captured by the idea that modem industrial states are made of what Liddell Hart described as a 'complex and interdependent fabric'.'" They both believed that the delicate sinews -whether material or moral -holding together such intricate creations ought to be easily subject to the overwhelming offensive power of aircraft. Why the Americans chose, by the early 1930s, to emphasise the material undoubtedly had much to do with the political, geographical, and economic position of the United States at the time. By generally holding to the ideas contained in the Gorrell plan, the Americans attached themselves to the 1917 ideas of the British Air Staff-ideas which, ironically, Trenchard ultimately chose to ignore. But both the US and Britain made the same mistake in fixating an exaggerated faith on the offensive, and elevating it -to an extraordinary degree -over the power of the defensive. Both air forces incorporated biases into their air exercises, and tended to screen out information that did not reinforce prevailing conceptions and prejudices. Under the desperate pressures of combat that caused them to face the tactical reality of their unenviable situation, the RAF re-evaluated its position: the Trenchardian focus on the 'moral effect' of bombing, which had served well for bureaucratic purposes, and which -for a time -had served as the rhetoric of deterrence, was suddenly repl
