shoulders of those who were content to downplay for too long the science of aerial bombardment, and the very daunting operational challenges it posed. In the end, though, perhaps a war was required to bring all of those many challenges to light. Despite their efforts to sort out the science of bombing in the 1930s, the Americans still fell short of doing so, and had to endure and overcome the bitter wartime consequences of that failure. In many respects, the air campaign of World War II resembled the ground campaign of World War I. It was characterised by a struggle to understand and master new instruments and methods of warfare, by large-scale battles of attrition, and by the critical importance of defensive techniques. Just as the artillery and machine-guns of World War I took their toll on the masses inspired by the offensive spirit, so did the fighters and flak guns of World War II take their toll on the bomber crews, whose stoic bravery helped them to carry out the epic offensive they were called upon to pursue. In the end, the monumental efforts of the RAF and USAAF did force Germany to devote vast resources to a defensive effort, including two million soldiers, civilians, and prisoners of war engaged in ground anti-aircraft defense, and an additional million in repair and rebuilding.188 Modem industrial societies, however, turned out to be quite robust, both morally and materially. Civilian will proved itself susceptible to 'cracking' in neither democracies nor totalitarian states, and the robustness of the German economy surprised, over and over again, Anglo-American intelligence and economic experts. Like a prize fighter unwilling to go down, the German economy kept coming back from the worst bruisings the Allies could inflict upon it. Attacks on German military and industrial installations were only effective after they had become massive, sustained, and relentless. The mistaken assumption that German industry might prove frangible drew heavily upon anoth
