AN STRATEGIC BOMBING 131 Williams, (note 9), pp.223-4, and 232-3; also Wise (note II), p.299. 14. Trenchard was in many ways an odd choice for head of the IF since he had staunchly opposed the formation of an independent air force when momentum for it developed after the German bomber raids on England in spring 1917. (For Trenchard's initial concerns about an independent air force, see his letter of 30 Aug. 1917 in AIR 1/521/16/12/3). It is likely that he took up the reins of the new long-range bombing force because he knew he had good relations with his allies in the field, and could at least oversee and control the the resources being committed to the task. In Dec. 1917 Trenchard was recalled to London and virtually forced to take the reins of the new service as CAS. He was almost immediately at loggerheads with the first Secretary of State for Air (Lord Rothermere), however, and resigned his post in March. Sitting in London without a job was embarrassing to him, and made him more amenable to the offer made to him by Rothermere's successor (Lord Weir) to take charge of the IF, but his acceptance was contingent upon certain conditions. On the events of Dec. 1917 see Andrew Boyle, Trenchard (NY: Norton, 1962), pp.249-55, and Cooper (note 6), p.l20. On Trenchard's decision to become head of the IF, see Smith, British Air Strategy Between the Wars, p.21; also Boyle, pp.284-8, and Cooper (note 6), p.l29. 15. Records of the work of the IF can be found in Trenchard's dispatches back to London, located in AIR l/458/15/312/69. Historian S.F. Wise has analysed the figures in Canadian Airmen and the First World War, pp.298-314. A very detailed analysis and critique also can be found in Williams, 'Statistics and Strategic Bombardment,' pp.324-439. 16. During the months in which the IF operated, CAS Maj.-Gen. Sir Frederick Sykes wished that Trenchard would dedicate more of his attention to genuine 'strategic' bombing. This sentiment was shared by other Air Staff planners. For
