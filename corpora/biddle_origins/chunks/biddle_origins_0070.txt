he IF operated, CAS Maj.-Gen. Sir Frederick Sykes wished that Trenchard would dedicate more of his attention to genuine 'strategic' bombing. This sentiment was shared by other Air Staff planners. For Sykes views see his memoir, From Many Angles, pp.215-68. For the views of other Air Staff members, see complaints raised about Trenchard in AIR 1/461/15/312/107, AIR 1/460/15/312/101, and AIR l/458/15/ 312/69. See also Wise (note 11), pp.298-9, and N. Jones, Beginnings of Strategic Air Power (note 9), pp.l7-21. 17. In early Aug. 1918 the Air Ministry's Director of Flying Operations, Maj.-Gen. P.R.C. Groves, sent a request to Trenchard's staff, asking for six copies of all of Trenchard's dis­ patches, arguing: 'We are out to binge the Independent Force for all we are worth, the opposition both inside and outside the building is considerable.

See Daily Mail clipping, 21 Sept. 1918, in AIR 1/462/15/312/116. 19. Williams (note 9), pp.l5-335, who traces this trend in enlightening detail. The views of Newall (inc. his arguments regarding the 'moral effect') are expressed succinctly in a paper he wrote called, 'The Scientific and Methodical Attack of Vital Industries', (with covering note from Salmond to Sykes), 27 May 1918, in AIR 1/460/15/312/101. General informa­ tion on Newall's 41st Wing and 8th Brigade can also be found in H.A. Jones, The War in the Air, Vol. VI (note 4), pp.l22-35. 20. In particular, Sykes' grand scheme for a large postwar RAF did not accord with the wishes of the postwar government. His proposal is in From Many Angles, Appendix VII ('Memorandum b
