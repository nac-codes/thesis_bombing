Altham cited by Michael Howard in 'Men Against Fire: Expectations of War in 1914', in Steven E. Miller et at. (eds.), Military Strategy and the Origins of the First World War (Princeton: Princeton UP Press, 1991), p.11. The essay appeared originally in International Security 9/1 (Summer 1984), pp.41-57. 25. Of Haig, Tim Travers has written: 'Another underlying message in Haig's [Staff College] notes was the Clausewitzian emphasis on human nature and morale -success in war required the highest moral qualities in the Commander-in-Chief and in the army -these were the ultimate determinants of Victory.

The Killing Ground (note 23), p.87. On Trenchard's penchant for the offensive, see his memoranda on air tactics and strategy in AIR 1/522/16/12/5. See also Cooper (note 6), pp.71-81. On his loss rates, see e.g. a memo by Lt.-Col. J. Gammell to the Director of Flying Operations, 15 Oct. 1918), in AIR 1/461/15/312/107. 26.

The document is discussed inN. Jones, Origins of Strategic Bombing (note 9) pp.162-3. Michael Paris has stressed this general point too in Winged Waifare (note 1), pp.242-3. 27. See Travers (note 23), pp.250-1, who points out that H
