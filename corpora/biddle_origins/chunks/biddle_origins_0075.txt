ed an idea he called 'national attrition'. He argued that in modem, total war, 'The entire population and the whole weight of the resources and industries of the opposing nations are thrown into the balance. The success of the armies or fleets entirely depends upon the energy and "moral" of the nation supporting them.' See 'Review of the Air Situation and Strategy for the Information of the Imperial War Cabinet', 27 June 1918, repr. in Sykes, From Many Angles (note 9), pp.544-54, see esp. p.545. 34. Between 7 Dec. 1918 and 20 Jan. 1919 the British surveyed bomb damage done to target sites in Germany. The survey, which was undertaken by three intelligence officers and three other ranks under Maj. H.W.M. Paul, was submitted to the Air Ministry on 26 Feb. 1919. It was comprised of seven reports -six on specific targets, and a set of conclusions. They are found in AIR 1/1998 and AIR 1/1999. Scholars interested in the World War I bombing survey should see, in addition to the documents themselves, the pioneering work of Wise, Canadian Airmen (note II), Ch.ll; and, esp. Williams, (note 9). For details about the composition of the survey team see Williams, pp.46-48, and 337-9. 35. The Industrial Centres report claimed ' ... it may be said that the moral effect of air raids was very considerable from every point of view.' See Air 1/1998/204/273/264. The report on Chemical and Munition Center raids argued that, 'In contrast to the material damage caused by air raids, the moral effect on the workmen and others at the BASF and the Oppau works was considerable.' See AIR 1/1999/204/273/268. Frequent use was made of the word 'considerable,' although there was never an attempt to define it in the reports; one thus senses that its significance was mainly bureaucratic. 36. 'Results of Blast Furnace Raids', AIR 1/1999/204/273/269. The report on chemical and munitions factories came to a similar conclusion, pointing out that, had the raids been more frequent, the results 'might have be
