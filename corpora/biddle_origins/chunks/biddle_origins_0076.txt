ast Furnace Raids', AIR 1/1999/204/273/269. The report on chemical and munitions factories came to a similar conclusion, pointing out that, had the raids been more frequent, the results 'might have been disastrous'. See AIR 1/1999/204/273/268. 37. Maj. E. Childers, and E.N.G. Morris, 12 March 1919, in AIR 1/2115/207/56/1. The survey team (Childers, Morris, 3 draughtsmen and a photographer) was sent to Belgium on 19 Nov. 1918, and returned to Britain on 22 Dec. 38. See AIR 1/1999/204/273/268 (Chemical and Munitions), section titled, 'The General Moral Effect and Its Causes Produced by Day and Night Air Raids on the BASF'; AIR 1/1999/204/273/269 (Blast Furnaces), sections titled: 'Difficulty of Retaining Employees', and 'General Opinion of the Directors as to Our Bombing and the Effect of the Bombing of Blast Furnaces'. See also Williams (note 9), pp.348-50; and Wise (note 11 ), pp.322--4. 39.

On this general issue see Williams (note 9), who argues that 'the wartime editions of A.P. 1225 ... had firmly established an analytical precedent for the widely cited third edition of January 1920.' p.340. He argues further that A.P. 1225 (3rd ed.) was dedicated more to 'advocacy than accuracy', and explains that Maj. Boyle's staff did not produce a compreÂ­ hensive, analytical report based on 'substantive analysis of captured materials or thorough cross-checking against RAF wartime records'. See his pp.341-3. In his thesis Williams undertakes such a cross-checkin
