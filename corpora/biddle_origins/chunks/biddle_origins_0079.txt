Remarking on this era, historian Donald Cameron Watt has pointed out that socialism and Bolshevism raised the prospect that an internal threat to order and authority might justify greater concern than foreign enemies. See Watt, Too Serious a Business (note 29), p.34. 55. L.E.O. Charlton War From the Air (London: Nelson, 1935), p.173.

See for instance, 'Experiences of Bombing with the Independent Force in 1918', in 'A Selection of Essays from the Work of Officers attending the First Course at the Royal Air Force Staff College, 1922-1923', Air Publication 956, Air Ministry, Dec. 1923, in the RAP Staff College Library, Bracknell, UK. See also Allan D. English, 'The RAP Staff College and the Evolution of RAP Strategic Bombing Policy, 1922-1929', Master's Thesis, Royal Military College, Canada, 1987, and an article of the same title in Journal of Strategic Studies [hereafter JSS] 16/3 (Sept. 1993), pp.408-31. 57. The Manual continued: 'Such results are far more important than the actual physical destruction and damage caused by air bombardment and will react upon the morale of both enemy nation and its fighting forces.' See Royal Air Force War Manual, Part I - Operations, Chapter 8, A.P. 1300 (July 1928), Air Ministry, London. For the history of the Manual- and the earlier Manual of 1923-see English (note 56), pp.24-30. 58. The 'Ten Year Rule', which placed British defence planning on the assumption that 'the British Empire will not be engaged in any great war during the next ten years and that no Expeditionary Force will be required for this purpose,' was in operation from 1919 to 1932. For a detailed history of the Rule, see Appendix 1 of AIR 41/39. See also, John R
