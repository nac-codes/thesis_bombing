In a post-World War II speech to members of the US Air Force at the Air War College, Alabama, Sir Robert Saundby (formerly Dep. AOC-in-C Bomber Command, 1943-45) argued that the uncertainty caused by the disarmament negotiations 'had a devastating effect on develop­ ment of the Royal Air Force at that time' Lecture by Saundby to the Air War College, lO Nov. 1953, in the AWC file at the USAPHRC. 60. See English's critique of the Staff College entrance exam in his Master's thesis (note 56), pp.51-8. He has written: 'To ensure the new Staff College students were properly prepared for the course, they had to submit to an examination. The exam process involved the Air Ministry, with the Staff College's advice, telling the students what they had to study, examining them thoroughly, and then publishing the questions with the examiners' com­ ments. This allowed the Staff College to indoctrinate its future pupils before they even arrived ...
