ufficient data on the military situation in France, and this lead him to put forward an aim which was 'far too high and vague to form the basis of an AOC's appreciation.' See also R.

(This idea probably was influenced by the experience of air control in which the RAF had relied often on signalling instead of resorting to a lethal use of force.) 71. Historian Brian Bond has written: 'It would be impossible to prove that war fiction actually determined official policy, but there can be no doubt that some governments, notably those of Britain and France, were greatly influenced in their ordering of priorities in defence by their own and their public's obsession with air attack.' He also provides a list of popular book titles addressing the subject of attack from the air. See Bond, War and Society in Europe, 1870-1970 (NY: OUP, 1986), p.l5l. And Uri Bialer has written: 'These writings stressed especially the immense destructive capability of air bombardment. The difference between the 'professional' analysis on the impact of air attack in a future war and the "Science Fiction" of that times seems to be very small in this respect.' See Bialer's essay, 'The Danger of Bombardment from the Air and the Making of British Air Disarmament Policy 1932--4,' in War and Society, Brian Bond and Ian Roy (eds.), Vol.I (NY: Holmes and Meier, 1975), p.204. Stanley Baldwin's famous statement can be found in H of C Deb., 10 Nov. 1932, Vo\.270, co\.632. 72. To understand the many problems faced by the British during the years of rearmament, see Wesley K.
