, in Boog, Conduct of the Air War in the Second World War (note 1), esp. pp.239-40. 77. For instance, W/Cdr. R.V. Goddard of the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee (Spain), stated (at the end of a lengthy report on the air war in Spain): 'The nature of this civil war and the limitations in material and command cannot, it seems, be expected to produce military information which is wholly capable of direct application to our own problems.' See 'Visit of Air Staff Officers -General Report by Wing Commander R.V. Goddard', II March 1938, Office of Air Force (AF) History, Bolling AFB, Washington, DC, decimal no.512.04F. Similar attitudes can be found in documents contained in AIR 2/2190, AIR 2/2613, and AIR 5/1132. For an overview of this issue, see AIR 41/39, pp.333-40. 78. Smith, British Air Strategy (note 1), p.174. The document itself, dated 9 Dec. 1937, is reproduced in Webster and Frankland (note 2), Vol.IV, App. 5, pp.96-8. 79. Smith, British Air Strategy (note 1 ), pp.I73-97. 80. Ibid., pp.l89 and 194. Here I have borrowed Malcolm Smith's particularly apt phrase, 'calculated gamble'. 81. Quoted in Terraine, A Time for Courage (note 1), p.82. Terraine continues, 'Every page, almost every line, of Ludlow-Hewitt's report contradicts the image of a highly proÂ­ fessional, efficient pre-war air force with which the British comforted themselves at the time and continued to delude themselves in after years.' He points out also that as late as Aug. 1939, Ludlow-Hewitt knew that 'over 40 per cent of a force of his bombers were unable to find a target in a friendly city in broad daylight.' (p.85).
