orrow, The Great War in the Air (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Instn. Press, 1993); and Maurer Maurer, Aviation in the US Army, 1919-1939 (Washington, DC: Office of Air Force History, 1987). Key documents relating to the American effort in the air can be found in Maurer Maurer (ed.), The US Air Service in World War/, 4 vols. (Washington, DC: Office of AF History, 1978). 83. The Gorrell Plan (Nov. 1917), by Lt.Col. Edgar S. Gorrell, is repr. in Maurer (ed.), US Air Service, Vol.II, pp.l41-51. See esp. sections I, II, V and VI. (The plan was also repr. in Air Power Historian, April 1958, pp.103-13.) The reader should compare the plan with Tiverton's 'Original Paper on Objectives' (note 8) See also Tiverton's note to Capt. Vyvyan (15 Sept. 1917), in AIR 1/462/15/312/121, and finally Gorrell's note to Tiverton (5 Jan. 1918), Halsbury Papers, Box 2, RAF Museum, in which Gorrell thanked Tiverton for the use of his notes, stating: 'Your kindness is sincerely appreciated in sending these to me and your co-operation is very much appreciated.' (I am indebted to George K. Williams for enlightening me on this interesting and underappreciated connection.) 84. The claim about the Gorrell Plan was made by Gen. Laurence Kuter who taught at the Air Corps Tactical School. See Maurer, US Air Service (note 82), Vol.II, p.l41. 85. Gorrell Plan, sect.II (b), in ibid., p.l43. 86. These target centers were: (a) the DUsseldorf group, (b) the Cologne group, (c) the Mannheim group, and (d) the Saar Valley group, see the 'Gorrell Plan', sect. III, in ibid., pp.l43-4. 87.

He argued further, 'Actual experience demonstrates that the moral effect of bombing indusÂ­ trial centres will be great even though at times the material effect may be small.' See Edgar S.
