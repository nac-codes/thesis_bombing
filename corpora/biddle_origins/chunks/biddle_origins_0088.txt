orale of those troops. 96. The authors wrote: 'The effect of destroying the enemy's materiel and personnel is not commensurate with the effect gained by day bombardment in weakening the morale of troops and civilians in the bombed areas. The relation of the effect of lowering the enemy's morale over that of destruction is estimated as 20 to I.

Cook, 13 Feb. 1923, Papers of Carl Spaatz, Box 2, Diary, Library of Congress MS Room, Washington, DC. Spaatz's views were likely influenced by Billy Mitchell, who had spent time with Trenchard during World War I. See Richard G. Davis, Carl A. Spaatz and the Air War in Europe (Washington, DC: Center for Air Force History, 1993), p.17. In 1926 William C. Sherman, an instructor in Air Tactics at the US Command and General Staff School, reinforced a predominant British view of World War I strategic bombing when he argued that, 'The Germans believed that the clamor of civilians for protection would find a ready echo among the governing politicians who would force the military authorities to protect their city. The event seems fully to have justified their belief.' See his Air Warfare (NY: Ronald Press, 1926), p.211. 98. For Baker's views, see War Department Annual Reports, 1919 (Washington, DC: GPO, 1920), pp.68-75. Baker felt that 'the aerial bombardment of back areas and inland cities' ought to ruled out 'upon the most elemental ethical and humanitarian grounds.' (p.70). And he was unimpressed with air attacks on cities, arguing that they 'had no appreciable effect upon the war-making power of either nation'. (p.68). 99.
