Kuter argued: 'Where the objective is a large industrial center, individual bombers must hit specific buildings or areas or the mission may be a failure ... It is thus evident that the destruction of materiel objectives - the reason for the existence or our arm -depends on the ability of bombardment to hit small targets.' See 'Bombing Probabilities', p.2. 116. See 'Program of Instruction, Air Corps Tactical School, 1933-1934, Command and Staff Regular Course, USAFHRC, decimal file no.248.192, and 'Comparison of Courses', Air Corps Tactical School, I July 1934, decimal file no.248.192, AFHRC. On 24 Oct. 1935 Lt. Col. E.L. Hoffman wrote to the Commandant of the School, asking to be exempted from the riding requirement. He argued: 'I have never liked a horse, nor admired one, except at a safe distance ... I am afraid of a horse, do not understand them, and doubt if they have any sense ... I fail to see that horses have any place in the science of aviation.' His request was denied. See 'Equitation', Memo to the Cmndt. from Lt.Col. E.L. Hoffman, 24 Oct. 1935, USAFHRC decimal file no.248.126. 117. On this see Greer (note 103), pp.55-8. 118. C.L. Chennault, 'The Role .of Defensive Pursuit,' (1933), p.l2. USAFHRC, decimal no.248-282-4. On Chennault's views generally, see Greer (note 103), pp.58--67, and Johnson (note I 00), pp.400--2. 119. He quoted the umpire of the official exercises of 1931 as declaring that, 'due to increased speeds and limitless space it is impossible for fighters to intercept bombers and therefore it is inconsistent with the employment of air force to develop fighters'. Cited in Greer (note 103), p.59. 120. Greer (note 103), pp.59 and 82. See also Johnson (note 100), who points out that Chennault, who focused on defensive operations, proved uninterested in involving himself with the question of long-range escort fighters, pp.40 1-2. 121.
