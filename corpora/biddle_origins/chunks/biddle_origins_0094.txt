re not optimistic about the prospects. Believing that the Germans would disperse their aircraft to numerous aero­ dromes, they could not see a way to reduce the enemy force efficiently, or without subject­ ing Bomber Command to heavy losses. Bomber Command itself agreed with the Air Staff assessment. The second plan listed, an attack on German military rail, canal, and road communications in the early stages of a war (W A4) was designed as a way of offering some help to future allies on the continent. But the Air Staff was lukewarm about this too, as they were not anxious to place a significant portion of Bomber Command under the Army C-in-C. See Webster and Frankland (note 2), vol.I, pp.94-7.
