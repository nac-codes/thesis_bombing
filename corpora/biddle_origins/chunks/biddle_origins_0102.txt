See Letter, Harris to Portal, 21 Oct. 1942, Portal Papers, Folder 9C (copy at Nat. Def. HQ, Canada). 174. The relevant correspondence can be found in the Portal Papers, Folder IOC (copies at the Nat. Def. HQ, Canada.) On this dispute, see also Webster and Frankland (note 2), Vol.III, pp.75-94; and Max Hastings, Bomber Command (NY: Dial Press, 1979), pp.385-8. 175. See, e.g., the correspondence between Lord Salisbury and the Secretary of State for Air, Archibald Sinclair, over the bombing of Berlin, in the papers of Arthur Harris, Folder H79, RAF Museum, Hendon (copies at Nat. Def. HQ, Canada). In general see also Garrett, Ethics and Air Power in World War II (note I). 176. Letter, Harris to Under Secretary of State, Air Ministry (Arthur Street), 25 Oct. 1943, in AIR 14/843. 177. Here it is useful to point out that the Allied ground advance caused night-fighter bases to be lost, and the early warning system to be overrun. See Frankland (note 162), p.86. 178. This argument was suggested in Webster and Frankland (note 2), Vol.III, pp.241-3. 179.

Bomber Command (note 174), p.388. 180. In recent years this has been an important topic in American literature on strategic bombÂ­ ing. See Schaffer, Wings of Judgment; Sherry, The Rise of American Air Power; and Crane Bombs, Cities, and Civilians (all note 2). For an earlier but still useful study, see Gary Shandroff, 'The Evolution of Area Bombing in American Doctrine and Practice,' PhD thesis, New York Univ., 1972. 181. Marshalling yards normally were within the centre of cities, and they were a target bombed frequently in poor weather conditions. On the
