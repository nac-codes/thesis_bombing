Portal, not one to shrink from the prime minister’s tempests, pointed out that Churchill’s own rhetoric and decisions to date had all relied on the strategic air arm—if not to win the war on its own, at least to help prepare the continent for an allied ground invasion. He defended the RAF scheme and then challenged Churchill directly: “We could, for ex- ample, return to the conception of defeating Germany with the army as the primary offensive weapon.” Knowing that Churchill would find this  distasteful, he continued, “I must point out with the utmost emphasis that in that event we should require an air force composed quite differ- ently from that which we are now creating.
