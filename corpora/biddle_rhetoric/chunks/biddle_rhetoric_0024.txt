ber Offensive” of 1943-45, detailing the sometimes desperate Anglo-American quest to make bombing into an effective tool of war against Germany, and how this quest ultimately led to the kind of aerial onslaught both predicted and deeply feared in the interwar years. This chapter also covers the American strategic bombing campaign in Japan—a campaign that, though an extension of the trajectory of strategic bombing begun in the early part of the century, also began a new chapter in the history of warfare through its climax at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Chapter 5 ends by examining the many contested claims about Anglo-American strate- gic bombing in World War Il. In the conclusion, I bring together the main themes of the narrative and suggest ways in which they influenced thinking about air warfare in the second half of the twentieth century.  CHAPTER ONE  The Beginning: Strategic Bombing in the First World War  Tue history of strategic bombing in the twentieth century is a history of the tension between imagined possibilities and technical realities. In seeking the roots of this tension, it is necessary to turn to World War I, where combat aircraft made their first serious appearance in both tacti- cal and strategic roles—from short-range battlefield reconnaissance to long-distance bombing of enemy cities. In the end, tactical aviation re- ceived a fuller test than did strategic flying: the latter’s demands on plane and pilot were more onerous, and armies, unsurprisingly, priori- tized their tactical forces since they were of greater immediate use to the war effort. The result was that, by 1918, strategic bombing had re- ceived only a brief trial. Because its possibilities seemed far-reaching, however, this experience left a legacy with an important impact on post- war thinking; it formed a foundation for extrapolation, speculation, and zealous advocacy.’ But the perception and interpretation of the ex- perience itself had been shaped by expectation.
