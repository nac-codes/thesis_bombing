ies of various sorts.’ In 1670, Jesuit monk Fran- cesco Lana produced an important treatise with two chapters on the “Aerial Ship.” While he believed his theoretical machine to be viable, he warned that God might not allow such a ship to be successful, “since it would create many disturbances in the civil and political governments of mankind.”* The successful balloon ascents of the Montgolfier brothers and Jacques Charles in 1783 inspired an outpouring of imag- ination driven by a growing faith in the promise of science and technol- ogy; this manifested itself in prints and engravings depicting great flying ships dropping their deadly ordnance on those below. The emerging industrial revolution encouraged even more daring leaps. In Britain, where the people had been aroused to fear of invasion during Napo- leon’s continental successes, a rash of war speculation appeared in print and prose.S  Even after the invasion tide had ebbed, concerns over air warfare continued. In his poem “Locksley Hall” (1842), Lord Tennyson “dipp’d into the future, far as human eye could see,” and postulated a “ghastly dew” raining from the heavens as “the nations’ airy navies” grappled in “the central blue.”* Just one year later, British inventor Samuel Alfred ‘Warner sought to interest British officials in his balloon called the “long range,” which, he argued, could ascend, travel to a point, and release its bombs on a target “with accuracy and mystery,” thus enabling a com- mander to destroy forts and towns, and spread consternation among both troops and civilians. Twenty years later, Henry Tracy Coxwell con- templated a kind of “ghastly dew” when he sent a letter to the Army and Navy Gazette suggesting that balloons might drop chemical agents designed to cause “stupefication” of enemy populations. Jules Verne’s widely read novel Clipper of the Clouds (1886) asserted that the future belonged to aerial warfare machines.”  As scientific progress continued, notions of air war were modernized
