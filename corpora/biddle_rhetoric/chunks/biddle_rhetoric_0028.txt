Odell’s The Last War; Or, Triumph of the English Tongue, published in 1898, English-speaking peoples win their final battle against inferior races via an air force that rains incendiary bombs down upon the enemy. In the end, the English speakers impose the English language and the “customs of civilization” on the “ignorant and savage inhabitants” of Russia and Asia. Roy Nor- ton’s 1907 story The Vanishing Fleets imagined American scientists de- vising radioactive weapons to cope with a sneak attack by the Japanese, who were aided by communists operating within the United States.'*  The fertile mind of H.

Air war brings catastrophe as bombers destroy the very fabric of modern civilization, leaving chaos, famine, and political upheaval in their wake. Wells speculated that urban populations already weakened by the war’s dislocations would, upon the appearance of an air fleet, fall victim to “civil conflict and passionate disorder.”"  From its outset, aviation was “a very public technology” in England.” Some military writers of the early twentieth century denounced popular speculation on the topic, expressing concern over the deleterious impact on the public mind of unrestrained imaginings about aircraft.
