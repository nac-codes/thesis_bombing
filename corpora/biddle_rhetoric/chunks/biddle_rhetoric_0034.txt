Lt. Gen. Baden-Powell (founder of the Boy Scout movement) made a vigorous call to arms in the Daily Mail on 13 July. Indeed, first-hand witnessing of Germany’s airship mania helped prompt David Lloyd George to propose the formation of a coalition govern- ment in England—a government designed to bring unity and national purpose in the face to unprecedented external and domestic worries. “There were ominous clouds gathering over the Continent of Europe and perceptibly thickening” he later wrote in his memoirs. “The subma- rine and the Zeppelin indicated a possible challenge to the invincibility of our defence.”* The mass-circulation press raised the profile of the preparedness issue, and stirred popular passions by serving as an outlet for invasion stories and scare literature.
