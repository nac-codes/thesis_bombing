The next day Northcliffe made good on his offer, presenting the Frenchman with a check for £1,000. His newspaper drew characteristically dramatic con- clusions: “British insularity has vanished. We would not be understood to say that in a few weeks or months hordes of aeroplanes will follow where M. Bleriot has led, but his example has shown the way. . . . The British people have hitherto dwelt secure in their islands. . . .
