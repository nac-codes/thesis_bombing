major war might see the “explosion of those volcanic forces which underlie every modern democracy,” and urged that “unless steps are taken to prevent the hardships of war pressing intolerably upon the new working classes, the whole organized political power of labour may be used to demand the cessation of the war, even at the price of submission to our enemies.” Later that month, Col. W. G. Simpson discussed “The Du- ties of Local Authorities in Wartime.” Commenting on his remarks, the chair of the session, Major-General Dickson, argued, “During any Great  STRATEGIC BOMBING IN WWI 19  ‘War there is certain to be danger, in a densely populated country like Britain, arising from the miseries of the poorer classes, especially in the manufacturing districts.”*” And in an April 1914 lecture, Col.

In 1849, during an Italian revolt against the Austrian Hapsburgs, Venice became the first city to be bombarded from the air, by projectiles carried by small linen and paper balloons. These seemed to have little if any impact on the defenders, even though the Austrian press made exaggerated claims about the “frightful effects” of the new weapons.” Just over sixty years later, the Italians scored another famous first when they sent airplanes and dirigibles to Libya during the Italo- Turkish war of 1911-12. Since many nations scrutinized this war as a testing ground for new weapons, it drew the attention of the world press; indeed, a wide range of publications sought to glean “lessons” from the Italian experience for the benefit of their own military organi- zations.” Perhaps because of aviation’s dramatic hold
