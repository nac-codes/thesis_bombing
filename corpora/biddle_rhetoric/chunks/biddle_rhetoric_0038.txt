ld press; indeed, a wide range of publications sought to glean “lessons” from the Italian experience for the benefit of their own military organi- zations.” Perhaps because of aviation’s dramatic hold on the public imagination, some observers seemed predisposed to view its contribu- tion as revolutionary. The Times (London) correspondent remarked ef- fusively that “it is already clear that no nation can afford to go to war with a marked inferiority in aerial strength.”*  Italian bombing efforts were unsystematic—mainly pilots dropping small bombs arbitrarily over the sides of their planes. Nonetheless, a headline in Italy’s Gazzetta del Popolo, printed after the initial raid, exclaimed that the bombs had scattered the “terrorized Turks.”* The Italians seemed convinced of the psychological impact of the bombing; less subjective observers also were prepared to argue that even though the bombs had virtually no physical impact, they had produced a dis- cernible moral effect." The editors of Scientific American followed up this line of thinking in their commentary on aviation in the Balkan wars of 1912-13. In an article called “Bomb Dropping in the Balkans,” they argued that “the importance of aeroplane bombs lies in their moral effect—in the impression created that the machine in the sky is a real source of danger.”** This rhetoric reflected the dramatic effect that air- planes could induce when they appeared over battlefields and caused ground troops to feel trapped and vulnerable—an effect that would be seen again later in the century. But the rhetoric also reflected expecta- tions embedded deep in the history of speculation over air bombard- ment, and reinforced by prevailing notions of the supremacy of psycho-  20 CHAPTER1  logical factors in war and of the fate of civilians in future conflicts. With regard to aerial bombing, the moral effect would soon take on a life of its own.  THE OPENING ROUNDS: ZEPPELINS OVER BRITAIN, 1914418  Because interested nations graspe
