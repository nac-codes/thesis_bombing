Fighter aircraft with greatly improved climb speeds, anti-airship weapons such as incendiary bullets and flechettes, more and better anti-aircraft guns with high explosive shells, and an improved defense communications network were now taking a substantial toll on the attackers. In particular, the British used signals intelligence to good effect.” On the night of 23-24 September, Germany’s Imperial Navy lost two of its newest airships; on 1-2 Octo- ber, another of the great ships went down along with one of Germany’s most expert commanders, Heinrich Mathy. Though the airship cam- paign would continue sporadically to the end of the war, it never again posed a serious threat to Britain: “the newest and most marvelous prod- ucts of Friedrichshafen were reduced to tangled piles of junk smoulder- ing in the fields around London.”®  By the end of the war, zeppelins had dropped some 6,000 bombs (a total weight of under 500,000 pounds) on Britain, causing 556 deaths and 1,357 wounded. British citizens generally received little public warning that a zeppelin raid might be imminent; nor were they given much information about the results of the raids in their daily news-  STRATEGIC BOMBING IN WWI 23  papers. The authorities were concerned that air raid warnings would cause panic and, in particular, a loss of production in the factories so vital to the prosecution of total war.
