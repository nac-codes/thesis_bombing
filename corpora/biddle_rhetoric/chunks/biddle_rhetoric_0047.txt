Would not the general will to resist vanish, and what use would be the still determined fractions of the nation, without organization and central direction?”® In this way, the experience of the zeppelin raids would help to sow seeds of dramatic speculation and extrapolation in the 1920s and 1930s. And, in this speculation, anger tended to be conflated with panic.  DEVELOPMENTS ON THE CONTINENT: 1914-18  While lighter-than-air craft were the focus of attention over British skies, on the continent heavier-than-air craft were directed more and more frequently beyond the battlefield. French bombing theory had as- sumed that a war effort was an integrated whole: air forces were to cooperate with ground forces, eroding the enemy’s will and capability at all levels. French long-range bombing missions to industrial targets therefore were not thought of as “independent” operations. In general, continental military organizations had to think in terms of their armies first; victory in war—and, indeed, political survival—had, for them, al- ways rested on ground warfare. Equipped with Voisin aircraft, the early French bomber squadrons strove to extend the reach of French offen- sive power; by mid-1915 there were over 120 aircraft able to prosecute long-distance attacks on German industrial assets in the Rhine and Saar valleys. Pilots departed for their destinations individually, picking their way across country and taking their chances against enemy defenses. Initial bombing methods were crude and inaccurate.”  The French sought to identify those industrial sites key to the German war effort, including the Badische Anilin und Sodafabrik of Ludwigs- hafen, manufacturer of poison gas and explosives. By late summer of 1915, however, German fighters were taking an increasingly heavy toll on French b
