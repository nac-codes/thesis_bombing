senior officers (few junior offi- cers were willing to risk airing their views), no charges of wrongdoing were leveled.* In a widely read account of the war written shortly after the armistice, the noted British journalist Sir Philip Gibbs was sharply critical of Trenchard’s style, which he argued wasted life needlessly. Sir Frederick Sykes later claimed that Trenchard “had been an exponent of the battering-ram tactics beloved by G.H.Q.”** But Sir Walter Raleigh and H. A. Jones, official historians commissioned by the Air Ministry, came to Trenchard’s defense. Though Jones admitted, “It may be said perhaps with truth that the offensive patrols were too much a matter of routine, that their direction and co-ordination were not always suffi- ciently characterized by an alert imagination,” he nonetheless supported Trenchard, largely by arguing that since the army had chosen to take an aggressively offensive stance, its air arm could do no less."  STRATEGIC BOMBING IN WWI 29  Whatever the realities of the situation or the debates that ensued over it, the main point is simply that Trenchard firmly believed that his tac- tics were correct, and incorporated them into the foundational body of British air theory—with important consequences both during and after the war. Throughout 1917 and 1918, British wartime aviation would remain devoted to the primary task of maintaining a continual air of- fensive over the western front. Indeed, Trenchard’s offensive tactical posture had so defined the nature of British wartime aviation that it would continue unaltered, even as its heavy demand for aircraft helped compromise British strategic bombing efforts commanded, ironically, by Trenchard himself in 1918.”  ‘THE GOTHA / GIANT RAIDS AND THEIR IMPACT  In the end, the RFC was not afforded the luxury of keeping its entire focus on land battles. German aviation—specifically long-range, heav- ier-than-air bombers—would compel changes, leading to a reorganiza- tion of the British military
