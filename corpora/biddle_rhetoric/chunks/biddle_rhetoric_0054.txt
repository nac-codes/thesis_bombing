the luxury of keeping its entire focus on land battles. German aviation—specifically long-range, heav- ier-than-air bombers—would compel changes, leading to a reorganiza- tion of the British military. Besides their immediate impact on the Brit- ish war effort, these developments ultimately would have long-lasting consequences for the island nation.  From the beginning of the war, the Germans had been engaged in an effort to develop and produce a long-range bomber. Their work came to fruition when specially designed Gotha, and later, Giant, bombers (Riesenflugzeuge or R-planes) were positioned in Flanders to wage ae- rial attacks on Britain. Both were technological marvels for their time, indeed, the Giant’s 138-foot wing-span was scarcely shorter than that of a World War II B-29 bomber. As with the zeppelin raids, the Germans not only hoped that the bomber offensive would cause both material and psychological damage; they also gambled that these raids, along with unrestricted submarine warfare, might help break the war’s dead- lock. In July 1917, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenberg pointed out to the chancellor (Bethmann-Hollweg), “The military advantages are great. They keep a large amount of war material away from the French front and destroy important enemy establishments of various kinds.”**  Though the aircraft could carry only a fraction of a zeppelin’s bombload, they were faster, more maneuverable, and able to attack in daylight.” German bomber raids on Britain commenced on 25 May 1917 against Folkestone and Shorncliffe, followed by attacks on Lon- don on 13 June and 7 July. The people of Folkestone had images of air war seared into their memories in a particularly traumatic way. A hand- ful of German bombers appeared overhead on a bright and otherwise calm spring day; the bombs they dropped killed 95 people and injured  30 CHAPTER1  another 195. Only one German plane was shot down by the seventy- four British fighters attempting to engage the intruders. Short
