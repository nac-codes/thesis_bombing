ceived the raid as a spectacle second to none.” In the United States, the Literary Digest cited British sources claiming that, “in the majority of our fellows we believe the evidence before us shows de- meanor to have been unimpeachable, and to augur well for whatever days of trial may yet be in store.” But if the British were not in the throes of panic, they were not complacent either. News coverage made it clear that in the aftermath of the second attack, Londoners were more indignant than ever about poor defenses, inadequate warning, and the dearth of retaliatory efforts. A key story in the Times (London) of 9 July stated that British anger was provoked “because the enemy squadron had got away unscathed.” The author added, “The attack was carried out with such confidence—‘impudence’ was the popular word among the people—that one got the impression that the Germans despised our defenses.”"” Opinion leaders, even those generally inclined toward moderation in war, began to take a hard line. The Reverend Bernard Snell, Chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, preached in Brixton that the British people should no longer practice “patience, self-control and good behaviour” while its citizens were slaughtered at home."  Another gathering of Londoners at Tower Hill produced a telling message for delivery to the King: “Thousands of Londoners appeal to your Majesty to instruct your Ministers at once to make rigorous and continual air attacks on German towns and cities as reprisals for the murder of civilians—men, women, and children, even infants at their school desks—and if your Ministers do not take steps to protect us we implore your Majesty to dissolve Parliament and appoint Ministers who will do their duty. Failing any other solution we suggest the revival by Royal license of Letters of Mark granting the right to privateers of the air to carry havoc and destruction as reprisals into Germany.”'* Popu- lar anger again found an outlet in daily newspaper
