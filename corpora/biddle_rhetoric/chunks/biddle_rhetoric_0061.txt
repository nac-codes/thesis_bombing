Many in their ranks feared that the creation of an independent third service would waste resources or divert them to sideshows. Neither Trenchard nor Haig, for instance, was the least bit enthusiastic about the Smuts Report. Committed to the primacy of the western front, Trenchard believed that the RFC existed to further Haig’s ground cam- paign. In a letter of 30 August 1917, he complained that the idea that the war could be won in the air alone was “bare assertion.” And he argued that an independent Air Ministry, susceptible to “popular and factional clamour,” could “lose its sense of proportion” and be drawn “toward the spectacular” at the expense of providing essential support to the older services."
