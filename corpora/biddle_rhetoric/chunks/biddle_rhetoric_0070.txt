scernable. Admiral Kerr argued that bombs missing factory tar- gets would often hit workers’ dwellings and thus reduce output indi- rectly: “If [workers] houses are hit it produces panic and lowers the production.”"* Though Tiverton was mainly interested in destroying German factories and works, he understood that bombing would have a concomitant “moral” effect. He advocated daylight bombing over night bombing because in daytime workers in factories would feel more ex- posed than at night in their own homes." In considering the bombing of chemical factories, Tiverton recognized that fires started could spread beyond the control of local fire brigades, precipitating effects out of proportion to the damage actually done by the immediate effect of the bombs.  When the IF ultimately commenced operations with a much smaller complement of aircraft than had been anticipated for it, the Air Staff realized that inflicting material damage would be problematic, and a temporary change of priority would be warranted. Under the circum- stances, it seemed expedient to hope for a maximum moral effect. This philosophy applied as well to the force, then in development, of large four-engine Handley Page V/1500s designed to range all over Germany from bases in Britain.“ A planning paper addressing the V/1500s ar- gued, “It appears certain that this machine cannot be produced in suffi- ciently large numbers this year to obtain decisive results against the root munitions industries. It is therefore apparent that the best value can be obtained by aiming at the maximum moral and political results.” *”  To quantify and incorporate moral effect as an operational goal, Ti- verton defined it as anything “which hinders the German output of mu- nitions, apart from actual material damage done to works.” In a grim foreshadowing of World War II, he requested from air intelligence a “list of towns and works which specialize in workmen’s dwellings, such dwellings therefore forming a reasonable target
