such obstacles as “high wind and cloud over the Rhine Valley,” he highlighted a few long-distance raids against Stuttgart, Mannheim, Zweibrucken, and Rottweil. Many of these raids involved only a handful of bombers, however. Though Trenchard em- phasized the numbers of bombs dropped, claiming that “shooting has, as a rule, been good,” actual achievements remained ambiguous."* The aircraft available to Trenchard suffered frequently from engine troubles, including broken valve springs (in the unreliable DH9 machines), and overheating (in the Handley Page 0/400s). He requested replacement engines for the DH9s, but the process was slow. In addition, training in  42 CHAPTER1  map reading was not up to the needs of long-range bomber pilots. And in the field it was no small task, even for experienced airmen, to read large maps in cramped, windswept, frequently dark cockpits."”  Similarly, target-finding and bomb-sighting capabilities were very crude: pilots had only a random chance of hitting their intended targets, and those on the ground could rarely discern what pilots were aiming at when they released their bombs. The bombsights on DH9s, for instance, had to be calibrated before the aircraft left the ground. Frequently the prevailing winds over the target were not what had been predicted three hours earlier and one hundred miles away. And, often, oil from the engines would partly or wholly obscure the bombsight view by the time a pilot reached the destination. DH9s were slow and had a ceiling of only 14,000 feet with bombs; they were dangerously less capable than the DH4s they were intended to replace. The carefully chosen and vague phrases employed by the official historian of the air campaign are revealing in this respect. Jones explained that between October 1917 and November 1918, 76 percent of the airplanes sent out bombed “some objective.” (Fourteen percent returned due to engine trouble and 10 percent due to poor weather.) Of the 76 percent dropping bombs, 55.5
