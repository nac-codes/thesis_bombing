STRATEGIC BOMBING IN WWI 43  1918, Trenchard devoted to the railways, respectively, 55 percent, 46 percent, and 31 percent of the total bombs dropped by the IF. And he argued that he had no choice but to attack enemy airdromes to reduce the threat to his own forces. By September more than 83 percent of total IF attacks were directed at railways and airdromes.'* His extensive use of the IF for tactical purposes greatly frustrated members of the London Air Staff who believed that, despite the difficulties, he had more targeting flexibility than he let on. In September the Air Staff’s Director of Flying Operations, Brig. Gen. P.R.C. Groves, submitted a critical re- view of the work of the Independent Force during its first three months. He pointed out that Trenchard’s attacks on priority targets had declined drastically: for instance, attacks on chemical factories had gone from constituting 14 percent of the total bombings in June to only 8 percent in August. Attacks on iron and steel works had shown a similar trend.'* On the other hand, the percentage of attacks on enemy airdromes had risen dramatically from June to August. While he left the latter alone (granting that only the field commander could judge what kind of coun- teroffensive was required), Groves argued that the number of attacks on railway objectives was indefensible since “every effort should be made to concentrate upon root industries, since to carry out the destruction of these industries is the object for which the Independent Force was created.”  Like Groves, Sykes sharply criticized Trenchard at the time for re- maining too tactically oriented, and later (in his memoirs) complained that Trenchard “allowed the independent air force to be diverted in attacking purely military objectives of minor importance in the army zone.”"* By midsummer, Sykes had revealed his own views and aspira- tions in an ambitious, forward-looking planning paper titled, “Review of Air Situation and Strategy for the Informati
