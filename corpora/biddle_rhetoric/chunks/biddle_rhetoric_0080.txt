ade by his predecessors in the RNAS and RFC." Over time the RNAS had relied increasingly on the moral effect as a way of justifying the existence of No. 3 (Luxeuil) Wing, and this tendency reached its climax when the unit was under pressure to disband and transfer its assets to the army. An excerpt of a letter from a German factory man- ager claiming that he could no longer give his clients firm delivery dates because of wartime disruption and aerial bombing was translated by the Admiralty into an assertion that Allied raids “have caused panic among the workmen, and they refuse to carry on their work. Nearly all of them have cancelled their agreements, fearing for the safety of their lives on account of the Allies’ machines.” Likewise Newall had stressed moral effect as a primary achievement of the Eighth Brigade’s work.  The ubiquitous phrase made sense to an audience that accepted it unquestioningly. In 1916 a brief essay in The Spectator had explained that the term “moral” (pronounced with the accent on the second sylla- ble) is “on the lips of everyone.” The author traced the term to the French (and noted that the British often misspell it by placing an “e” on the end).'** For Trenchard, asserting the primacy of the moral effect mollified public opinion and permitted him to deal effectively with the press. In general, vaguely articulated pilots’ claims—‘considerable damage appears to have been done”—formed the heart of many field dispatches, and, subsequently, many official statements on air activities." And Trenchard relied on the phrase in interviews. An article in the Daily Mail of 21 September 1918, for instance, highlighted the work of the IF in support of the American advance at St. Mihiel, and ended with a description of a raid (of 16-17 September) against Frankfurt, in which  46 CHAPTER1  it was claimed that the attack—carried out by only one bomber—had killed 120 persons and left the Opera House a “heap of ruins.” Inter- viewed for the story, Trenchard
