ch, and the part most often quoted because it articulated Trenchard’s overall approach. “The question I had to decide,” Trenchard wrote, “was how to use this Force in order to achieve the object, i.e., the break-down of the German Army in Germany, its Government, and the crippling of its sources of supply.” He asserted that he had but two choices: the first, to deliver “a sus- tained and continuous attack on one large centre after another until  48 CHAPTER1  each centre was destroyed”; and the second, to attack “as many of the large industrial centres as it was possible to reach with the machines at [his] disposal.” He chose the second, arguing that it was the only course open to him based on the resources available."  Trenchard asserted that such widely dispersed attacks had not squan- dered resources since attacking “as many centres as could be reached” enhanced “the moral effect” and insured that “no town felt safe”; in- deed, he argued, the enemy required “continued and thorough defensive measures” so as “to protect the many different localities over which my force was operating.” And he added, “At present the moral effect of bombing stands undoubtedly to the material effect in a proportion of 20 to 1, and therefore it was necessary to create the greatest moral effect possible.” It was a curious statement. If he had faith in his own mathematics, then bombing for moral effect would have been the most efficient strategy no matter how many bombers were available. There is no evidence, however, that Trenchard had thought through the full im- plications of his asserted rationale. The ratio itself (20 to 1) had no scientific or mathematical basis. Trenchard used numbers liberally but never based them on anything except his own hunches."* Emphasizing the moral effect in this instance was wholly consistent with his use of the phrase in summaries and press releases sent out during the course of the fighting: he argued that his long-range raids (no matter how dis- persed
