and ser- vices whose complete interdependence and working together is neces- sary for efficiency. No one arm alone can bring about complete vic- tory.”** Mitchell’s main task was to control the air over the battlefield. This led him naturally to emphasize what Americans termed “pursuit” (fighter) aircraft. The American command influence reached its peak in the late summer and early autumn of 1918 when, at St. Mihiel, Mitchell controlled a great conjunction of British, French, and Ameri- can forces, which placed nearly 1,500 planes under his direction.  STRATEGIC BOMBING IN WWI 53  His bombers were best suited to tactical work, so he used them against those targets he felt would have the greatest impact on the ground battle, including depots, ammunition dumps, and railway heads in the enemy’s rear. Mitchell soon learned that it was costly to send bombers over enemy territory in small formations. Indeed, during the St. Mihiel campaign, American attacks on German targets ten to twenty kilometers behind enemy lines resulted in such high casualties that Mitchell felt compelled to use escorts regularly during the [later] Meuse- Argonne offensive. He learned also that when escort aircraft were tied too closely to the bombers, losses ran at a prohibitive level (of nearly 60 percent). Results were far better (falling to only about 8 percent) when escorts freely engaged enemy fighters. Mitchell staged his largest bomb- ing attack on 9 October 1918, sending 200 day bombers and 100 fighters against German troop concentrations.”* Throughout the cam- paigns Mitchell felt the impact of production problems at home. These failures, combined with high loss rates, meant that aircraft were always in short supply. On 26 September 1918, 646 airplanes could be counted in the U.S. effort; on 15 October there were 579. At the armistice, U.S. aviators had available only 457 airplanes.” Nonetheless, Mitchell be- lieved that his stress on concentration protected American troops by dispersing
