alled for a new policy, and he argued that the Germans and the Allies had both come to understand the promise held out by aerial bombing. He felt though that the Germans were gaining the upper hand, and might suc- cessfully pursue, in 1918, a day and night bombing offensive designed to “wreck” Allied commercial centers. The only solution, he believed, was a counteroffensive of greater weight.”* “The object of strategical bombing,” he wrote, is “to drop aerial bombs upon the commercial centers and lines of communication in such quantities as will wreck the points aimed at and cut off the necessary supplies without which the armies in the field cannot exist.”** Like Tiverton before him, he empha- sized that the output of enemy war matériel depended on a relatively small number of factories producing key components.*” By singling out  STRATEGIC BOMBING IN WWI 55  those, he believed, one could quickly alter the entire course of the war. In the body of the plan, Gorrell adopted Tiverton’s four geographical target groups—Diisseldorf, Cologne, Mannheim, and the Saar Valley— around which were clustered Germany's main manufacturing and in- dustrial centers. He also echoed Tiverton’s staunch advocacy of sus- tained (night and day) mass attacks against single targets with the aim of completely destroying them,?*  In his introduction, Gorrell cautioned that any German air offensive would have not only direct physical effects, but also a moral effect on civilians.” Later in the paper he included Tiverton’s prediction that pro- longed Allied bombardment against a German target might cause a breakdown of order, and other consequences disproportionate to the immediate effects of its bombs. Gorrell owed his commitment to the moral effect of bombing to Trenchard as well as Tiverton, however. His essay called “The Future Role of American Bombardment Aviation,” written some months after he had completed his November “Plan,” in- corporated significant segments of Trenchard’s November 19
