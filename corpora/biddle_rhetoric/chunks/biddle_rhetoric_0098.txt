armi- stice (from the perspective of the airmen) foreclosed Air Service hopes for postwar autonomy. General Pershing devoted few words and little praise to the role of the Air Service when he wrote up his final report on the war." A general review of AEF participation in the war, undertaken in the spring of 1919 at the request of Pershing, was convened under Maj. Gen. Joseph T. Dickman. It predictably concluded that aerial oper- ations to support troops showed more potential than independent ini- tiatives. Gen. Mason Patrick, who had served as Chief of the Air Ser- vice, AEF, noted that observation remained the key job of an air force; bombing distant factories was, at best, a “luxury.”*’ Thus was the American debate on long-range bombing muted—but only temporarily. Writing retrospectively—during a similarly acute period for the institu- tional future of the air arm—the official historians of the United States Army Air Forces in the Second World War hypothesized, “Had the [First World] War lasted long enough to provide the Air Service with some experience in a bombardment program conceived independently of the movements of ground armies, its postwar history might have been far different.” How different is hard to say, however. Lack of operational experience and interservice antipathy ultimately did not  STRATEGIC BOMBING IN WWI 57  prevent the development of a detailed, indigenous concept of indepen- dent, long-range bombing. That concept would mature gradually and, though it would never gain acceptance by the army hierarchy prior to ‘World War II, it would win staunch adherents and advocates.  THE POSTWAR ASSESSMENTS  Curious to see what impact aerial bombing had had on the enemy, the British sent a small team of investigators, under the direction of Major H.W.M. Paul, to examine and evaluate the “material damage done” and the “moral effect caused” by British bombing, and to examine the defensive measures employed by the Germans. They assessed not only the work of
