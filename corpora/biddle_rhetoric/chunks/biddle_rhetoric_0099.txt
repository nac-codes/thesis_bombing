to examine and evaluate the “material damage done” and the “moral effect caused” by British bombing, and to examine the defensive measures employed by the Germans. They assessed not only the work of the IF, but also that of the RNAS’s No. 3 Wing and New- all’s 41st Wing (later Eighth Brigade). Their reports on various target sets were sent to the Air Ministry on 26 February 1919." In addition, a smaller survey of bomb damage in Belgium was undertaken in November- December 1918.2” Subsequently, in January 1920, the Air Ministry is- sued a publication, A.P. 1225 (Air Publication 1225), titled, “Results of Air Raids on Germany Carried out by the 8th Brigade and Independent Force.” It was produced by a staff headed by Major A. R. Boyle, who had been responsible for producing two wartime assessments—also des- ignated A.P. 1225—analyzing the progress of British bombing. The ear- lier editions were published in August and October 1918.2" The Ameri- cans also arranged for a team to investigate bombing. Undertaken as part of Lieutenant Colonel Gorrell’s effort to put together a history of the Air Service, AEF, the work had as its mandate to secure “as com- plete and reliable information as possible upon which the Air Service may base its future bombing plans.”** The investigators were, like the British, to seek out evidence of material and moral effect. The work of the Americans, discussed below, was done independently of British efforts.  The British Survey  ‘Two principal conclusions were articulated in the original British field survey. The first was that the material damage done to the German war economy generally had been small; the second was that the “moral effect” of bombing had been “considerable.” The first inescapably fol- lowed from physical investigation, but the second, less amenable to em- pirical analysis, could be established only through less direct means— usually interviews and interrogations of factory owners.
