ect of bombing. Indeed, the sig- nificance attached to this idea would increase during the interwar years as British aviators contemplated the air campaigns of the future. But the British survey members were prepared to go even further, giving a wide and dramatic interpretation to moral effect that took the idea beyond calculations of lost work-hours and stretched it, dubiously at times, into the realm of speculation. They argued that the stress caused by air raid alarms had important consequences. Of raids on the BASF, the survey team explained, “In contrast to the material damage caused by air raids, the moral effect on the workmen and others at the BASF and the Oppau Works, was considerable.” They argued that the mood had intensified when bombs hit workmen’s housing in March 1918, and that, over the summer, the effects of a “general state of nervousness,” especially among the women and children, became apparent.”* In the same report, the authors argued that while balloon barrages and the construction of dugouts raised the morale of the German workers somewhat, “even these did not prevent continual alarms which caused great confusion throughout the works and intense nervousness in the workmen’s dwell- ings.” In reference to the workers, the survey authors were prepared to make the extreme claim that “constant alarms and raids ruined their nerves, in some cases for life.” With reference to the foundries at Bur- bach and Hagondange, the survey team explained that during the fre- quent alarms of 1918, “war-weariness and undernourishment” were felt and rendered men “less able and willing to work their best” under the trying conditions. They concluded with the bold but unverifiable predic- tion: “Had the war continued a few months longer, a more or less total breakdown of labour at several of the Works might have been confi- dently expected.”  Not infrequently the survey team had to confront evidence that un- dermined the case they sought to make. For instance, German
