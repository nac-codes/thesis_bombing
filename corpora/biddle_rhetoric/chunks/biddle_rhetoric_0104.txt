tence of civil defense efforts also served as evidence for the British of the fact that their bombing had caused German authorities to attend to the protec- tion of their population.  Word choices made by investigators injected ambiguity into their re- ports. For example, they repeatedly described the moral effect (and, in one instance, material effect) of bombing as “considerable,” without further useful explanation. In addition, speculation and extrapolation were regular features of the reports: their wording frequently dwelt more on what might have happened (had the bombing continued) than on actual consequences. For example, the survey of bomb damage in Belgium, headed by Maj. Erskine Childers, initially conceded that the bombing in Belgium had been “at best a secondary and very imperfect method of attack.” But the report nonetheless asserted that “with the progress in air science that seems likely to continue, it will be possible in a few years .. . for a powerful military nation . . . to obliterate cities in a night and produce the stunning moral effect necessary to victory.”*”  While investigators certainly saw indirect effects of bombing as real and important, there can be little question that they gave them so much play because evidence of the direct, material effect of bombing was thin. Investigators sent out specifically to assess bombing results would have had little desire to contradict official assertions that had been made publicly for some time. Further, they would have been keenly aware that scarce resources had been expended in strategic bombing, and that British lives had been lost in the prosecution of the campaign. Even if only subtle or subliminal, pressure to justify the effort certainly would have existed and would have been felt by those responsible for report- ing the results of the surveys. Under these circumstances, their flights into extrapolation are, perhaps, unsurprising.  STRATEGIC BOMBING IN WWI 61  The two wartime versions of A.P.
