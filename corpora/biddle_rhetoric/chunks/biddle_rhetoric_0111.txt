s repeated references to it indicate that it was accepted as a sig- nificant, integral element of aerial bombardment. The report on Co- blenz stated for instance that, “everyone interviewed [was] of the opin- ion that the morale of the people was very much shaken by air raids, and the chief engineer at the railroad station stated that the efficiency of his employees was greatly impaired.””* Such explicit attention high- lighted the concept and extended its influence into future studies.  Like the British, the Americans portrayed civilian workers as subject to nervous strain under bombardment; indeed, the U.S. survey sug- gested that women were particularly vulnerable and prone to hysteria." Perhaps the most dramatic statement regarding the moral effect was included in the report on Metz, where it was argued that bombing “had a tremendous effect upon the morale of the workers and civilians,” and “a crew of 250 civilians as well as several hundred soldiers were kept on hand to repair the damage from bombs.” Extrapolating in a manner  STRATEGIC BOMBING IN WWI 65  similar to the British team, the authors concluded that if the bombing had continued “a month or so longer, it would have been impossible to keep employees at their duty.”** But the American survey also made clear that when workers were exposed to consistently dangerous condi- tions, they frequently could be mollified by increased wages—and this step was necessary only on rare occasions. Most workers stayed on the job, and, when required, proceeded to shelters in an orderly fashion. Officials at Burbach claimed, for instance, that “[t]he workmen main- tained a fairly good working standard in the factory and many were glad when an alert was signalled because it meant a loaf for a while.” Similarly, officials at the Meister Lucius works claimed that their em- ployees were “most loyal,” and put “their best efforts into their work at all times.”  When civilians (other than factory workers) were considered as a sep
