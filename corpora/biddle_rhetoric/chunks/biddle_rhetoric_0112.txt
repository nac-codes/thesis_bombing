Meister Lucius works claimed that their em- ployees were “most loyal,” and put “their best efforts into their work at all times.”  When civilians (other than factory workers) were considered as a sep- arate category, the reported results were similarly inconclusive. At Diiren, where one raid (on 1 August 1918) had caused thirty deaths, it was reported that “the German population consider the attack on the unfortified town of Diiren an outrage and there is no doubt but that the morale of the people was greatly lowered and later alerts nearly caused panics.” The Thionville report argued that while the morale of the peo- ple had generally held up well, it “rapidly dropped” toward the end of the war when the bombing became heavy, “and the mental strain under which the people labored seemed to have been enormous.” The bur- gomaster of Ehrang said that the raids had a great effect on the people of the area, causing nervous breakdowns, calls for a cessation of hostili- ties, and agitation for a ban on the bombing of towns. The concluding section of the survey argued that during one raid against Ehrang, three people had died from fright. On the other hand, the survey report on Cologne (which had been said to suffer a decline in factory worker morale) claimed generally that “[t]he moral effect on the people was rather insignificant,” and added that “the people were in general quite stoical, the feeling being that Cologne was a fortified city and the Allies had a right to bomb it. After the first raid, the people became quite resigned.”*” Bonn was bombed for the first time on 31 October 1918. If its people were aware of raids in other towns they did not seem to be terribly worried about them: it was reported that the people “would not take shelter during alerts.”*"  ‘As would be discovered again in the Second World War, the cause and effect relationship between bombing and civilian morale was com- plex and not conducive to ready generalization. The public reaction to bombing
