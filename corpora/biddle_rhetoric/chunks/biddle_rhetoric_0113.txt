discovered again in the Second World War, the cause and effect relationship between bombing and civilian morale was com- plex and not conducive to ready generalization. The public reaction to bombing might vary a great deal according to local circumstances and, in particular, the degree to which the population felt the government  66 CHAPTER 1  was making efforts on its behalf, And popular anger and indignation could be mistaken for panic, even if there was no clear evidence of the latter.  The conclusions of the American investigators were compiled in a final “Narrative Summary,” which included the main observations sa- lient to the Allied effort. Some of these paralleled British observations, including an emphasis on German production losses due to both raids and alerts. In the subsection titled “Moral Effect,” the authors ringingly declared, “It is certain that air raids had a tremendous effect on the morale of the entire people.” With reference to the German air defense system, they asserted, “The enormous expense of maintaining balloon barrages, home defense flights, and anti-aircraft artillery must be an indication that the material was needed as well as that the popular clamor for protection was great.”*”  But the conclusions of the American survey did not completely coin- cide with those of the British survey. Indeed, in the subsection of the Summary called “Criticisms of Bombing in the Present War,” the Ameri- cans took issue with the British—that is, Trenchard’s—operational ap- proach. Making a point in common with the Air Staff in London, the Americans claimed that the greatest failing of British bombing was that it was inefficient, suffering from “the lack of a predetermined program carefully calculated to destroy by successive raids those industries most vital in maintaining Germany's fighting forces.” The U.S. survey further stated, “Evidence of this is seen in the wide area over which the bomb- ing took place as well as the failure of crippling, beyo
