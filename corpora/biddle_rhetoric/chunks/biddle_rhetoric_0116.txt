come the American canon on strategic bombardment.””*  ee  While there had been no consensus on the role that aircraft might play in war prior to 1914, there had been a good deal of speculation— particularly on the potential role of aerial bombers. These were used in the war, and while they remained on the margins of overall national effort, they nonetheless captured public and governmental attention. The limited experience of bombing—and of being bombed—would provide the foundation on which speculation about future air wars would come to rest. In Britain, that experience was interpreted in a context that highlighted prewar concerns and anxieties about the ro-  68 CHAPTER 1  bustness of national polities, particularly urban working classes, at war. And the interpretation was shaped in accordance with the predilections and views of a particular individual—Trenchard—and the institutional needs of the service he would head after the war. This would cast a long and important shadow over the RAF’s interwar years.  The Americans were little more than observers in this early phase of air warfare, but their interpretations of World War I strategic bombing would come to matter as they assumed an increasing role in world af- fairs and ultimately prepared to fight the Axis powers. They borrowed heavily from the British, but they also applied their own analysis to what they observed, emerging with a set of ideas that was in certain respects hostile to the Trenchardian view. Significantly, however, both British and American airmen believed that long-range bombing could be used to important effect in war, and that modern industrial nations had exploitable weaknesses and vulnerabilities (in large part because of their complexity and interdependence). The next two chapters will examine how these ideas evolved in the context of the turbulent 1920s and 1930s, how they interacted with public expectation, and how they influ- enced national defense policies on both sides of the Atlantic
