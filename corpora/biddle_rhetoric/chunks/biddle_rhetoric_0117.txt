how these ideas evolved in the context of the turbulent 1920s and 1930s, how they interacted with public expectation, and how they influ- enced national defense policies on both sides of the Atlantic  CHAPTER TWO  Britain in the Interwar Years  IN the aftermath of the war, the young RAF faced an immediate fight for its institutional life. Though it survived, it had to articulate an ongo- ing raison d’étre as a separate service. This requirement had the effect of elevating the role of strategic bombing above other tasks, and compel- ling the RAF’s leadership to continue protecting its wartime bombing record in the exaggerated terms that Trenchard had employed in his own defense. Aggressive arguments for the continued existence of an independent air force helped establish a pattern of exaggeration that ultimately would help to create a gap between RAF declaratory policy and its actual capabilities. In addition, Trenchardian policy was vague; it lacked clear guidance, particularly on questions of targeting. Public articulations of RAF thought worried the other services, and fostered popular expectations about air warfare that would prove, ultimately, self-deterring for Britain. As a new war approached, RAF leaders would struggle to close the divide between rhetoric and reality by figuring out—in ways that Trenchard had not—how actually to plan and wage a major strategic air campaign.  The chapter necessarily begins with a further examination and elab- oration of two important and related ideas from the World War I expe- rience that would strongly influence British interwar thinking about strategic bombardment: the theory of the offensive and the “moral ef- fect” of bombing. Indeed, they would prove central to RAF planning and decision making in the 1920s and 1930s.  ‘THE OFFENSIVE THEORY OF AIR POWER  Trenchard attached great weight to offensive tactics, embracing the con- viction that air war must be guided foremost by a commitment to the “relentless and incessant off
