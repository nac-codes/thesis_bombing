an early postwar paper titled “Air Superiority” argued, “An enemy air offensive more intensive than our own must be met by re- newed efforts on our part. Never must a defensive role be forced upon us.”* Once Trenchard had drawn particular lessons from his Somme experience and had committed himself to these publicly, it was natural that he would remain largely consistent in his views even as he applied them to a new realm.‘ But the application of an offensive posture to tactical and strategic aviation would pose different problems. With re- gard to long-range bombing, the key question was how to fly deep into enemy airspace repeatedly, without suffering prohibitive losses in the face of enemy defenses.  During World War I, the underdeveloped state of communication be- tween air and ground often worked to the advantage of enemy bombers. Fighter scouts had to fly sweeps over large areas in the hope of finding bombers—a practice that was difficult in the daytime, and doubly diffi- cult at night. This made it possible, though risky, for bombers to oper- ate without escorts to defend them. While at the helm of the Indepen- dent Force, Trenchard became well aware of the threats to his bomber force. His earliest conceptions for a long-range force, articulated in 1917, had envisioned a need for fighter escorts and for self-defending bombers.‘ In his negotiations with Lord Weir over command of the IF, Trenchard addressed the requirement for “fighter types of aircraft” to enable bombers “to carry out their work properly.” In taking up his new job as General-Officer-Commanding (GOC), IF, however, Trench- ard was reluctant to divert too many fighters to the IF from RFC units, and so requested only that he be given a future claim on aircraft allotted to the Expeditionary Force. By the time of the armistice, however, Tren-  BRITAIN IN INTERWAR YEARS 71  chard had only one fighter squadron attached to the IF. Existing aircraft were tied up with the ongoing German offensive, and co
