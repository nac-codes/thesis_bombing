World War, aviation author J. M. Spaight recalled Trenchard once telling him that “ten bombers can be made to do the work of thirty, or of a hundred. All that is needed is to send them in again and again.” Elaborating on Trenchard’s views, Spaight wrote, “And it is not the destruction of life of property which the bombers cause that matters; it is the destruction of morale, the disturbance of life, the dislocation of routine. The moral effect is far more important than the material. Keep on raiding: that is the right strategy in the air, according to the Trenchard school.”"® Such a strategy presumes, of course, that sufficient bombers survive—or that adequate replacements will be forthcoming.  As the first postwar Chief of Air Staff, Trenchard could insure that his ideas received attention. The RAF’s January 1921 paper “Air Power and National Security” argued that “in the offensive lies the surest de- fence, and it will be necessary to carry the war into the enemy’s country, to attack his aerodromes, factories, military and naval establishments and generally force upon him a defensive role.” By 1924, Air Staff doc- uments were beginning to argue that it was more effective to launch an immediate bombing offensive against vital centers than to bother with  72 CHAPTER 2  initial counterforce attacks on the enemy air force." A determination to seize the initiative and force upon the enemy “a defensive role” became the Air Staff’s cardinal objective. While this had organizational benefits, it also reflected the interpretation of past experience.  Trenchard and his colleagues had been heartened by their perception (articulated in the bombing surveys) that IF efforts, even though largely without apparent material result, had caused German industrial facili- ties to issue repeated air raid alarms. In this they saw important indirect effects (a major component of the phrase “moral effects”): widespread inefficiencies and loss of production caused by the threat of imminent b
