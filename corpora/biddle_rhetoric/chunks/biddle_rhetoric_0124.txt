loss to the critical offensive aspect of the war effort. In fact, the wartime experience had traced only the very steep, initial portion of a diminishing marginal returns curve. The relationship between defenders needed and attackers faced is sharply nonlinear: defenders require a certain number of aircraft simply to cover the relevant airspace, even if few bombers attack—the require- ment is driven more by the area to be defended than the size of the attack. Hence a small attack still requires a relatively large defense to defeat it. But once defenders have deployed enough fighters to make it likely that any given raid will be intercepted, further increases in bomber fleets do not much increase the number of fighters needed to defeat them. All air forces discovered this in the Second World War, but by 1918 none had seen more than small raids, and thus all they had observed were the needs of defending against small attacks, which seemed disproportionate.  Trenchard adamantly insisted that an air force simply could not af- ford to surrender voluntarily the strategic initiative, and therein start down the slippery (and inevitable) slope to defeat. In language that echoed his Edwardian mindset and training, he emphasized national character, declaring that the aim was the destruction of the enemy’s will power: “The one that stood it longest would win. . . . If we could keep going longer than the enemy, that was where we would score. It was not a matter of mathematical calculation.”"* Here Trenchard downplayed analysis—not to mention the often staggering losses endured by his own forces in wartime—in favor of exhortation. But his argument nonetheless would help to form a foundation on which a significant piece of the RAF’s interwar declaratory policy would come to rest.  74 CHAPTER 2  The lessons drawn from World War I experience were attempts to make sense of perceived reality. But they, too, were selective and prob- lematical."’ The need to put a positive face on Brit
