CHAPTER 2  The lessons drawn from World War I experience were attempts to make sense of perceived reality. But they, too, were selective and prob- lematical."’ The need to put a positive face on British bombing results caused a greater emphasis to be placed on “indirect effects” than was warranted. Limited feedback, rudimentary methods of analysis, and or- ganizational interests contributed to the problem. A more systematic and detailed look at the effects of bombing and its costs might have helped clarify the picture, setting up a better basis for future planning. Certainly the British raids had imposed a defensive cost on Germany and compelled nontrivial investments in air defense. In the end, though, the damage and disruption caused by air raids in Germany lowered output and production only marginally, and the temporary deficits often could be quickly recouped by those bombed.  Another factor complicating interpretations of wartime experience was the tendency (in some RAF circles, among certain popular writers, and among the public at large) to overemphasize the impact of early zeppelin and Gotha raids and, conversely, to deemphasize the outcomes of later raids. To be overly impressed by initial experience and to mini- mize subsequent information that diverges from it is a common cogni- tive error. Once a particular interpretation of an event has taken hold, new information bearing on it will not have the same impact it would have had earlier.’* In this case, the early raids were an indelible trauma that could not be wholly erased by subsequent events. The early zep- pelin and Gotha raids, when the British were caught unprepared, man- aged to inflict damage disproportionate to the size of German resources committed. And the lucky shot later on, such as the direct hit on the Odhams Printing Works in 1918, helped perpetuate the perception that British defenses were somewhere between inadequate and futile.”  But with respect to both zeppelin and Gotha/Giant raids,
