ly in this particular realm. Many in the RAF felt it was essential to do the kind of mathematical calculation that Trenchard eschewed: to find the ideal proportion of fighters and bombers that would both facilitate an aerial offensive and enable the homefront to hold out in the meantime. This meant that home air defense was never neglected in the interwar RAF; in fact, it would develop successfully— albeit out of the limelight—through the interwar years.” If he had to compromise on this issue, however, Trenchard did what he could to insure that RAF public proclamations strongly emphasized an offensive posture. This was a way of maximizing both the organizational strength of the RAF and the deterrent value of aircraft, but it had some problem- atical ramifications. First, it implied that victory corollated mainly with an immediate, all-out air offensive. And second, it helped to encourage an environment in which the fallacy that the bomber “will always get through” could thrive.  These ideas were particularly consequential when combined with fears of future air war, and official interwar civil defense planning as- sessments. (As early as 1922 Lord Balfour was issuing dire predictions that a continental enemy could drop on London “a continuous torrent of high explosives at the rate of seventy-five tons a day for an indefinite period.”) In the early 1920s, the Air Staff claimed that in a future war involving attacks on Britain, one could assume fifty casualties per ton of bombs dropped. But this multiplier was highly problematical because of the error-laden way in which it was derived from the World War I expe- rience. Richard Titmuss, official historian of Britain’s World War II so- cial policy, explained, “This simple and easily remembered multiplier soon acquired a validity to which, in statistical theory and for other reasons, it was hardly entitled.”” The Air Staff's math went largely un- questioned even though there were plenty of grounds for questioning it, and
