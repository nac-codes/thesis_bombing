population possessed weaknesses and vulnerabilities, they needed only to be less than the enemy’s. Trenchard had to be able to argue that the British, despite inherent weaknesses, would not suc- cumb first. Here he relied on the relative qualities of the British com- pared to other European states, and an insistence that British leaders be prepared to dedicate themselves with incomparable determination to an early, large-scale air assault.  For the enemy state’s civilian population, being “thrown” onto the defensive would come about mainly through the cumulative “moral ef- fect” of being bombed: popular fear, disillusion, and demoralization leading to lost work hours, lowered production, and, ultimately, per- haps, political upheaval. These were the national-level parallels to the battlefield moral effect felt by soldiers and groups of soldiers in war. Expectations about the moral effect had been, as we have seen, imbed- ded in the prewar literature on air power, and were repeatedly articu- lated during the war itself. But perhaps the reason the idea was deeply rooted and broadly accepted was because it seemed intuitive. The pros- pect of aerial bombardment aroused in many a primal fear of total vul- nerability: there would be no shelter, no refuge from the worst ravages of technology. When combined with the apparently commonsense ex- trapolation that air forces would grow in size and that chemical weap- ons (gas) would form part of the future arsenal of long-range bombers, the fear became particularly potent.  BRITAIN IN INTERWAR YEARS 77  By emphasizing moral effect during the war and in his final dispatch, Trenchard exploited a phrase already well understood in his social and cultural milieu, and firmly established in the professional context in which he worked and fought.” In his 1916 memorandum on the pri- macy of an offensive posture in the air, he wrote, “[T]he moral effect produced by a hostile aeroplane . . . is all out of proportion to the dam- age which
