uments are available to any researcher willing to delve even briefly into Air Staff documents of the early postwar years.**  Hewing to Trenchard’s line, the Committee of Imperial Defence’s first committee on Air Raid Precautions concluded in 1924 that the moral effect of bombing in a future war will be “out of all proportion greater” than the physical consequences.** Writing later about such committee conclusions, official historian Richard Titmuss argued, “[I]t seems sometimes to have been accepted almost as a matter of course that widespead neuroses and panic would ensue.” Yet he found that this conclusion rested on assumption rather than analysis: “In sifting the many thousands of papers, which passed through Governmental agen- cies during the nineteen-twenties and nineteen-thirties, it is difficult to find even a hint that this fear of a collapse in morale was based on much else than instinctive opinion.” And he added that the evidence, such as it was, had been passed through “a dense and reduplicated veil of human interpretation.” Among the details sometimes cited were the number of people sheltering in the tubes during 1917-18, the work stoppages among the railways, and the number of industrial work hours lost due to air raids. But there was little systematic evaluation of what had actually taken place during the war. The consistently dire prog- nostications of the interwar years, he argued perceptively, could not be understood “if divorced from the public temper and the time when they were written.”””  Like its emphasis on the “offensive,” the RAF’s focus on the moral effect would have important long-term consequences. Trenchard be- lieved that material effect would be necessary (at least initially) to pro- voke a moral effect, but he elevated the latter, arguing specifically that it was the more important of the two consequences of long-range bomb- ing. This was problematic because it downplayed the fact that bombing designed to maximize the material effect
