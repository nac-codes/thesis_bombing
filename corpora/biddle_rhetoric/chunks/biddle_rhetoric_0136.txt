specifically that it was the more important of the two consequences of long-range bomb- ing. This was problematic because it downplayed the fact that bombing designed to maximize the material effect would not necessarily require the same operational approach as bombing designed to maximize moral effects. Also, the emphasis on the moral effect tended to make bombing seem a simpler enterprise than it really was, since it implied that it might be enough for bombers merely to get in the vicinity of their tar- gets. If air raid alarms were virtually as important as raids themselves, then the operational details of bombing accurately probably did not matter all that much: it might be enough for bombers simply to trigger lots of alarms. This helped remove incentives for close, sustained atten- tion to targeting and navigation. Finally, the RAF’s rhetorical reliance on the prospect of causing enemy collapse helped contribute to domes- tic popular anxiety about air power and long-range bombardment.  BRITAIN IN INTERWAR YEARS 81  With the Trenchardian theory of aerial offensive, the RAF had to walk a fine line between deterring the enemy and frightening the domestic pol- ity into a state of self-deterrence. If this could be done in the 1920s when there was no terribly serious air threat on the horizon, it was far more difficult to do in the 1930s when such a threat appeared in abrupt and ominous form.  ‘THE RAF’s EARLY POSTWAR YEARS  The early years after the war held challenges for all three services in Britain as they coped with demobilization, the return to a peacetime footing, and the requirement for a new conceptualization of British grand strategy. In 1919, Winston Churchill took over the dual post of Minister for War and Air. Though he chose to keep Air as a separate service, he found Sykes’s plans for the postwar RAF too grandiose and expensive; instead, he prevailed upon Trenchard to oversee a smaller force. It was indeed ironic, in view of Trenchard’s earlier antip
