A March 1924 memorandum argued that even though the “lessons of military history” seemed to call  86 CHAPTER 2  for a preliminary attack on the enemy force, the Air Staff did not share this view. More efficient would be a direct attack on “military objectives in populated areas” with “the object of obtaining a decision by the moral effect which such attacks will produce, and by the serious dis- location of the normal life of the country.” Since long-range, self- defending bombers were essential to this overriding task, the Trenchar- dian document argued (in purposefully vague terms): “it may be stated as a principle that the bombing squadrons should be as numerous as possible and the fighters as few as popular opinion and the necessity for defending vital objectives will permit.”®  In the course of events, production of the fifty-two-squadron force fell behind schedule; and when the “French threat” had abated in light of the 1925 Locarno Treaties, the leverage of the economizers in the Treasury grew.
