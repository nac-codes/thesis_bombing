of the cabinet, Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill was able to impose economies on the services in 1925. Trenchard helped Churchill attack the navy in order to further his own agenda for the RAK, but the ultimate result was not as he had hoped or planned. In arguing that the RAF should be the keystone of British defense, he alienated the older services even more, and, in provoking a new round of interservice struggles, Trenchard “helped the exchequer create a change in strategic principles,” which ultimately worked to his disadvantage. The Treasury argued that it should rationalize the competing claims of the services in their bid for budgets; it argued, as well, that finance was a more important compo- nent of power than military strength. The date for the completion of the fifty-two-squadron program was moved again, to 1935.* Since fighters were cheaper and easier to build, they were produced at a faster rate than bombers. Indeed, only by 1928 did the RAF have more bombers than fighters; even in 1934 the figure was twelve fighter squadrons to fifteen bomber squadrons.  In the late 1920s the lack of an enemy on the horizon seemed to obviate any governmental sense of urgency for defense expenditure. The RAF turned its attention back to the immediate tasks at hand, including air control of colonial territories and the need to serve as a general imperial air reserve behind Britain’s extra-European air forces. Central to the latter role was the Defense of India Plan, which from 1929 on- ward called for the dispatch of bomber and fighter squadrons to aid the army in operations against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and the northern frontiers of India. These roles put a premium on the existence  BRITAIN IN INTERWAR YEARS 87  of versatile, easily serviced aircraft able to operate in primitive condi- tions—a requirement also amenable to Treasury wishes since it offered the maximum number of aircraft for the least money. The result was a concentration of light
