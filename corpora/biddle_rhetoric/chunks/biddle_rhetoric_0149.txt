he existence of the enemy air force, and of concentrating on the attack of those objectives, the destruction of which would best achieve his aim, was fully justified by the results.””’ In his analysis of the 1931 exercises, Maj. C. C. Turner tried to grapple with some of the problems of assessment and interpretation of a staged operation. He explained, “Of the 112 bombers detailed for the exercises, it was judged that 84 were destroyed in the three days’ operations. This may or may not be a sound estimate; but, after all, the crux of the matter is the amount of damage they would have inflicted on London and London’s nerves.” In the opening section of his essay, he pointed out that the  BRITAIN IN INTERWAR YEARS 91  exercises were important not only for the RAF, but also for the British people: “Air exercises of the kind now under discussion imply attacks on cities, and if disastrous panic—possibly from small cause—is to be averted, measures must be taken in peace time to instruct civilians, to organize protective measures, and to ensure discipline.””*  Although air officers understood that the exercises were artificial and that their result—to some degree—could be open to interpretation, their perception was guided by some general assumptions: that Britain would outdo its enemy in terms of commitment to a swift and relentless offensive; that enemy morale could be made to break under such pres- sure; and that bombers flying at night, at high altitude, or on instru- ments through cloud would more than hold their own against fighters. Developments in bomber speeds and altitudes in the early 1930s legit- imately bolstered their views: some exercises testing new techniques and models bore this out, and, in the 1934 exercises there was a 10 percent dip in interception rates across the board. But the slide was reversed a year later when (despite exercise rules tilted against fighters, and bombers flying at twice the altitude of earlier exercises) 79 percent of the 110 raid
