ngly risky in the age of mechanization and ever more com- plex methods of warfare—all of which demanded analysis and calcula- tion. Brooke-Popham, the first commandant of the Staff College, cau- tioned that regarding air warfare, “it is impossible to be so definite on the correct method of procedure as it is in the case of operations at sea or on land.” Arguing that air tactics and air strategy necessitate “extreme flexibility,” he advised his listeners to focus on the future, and warned them against limiting their thinking “to the range of mate- rial at our disposal today.”® A later commandant of the Staff College, Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt, admonished students in 1928 against becoming “dogmatic.” After explaining that in war there are “no universal re- medies—no panaceas,” he went on to warn against “being impressed too much by the actual letter and figure of our calculations” and de- veloping “a habit of mind which calculates results purely in mathe- matical terms.”*  Though writing about the First World War, H. A. Jones captured something fundamental about the interwar tendencies of British military organizations when he wrote that “the British character inclines to the taking of a sporting chance in preference to making fussy and appar- ently endless preparations for something which may never happen.”*' While it is clearly the case that not all operational details of wartime practice can be worked out in advance, it is clearly the case, too, that a modern military organization is best served by trying to work out as many as possible.  If Ludlow-Hewitt was wary of peacetime calculation, he nonetheless embraced certain general principles. Continuing in the tradition of Trenchard, he argued, “The demoralising effect of air bombardment is exceptionally high compared to its destructive effect.” While he ruled out “terrorizing the enemy civilian population,” he nonetheless ac- cepted that the “demoralising force should be applied where it will have the quickest and most de
