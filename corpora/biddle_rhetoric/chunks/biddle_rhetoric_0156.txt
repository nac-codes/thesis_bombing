l districts over which you pass. You know Lord Trenchard’s slogan ‘keep the Germans out of bed, keep the syrens blowing,’ and there is the devil of a lot in it.”  The idea that one could “throw” the enemy on the defensive also depended crucially upon the enemy population being vulnerable, or—at least—more vulnerable than one’s own population in a head-on offen- sive contest.” But this Trenchardian conception only made sense in a world in which bombers could penetrate successfully enough to bring about the desired effect. The RAF War Manual, published in July 1928, argued that “the wide space of the air and the condition of cloud and wind confers unique powers of evasion on the attacking aircraft and renders their timely interception uncertain.” It argued further that “the defenders cannot be said to possess absolute stopping powers, and can- not altogether prevent the attackers reaching their objective if the attack is made with sufficient determination [emphasis added].”*  Downplaying escort fighters, Trenchard believed that if enemy de- fenses became a problem, they should be handled by offensive tech- niques. The War Manual read, “When, owing to the strength of the hostile defence, the casualties caused by enemy fighters become exces- sive, the remedy should first be sought in the improvement of the fight- ing efficiency and fire effect of the bomber formations themselves, rather than in the provision of escorts.” Evasive techniques were em- phasized, including flying at high altitude, use of cloud cover, avoidance of routine, cooperation between operating squadrons, and the use of feints.” In his May 1928 memorandum to the Chiefs of Staff, Trenchard stressed that the effects seen in the Great War would only be redoubled in a future war “with greater numbers of aircraft, the larger carrying capacity and range, and the heavier bombs available.”  After reading Trenchard’s memorandum, both the Chief of the Impe- rial General Staff (Milne) and the Chief of the Naval
