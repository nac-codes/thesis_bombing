To heartfelt applause, Commandant of the College, P. B. Joubert de la Ferte toasted him: “We owe our existence as a service to Lord Trenchard; we could not owe more.”* In the view of those gathered, Trenchard had been responsible for preserving RAF autonomy, and thus deserved the ser- vice’s gratitude and praise. From a bureaucratic point of view, Tren- chard had been a great success: his positions and rhetoric had encom- passed and promoted a vision of air war that had advanced the RAF’s organizational needs. But his long-term legacy would be decidedly more mixed.  The ideas laid out by Trenchard in 1928 were left largely intact through the early 1930s.

In a lecture titled “The Employment of Air Forces in War,” he argued that air power allowed for “the direct application of pressure to the enemy people without any defeat of their armed forces,” and that successful attack on the “weaker components” of a nation’s fighting strength, in- cluding its “moral qualities” could “bring the whole edifice crumbling down.?™  Even though Trenchardian rhetoric persisted, it remained less than limpid. Trenchard once admitted, “I am not good at writing.

An avoidance of analytical rigor, com- bined with rhetorical flexibility designed to serve organizational needs, had left behind p
