ce and for defense if deterrence failed. Sir Freder- ick Sykes, who was responsible for civil aviation after the war, wrote of great aerial armadas that would aim at the heartland of their enemy in future wars. And by 1925 Churchill himself wrote of aerial attacks on civilians by bombers carrying gas and other chemicals. Other noted fig- ures, including Lord Balfour, Gen. Sir Frederick Maurice, Sir Sefton Brancker, Lord Salisbury, Sir Maurice Hankey, and Anthony Eden advo- cated for air power—and warned of the consequences of being left be- hind in that realm—during the 1920s.'*  In his Reformation of War (1923), J.F.C. Fuller postulated that aerial bombing of cities, especially with gas, would be a notable feature of future wars. In 1925, Capt. B. H. Liddell Hart published what would become a deeply influential book, Paris, or the Future of War. It ex- plored means by which an enemy nation could be subdued, not by deadly frontal assaults on armies, but by locating and exploiting na- tional weak points. Taking his cue from Paris of the Trojan War, who shot an arrow into Achilles’ heel, Liddell Hart sought a strategy of modern warfare that would exploit “moral factors.” He argued that an enemy people can be subdued by “dislocating their normal life” to such a degree that they will have no choice but to surrender."® He explained that aircraft provided “boundless possibilities” for striking immediately “at the seat of the opposing will and policy.” Using a metaphor from  BRITAIN IN INTERWAR YEARS 105  biology, he explained that “a nation’s nerve-system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops, is now laid bare to attack, and, like the human. nerves, the progress of civilization has rendered it far more sensitive than in earlier and more primitive times.” Liddell Hart prophesied that, with its 990 airplanes, France could drop a greater weight of bombs on London in one day than the Germans dropped during the entire course of World War I—and could repeat the dose at
