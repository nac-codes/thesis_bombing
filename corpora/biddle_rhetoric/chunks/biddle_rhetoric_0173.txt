known for his unflappability and objectivity, the report he oversaw incorporated (from Air Ministry estimates) an assessment that a future war might bring some 350 tons of bombs down on London in the first forty-eight hours, and 100 tons per day thereafter for a month. The Committee—again following the lead of the Air Ministry—put only limited faith in de- fense; it recommended partial evacuation of the city so as to minimize panic, chaos, and confusion. Conversations with Trenchard led commit- tee members to conclude, pessimistically, that the only course open to them was to continue their investigations “with a view to mitigating, so far as possible, the evils attendant upon aerial bombardment.” Regard- ing public morale, they wrote, “It has been borne upon us that in the  BRITAIN IN INTERWAR YEARS 105  biology, he explained that “a nation’s nerve-system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops, is now laid bare to attack, and, like the human nerves, the progress of civilization has rendered it far more sensitive than in earlier and more primitive times.” Liddell Hart prophesied that, with its 990 airplanes, France could drop a greater weight of bombs on London in one day than the Germans dropped during the entire course of World War I—and could repeat the dose at “frequent and brief intervals.”"* He hypothesized that future weapons and deliv- ery systems would be vastly more accurate and powerful than the “primitive instruments” of 1915-18. Indeed, he postulated that a state with superior air power could deliver to its enemy a blow so powerful as to paralyze its “nerve system” within a few hours or, at most, days."**  Paris, placed on the RAF list of recommended reading and highly touted by Trenchard, was written when the Red Scare—an aftershock of the Russian Revolution—still had much of Europe in its grip. Liddell Hart’s argument assumed the intolerance of the civilian population for disruption of their normal routines. Disruption would lead to chaos, part
