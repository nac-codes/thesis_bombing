stated that the next war would be the end of civilization in Europe: “[T]he raging peoples of every country, torn with passion, suffering and horror, would wipe out every government in Europe” and would leave anarchy in their wake.'* When, in the spring of 1932, the government gave serious considera- tion to a Foreign Office plan to prohibit aerial bombing of the territory and shipping of another sovereign state, the Air Ministry redoubled its efforts to stave off a bomber ban. They argued that, so long as aircraft existed, no agreement could prevent Britain from being attacked by air in a future war; and they strongly implied that such attack—which would be all but inevitable—would involve heavy casualties. The only answer to it, they argued (unsurprisingly), was counterattack; fighters alone could not secure London. The Coast Defence Subcommittee of the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID)—which did not include the First Sea Lord or the Chief of the Imperial General Staff—was impres- sed by Air Ministry arguments and endorsed the RAF view.’ Shortly afterward an even more radical plan for air disarmament, drawn up by Stanley Baldwin, was presented to a specially appointed cabinet com- mittee. Sympathetic toward, but concerned about, Air Ministry argu- ments, the full cabinet recommended that Baldwin’s plan become the basis of informal negotiations with the French. In the meantime, the Americans interjected a dramatic but problematic proposal that mainly had the effect of disrupting the Anglo-French discussions. By mid- summer Britain’s efforts were stymied. Despite the government's sincere commitment to air disarmament, it never managed to devise a workable policy. The dilemmas raised by the potential wartime conversion of civil aviation proved particularly resistant to solution, and there was no con- sensus on how to constrain bomber operations in war. The deliberations finally succumbed to the German demand for an air force equal to that of the other European pow
