The deliberations finally succumbed to the German demand for an air force equal to that of the other European powers; the negotiations were effectively over when the Germans withdrew from the talks in October 1933. Still, the British continued doggedly to seek, right up to1939, a way to head off the “knock-out blow” through international deliberations.'* Throughout those years there was no shortage of dire predictions re- garding air warfare—not just in fiction but in scholarly accounts as well. Former RAF officer L.E.O. Charlton’s 1935 book, War from the Air (developed from a series of lectures he gave at Cambridge), argued that since air defense was essentially futile, a future air war would be “like a team competition in a shooting gallery.”"* Charlton, who had been Britain’s Air attaché to the United States, foresaw a war in which railway yards, docks, and market centers would be “drenched with gas,” and power stations would be attacked with high explosive bombs,  BRITAIN IN INTERWAR YEARS 109  creating, in the dark shelter of the London Underground, “an interlude of blind panic” that “will beggar description.” He was particularly exercised over the likely behavior of Britain’s working classes, explain- ing that it would be the “labouring masses, herded in the discomfort of overcrowded, antiquated dwellings in congested districts, themselves the most difficult people to control (factory employees in particular), who will be more susceptible than most to dismay and stampede when the air-raid warning goes.”  Two years later, Frank Morison took a less dramatic tone in his book War on Great Cities. He argued that gas was not something that gov- ernments would employ lightly.
