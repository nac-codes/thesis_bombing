that Hitler would develop strength rationally, and in depth (rather than in the “shop window”). This assessment reflected the Air Ministry’s own concern for efficiency, as well as assumptions about the German national character. In a failure to understand the political dynamics inside Germany at the time, Air Staff members assumed that the Germans would follow a deliberate, measured rearmament pattern designed to create an effective military force with adequate spares and reserves. The Foreign Office, which was more alarmed by the situation, did not concur with the Air Staff's approach. Having failed to bring about disarmament, they sought to create a strong but nonprovocative deterrent. Foreign Office leaders—particularly Sir Robert Vansittart-— criticized what they perceived to be the inwardly focused attitude of CAS Sir Edward Ellington and his deputy Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt. But Ellington and Ludlow-Hewitt wanted to avoid being pressured into cre- ating an air force of readily available but probably inadequate types, backed by insufficient reserves." Reflecting back on this tension many years later, Sir John Slessor would admit that the Air Staff should have used Vansittart and others as allies to push the government toward a swifter, more energetic rearmament policy. The RAF, he opined, “lagged behind the political pressure that was only too anxious to back us.”"**  In House of Commons debates in late 1934, Winston Churchill thrust himself into the forefront of the issue: he challenged the government by demanding that it confirm or deny his own estimate that the Germans were already approaching parity and by 1937 would have three times the strength of the RAE'” The debate reached a head in March 1935 when Hitler announced—to senior diplomats who had gone to Ger- many to try to reopen the possibility of disarmament—that the Luft-  BRITAIN IN INTERWAR YEARS 113  waffe already had achieved parity with the RAF and would seek parity with the Red Air Force.
