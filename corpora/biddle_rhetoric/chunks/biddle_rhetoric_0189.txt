s were to be replaced by me- dium bombers and heavy mediums. This trend favoring heavier, longer- range aircraft—a first step in closing the gap between RAF declaratory policy and capabilities—would lead eventually to the Short Stirling, the Handley Page Halifax, and ultimately the Avro Lancaster, Britain’s most effectiveWorld War II bomber.  By this time the dynamic and energetic Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister (later Viscount Swinton) had become Secretary of State for Air, lobbying hard for reserves and industrial mobilization." Organizational changes were underway as well. What had been the Directorate of Supply and Re- search (of the Air Ministry) was divided into separate research and de- velopment and supply organizations. During the spring and summer of 1936 the RAF command structure was also reorganized around four distinct divisions: Bomber Command, Fighter Command, Coastal Com- mand, and Training Command—all responsible to the Air Council through the Chief of the Air Staff.”' While this reorganization was viewed as an improvement, it had some inherent problems as well. Sep- arating fighter and bomber functions reduced the incentive for the two divisions to work together, engage in joint tactical planning, or share  114 CHAPTER 2  advances and breakthroughs. The latter was particularly troublesome, as research done for Fighter Command progressively revealed defensive techniques that would increase the vulnerability of bombers.'” Throughout 1936 the Air Ministry was made well aware of the con- tinuing anxiety felt by the various agencies and individuals trying to assess the Luftwaffe. In a meeting between the prime minister and rep- resentatives from both Houses of Parliament, Sir Austen Chamberlain and Lord Salisbury confessed to being “profoundly disquieted .. . at the contrast between the high degree of preparation which appears to have taken place abroad among those who might be our adversaries and the want of promptness with which we originally responded to
