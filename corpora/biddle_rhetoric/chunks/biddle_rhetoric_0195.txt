bombing “had been directed towards military and important material objectives.”*% He believed that the indigenous perception resulted from the frequent inaccuracy of the air raids, and he felt that the Italians had been more responsible than the Germans for inaccurate bombing.”” He reported as well that attacks against power stations had been neither “sustained” nor “daringly executed.” And he asserted generally that “Franco’s Air Forces have had no sustained bombing policy.”2  In reporting on attacks against “the habitations of industrial and dock workers,” Goddard pointed out that in many cases such attacks had resulted in evacuations, and surmised that this must have led to a very great moral effect. At the same time, though, he explained that in the factories themselves output had not declined. He pointed out that repeated attacks on the vital Sagunto works “have apparently not ap- preciably reduced the output of steel”; and that despite being put out of their homes and suffering 150 deaths (among 3,000 workers), the workers had displayed “amazingly high spirit,” and only two had de- serted. But, he wrote (in what can only be seen as a strained attempt to explain this outcome), “[I]t must be hard for people of a gay tempera- ment to take a morbid view of things in the halcyon sunshine which seems to prevail nine days out of ten in Spain. The shattered steel works at Sagunto would have seemed very depressing in the wet and gloom of Sheffield, but in Spain it was not so.”” (Later that year the British Consul at Valencia would write up a report for the Foreign Office spe- cifically on the moral effect of bombing. After explaining the difficulties in getting reliable information, the Consul reported that the indirect results of the bombing had been negligible. But he implied—in a way that downplayed the impact of his news—that this was due to the fact that the bombing was inaccurate and sporadic, and that, on the whole, the war revealed an “excellent example of how
