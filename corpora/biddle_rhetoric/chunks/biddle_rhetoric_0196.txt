mplied—in a way that downplayed the impact of his news—that this was due to the fact that the bombing was inaccurate and sporadic, and that, on the whole, the war revealed an “excellent example of how not to utilise a complete  118 CHAPTER 2  mastery of the air.” He argued that half a dozen planes could, if em- ployed intelligently, keep the port cities in an almost constant state of alarm.)”"°  Goddard argued that in zones outside the battle area “aircraft have not fully exploited their advantages,” and that the air effort had been “dissipated over a wide range of objectives instead of concentrated time and time again on certain important objectives to ensure their destruc- tion or the demoralization of local personnel.””' This enabled him to draw two general conclusions. First, “The well-known principles gov- erning the employment of men and machines in war both on a large scale and in minor tactics, appear to require no modification in the light of experience gained in Spain.” And second, “The nature of this civil war and the limitations in material and command cannot, it seems, be expected to produce military information which is wholly capable of direct application to our own problems.”*” A Joint Intelligence Sub- Committee Report of 10 June 1939 likewise accepted that, with respect to the attack on industry, there was very little analogy between the wars in Spain and China and any future war between Great Powers in Europe.”  This tendency to eschew parallels was evident as well in British think- ing about fighter escorts. Many British observers of air operations in Spain contended that escorts had to fly only short distances, and that therefore the “lessons” of Spain did not apply." From his own observa- tions, Goddard reported, “The escort of bomber formations proceeding to and from their objective by double, or more than double, their num- ber of fighters, has been found by both sides to be a necessity notwith- standing the ability of the bomber to shoot dow
