But even though he had sounded a tocsin, Goddard soothed his readers by pointing out that bombers could defend them- selves with speed, and forward and rear gun defenses; he added that “bomber crews were confident in their ability to bring down fighters, and many successes by bombers were claimed.”2””  Prior to Goddard’s visit to Spain, the DDOps (Richard Peirse) had sent a memorandum to the DCAS indicating that escort operations in Spain ought to be observed, as the war provided “the only examples of modern air forces in actual conflict with each other since 1918.” He was interested in German tactics for using fighters as escorts or “as a sort of advanced guard for the bombers.” Nonetheless, he remained skeptical, stating, “While ... I still feel it would be a confession of weakness and a waste of effort on our part even to contemplate the use of fighters in this way, I cannot help feeling that we ought to be pre-  BRITAIN IN INTERWAR YEARS 119  pared for such an eventuality.”*"* He asked that the Bombing and Fight- ing Committees look into the question, and that a specification be drawn up for an escort fighter. But he admitted, “I confess I am not at all clear in my own mind as to the type of fighter that should be pro- vided.”*” Commenting on the minute sheet a week later (30 November 1936), the Director of Staff Duties (Sholto Douglas) wrote, “My own feeling in the matter is that the bombers should be able to look after themselves without the addition of an escort of fighters; although cer- tain of the bombers might be more heavily armed than the remainder at the expense of their
