bombers should be able to look after themselves without the addition of an escort of fighters; although cer- tain of the bombers might be more heavily armed than the remainder at the expense of their bomb load.””? In his response, the DCAS listed a set of concerns about escorts that was fairly representative of RAF thinking: specialized escorts would demand resources that might other- wise be put into bombers; they would have to be tied to their forma- tion; and they could not necessarily be better armed than the aircraft they were escorting. He concluded that though he did not wish to con- strain free discussion of the question, he felt that “the whole conception of fighter escorts is essentially defective.”**  In June 1937 the Air Fighting Committee of the Air Ministry found itself stymied over the question of escorts. After listening to detailed arguments first in favor of and then against the development of escort fighters, they decided it was not the right time for special requirements to be drawn up.” Instead, they recommended exploring the possibility of fitting certain bombers with more (and larger) guns, more ammuni- tion, and better protective armament.” In the late summer of 1938, Ludlow-Hewitt, then Chief of Bomber Command, suggested very se- rious reconsideration of the Air Staff’s policy on escorts. Confessing to his own past pessimism over escorts, and confusion over what an ade- quate type might look like, he was nonetheless concerned enough to advocate some action. He envisioned, ultimately, a bomber force work- ing out of France, aided by heavily armed escorts." At an April 1939 meeting on Bomber Command readiness, the Director of Operational Requirements reported that further discussion on the issue had yielded the opinion that the defense of bombers could be better undertaken “by bomber aircraft carrying fewer bombs, but more ammunition and guns.”25  ‘As war approached, Air Staff members realized that they had not made sufficient progress on this
