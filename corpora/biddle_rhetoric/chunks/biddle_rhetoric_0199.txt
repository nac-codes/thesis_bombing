Though increased urgency characterized their discussions, they were unable to determine how an escort could be made fast enough, maneuverable enough, and sufficiently long-ranged to be feasible for deep penetrations into enemy air space. What they envisioned, in the end, was more an escort bomber than an escort fighter.’ In general, in the years leading to war many  120 CHAPTER 2  unresolved questions remained about how the RAF ought to proceed, and how it ought to think about the Luftwaffe. Air planners were hand- icapped by their late start on many of these issues, and simply by their inability to come to a consensus on how to predict the increasingly complex and uncertain future of aerial warfare. They also did not help themselves with their selective reading of the evidence available to them, which tended to interpret new information in such a way as to preserve and indeed reinforce prevailing conceptions.  REARMAMENT: THE EVE OF WAR  As the RAF cast about for ways to conceptualize and prepare for the future, a number of important changes took place that would influence the early stages of the coming war. In May of 1937, Neville Chamber- lain replaced Stanley Baldwin as Prime Minister; Sir John Simon became Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Anthony Eden took over at the For- eign Office.
