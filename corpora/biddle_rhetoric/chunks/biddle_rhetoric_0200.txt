The air force proposed that the bomber force be rearmed with heavy bombers that could operate entirely from British bases, and continued to demand full accommodation for reserves (for bombers and fighters). RAF requests called for increases of 40 percent in bomber strength and 25 percent in fighter strength over the existing program (Scheme F). However, it would be no small task to produce the airplanes, the en- gines to power them, and the crews to fly and maintain them. In addi- tion, runways and airdromes would have to be reworked in order to accommodate the heavier planes, and no one was certain that some sort of catapult system might not be necessary to get the planes off the ground.”” In putting forward the new program, Lord Swinton found  BRITAIN IN INTERWAR YEARS 121  himself telling the cabinet that it was very unlikely the goals of the plan could be met before the summer of 1941 at the earliest.*”  As it turned out, the new plan (Scheme J) was met by a challenge from Sir Thomas Inskip, a civilian appointed Minister for the Coordina- tion of Defence in March 1936 and who was charged with the thankless task of trying to coordinate and prioritize the views of the different services—a
