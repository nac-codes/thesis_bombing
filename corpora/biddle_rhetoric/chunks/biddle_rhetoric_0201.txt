a civilian appointed Minister for the Coordina- tion of Defence in March 1936 and who was charged with the thankless task of trying to coordinate and prioritize the views of the different services—a role performed unofficially by the Treasury in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In an aide-mémoire of 9 December 1937, Inskip ar- gued that German aircraft could be better destroyed over Britain by fighters than by an attack on German factories and airdromes.*" At the most basic level, fighters would be cheaper and easier to construct. The fighter force, he argued, should be made as strong as possible and given full reserves. Inskip’s own view of future strategy was in line with the methods Britain had traditionally used over the centuries: relying on sea power and superior economic resources to repulse any initial assaults, and then engaging the enemy in a war of economic attrition.*” While his actions were motivated mainly by a concern for economy, their im- mediate consequences confronted some of the premises of Air Staff planning.  Despite hostility from the Air Ministry and protest from the Foreign Office, Inskip managed to win his case in the cabinet, which on 22 December 1937 accepted his program. He declined to put the Air Staff program forward, and placed a spending limit of £110 million over Scheme EF? The new Scheme K retained fighter numbers with full re- serves, but cut bomber squadrons and reserves. The Inskip program was, in actuality, less radical than some authors have argued. While Inskip did change the ratio between bombers and fighters, he did not change the number of fighters ordered for Britain—this number had already been agreed to by the Air Ministry. And his program retained nearly the same front line strength in bombers, as well as a plan for rearming the air force at some future point with new heavy bombers. After further deliberation, in which the Air Ministry warned against cutting reserves for heavy bombers, monies were shifted out of the tr
