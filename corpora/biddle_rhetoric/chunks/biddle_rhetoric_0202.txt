ng the air force at some future point with new heavy bombers. After further deliberation, in which the Air Ministry warned against cutting reserves for heavy bombers, monies were shifted out of the training establishment and the construction of permanent buildings, and into reserves.’*  Still, the near-term deemphasis of bombers worried the Air Ministry; its members did not take kindly to being second-guessed on issues of such fundamental importance. Thus, part of their reaction to Inskip was dismissive and defensive in nature—indeed, one officer complained that Inskip’s plan was the equivalent of putting all of one’s players in goal.” Sir Cyril Newall, who had become CAS in September 1937, believed that Inskip was driven only by economics, and not by the necessities of strategy. And he believed that, in any event, it was not Inskip’s place to  122 CHAPTER 2  tell the services how to spend their money. The Air Staff suspected, as well, that the navy might be influencing him.’ But the Inskip report had found the RAF in a moment of pessimism and low confidence. The JPC report of 1936 had acted as a catalyst for more detailed planning within the services, and the RAF duly followed through on its part. The results that followed were wholly discouraging. As the official historians of the World War II bombing campaign acknowledged, “It was soon revealed that there was no clear idea as to what was operationally pos- sible, what targets could be reached, how far they could be hit, what would happen to them if they were hit, or what were likely to be the casualties incurred.”*”  Air planners believed, of course, that a determined air offensive had to be part and parcel of any victory plan for a future war: this idea had been the centerpiece of their identity, so its disruption, even temporarily, was disturbing and disorienting. But, with their counteroffensive capa- bilities so uncertain, they were hardly in a strong position to parry suc- cessfully Inskip’s thrust—at least
