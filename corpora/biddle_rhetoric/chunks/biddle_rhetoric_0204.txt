preferred to try to convince themselves that things were not so bad.*° Ironically, the man who had once warned against “calculations” was now having to make very many of them. To his credit, he set about the task with great energy and determination.  BRITAIN IN INTERWAR YEARS 123  Problems of reconnaissance, target acquisition, intelligence, tactics, and navigation had received inadequate attention through the early and mid-1930s. There were no specialized reconnaissance units, and there was no organization for the interpretation of photographs; indeed, the need for damage assessment was hardly considered at all.*" Navigation was done largely by dead reckoning with occasional visual checks, but the lack of career opportunities for navigators meant that few men were attracted to it. In the two years before the outbreak of war, there were no less than 478 forced landings due to pilots losing their way" A similar state of affairs existed with respect to the operational details of bombing. There had been, for instance, no consensus on how bombers ought to proceed to their targets while minimizing the risk of fighter interception.** In 1938 a Bombing Policy Sub-Committee (of the Bomb- ing Committee) was formed to consider the tactical details of different methods of bombing, and to determine the most suitable types of air- craft and apparatus for these. At its first meeting, on 22 March 1938, the Sub-Committee recommended the investigation of methods for im- proving high-level bombing accuracy. The members argued that inade- quate attention had been given to bombing problems, and that there was a “crying need for a Bombing Development Establishment [original emphasis], which could concentrate on the necessary experiments.” It was pointed out that a similar proposal had been made at the 2nd, 3rd, and 10th meetings of the Bombing Committee, “but nothing had even- tuated.”** Such an establishment was brought into being only after the Munich crisis. Until then, many of the
