made at the 2nd, 3rd, and 10th meetings of the Bombing Committee, “but nothing had even- tuated.”** Such an establishment was brought into being only after the Munich crisis. Until then, many of the most urgent questions surround- ing bombing policy remained unsolved.** Regarding bombs themselves, there had been actual retrogression. The need for heavier bombs, which was seen in World War I and was reemphasized by Trenchard in 1923, was apparently forgotten; in 1935, the Air Staff rejected a proposal (from the Commander-in-Chief, ADGB) that the standard 500-pound bomb be replaced by those of 1,000 and 2,000 pounds.»”  The RAF was, in the late 1930s, an organization facing the fact that it could not carry out its own declaratory policy. But the situation was brighter with respect to defense. Despite its overwhelming declaratory commitment to the aerial offensive, the RAF had never ceased thinking about fighters and methods of home defense generally. This hedging of bets would pay off in crucial ways. By the late 1920s, the funds avail- able to the Air Ministry for research were devoted largely to scientific and technical experiments examining possibilities for defense.** General E. B. Ashmore, who had directed British air defense in World War I, argued after the war for the development of an information network to enable the communication of data to facilitate interception of incoming aircraft. The resulting system made use of ground observers and dedi- cated phone lines to support fighters and anti-aircraft artillery. Progress  124 CHAPTER 2  was made in radio telephony that would allow for a greatly improved communications system for defenders. Other important developments took place in intelligence, and in fighter defense organization. During his tenure as Chief of Air Staff (May 1933—August 1937), Sir Edward Ellington oversaw the drawing up of specifications that led to the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire. When experiments in methods of aircraft de
