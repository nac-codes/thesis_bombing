margin of speed between fighters and bombers. In his covering note to the Assistant Chief of the Air Staff, he admitted that, on many issues involving the tactical performance of new fighters and bombers, there was a dearth of useful information. And he pointed out that while he believed the value of the fighter was declining due to increased bomber speeds and blind flying methods, his general view of their value was, he thought, more generous than that of the Air Staff.** In answering the query, Air Staff respondents conjectured that some 60 percent of day raids and 40 percent of night raids could be intercepted (though the figure might fall to 20 percent and 10 percent respectively in heavy cloud). Actual shoot-down rates would depend on such things as the tactical formations utilized by the bombers, but the chances of a fighter taking a bomber out of action were thought to have increased in gen-  BRITAIN IN INTERWAR YEARS 125  eral. These good rates were attributed to such things as increased fighter climb speeds, better communications and observer corps organization, balloon barrages, and more accurate anti-aircraft fire. Counteracting this trend, however, were cloud flying techniques and the greater speed and operating heights of modern bombers.*  Significantly, an attached document called “The Composition and Strength of the Royal Air Force—Air Staff Policy” sought to address the perception that recent increases in the strength of the RAF had “lead to some erroneous deductions that a change of policy is thereby implied in the direction of a defensive strategy at the expense of our capacity for counter-offensive action.” The authors asserted that “no such change is implied by the measures recently announced or is in any way contemplated.” They pointed out that increases in the numbers of fighters were tied to the development of the German bomber force, but insisted that British strategy had not changed, arguing that “[iJt is not enough to avoid losing a war .
