as little other option but to do so. This precluded a full examination of the tension inherent in simultaneously believing that one could fend off a Luftwaffe attack and also prosecute a successful offensive against Germany.  126 CHAPTER 2  While a determined faith enabled air planners to find hope on the horizon, it did not help them to solve their near-term problems. Cham- berlain did not set before the House of Commons all the implications of the Inskip program, but that body already was exercised about RAF inadequacies and a possible German “bolt from the blue.” Churchill, still playing a leading role in the drama, called for an inquiry into the workings of the Air Ministry. Though the issue was debated, the poten- tial crisis never came to a head because the resignation of Lord Swinton in May 1938 was enough to placate the critics, at least for the time being.” By then, however, the perception of British vulnerability played a part in the conclusion drawn by the Chiefs of Staff that very little could be done to help Czechoslovakia, the object of Hitler’s latest terri- torial demands.**  Wesley Wark has argued that three factors dominated the air intel- ligence picture at the time of the Munich crisis: lack of technical insight into the Luftwaffe’s real capabilities; an assumption that the Luftwaffe was developed for a strategic air offensive; and a two-year history of increasingly pessimistic readings of the air power balance. All of this added up to a reliance on worst case scenarios. And these could not fail to contribute to the deep sense of alarm and pessimism felt by policy- makers responsible for coping with Hitler, Although the Air Staff did not assume that the Germans were in fact looking to launch a bolt from the blue at that moment, air-intelligence estimates of that worst case were dire: fifty thousand casualties in a twenty-four hour period. Be- cause senior military advisors to the government did not analyze the bolt from the blue scenario, the iss
