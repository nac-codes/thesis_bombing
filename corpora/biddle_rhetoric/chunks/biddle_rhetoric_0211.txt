twelve hours a day, and “laggards” who had not yet picked up their masks were implored to do so via loudspeakers mounted on roving trucks. Airplanes circled overhead, trailing streamers asking volunteers to join the auxiliary fire service. Hospitals prepared to dis- charge stable patients to make room for emergency cases; their staffs inventoried equipment and stocked up on surgical supplies. The Church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields held day and night prayers for peace. Fac- tories and shops made emergency accommodation for their employees and patrons: one shop readied “brandy for the nervous, chocolate for the hungry, and games for the restless.” The London Zoo made plans to destroy its poisonous snakes and spiders, and to shoot any large ani- mals that might escape their cages due to bombing.“  The crisis over Czechoslovakia removed whatever patience or toler- ance remained in Britain for Hitler’s revision of the World War I settle- ment. Up to that point, more than a few Britons had felt, as Slessor later explained, “that this fellow Hitler had a case,” that the Germans could not “permanently be held in a position of inferiority vis 4 vis the French.” Indeed, Churchill was in a unique position: opposed to both the appeasers and the pro-German right wing.” But Munich had finally begun to reveal the Fiihrer’s true face, and this brought with it the dawning realization that war, even if averted for the time being, was unlikely to be averted for long. The gap between claims and capabilities would now have to be closed for good. In the breathless months leading up to war, the Air Staff would concern itself with a great many ques- tions pertaining to British and German capabilities regarding strategic bombardment. In addition, Air Staff members would concentrate on drawing up plans for war based on the resources available to Britain in the near term. This crucial process will be examined in the early pages of chapter 4.  CHAPTER THREE  The United States in the Interwar
