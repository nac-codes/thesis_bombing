Indeed, a 1928 document from the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps had argued, “It is not hard to visualize a situation in which the destructive power of the air force will be adequate to subdue the enemy’s will and in which both the Army and Navy would operate in support.”* Thoughout the interwar years a debate raged inside the U.S. military—sometimes quietly and sometimes openly—about the degree to which an air force could and should act independently in war. A desire for greater autonomy naturally inclined the airmen to focus their  UNITED STATES IN INTERWAR YEARS 129  attention on strategic bombing—a role that promised them greater independence, responsibility, and prestige. Their subordinate status caused them to behave differently from the British, but the differences were, ultimately, more in the realm of official action than in the realm of ideas. RAF leaders defended themselves and Air Corps leaders sought to assert themselves by using similar claims about the possibilities for independent air operations. In both cases, the circumstances caused them to become heavily invested in those claims.  Second, the United States and Britain faced distinctly different geo- political situations; these, necessarily, produced different interwar per- spectives on aerial bombing among their leadership and within their general populations. If the First World War had been a grievous and disillusioning experience for the Americans, it had not scarred them with the shock and trauma that had defined the British experience of war. With the English Channel no longer serving as the useful moat it had been for centuries, the British felt their new vulnerability acutely. Though the postwar dismantling of the German air
