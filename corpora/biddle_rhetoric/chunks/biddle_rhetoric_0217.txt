planning in crucial ways and produce effective results. They came to believe that their own long-range bombers would be able to undermine efficiently the integrity of an enemy’s war economy by attacking specific targets crucial to the functioning of that economy. This conviction gained momentum through the years as Air Corps plan- ners dedicated themselves increasingly to understanding and preparing for air operations independent of the army and its ground combat func- tion, and as they invested themselves in the concept of “precision bomb- ing.” Indeed, this line of thought eventually would take on a life of its own as the “industrial fabric” (or “industrial web”) theory of bombing, articulated and promoted most aggressively by the Air Corps Tactical School of the 1930s. But though the Americans would embrace the “in- dustrial fabric” theory, they would fail to back it up with the intel- ligence apparatus necessary to turn it into a coherent and sophisticated foundation for an operational plan. And they would fail to understand fully the conditions and requirements necessary to enable it to succeed. Thus, even if American airmen were free of the burdens of defending a wartime record, they were not immune from problematical assumptions, faulty analyses, oversights, and a tendency to make bold, unsubstanti- ated claims. The latter in particular stemmed from a desire to win greater freedom from the institutional confines of the army. But many of the problems they faced stemmed from the way in which they perceived their world and, in turn, how they interpreted new information based on those perceptions. These inevitably influenced their decisions and their behavior, with important ramifications during the Second World War.  IDEAS AND INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS: ‘THE EARLY INTERWAR YEARS.  The early postwar writing of American airmen reflected the organiza- tional constraints they operated under; but it revealed, as well, the lure of wider horizons. While commanding the
