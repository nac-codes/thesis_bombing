NTERWAR YEARS.  The early postwar writing of American airmen reflected the organiza- tional constraints they operated under; but it revealed, as well, the lure of wider horizons. While commanding the Air Service First Army, Gen. Billy Mitchell had drawn up a set of guidelines for his observation, day bombardment, and pursuit (fighter) units. Initially published in a series of operations bulletins, these were later incorporated, with some revi-  132 CHAPTER 3  sions, into the “Provisional Manual of Operations,” which appeared officially in December 1918. Even though Mitchell’s units had not un- dertaken long-range bombing, many of his ideas were relevant to the formation of American thought on independent air operations. He em- phasized for instance that bombers must fly in defensive formation, with up to eighteen aircraft per group.*  Maj. William C. Sherman, who had been Chief of Staff of the First Army Air Service, added to the Air Service’s early body of thought by preparing an extensive “Tentative Manual for the Employment of Air Service” in early 1919. Hewing to army orthodoxy, Sherman reminded his readers that “the final decision in war must be made by man on the ground, willing to come hand to hand with the enemy. . . . It is, there- fore, the role of the Air Service, as well as that of the other arms, to aid the chief combatant: the infantry.’ But Sherman also revealed enthusi- asm for what he perceived to be the vast possibilities of air operations, arguing that the commanding position of an airplane, which renders concealment useless, “induces the instinctive belief in the heart of every man on the ground that he himself is being watched by hostile eyes and being made the target for bomb or bullet; and that this hostile man can pursue him intelligently and ultimately destroy him.” He explained, “To this is added a feeling of utter helplessness, not justified by facts but none the less instinctive and not to be overcome wholly by reason or training.”* In a
