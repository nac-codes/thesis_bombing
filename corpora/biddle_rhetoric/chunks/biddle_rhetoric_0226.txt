carry these supplies from place to place.” An unabashed advocate, he asserted that any future war would com- mence with air battles: “[T]he nation winning them is practically certain to win the whole war, because the victorious air service will be able to operate and increase without hindrance.”” Like the Italian general Giu- lio Douhet, Mitchell emphasized the importance of winning and main- taining control of the air. Defying Newton Baker, he argued that in total war an enemy nation’s entire population—women and children in- cluded—would be subject to bombardment as contributors to the enemy war economy.” But—again like Douhet and many other inter- war air “prophets”—he argued that air power, by making wars shorter, would offer a way around the stalemate and slaughter seen in the Great War. Further, he believed that the very prospect of large-scale bombard- ment would serve as a deterrent to war.  Echoing Trenchard, Mitchell stressed the indirect impact of bombs  UNITED STATES IN INTERWAR YEARS 137  upon the morale of a nation during World War I: “When industrial districts were attacked,” he wrote, “the workers were made so nervous that whenever the buzz of an airplane was heard it made them stop work .. . while at night the constant fear of the bombardment attacks prevented sleep.”*' He also was attuned to the possible use of chemical weapons over urban areas. But while he was confident in the psycho- logical effect of aircraft on fragile civilian will, he did not make clear precisely how to break that will, or how doing so would translate into peace.*? Indeed, Mitchell never articulated a coherent body of doctrine that devolved from consistent theories or logical postulates. Rather, he was an energetic publicist who elevated his conception of omnipotent air power above the heads of his colleagues, and directly to the masses. He had such faith in his convictions and found them so instinctively correct that he was confident the public, once roused to awareness, w
