hell had settled any of the major debates on the future of air power. But most airmen were content simply to look to the future, a sentiment reflected in the ACTS motto adopted in 1929: “Proficimus More Irretenti” (We progress unhindered by tradition)” They forged identity and unity through their shared sense of mission, their readiness to accept the dangers of early flying, and their defiance of army ways. Youthful and daring, they took pride in the fact that they stood largely outside the West Point fraternity.” Army Training Regulation 440-15, “Fundamental Principles of Em- ployment of the Air Service” (26 January 1926), was conservative in tone, assigning airmen a supporting role in a future war: “to aid the ground forces to gain decisive success.” The 1926 version of the “Bombardment” text used at the Air Corps Tactical School revealed many of the tensions and unresolved disputes of the day.
