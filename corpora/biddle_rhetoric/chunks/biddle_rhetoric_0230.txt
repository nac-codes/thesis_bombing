at- tacks made by the enemy on such centers in our own country.” None- theless, the authors questioned the potency of such reprisal raids (including those waged against London and Paris in World War I): “Whether such bombing actually accomplishes its avowed purpose—to weaken the morale of the hostile nation and thus hasten the end of hostilities—is doubtful in some cases. The reactions may be in exactly the opposite direction.”**  In the same year that this text appeared, however, the Air Corps pro- duced a less conservative one for a course called “Employment of Com- bined Air Force.” It signalled the increasingly confident posture of the Air Corps; it especially emphasized the concept of enemy will, arguing that the aim in war is to destroy the enemy’s will to fight—a goal not necessarily accomplished by a direct attack on his armed forces. Instead, this objective might be achieved by attacking, via air power, vital points in the enemy interior. This language, now common among air theor- ists, was reinforced by trends in Britain, in particular by the 1925 pub- lication of B. H. Liddell Hart’s Paris, or the Future of War. Endorsing the book during a speech to the Army War College, Gen. Mason Patrick (the new, less conservative Chief of the Air Service) asserted that in the future the objective in war should be to crush the enemy’s will to fight rather than to concentrate on his armed forces.” In calling attention to the text, Patrick was bound to give it a wide audience among American airmen. Maj. Gen. James E. Fechet, who became Chief of the Air Corps in November 1927, likewise promoted a more independent line of think- ing. Proposing revisions in the existing ACTS texts, he wrote, “The objec- tive of war is to overcome the enemy’s will to resist, and the defeat of his army, his fleet, or the occupation of his territory is merely a means to this end and none of them is the true objective.” He added, “At present the Air Force provides the only means for such an ac
