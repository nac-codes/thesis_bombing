is army, his fleet, or the occupation of his territory is merely a means to this end and none of them is the true objective.” He added, “At present the Air Force provides the only means for such an accomplishment.”**  Clearly the Americans were in the throes of working out just how to think about the future of bombing, and how to articulate it. Though organizational policies and authorities had sought to limit the debates, a growing iconoclasm inclined instead toward the forward-looking vi- sions of those who had perceived an aerial shortcut to the accomplish- ment of a Clausewitzian dictum: to end a war one must destroy the  140 CHAPTER 3  enemy’s will to fight. Americans drew on their limited World War I experience and British rhetoric to underpin their evolving concepts. But while they embraced the idea that the real objective in war is to over- come the enemy’s will, they wrestled unsuccessfully with it. Phrases like “national will” and “moral effect” (and their connection to victory) remained elusive and underspecified. Americans did somewhat better when they focused on particulars. They found instinctive appeal in the idea that strategic bombardment must be governed by a well-thought- out program based on a thorough evaluation of the enemy’s war economy.  These evolving themes were evident in the mature work of William C. Sherman, who had gone from the Air Service Tactical School to instruc- tor in air tactics at the army’s Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. His 1926 book, Air Warfare, revealed much about the corpus of thought extant among the Air Corps’s most active theorists.

A decision is reached not by the actual physical destruction of an armed force, but by the destruction of its belief in ultimate victory and its will to win.”® On World War I bombing, Sherman argued, “The Germans believed
