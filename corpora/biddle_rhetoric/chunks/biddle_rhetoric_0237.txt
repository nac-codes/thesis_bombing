acArthur and Chief of Naval Operations William V. Pratt, which sought to settle the hotly contested question of how to define and delin- eate the functional responsibilities of the army and navy regarding coastal defense and seaborne operations. The MacArthur-Pratt agree- ment established that naval aircraft would be based on the fleet and would accompany it, while the army’s aircraft would be “land-based and employed as an element of the army in carrying out its missions of defending the coasts, both in the homeland and in overseas posses- sions.” It allowed that the air force of each service would be “free to develop within well-defined limits and each with a separate and distinct mission.”® The agreement, which was vague and which the army and navy tended to interpret in different ways, came after years of haggling between the services over respective responsibilities for defending the nation’s coastlines. Many members of the navy were unhappy with the agreement and continued to protest the Air Corps’ right to operate dis- tant, over-water patrols. (Indeed, the navy ultimately rescinded the agreement unilaterally.) Still, the agreement became the thin edge of a wedge for the Air Corps in its quest for expanded responsibility and matériel. In his January 1933 policy letter, “Employment of Army Avia- tion in Coast Defense,” MacArthur divided the nation into four coastal frontiers, in each a field army was commanded by the senior corps area commander. He directed the Air Corps to “conduct the land-based air operations in defense of the United States and its overseas possessions.”  The plan gave the GHQ Air Force wartime control over bombard- ment, pursuit, and attack aircraft, as well as observation for long-range  144 CHAPTER 3  reconnaissance. The latter function required special equipment suited to long-range reconnaissance over land and water. The Air Corps could also agitate for a GHQ Air Force to exist in peacetime and for a GHQ Headquarters to be established
