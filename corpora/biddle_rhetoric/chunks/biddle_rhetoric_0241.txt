onsibility for American national security policy, airmen knew that they also would have increased opportunity. By 1935, Con- gress expanded Air Corps appropriations—and the trend continued, spurred on by the growing threat of Hitler’s Germany and of wars in China, Ethiopia, and Spain. Air Corps expenditures nearly tripled in five years, ballooning from $30 million in 1935 to over $83 million in 1939.”  146 CHAPTER 3  In addition, the Air Corps won a powerful ally in President Roosevelt, who, despite his naval background, viewed military aviation as increas- ingly central to the national defense.  The ominous tones emanating from Europe had been heard across the Atlantic, not only by politicians but by military planners who would be responsible for protecting American interests and, indeed, waging war if it became unavoidable. The 15 May 1935 issue of the Air Corps Newletter reprinted an editorial from the 12 April issue of the Manches- ter Guardian, under the title, “Widespread Air Bombardment Contem- plated by European Powers,” which asserted that “[alir power will strike at the very outset of a future campaign,” and explained that “since in a war of ‘areas’ and not of ‘fronts’ the advantage is through- out with the attacking air force, no large success by the defense can be expected.”” Increasing awareness of the probable role of bombardment in a future war, concern about events abroad, and the growing techno- logical sophistication of bombers all spurred ACTS to focus even greater attention on strategic bombardment.  The difference between the MB-2 bomber of the 1920s and the Mar- tin B-10 of the early 1930s was striking: the service ceiling was raised from 7,700 to 24,400 feet, the normal bomb load from 1,040 to 2,260 pounds, and the top speed from 98 mph to 213 mph. Indeed, the B-10 marked a new generation of machines: it proved that greater size did not necessarily mean slower speeds (instead, aerodynamic efficiency could be increased with size). But the B-10’
