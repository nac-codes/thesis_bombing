say, he consoled his readers by pointing out that even if bombing destroyed one or more nations in a future war, it would probably not destroy all of Western civilization.**  Those affiliated with the Air Service / Air Corps, and those with ties to the aviation industry also attempted self-consciously to create an “airminded” culture in the United States by producing a steady stream of speculative literature and air war fiction. As we have seen, Billy Mitchell worked tirelessly to convince Americans that their powerful navy could no longer be relied on to protect them from hostile outside forces. By 1921 he was arguing that those “who have had experience in aviation thoroughly believe that the great battleship on the water is as vulnerable to air attack today as was the ‘knight in armor’ to the foot- man armed with a musket.”** Handsome and articulate, he made him- self into a kind of American icon: the brash, committed individualist who bucks the establishment for the sake of a deeply held conviction. News footage of his exploits kept him in front of a nation that had become captivated by the cinema. Equally suited to the newsreels were the great distance flying exploits of the 1920s and 1930s, and the air races of the same era. And even those without ready access to the cin- ema might still witness the derring-do of Depression-era barnstormers and acrobatic flyers.  Other members of the Air Service also set out to build public support for military aviation. Henry Arnold and Ira Eaker, officers on active duty, coauthored three books on aviation for popular audiences. Arnold also wrote a six-volume adventure series for boys—based on the ex- ploits of a young flyer named Bill Bruce—designed to raise “airminded- ness” and to create a favorable image of the “airman” for America’s youth. In the 1930s, boys’ aeronautic organizations flourished: the Jun- ior Birdmen of America had no less than 500,000 members by 1936.” Alexander de Seversky, a World War I Russian fighter
