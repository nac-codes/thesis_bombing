a hostile northern neigh- bor waged air attacks upon the United States with a force roughly equal to that of France (the largest air power at the time). Basing his estimates on the number of bombs that could be carried by planes getting through fighter and anti-aircraft defenses (and their possibility of bombing accu- rately), he calculated that .23 percent of Manhattan and the Bronx  UNITED STATES IN INTERWAR YEARS 151  might suffer damage on the first day, and that their populations would suffer 1,240 killed and 3,560 injured. He suggested that while this would produce “moral” effects including fear and an exodus from the city, it was unlikely to cause collapse. He added that, over time, the efficiency of the offensive force would deteriorate as weather and fa- tigue took their toll, and as defenses—including anti-aircraft techniques and better communications—improved.” To include the possibility of gas weapons, he recalculated his numbers, again using his best estimate of what could feasibly be delivered by a 1932 air force. Rather than death to every living thing, he predicted about 12,000 casualties, point- ing out that a population equipped with respirators would be more resilient and resistant to terror than many doomsday speculators assumed.”  As Conway’s article appeared, European disarmament negotiations were underway in Switzerland. As noted in the previous chapter, the British government took the conference very seriously, considering that failure with respect to bombardment aviation would have disastrous political consequences. The Americans could afford a far more disin- terested approach; indeed, the Disarmament Conference itself highlights the wide gulf then separating British and American attitudes toward defense issues. If Ramsay MacDonald and Sir John Simon felt them- selves engaged in a struggle for their national security and the mainte- nance of their way of life, American participants saw themselves acting mainly as friendly facilitators in a
