severe curtailment of military aviation. And the Department of Commerce, concerned for the future of American civil aviation, did not wish to see any restriction in that realm.*  The Hoover Administration hoped that the British would be prepared to endorse the plan (indeed, Norman Davis of the American delegation at Geneva had indicated that MacDonald “was very anxious that some- thing big and definite” be done at the conference), and they sought to work openly with MacDonald and Simon. Even though he admired the aim of the Hoover plan and was thus prepared to give it general support, MacDonald wanted time prior to its announcement to discuss it with the cabinet in London; he was particularly concerned about the naval provisions.” Sir John Simon also asked that the Americans not push ahead before the ground could be properly laid. But Hoover was unwilling to give them the time they desired.” Sir John Simon viewed the American timing as little short of disastrous. He conveyed his feel- ings in no uncertain terms to the Americans; indeed, Norman Davis reported to President Hoover that Simon was “terribly upset and almost takes it as an insult.” In the days preceeding Hoover’s 22 June announ- cement, the British and French had made some headway on the ques- tion of bombers, and Simon did not want the American intervention— which was well intended but full of practical problems—to interrupt the progress of those discussions.
