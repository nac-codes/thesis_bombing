John F, Curry told the Chief of the Air Staff in 1932 that ACTS needed to become a “clearing house into which tactical ideas can flow, where they can be tried, and where the doctrine can go out to the ser- vice to be put into practice and evaluated.” In large part this worked. So long as the airmen remained formally committed to army concep- tualizations, they found themselves with some leeway since the army did not look continually over the shoulder of ACTS. Its personnel thus had some opportunity to envision the future as they wished.'*  But anticipating and preparing for the future was by no means a sim- ple or straightforward task for these self-appointed visionaries: the tech- nological and political ground was shifting rapidly beneath their feet, and the organizational context of their efforts remained complicated. Throughout the 1930s the Air Corps continued to have a dual person- ality, aspiring to evolve in a radical direction while proclaiming its offi- cial commitment to a more conservative one. By the end of the decade, though, it was speaking in ever bolder terms about strategic bombing, and straying increasingly from army-oriented conceptualizations of avi- ation. The text for the “Air Warfare” section of the 1938 “Air Force” course asserted confidently, “The possibility for the application of mili- tary force against the vital structure of a nation directly and imme- diately upon the outbreak of hostilities, is the most important and far reaching military development of modern times.”' But this was an in- ternal dialogue that remained unsanctioned by the army and largely ignored by the navy. As such it was risky, and held room for potential conflict and confusion among the services.  Even if the Air Corps had carved out some space for itself, official doctrin
