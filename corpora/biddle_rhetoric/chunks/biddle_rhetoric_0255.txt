largely ignored by the navy. As such it was risky, and held room for potential conflict and confusion among the services.  Even if the Air Corps had carved out some space for itself, official doctrine continued to be contested ground between the army and the air insurgency movement within its ranks. Much of the army effort mani- fested itself in the official “Training Regulations” for the Air Corps and the wartime role it authorized. Those seeking greater freedom for avia- tion in war could hardly have been excited by wording, put forward in a 1935 proposed revision of the Training Regulations, which specified that “Air Corps troops further the mission of the territorial or tactical commands to which they are assigned or attached.”"” The first volume of an Air Corps field manual, drawn up in 1937-38 and forwarded for comment to the War Department, did not by any means receive the whole-hearted endorsement of that body. After six months of review, the War Department sent it back demanding changes: the manual was  UNITED STATES IN INTERWAR YEARS 155  not to make mention of “independent” operations, nor was it to discuss air attacks designed to destroy civilian morale."  And even as it contended with externally imposed constraints, the Air Corps also had to face up to its own internal attachments to army lega- cies: despite professing a future-oriented perspective, Air Corps mem- bers (like their RAF colleagues) had to overcome their own cultural connections to social anachronisms and to outdated elements of train- ing harkening back to once-favored but now obsolete methods of war. While, for instance, the requirement for twenty-five hours of equine sta- ble management was eliminated early on, horseback riding was required from 7:15 to 8:15 every other morning. Indeed, students spent many more hours on horseback than they did addressing themselves to more useful topics such as air logistics."” The riding requirement was increas- ingly resented as the years passed.
