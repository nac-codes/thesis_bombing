Even if the Air Corps had been allowed or required to present its case more completely to the public, it is not certain that the process would have produced greater clarity. It had not done so for the RAE  156 CHAPTER 3  By the late 1920s and early 1930s, the rhetoric of ACTS was evolving ever more rapidly toward a full and unconstrained articulation of a theory of independent strategic bombing. The 1930 text for the “Bom- bardment Aviation” course took its readers through the history of long- range bombing, seeking to draw lessons from the World War I experi- ence. It continued to acknowledge the difficulties posed to bombers by pursuit planes, pointing out that in World War I both fighters and ground-based defenses had taken their tolls and had forced attackers to bomb by night. The authors observed that by 1918, “certain of the principles governing the employment of bombardment aviation were definitely recognized,” including disruption of lines of communication and destruction of important factories and airplanes on the ground.'* The authors printed portions of Trenchard’s 1916 memorandum on the “relentless and incessant offensive,” claiming simply, “It is evident that this policy was adhered to.”'* Echoing the British, the authors were impressed by the difficulties of defending against an aerial offensive. They argued that German bombing of London and Paris had forced the British and French to tie up a “large number of personnel and a vast amount of material to defend against the German airplanes.” Extrapo- lating, they asserted “it is apparent that the damage suffered by London throughout the war did not equal that which could be caused by one heavy bombardment group with modern equipment.”'"’ The text supported the case for strategic bombing in war, arguing that it had caused losses of production in factories, inconvenience to the enemy (which cou
