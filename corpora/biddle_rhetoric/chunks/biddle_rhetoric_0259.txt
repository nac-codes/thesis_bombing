trike directly the rear of the enemy’s army, or the heart of his country, may have a profound effect upon his will to wage war.”"’ Because entire societies now went to war, rather than just armies or navies, nations themselves became vulnerable. The route to victory was no longer through the enemy forces alone: the nation itself was subject to defeat, either along with or independent of the defeat of its armed forces. The goal in war was to break the enemy’s national will, and to do it directly through the application of the air arm.
