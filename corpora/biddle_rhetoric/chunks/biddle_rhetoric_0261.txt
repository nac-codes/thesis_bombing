was because it gave him bureaucratic flexibility, and in part because he was disinclined to work out details in advance of events. But the elusive way in which he han- dled the question, combined with his emphasis on the inherently vague moral effect, had led to a good deal of confusion (and consternation) both inside and outside the RAF.  American air theorists could not predict the latitude the Air Corps might be given to prosecute a future air war, especially since American security policy remained defensive, isolationist, and officially hostile to any proposal for bombing noncombatants. Under the circumstances, they attempted to think through possible futures even as they sought to avoid raising the eyebrows of their colleagues in the other services. The “Air Force” course text of 1931 (rev. ed.) pondered the possibility of direct attacks against “political objectives,” specified as attacks on cities (with high explosive or chemical bombs) or on civilian water and food supplies and utilities. The authors recognized that these would entail terrific suffering among noncombatants, and suggested that a decision to undertake such raids could be made only after careful political con- sideration by the “highest authority.”* They then quoted several Euro- pean sources to show that the possibility of air warfare directed at civil- ians could not be dismissed.

But they promptly added “When control of the air has been gained, then military objectives other than the hostile air force will receive increasing attention, including perhaps political capitals and cent
