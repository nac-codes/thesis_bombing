ue, who became the new assistant commandant at ACTS in 1934, brought with him an ap- preciation of technological advances in precision bombing and target- ing, including the new Norden bombsight.'™ All bomber advocates, they reinforced one another’s intuitions and logic, and helped to create loyal and tenacious support at ACTS for their mature ideas.'* These ideas were expressed in the “Air Warfare” section of the 1938 “Air Force” text:  [T]he economic structure of a modern highly industrialized nation is char- acterized by the great degree of interdependence of its various elements. Certain of these elements are vital to the continued functioning of the mod- ern nation. If one of these elements is destroyed the whole of the economic  UNITED STATES IN INTERWAR YEARS 161  machine ceases to function. ... Against a highly industrialized nation, air force action has the possibility for such far-reaching effectiveness that such action may produce immediate and decisive results.”"*  The requirements placed on American bombers for coastal defense and sea search put a premium on their ability to find and hit specific targets, and this in turn encouraged the existing orientation toward “precision bombing” of selected targets in an enemy war economy. This was further reinforced by the development of American bombsights, in particular the Norden Mark XV bombsight of 1933, produced by in- ventor Carl Norden, the navy’s in-house designer of cutting-edge tech- nologies.” Precision bombing of selected targets would require, neces- sarily, a process of identifying vulnerable points in the enemy war economy—a process that had already been understood as necessary and vital. Thus, the new capabilities inherent in the B-17 and the Norden sight both facilitated and reinforced the prevailing U.S. conception of air force doctrine: scientific and technological developments dovetailed not only with the existing emphasis on careful selection of targets, but also with the requirements of prev
