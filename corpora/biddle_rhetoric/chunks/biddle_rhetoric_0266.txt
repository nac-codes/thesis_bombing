U.S. conception of air force doctrine: scientific and technological developments dovetailed not only with the existing emphasis on careful selection of targets, but also with the requirements of prevailing moral and ethical strictures. Technology (in a self-proclaimed “high-tech” nation) seemed to make all things possible and, equally, seemed to solve all potential problems.  Along with some ACTS colleagues, Donald Wilson in 1933 engaged in a grapeshot-style letter-writing campaign to solicit information for use in lectures and problem sets. He began by searching for “key node targets” in the American industrial infrastructure; this would serve as a model for similar analyses of other states. His civilian experience with railroads led him to think in terms of critical junctions and potential bottlenecks. In a note of thanks to a colleague who had sent him a list of the components in B-10 and B-12 aircraft, he wrote, “This sort of information puts a new angle on air force operations. . . . It seems to hold the promise of solving all problems of destruction in the most efficient way.”'” From the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War, he requested information on the industry in the northeastern United States, including “principal electric power plants” and “key items and their source in each of the major industries such as: steel, automobiles, clothing, printing, chemicals, rubber, etc.”"°  In August 1935 the Commandant of ACTS asked the Chief of the Air Corps for vital information on the makeup of German cities; the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps in turn requested that the military attaché in Berlin obtain the information.’ A power outage in New York City triggered intense interest in urban power grids. This culminated in an ACTS lecture called “Air Power and the City,” which determined that the New York metropolitan area relied upon twenty-six generating  162 CHAPTER 3  plants within a radius of twenty-two and a half miles.
