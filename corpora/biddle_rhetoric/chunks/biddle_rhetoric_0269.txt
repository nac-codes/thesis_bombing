tors would bear heavily on actions. No planner on ei- ther side of the Atlantic could predict the exact course of a future air war or the amount of political leeway that air forces might be given with respect to targeting.  The Americans understood this just as well as the British did, but the lure of the “industrial fabric” theory—and their growing rhetorical at- tachment to it—inclined them in a particular direction with respect to targeting. They focused on teasing out the main threads in the complex fabric of industrial economies, which they believed could be identified and assessed well in advance of hostilities, providing an almost fool- proof strategy for rapid victory through the precise application of offen- sive air power utilizing the best and most ingenious American technolo- gies. In addition, the moral constraints articulated by Newton Baker (and maintained by policymakers after him), and the long-standing trend in American political thought toward moral “exceptionalism” had put boundaries around Air Corps thinking, reinforcing its inclina- tion toward the relatively tangible “economic sphere.” The luxury of geography and the absence of any worry about sudden “bolts from the blue” unquestionably played a role as well: the Americans were not at this point trying to deter attacks on their own cities, nor were they so worried as the British about the unpredictable and potentially uncon- trollable behavior of their working classes. Also, the absence of any World War I long-range bombing experience meant that the Americans felt no obligation to be consistent with past history. Finally, the Ameri- cans were inclined to dither over the details of air warfare well in ad- vance of actual operations. Unlike Britain’s Ludlow-Hewitt, who in 1927 had eschewed overreliance on “peacetime calculations,” Laurence Kuter of ACTS insisted (if overoptimistically) that “[i]t is highly desir- able to base our computations upon sound mathematical considera- tions, We would av
