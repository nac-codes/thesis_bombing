nce on “peacetime calculations,” Laurence Kuter of ACTS insisted (if overoptimistically) that “[i]t is highly desir- able to base our computations upon sound mathematical considera- tions, We would avoid chance, luck, or hazard and deal only in concrete facts.”"**  To a greater extent than their RAF counterparts, American airmen labored to derive scenarios and target sets, and to identify and assess the most vulnerable points of attack for an air force. This analytical outlook probably owed much to the progressivist tradition and the strong appeal of Taylor’s “scientific management” in the United States.  164 CHAPTER 3  It was reinforced by bitter lessons from the economic crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression that hit the United States particularly hard: specifically, complex, fragile modern economies are subject to major dislocation." Writing in Colliers magazine in 1939, Republican Congressman Bruce Barton gave voice to a widely held impression: “In- dustry is a living body, highly integrated, with nerves extending to every part. Cripple a limb, and the whole body limps, prick even a finger, and the pain is felt throughout.”"*”  The American preoccupation with science and technology could not resolve all the many unforeseen problems inherent in the planning pro- cess, however. This process was undermined by flawed assumptions and by a failure to comprehend fully the heavy—indeed central—demand for high-quality strategic intelligence. Also, overarching enthusiasm for “precision bombing” and faith in American technology seemed to crowd out any concern that such a course of action might prove diffi- cult—even impossible in some circumstances. In the 1930s, test results “showed that bombing was accurate only in excellent weather against a clearly outlined, undefended target in the middle of wide-open terrain.” Committed to an idea, the airmen chose not to countenance completely those things that undermined it. Even as war loomed on the horizon, bomber cre
