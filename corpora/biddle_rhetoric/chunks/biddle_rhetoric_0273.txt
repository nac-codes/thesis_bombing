of the self-defending bomber would remain largely intact until wartime experience would rudely challenge its assumptions."  Examples from past military experience (aside from the World War I aviation experience) were invoked to reinforce subtly the idea that armed forces of an enemy state, when utilizing the initiatives of space and time, were difficult to find and intercept quickly. Armies had been able to maneuver around one another throughout decades of European history, and navies—even as recently as World War I—had successfully evaded one another much of the time. Both the British and the Ameri- cans would point to the “vast expanse of the air above the earth” as a factor in the promised dominance of bombers. But if conclusions rested in part on perceived reality, they rested as well on selective memory and  166 CHAPTER 3  filtering. Like the RAE, the Air Corps generally downplayed informa- tion—available by the late 1930s and based on techological develop- ments—suggesting that bombers would become increasingly vulnerable in light of new breakthroughs enhancing the capabilities of defensive fighters. And (as we shall see next) they largely interpreted the wars of the 1930s in ways that did not disrupt their assumptions about bombers.  The evolution of American thinking about bomber vulnerability is not hard to trace in documents, speeches, and texts. Early post-World War I aviation studies by Americans had revealed a healthy respect for the ability of fighters to intercept bombers. Fighter escorts were recom- mended for bomber formations, even though it was recognized that this would not always be feasible in all situations. In 1922 the commander of the 1st Pursuit Group, Maj. Carl Spaatz, had called for maneuver- able, heavily armed escort fighters with speeds superior to the bombers they were to protect, and ranges equal to them.* In Air Warfare, Wil- liam Sherman made the case for fighter escorts. He argued that while pursuit might not remain continually w
