idea that they could defend themselves. The 1930 “Bom- bardment” text readily acknowledged that pursuit had taken a toll on  UNITED STATES IN INTERWAR YEARS 167  daytime bombing in World War I, forcing all the belligerents toward night operations. But it also made clear the distance limitations faced by pursuit aircraft trying to escort bombers on longer strategic missions.'* The authors accepted Trenchard’s policy of “relentless and incessant offensive.” Concomitantly, they cast doubt upon French concerns, ex- pressed during the war, that the losses from bombing sometimes out- weighed its benefits.” The 1930 “Air Force” text incorporated in bulk arguments that Trenchard had used: “It is not possible to secure control of the air over a wide front. The hostile attack and bombardment with their great range may be expected to avoid the area over which the other belligerent has control of the air, and to enter elsewhere.”'® Later in the text the authors drew an analogy with the oceans: “Even the surface of the sea, which represents a much smaller field than the air above the sea and earth, was large enough to permit units of the Ger- man Navy . .. to elude the unquestionably superior British and Allied Navies for a long period of time during the World War.” Conceding that high altitude bombardment could be detected, the authors nonethe- less asserted that “hostile pursuit will not be able to make contact with it in effective force, until after the bombardment has reached its objec- tive and is on the journey home. . . . As the speeds of attack and bom- bardment increase, the time available to the hostile pursuit to gain con- tact, and to attack them as they fly home, diminishes.”**  Though they had earlier relied on World War I examples for guid- ance, ACTS instructors at this point sought to distance themselves from the inconvenient fact that bombers had often been vulnerable to the enemy. They implied that better tactics and increased speeds would solve the problem,
