they rep- resented improvements over the P-26, neither the Seversky P-35 nor the Curtiss P-36 was a match for the B-17.17"  Not everyone, however, accepted the intellectual orthodoxy of bomber invincibility. Lt. Col. Millard Harmon, while a fan of bomber development, nonetheless lamented the short shrift given to pursuit at ACTS. On a board that reviewed the 1935 “Air Force” text, he argued that it was fully conceivable to imagine an enemy air force defeated by hostile pursuit. Likewise, Lt. Col. A. H. Gilkeson, in charge of the 8th Pursuit Group, argued that dismissiveness toward pursuit had led to “the teaching of doctrines which have not been established as being true  UNITED STATES IN INTERWAR YEARS 169  and might even be fatally dangerous to our aims in the event of armed conflict.” And Major O. S. Ferson pointed to improved radio communi- cation as a factor bearing on the future of defensive pursuit and bomber penetration."”  Capt. Claire Chennault, in charge of pursuit aviation at ACTS from 1931 to 1936, acerbically observed that the bomber ought not to be made “the first exception to the ancient principle that for every weapon there is a new and effective counter weapon.”'” At ACTS, Chennault’s frequent verbal battles with bomber advocate Kenneth Walker became legendary. He believed that a responsive ground agency—a defense warning system using improved radio technologies—could solve the in- tercept problem. Outraged that fighter design had been neglected rela- tive to bomber design, he believed that interpretations of the 1930s exercises were flawed and selective. This position, pregnant with impli- cations for an attacking force, brought him into direct conflict with Lt. Col. Hap Arnold. Indeed, in response to Arnold’s interpretation of the 1934 exercises, Chennault wrote an eight-page critique, arguing that the P-26 was outmoded compared to foreign fighters of far superior quality. He argued further that, instead of proving the invulnerability of bombers
