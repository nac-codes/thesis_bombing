Arnold and Eaker claimed that the war in Spain had produced only “the first crude air warnings, the first faint evidence about what could be ex- pected later in some other and more important localities.”'”' They ar- gued that the “uncertain and indiscriminate undertakings” of these wars did not foreshadow “what the power and effect of a great air force might be and how best it might be combated.”"?  Nonetheless, those responsible for planning and policy at the time did not feel they could completely ignore events overseas. Incoming infor- mation prevented them from doing so, and kept them alive to the com- plexities and difficulties of air warfare. They had to admit, for instance, that anti-aircraft guns and machine guns had made great strides, and that certain “passive” defenses, such as the dispersal of factories and matériel, could be effective in combating the effects of air strikes. In addition, they could not entirely overlook the threat to bomber invin-  UNITED STATES IN INTERWAR YEARS 173  cibility posed by fighter interceptors. In December 1936, U.S. Army in- telligence requested information from military attachés in Rome, Berlin, Paris, London, and Moscow on the types of aircraft being used in the war in Spain, their performance, and their tactical employment.”* The attaché reports were supplemented by articles written by both foreign and American observers of the war. Conclusions varied with each ob- server, but a few key themes were articulated repeatedly: airplanes could effectively disrupt and demoralize troops on the ground;
