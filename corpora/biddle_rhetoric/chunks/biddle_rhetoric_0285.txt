and American observers of the war. Conclusions varied with each ob- server, but a few key themes were articulated repeatedly: airplanes could effectively disrupt and demoralize troops on the ground; and unescorted day bombers would be repeatedly harassed and attacked by defending fighters. Indeed, Condor Legion bombers were driven to nighttime at- tacks just as the bomber forces of World War I had been. Nationalist Air Chief Alfredo Kindelan argued that bombers had to have friendly fighter escort whenever enemy fighters were expected in their area.'*  In August 1937 the Air Corps Newsletter had reprinted an article from Revue de l’Armée de I’Air, whose author noted, “It proves to be very difficult for a bombing multi-seater to get away by day from the attacks of a single-seater pursuit plane; the only effective protection is then in the escorting single-seater.’ Maj. Harrison G. Crocker, who had given the sole lecture on the Spanish civil war at ACTS, argued that to prevail against enemy interceptors, bombers required armament, tight formations, and escort protection. And in the summer of 1938 the U.S. attaché for Air in Spain reported that Spanish military leaders unani- mously agreed that pursuit must come first.’ In addition, American intelligence reports made clear that bombers’ defensive armament had not deterred their attackers.” Other independent reports from Spain and China, brought to the attention of the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps, also cast doubt on the invincibility of bombers.’ All of this helped to keep discussions of escorts alive, even if they were not ac- corded first place on the Air Corps priority list.  The pangs of concern felt at this point by some bomber advocates were intensified when war broke out in Europe in the late summer of 1939. Despite his desire to downplay the impact of the air wars of the late 1930s, General Arnold found himself having to rethink his earlier views on the ability of bombers to penetrate to their targets w
