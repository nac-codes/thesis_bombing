Despite his desire to downplay the impact of the air wars of the late 1930s, General Arnold found himself having to rethink his earlier views on the ability of bombers to penetrate to their targets without assistance. Indeed, Arnold’s discomfort over this issue was such that in November 1939 he wrote a memorandum complaining about the ne- glect of pursuit tactics and technological development. He attributed much of the blame to the way doctrine had been taught in Air Corps schools. Distancing himself from any responsibility, he wrote, “A doc- trine which has been widely propounded in certain Air Corps circles for many years, to the effect that fighter craft cannot shoot down large bombardment planes in formations, has now been proven wholly un- tenable.” In Winged Warfare, published after radar had shown its  174 CHAPTER 3  impact on air war, Arnold (and Eaker) commented revealingly that, “[d]uring daylight and in good weather, when pursuit aviation is pre- sent in strength in an area, it can pretty nearly bar the air to the bomber.” Despite this, enough difficulty, muddle, and self-delusion surrounded the problem of long-range escorts to insure that little prog- ress was made toward a really workable solution. The Americans con- tinued to hang their hats on the self-defending, high altitude bomber. Indeed, only in 1943—after disastrous losses—would the Americans decide finally that unescorted bombers could not successfully shoot their way in and out of foreign territory.  With repetition, both the British and the Americans bomber advocates became so committed to what they believed to be the fundamental con- cepts of long-range aerial assault that they downplayed or dismissed plausible alternative scenarios. A passage from the ACTS 1935 “Bom- bardment” text read, “During the time devoted to the sighting opera- tion and release of bombs, the bombing teams must disregard the hos- tile pursuit and concentrate entirely upon the task at hand.” The authors added, “A well
