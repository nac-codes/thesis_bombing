ited States Army Air Forces (USAAF), would enter into war with limited numbers of aircraft and an untested faith that high altitude, “precision” daylight bombers would be able to reach their targets unescorted. This point of view would bring them into con- flict with their British allies who understood, through direct experience, the risks and hazards of trying to fly over Germany in daylight. No small issue, this conflict not only dominated early discussions about an Anglo-American Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO), but also shaped the nature of the wartime interaction between the two national air forces. The early years of the war saw the British and the Americans seek out ways to work together during a hazardous and often bleak  178 CHAPTER 4  period of mutual dependence, and to develop the means of waging a sustained air offensive over Europe in the face of effective German defenses.  PLANS, TARGETS, AND LIMITATIONS,  As we saw in chapter 2, preparation for war in the late 1930s finally had forced the RAF to harmonize the strategic goals of the Air Staff with the actual capabilities of Bomber Command; overarching guidance and plans had to be informed by operational realities. The planning process in general had been a sobering exercise for the RAF, and the process of drawing up operational guidance was especially so. The de- velopment of the “Western Air Plans” (WA Plans) for the first time “caused the strategy and tactics of the bombing offensive to be consid- ered with due regard to the actual conditions under which warfare would be carried on.”* The plans and their updates rested in part on intelligence provided by a number of specialized committees that would evolve over time in capability and sophistication.’ By the end of 1940 the Ministry of Economic Warfare (MEW) Intelligence Department would have a permanent representative on the Joint Intelligence Com- mittee (JIC) of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and some influence over policy. But the system that
