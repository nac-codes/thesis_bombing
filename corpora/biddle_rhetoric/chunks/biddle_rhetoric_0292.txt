But the system that emerged was not perfect, and tension would exist throughout the war between the Air Staff and the various agencies offering it advice and counsel.’  Though serious war planning had begun earlier, Bomber Command’s role in the process had greatly increased in late 1937 when the Air Staff sent it a list of plans, including instructions to concentrate on three of them: W.A.1, the attack on the German air striking force; W.A.4, the attack on German military rail, canal, and road communications; and W.A.S5, the attack on German war industry, particularly oil.’ These three target sets headed a more extensive list that was reevaluated constantly throughout the early years of the war. Some of the more unusual target- ing possibilities (recalling some of the odder schemes of WWI), included attacks on German forests and crops using air-delivered incendiary bombs, weed seeds, and entomological and biological vectors. Despite their technical difficulties, some believed that such attacks might have a great “moral effect” on the German civil population.’ Implementation of any of the plans would depend on developing contingencies and on the behavior of the Germans in war.  W.A.1 assigned Bomber Command a role in defending the nation and thwarting a “knock-out blow” by attacking the infrastructure and sup- ply of the Luftwaffe.

The Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command, Sir Edgar Ludlow- Hewitt, thought it might
