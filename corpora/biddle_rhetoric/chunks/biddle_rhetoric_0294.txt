link”: oil, plus concentrated attacks in the Ruhr to inflict both material and moral damage. They warned, “The longer we postpone the attack of oil after the ‘gloves are off’ and serious operations begin, the weaker our Air Striking Force will become and the stronger the enemy defenses will grow.” While the strategists recognized that they could not account for all contingencies, they felt that their plans were sufficiently flexible to “attain the degree of disloca- tion aimed at in the particular industry.”  Bomber Command was more optimistic in its assessment of W.A.5 than the other plans, and Ludlow-Hewitt showed a particular interest in night attacks as a means of causing the maximum disruption and incon- venience for Germany. He cited World War I, referring specifically to “bombing for purposes of disturbance,” which, he argued (in a way that reflected the tone of the post-World War I assessments) had caused 70-75 percent of the effect of bomb raids on Britain in World War I.*  180 CHAPTER 4  The Air Ministry hoped that W.A.5, through the general dislocation it would cause, might also help indirectly to stem the German ground advance. When joint staff talks opened between the British and French, however, the French were unconvinced that British air plans would ap- preciably assist the ground war: they would not commit to the British view that a “serious attack on the Ruhr” would interfere with the movement of the [German] army, and also “break the morale of the German people and their will to fight.”  But while Ludlow-Hewitt felt that W.A.5 was the best of the available alternatives, he remained pessimistic about Bomber Command’s capa- bilities. His proximity to the problem meant that he could not avoid what he knew to be a crisis. His views were reflected in a series of bleak letters to the Air Ministry that sought to instill a sense of urgency, and to drive home the need to achieve a high technical standard in all as- pects of long-range bombing.
