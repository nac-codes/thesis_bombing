ies of bleak letters to the Air Ministry that sought to instill a sense of urgency, and to drive home the need to achieve a high technical standard in all as- pects of long-range bombing. In a letter of 30 August 1938, he even challenged the Air Ministry's conventional wisdom on long-range es- corts, arguing that, while he too saw no ready answer to the problem, evidence from China and Spain suggested that the question be revisited. Subsequently he pointed out that the assumed range of the Blenheim bomber (792 miles) had proved in practice to be only 700 miles.’ In a November 1938 meeting to discuss the assumptions for war planning, he argued that any early attempt to send bombers deep into enemy territory might “end in a major disaster.” He therefore recommended that Bomber Command “start with targets fairly close in and gradually to penetrate further and further.”’”  In March 1939, Ludlow-Hewitt submitted a detailed, thirty-one-page report on the requirements and deficiencies in Bomber Command. In late May 1939, he continued his Jeremiad, complaining that Bomber Command’s crews were insufficiently trained (especially in navigation and air gunnery) and that inadequate provision had been made for such necessities as a permanent bombing range and practice in low-flying attacks." While conceding some of Ludlow-Hewitt’s points, the CAS (Air Chief Marshal Sir Cyril Newall) was not prepared to face the full implications of them. The Air Staff had kept itself from comprehending the full scope of Bomber Command’s problems in the 1930s, and when these were finally and unambiguously laid out by Ludlow-Hewitt, the Air Staff found his candor rather too jarring. Though recognizing the soundness of force conservation, Newall nonetheless insisted in early 1939 that Bomber Command must be prepared in an emergency to carry out attacks on essential enemy targets. Later, in May 1939, he argued that Ludlow-Hewitt’s outlook was overly pessimistic.” This ten- sion not only recalled the
