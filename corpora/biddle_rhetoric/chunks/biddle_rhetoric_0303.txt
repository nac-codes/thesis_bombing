would have an impor- tant cumulative impact on the nerves of the German people. Though they recognized that they were placing their faith in an “imponderable factor”—the will and morale of the German population—they felt that it was a “practicable course to adopt.”*  By early March 1940, Ludlow-Hewitt already was beginning to turn the focus of his force to night bombing. It had many drawbacks, but these seemed, at least, less formidable than the ones posed by daylight attack. On the night of 19 March 1940, in response to a German air attack near Scapa Flow, Bomber Command struck its first land target, the isolated seaplane base at Hornum on the isle of Sylt, chosen in part because of the low likelihood of collateral casualties. Although the crews claimed to have identified and bombed the target, photo- reconnaissance revealed no evidence of damage done. (In one bit of good news, only one of the dispatched bombers failed to return.) Bomber Command would soon admit that only about half of its average crews could be expected to identify and attack targets at night except in the very best conditions of visibility. This was an inauspicious start to what would become a five-year campaign of increasing tempo and fury.  In early April, Air Marshal Charles Portal took over from Ludlow- Hewitt the leadership of Bomber Command. Shortly thereafter Ger- many invaded Norway and Denmark. A month later Hitler commenced his ground offensive against the Low Countries and France. German air attacks against Rotterdam made it clear that Germany intended no spe- cial treatment for Western Europe. Bomber Command was unavoidably drawn into the ground war. But, as the Wehrmacht rolled westward, the RAF could not substantially aid the French or the British Expeditionary Force, and the French were understandably nervous about any RAF bombing that might provoke retaliation against them. On 4 June, DCAS Air Vice-Marshal Sholto Douglas summed things up when he told Portal laconically: “the stre
