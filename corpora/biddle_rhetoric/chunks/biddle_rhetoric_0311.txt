Still, even when working-class robustness was acknowl- edged, it was sometimes attributed to unflattering causes like ignorance of the military and political situation.”  Unsurprisingly, assessments of the impact of specific enemy air at- tacks often reflected the prevailing assumptions of those doing the as- sessing.
