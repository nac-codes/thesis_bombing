ians had the enormous psychological advantage of being able, simply, to move out of the way. They had far greater physi- cal (and thus psychological) freedom than soldiers who had no choice but to stay put. And civilians were not forcibly separated from their homes and from familiar social conditions. This sense of connectedness to the familiar was an important element of mental stability."  In response to a Gallup poll asking what had made them most de- pressed that winter, Londoners in early 1941 ranked the weather over aerial bombing.® Overall, the British endured their ordeal with calm, determination, and public-spiritedness. But if this news was felicitous for those charged with keeping homefront morale high, it was rather more problematical for those who argued in favor of air attacks aimed at German morale. As noted above, though, the contradiction was not grasped: the British were “tougher” than the Germans, and the British would pursue a more determined, overwhelming air offensive than their enemy had done.®  Optimism about the potential of British bombing was revealed in an interesting correspondence between Bomber Command chief Sir Rich- ard Peirse and Polish authorities. In January 1941, Peirse received a letter directly from Count Stefan Zamoyski, writing on the authority of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, asking if it might be possi- ble for Bomber Command to attack a German concentration camp in southwest Poland called Oswiecim (Auschwitz). Peirse put the question to Portal, stating, “If you judge it to be a desirable diversion . . . then I could undertake it with a small Wellington force under suitable moon- light conditions.” Portal did not judge it to be a desirable diversion since he could see no way to carry it out with any hope of success. He told Peirse to prepare a letter to Zamoyski explaining the difficulties. Peirse thus regretfully informed Zamoyski that limitations on accuracy  192 CHAPTER 4  and the weight of bombs that could
