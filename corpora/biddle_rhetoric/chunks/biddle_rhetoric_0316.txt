targets were whole German towns.””!  Later in the year Portal held out against resurrecting the oil plan. In May, DCAS Air Vice-Marshal Sir Norman Bottomley argued that in the five months since the oil directive had been issued, it had been shown that the plan was not feasible due to the difficulty of reaching and rec- ognizing the targets. Bottomley recommended a campaign aimed at the “destruction of the morale of the population of certain vital industrial centers.”” As their hopes for selective targeting faded, the members of the Air Staff increasingly accepted Portal’s view. Unsurprisingly, events had led them to become more receptive to arguments and “evidence” that area attacks designed to undermine German morale might prove efficacious. The wish became father to the thought.  Despite their lack of clarity about the meaning of the term, officials engaged in a good deal of speculation about enemy morale. By late 1940 it was widely held in policymaking circles that German morale was weaker than British morale: the German people, already wearied by rearmament and fearful of further wartime burdens, would not with- stand widespread bombardment.” This view was endorsed by the Chiefs of Staff at the beginning of 1941, in a report arguing that the Germans had been undernourished and subject to strain throughout the whole period of Hitler’s regime, and were thus more subject to collapse than a nation of greater stamina. The report suggested that harassing action and incendiary attacks on the centers of German population might pro- duce internal disruption. One of the several factors it ignored, however, was that the German standard of living under Hitler was higher than it had been in the years of economic depression.”  In May 1941 the retired Lord Trenchard weighed into the debate through a memorandum to Churchill, which was then forwarded to the Chiefs of Staff. Using his peculiar mathematics to support the notion that no bomb is wasted on a city, he proclaimed that
