Material dam- age would be negligible and the enemy’s morale, if not stimulated, will certainly be strengthened in a very short time.” But Portal held his ground, arguing for “dispersal so as to set the sirens blowing in as many areas as possible.””  Churchill’s intense disappointment with the record of Bomber Com- mand spurred him to lash out at Portal, triggering the autumn confron- tation detailed in the introductory chapter of this volume. Though Churchill vented his many pent-up frustrations over the disparity be- tween prewar RAF claims and its actual performance to date, he did not take up Portal’s challenge to reengineer British grand strategy to shift resources away from Bomber Command and toward other fighting arms. Despite its failure to contribute much of anything to the early war effort, Bomber Command still looked to Churchill like a much-needed tool in the British arsenal; after all, no other service could take the offensive, however limited, against Germany and thereby help sustain British homefront morale. Churchill remained anxious, however, about whether Bomber Command would “justify the large proportion of the national effort devoted to it.”  Though the existence of Bomber Command helped buoy the home- front, it is just as well that its early operations were not disclosed in much detail. In the autumn of 1940, Bomber Command lost through crashes six times the number of aircraft shot down or lost over enemy territory through other causes.” And a year later when, on 1 October 1941, Bomber Command’s assigned targets were in Stuttgart and Karls- rithe, its planes were reported wandering over twenty-seven other cities.” Without sophisticated scientific aids for navigation and target finding, the job of finding anything smaller than a city became a matter of chance—and, often, locating cities themselves was beyond the ability of British crews. Also, Bomber Command crews in 1940-41 occasionally dr
