of finding anything smaller than a city became a matter of chance—and, often, locating cities themselves was beyond the ability of British crews. Also, Bomber Command crews in 1940-41 occasionally dropped remarkably high percentages of their total load on dummy in- stallations, erected carefully and elaborately by the Germans to draw British fire away from real targets. During one raid on Berlin in 1941, for instance, RAF crews dropped forty-three times more high explosives and forty-seven times more incendiaries on a dummy installation than on the city itself.”  RHETORIC AND REALITY, 1939-1942 197  During this period Bomber Command’s offensive remained viable only because of the commitment, determination, and stoicism of its crews. Throughout the six years of its campaign, about half the total aircrews who served were killed. Out of every hundred men who joined operational training units, only twenty-four would avoid death, injury, and/or German prisoner of war camps. As Mark Wells has pointed out, “No other Western Allied combatants, except for their American day- light bombing counterparts, suffered the same huge casualties, nor faced the mathematical certainty of their own deaths so routinely and so un- flinchingly.””  Whether fair or not, the performance of a military organization inev- itably is associated with its commander. In light of Bomber Command’s 1941 record, Sir Richard Peirse’s reputation was hardly on the rise. Por- tal’s patience with Peirse had already run thin when, on the night of 7 November 1941, Bomber Command lost thirty-seven aircraft in bad weather. Peirse claimed that the weather had deteriorated unexpectedly and that the inexperience of his crews had contributed to the debacle. But Portal concluded that Peirse had ignored his own meteorologists.” The stage was set for a change in leadership. Before that change was effected, however, a new bombing directive came to dominate Bomber Command’s operations. It represented the culmination of mo
