the position of Bomber Com- mand at a crucial moment.  When Harris was brought in to take command, his colleagues at the Air Staff knew exactly what they were getting. Harris had never been one to hide his personality, his predilections, or his prepossessions. In his autobiographical account of the war, written in 1947, Harris would explain that for nearly twenty years he had “watched the army and navy, both singly and in concert, engineer one deliberate attempt after another to destroy the Royal Air Force.”** Among airmen, Harris seemed particularly to have internalized this threat to RAF indepen- dence; it had made him defensive and bitter throughout his RAF career, and it would bear heavily on his behavior during World War II. Aside from Trenchard himself, no other RAF officer of the period was so con- sistently antagonistic toward the other services as Harris.  A committed bomber advocate, Harris had a perspective on strategic bombing that did not fit neatly into either the Trenchardian or Tiver-  RHETORIC AND REALITY, 1939-1942 199  tonian camp. Like Trenchard, Harris fully expected that bombing would have a psychological effect, but he did not separate this out or elevate it above the impact of actual physical destruction. To Harris it was all of a piece: the moral and the material—the direct and the indi- rect—were inextricably linked. As he would later explain to Lord Tren- chard, his own view of efficient bombing was simply to do the maxi- mum amount of damage possible to Germany’s most important industrial-politico-morale objectives.”” In the same vein, he viewed at- tempts to seek out Tivertonian “bottlenecks” or “key nodes” (to use a later American term) as too clever by half. Indeed, he would scornfully refer to quests for such targets as “panacea mongering,” making deri- sive reference, for instance, to the “Schweinfurt fans” who wanted to strike German ball bearings, and the “oily boys” who sought to priori- tize petroleum targets. Harris believed, i
