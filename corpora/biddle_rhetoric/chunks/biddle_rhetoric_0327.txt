e same time that no fire fighting services, however efficiently and quickly they were reinforced . . . could get them under control.” But Harris did not feel that the German attacks on Britain had offered much of a window into what a larger and more determined British air offensive might accomplish. He was convinced, in particular, that the effects of accretion would be decisive: “There was every reason to expect not only that one thousand acres of devastation  200 CHAPTER 4  in a town would cause more than ten times the loss of output resulting from the destruction of one hundred acres, but also that when a large number of towns was similarly devastated the total loss of output could not be estimated merely by adding together the various acreages of dev- astation in all the towns.”' Along with this, Harris believed that non- industrial damage caused from air raids—damage to public utilities, gas lines, sewers, and so on—had an important impact on the enemy. All this left him well suited to implement the directive of 14 February 1942. Some air staff members, however, viewed the area bombing directive as a temporary expedient to be implemented only while Bomber Com- mand was expanding its strength and improving its target-finding abili- ties. This difference of views would lead to great difficulties later on.'*  Harris’s efforts to bolster the fortunes of Bomber Command and to focus it on city bombing received some assistance early on from Churchill’s scientific advisor, Lord Cherwell. On 30 March 1942, Cher- well addressed a memorandum to the prime minister asserting that bombing Germany’s fifty-eight principal towns would be decisive. The claim drew on data from a Ministry of Home Security report, still being written up, on air raids in the British cities of Birmingham and Hull. But, according to one of the two authors of that report, Cherwell’s use of the data was problematical, and his interpretation of its main finding on morale was “misguided.” Cherwell argued
