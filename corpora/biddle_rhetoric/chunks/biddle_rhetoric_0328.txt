But, according to one of the two authors of that report, Cherwell’s use of the data was problematical, and his interpretation of its main finding on morale was “misguided.” Cherwell argued that the “de-housing” of people in those towns had produced signs of strain, and that if such effects could be multiplied by a factor of ten, “there seems little doubt that this would break the spirit of the [German] people.” Cherwell also expected that worker productivity would be greatly depressed. But the Birmingham-Hull report had concluded, in fact, that there was no evi- dence of panic in either town, and, aside from some alarm and anxiety always associated with air raids, there was no mass antisocial behavior. Loss of production was caused almost entirely by direct damage to fac- tories, and that loss had been only about 5 percent.'®*  Though the report on Birmingham and Hull could not have spoken directly to the likely effects of much larger raids, it provided no basis for the assumptions that Cherwell drew from it; his conclusions rested on equal parts selective reading and wishful thinking. Similarly, the Air Ministry’s own summary of the report drew policy conclusions, in a section titled “Practical Application,” that did not flow naturally from the evidence. Many years later the official historians would point out, “[T]hese policy decisions could not be justified by the probability calcu- lations themselves because the calculations seemed probable only to those who, in any case, believed in the policy.”!"*  Nonetheless, Cherwell’s intervention had an important impact at a crucial moment.
