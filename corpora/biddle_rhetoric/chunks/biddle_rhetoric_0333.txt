THE UNITED STATES AND THE PREPARATION FOR WAR  In late January 1938, President Roosevelt, declaring American defenses inadequate in light of the troubling world situation, had asked for ap- propriations for naval construction and air defense. By year’s end he recommended an augmented Army Air Forces of 20,000 planes and an annual capacity of 24,000 aircraft. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall likewise supported the Air Corps request for the newest B-17B bombers. In January 1939, Roosevelt asked congress for $300 million for the Air Corps, which, at the time consisted of 1,700 tactical and training craft, 1,600 officers, and some 18,000 enlisted men.

A press release of 3 April 1939 explained that the War Department was prepared to acquire “the best types of aircraft now in existence,” begin- ning an expansion that would continue through 1944."°  During the interwar years, Roosevelt had hoped for an international agreement that would limit the effects of aerial bombing. When this hope faded and war came to Europe, he came full circle and advocated  204 CHAPTER 4  the creation of a serious American air force. Fearful of the Germans, particularly of their scientific and technological abilities, Roosevelt felt he had to support a bomber force to deter German attacks on the Amer- ican east coast, and, if necessary, to help fight and win a war in Europe. Roosevelt’s concerns about Germany were reinforced by the highly in- flated German production figures given him by U.S. Army intelligence sources. One estimate postulated that Germany would produce 42,500 aircraft in 1941; in fact, the true figure was 11,776—with no true stra- tegic bomber of long range." Nonetheless, the perception mattered more
