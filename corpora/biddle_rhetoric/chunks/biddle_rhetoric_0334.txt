ne estimate postulated that Germany would produce 42,500 aircraft in 1941; in fact, the true figure was 11,776—with no true stra- tegic bomber of long range." Nonetheless, the perception mattered more than the reality. Roosevelt hoped that a vast air program would deter Hitler, bolster American confidence, and arm the British and French against German aggression."  When war broke out in Europe in September 1939, the United States declared its neutrality and concentrated on developing the strength to keep the Axis powers out of the western hemisphere; Roosevelt’s first concern was hemispheric defense. But American planners soon realized that the survival of the Allies in Europe, especially Britain, would help forestall an attack on the United States. Thus, long before it was drawn into the conflict, the United States undertook to provide material aid to those states fighting the Axis. This task, on top of an ever-expanding domestic military build-up aimed at hemisphere defense, war prepara- tion, and deterrence of Japan in the Far East, put an enormous initial strain on American production. By late 1939 the U.S. aircraft industry had a backlog of orders totaling $630 million; of this, $400 million was attributable to foreign orders.'”  By 1940, when aid to the Allies had become avowed American policy, a radical expansion of facilities enabled the United States to begin to become the “arsenal of democracy.” On 16 May 1940, for instance, the president called for an annual output of 50,000 aircraft: the American aircraft industry was asked to expand twentyfold.’” Just as they had in 1917, the Americans turned to the prospect of an aerial fighting force. Preferable to a large land army, a high technology alternative like air power promised a way to prosecute war in a cleaner, briefer, and more effective way than had been the case during the disillusioning and dis- tasteful 1917-18 ground war in Europe. Even though U.S. military spending expanded across the board, it was
