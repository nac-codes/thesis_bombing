His time in Britain did convince Spaatz, however, that civilian populations were ro- bust and therefore it would be harder to shatter enemy morale than  206 CHAPTER 4  some proponents of bombing had expected.” Spaatz held fast to those ideas that defined the thinking and self-identity of his organization. Thus, he failed to realize, for instance, that acquiring a long-range es- cort fighter ought to be an immediate priority for the Americans. He reacted more flexibly to those things less dear to the heart of his service, such as the impact of bombing on morale. Like his RAF colleagues, he observed the battle of Britain through cognitive filters that carefully pre- served his preexisting views. “The English have developed real air power,” he argued, “whereas the Germans so far appear to have devel- oped a mass of air geared toward the army and [are] lost when con- fronted with properly applied air effort.”””  At this point, American air planning went forward as part of a broader effort to determine national strategic priorities in the event of American entry into the European war. Ironically, just as the British were beginning seriously to contemplate a shift to area attacks, the Americans were confirming their commitment to the selective attack of industrial targets. This commitment was codified in AWPD/1 (Air War Plans Division), written in August 1941. Triggered by President Roose- velt’s request for aircraft production information from the newly desig- nated U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF), the plan assumed that a “sus- tained air offensive” would prove crucial in a war against Hitler.
