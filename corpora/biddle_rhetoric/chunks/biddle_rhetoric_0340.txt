had not found any solution to the escort problem. While the board saw a need for auxiliary tanks for fighters, and also for increasing the safety of bombers on deep penetration raids, it “never connected the single engine pursuit aircraft and drop tanks with the bomber protection problem.” If this oversight seems remarkable in hindsight, it speaks to the power of cognitive filters and the enduring blind spots they can produce. Undaunted by either the German or Brit- ish conversion to night operations in the face of unacceptable daylight losses, the Americans convinced themselves that the superior speed and armament of the B-17, along with the maintenance of tighter forma- tions, would avoid the troubles faced by European bombers.  208 CHAPTER 4  Another key assumption of the plan was that American bombers would exploit the accuracy and precision of the gyro-stabilized Norden bombsight to destroy targets at the rate calculated. The faith placed in high-altitude “precision” bombing had yet to be challenged. It rested on data derived from artificial training conditions and bombing competi- tions that bore little resemblance to the operational demands of war in Europe.’ Although the AWPD/1 planners tried to account for the dif- ferences, they still made some mistaken assumptions, such as the num- ber of sorties required to destroy a target, and the number of sorties that could be flown per month given the weather in northern Europe. These problems insured that the plan would have to be altered later, sometimes dramatically, based on operational experience.  In December 1941 the shock of Pearl Harbor focused Allied attention on the American plan for air warfare. Despite the direct attack by Japan, President Roosevelt saw Hitler’s Germany as the more immedi- ate threat to American security. This perception, which had been for- malized in Anglo-American staff conversations earlier in the year, un- derscored the priority of American planning for a European war. For Churchi
