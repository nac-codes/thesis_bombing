to the Axis war effort,” would develop in three phases. First, U.S. bombers, aided by U.S. and RAF fighter protection, would attack tar- gets within the radius of action of RAF fighter forces. Second, U.S. bombers would attack objectives within the radius of action of both USS. and RAF fighters, relying principally on U.S. fighter cover, and ex- tending the range of attacks. Finally the United States would “develop its full day bomber offensive,” drawing upon RAF cooperation and sup- port as needed."  As had been the case for the RAF, target selection for the Eighth Air Force initially was governed by the limitations of the force. Targets pri- oritized early on included aircraft factories and repair depots, marshall- ing yards, and submarine installations. The early efforts were designed as well to determine U.S. capacity to destroy point targets by “daylight accuracy bombing” and to “beat off fighter opposition and to evade anti-aircraft opposition.” "* AWPD/42, an update of the original U.S. air war plan, and the most comprehensive plan produced by USAAF Head- quarters, was completed in September 1942. However, AWPD/42 ap- peared before a satisfactory body of intelligence had been developed to serve as its foundation. A program for selective targeting necessarily had to rest on very detailed and accurate analyses of the enemy war economy. In order to provide this analytical infrastructure, General Ar- nold authorized in December the creation of what would become the Committee of Operations Analysts (COA), a group of service and civil- ian personnel tasked with assimilating and analyzing industrial intel- ligence from all available sources. Subcommittees were established to study crucial elements of the German economy, including petroleum, aircraft production, transportation, and food.’ For the remainder of the war, the COA strove to put American target planning on as sound a foundation as possible. Nonetheless, hunches and best guesses some- times had to substitu
