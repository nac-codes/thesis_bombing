On 16 September he wrote directly to Roosevelt urging him to prioritize the production of aircraft. One month later Churchill diplomatically informed Roosevelt’s special as- sistant, Harry Hopkins, that the British were not as optimistic as the Americans about the initial efforts of the USAAF over France. He warned against the danger of committing too fully to producing bombers suited only to daylight work.''
