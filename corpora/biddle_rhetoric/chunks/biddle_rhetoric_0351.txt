OFFENSIVE 215  the January 1943 Casablanca conference on Allied grand strategy. In a presentation to Churchill, Gen. Ira Eaker lobbied hard for the American position. His briefing text was designed to help the Americans hold their ground against the prime minister’s persuasive powers. What Eaker and his colleagues did not know, however, was that Churchill’s own advisors had worked to persuade him to allow the Americans to go their own way.
