Such general language contained some- thing for everyone, and gave a good deal of latitude for interpretation to the field commanders. Harris found in it a continuing endorsement of his approach. Though Portal was theoretically in control of what was now called the “Combined Bomber Offensive” (CBO), the real power was in the hands of Harris and Eaker, since the tactical decisions of field commanders often were as consequential as higher-level strategic plans.  In March, the American Committee of Operations Analysts (COA) submitted targeting recommendations to Gen. Hap Arnold, endorsing selective targeting designed to “cause a high degree of destruction in a few really essential industries or services.”* American operational plans, drawn up by Eaker and finalized in April (as the “Eaker plan”), rested on the assumption that “precision pattern bombing” was tactically feas-  216 CHAPTER S  ible from high altitude (20,000 and 30,000 feet) in the face of enemy defense—a proposition the Americans felt had been “proven” by their bomber raids waged in the first three months of 1943. But Eaker under- stood that the success of his plan would hinge on winning air superi- ority; he would attack the Luftwaffe in the factories where its aircraft were made, and, to the greatest extent possible, in the air as well.*  The primacy of counterforce operations and the general thrust of the Eaker plan, which drew on long-standing themes in American bombing theory, were reflected in the draft of the Pointblank bombing directive. Drawn up with the assistance of American and British economists and operations analysts, revised, and then submitted to the Combined Chiefs of Staff in May, Pointblank identified six target systems compris- ing seventy-six precision targets, the
