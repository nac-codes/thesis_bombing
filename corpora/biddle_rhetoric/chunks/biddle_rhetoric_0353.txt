British economists and operations analysts, revised, and then submitted to the Combined Chiefs of Staff in May, Pointblank identified six target systems compris- ing seventy-six precision targets, the destruction of which, it was claimed, would gravely impair the Axis war effort.‘ It warned that the Germans were rapidly building their fighter defenses so as better to pro- tect their vital industries. The authors stressed that “if the growth of the German fighter strength is not arrested quickly, it may become literally impossible to carry out the destruction planned and thus to create the conditions necessary for ultimate decisive action by our combined forces on the Continent.”’ Thus, the German fighter force was desig- nated the “intermediate objective” that would take ial priority as a means of establishing the conditions for an extension of the bomber offensive, and also as a means of establishing air superiority over Ger- many prior to the opening of an Allied second front.  In endorsing Pointblank, Portal and his staff accepted many of the assumptions that underlay American air theory. Significantly, Point- blank acknowledged that German fighters threatened both the Ameri- can daylight and the British nighttime campaign, and endorsed a coun- terforce campaign against the Luftwaffe over an aerial guerre de course. The plan directed that Eighth Air Force day raids should be comple- mented by RAF bombing attacks against the surrounding industrial area at night; the authors pointed out that, “Fortunately the industrial areas to be attacked are in most cases identical with the industrial areas which the British Bomber Command has selected for mass destruction anyway.”* Harris, however, was guarded in his attitude to Pointblank. While he had posed no major objections to the Eaker plan, he would allow himself to be pulled only so far toward selective targeting, even to denude Luftwaffe strength. He was much less interested in “intermedi- ate objectives” than in what
