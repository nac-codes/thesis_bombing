He was much less interested in “intermedi- ate objectives” than in what he believed to be a more direct and effec- tive utilization of bombers: the attack on cities. Accordingly, he man- aged to revise the language of the Pointblank draft to give him the latitude necessary to continue the general area offensive.’ In the event,  COMBINED BOMBER OFFENSIVE 217  he only infrequently coordinated Bomber Command’s raids with those undertaken by the Americans. In order to maintain support for his com- mand, though, he knew he had to produce results. Under such circum- stances, 1943 became—in the words of the British official historians—a “bombing competition” rather than a combined offensive."”  The years 1942 and 1943 had brought ever-increasing operational strength to Bomber Command; indeed, the British official historians have argued that 1942 was “the turning point” in the operational devel- opment of the force. The incendiary technique was demonstrated against Luebeck in March of that year and many more such attacks followed, aided by new target-finding devices. The Pathfinder Force, in which skilled crews marked targets at night, was created in August. And special units proved themselves capable of remarkable accuracy on oc- casion. But the whole of the force, which continued to focus on area bombing, became increasingly deadly in light of special developments in pyrotechnic bombs and incendiary clusters. In July 1943, Bomber Com- mand raised a firestorm in Hamburg that leveled five square miles of the city center.”  On 7 June 1943, just days before Pointblank officially took effect, the cover of Time magazine featured Harris’s profile superimposed over a drawing of repeated hammer blows against a gradually shattering Nazi swastika.
