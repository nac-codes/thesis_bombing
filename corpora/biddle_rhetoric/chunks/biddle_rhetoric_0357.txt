ok and caused no end of headaches for his colleagues and supe- riors. He was too quick to assume that those who prioritized naval targets were short-sighted or insufficiently “air-minded.” In August 1943 the Secretary of State for Air, Sir Archibald Sinclair, wrote to Harris in exasperation: “I know that nothing I can say will undermine your conviction that we in the Air Ministry are all in a nefarious con- spiracy to ham-string Bomber Command! I only wish that you could hear what the other commands say to me about the favouritism with which your command is deliberately . . . treated by us here.” Harris’s views stood in stark contrast to those with a wider perspective.

He did not feel compelled to shroud his work in a guise designed to make it more palatable for the public, and he
