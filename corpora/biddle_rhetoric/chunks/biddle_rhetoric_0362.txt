apparent.” And a March 1943 letter from the U.S. Embassy, which conveyed information from its Legation in Helsinki, claimed that an eyewitness to Bomber Command attacks on Berlin reported terrific dev- astation and panic among the city’s citizens.” But these assessments, like all assessments of moral effect, were inherently subjective and liable to be interpreted according to the predispositions of the interpreter.  In addition, Harris believed that bomb damage assessments resting on photographic interpretation were inaccurate and failed to tell the whole truth. He expressed his views to Portal on this matter several times,  222 CHAPTER S$  pointing out that damage to German housing was more extensive, ac- cording to some German sources, than British sources indicated. He asserted that, particularly when built-up areas were at issue, damage was generally much more widespread than official reports implied. By questioning the work of British intelligence, Harris could retain his views about city bombing even as evidence mounted against its efficacy; and he could remain optimistic that the continued growth and improve- ment of Bomber Command would soon push Germany to collapse.” Such collapse, he hoped, might be provoked by an air assault on Berlin, planned for the long winter nights of 1943-44.  American airmen, too, were finding sources of optimism, and were reassuring themselves with wishful thinking. A report done under the auspices of the Chief of the Air Staff and the Commanding General of the U.S. Eighth Air Force, covering the period February to October 1943, argued that “all evidence points to the fact that conditions in Germany are resolving themselves into an ever more acute conflict of priorities, and a marked deterioration in morale.” The report argued, as well, that concentrated daylight attacks on single vital systems (like fighter factories) “are likely to have produced within that industry far in excess of the sum of the visible damage.” Like Harris,
