Those planners, both American and British, who believed that Point- blank was key not only to a wider bomber offensive but also to an Allied second front, understood that it could not be allowed to fail. Heightened tensions led to recriminations. General Arnold wrote to Portal asking why Fighter Command could not be of greater help to American bombers. Explaining that Fighter Command aircraft had ines- capable range limitations, Portal went on to argue that, in his view, the difficulties faced by the Eighth Air Force were due to the Americans’ failure to make good on their production and reinforcement schedule.“  Realizing that the year’s setbacks may have put his command in jeop- ardy, Eaker wrote to Arnold on 16 November 1943.
