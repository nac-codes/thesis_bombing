sumed overall leadership of the two air forces as commander of the United States Strategic Air Forces (USSTAF) in Eu- rope. When Spaatz took up his new post in late December 1943, he arrived at a critical moment. The pressures on him were very great, but he was able to take advantage of some things Eaker had been denied: American production finally was hitting its stride, and victory in the battle of the Atlantic meant that it was now much easier to transport the fruits of that production to Britain. And, despite heavy attrition from September 1943 to May 1944, the number of fully operational heavy bombers in the Eighth Air Force increased from 461 to 1,655, and fighter aircraft rose from 274 to 882. By mid-February, the Fif- teenth Air Force was able to add twelve heavy bomber groups and four fighter groups to the total Allied effort in Europe. Just as critically, the supply pipeline from the United States was beginning to include new aircraft—long-range fighter escorts—which would ultimately turn the tables for the Allied air war in Europe.  ‘As we have seen, the problem of building a long-range escort capable of holding its own against enemy short-range defensive fighters had looked largely intractable to both the British and Americans. And their motivation to push onward toward a solution was surely undermined by their readiness to believe that escorts might not be needed anyway if bomber crews were adequately motivated to wage an aggressive offen- sive. During the early years of the war, the British remained pessimistic about the possibilities for escorts, while the Americans maintained the same conflicted attitudes that had characterized their interwar machina- tions on the subject.’ On the one hand, they recognized the problem and, on occasion, expressed a desire to address it; on the other, they tried to reassure themselves that there might be no need for such a plane. If the 1941 American plan AWPD/1 had called for the develop- ment of escorts as a kind of
