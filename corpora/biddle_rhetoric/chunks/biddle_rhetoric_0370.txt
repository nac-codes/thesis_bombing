to address it; on the other, they tried to reassure themselves that there might be no need for such a plane. If the 1941 American plan AWPD/1 had called for the develop- ment of escorts as a kind of insurance policy, it nonetheless sent plan- ners down an unproductive path toward heavy two-seaters. AWPD/42 did not reemphasize the problem of fighters; instead, it argued that “our current type bombers can penetrate existing German defenses to the limit of their radius of operation without excessive losses.” *  The failure to prioritize escorts and their supporting technology ear- lier meant that possible solutions to the bomber penetration problem were slow to be conceived. The demands of the war intervened too. In 1942 the invasion of North Africa diverted aircraft from Europe and stripped the Eighth Air Force of its P-38 fighters, replacing them with shorter-range Republic P-47 fighters suffering engine and radio troubles.  COMBINED BOMBER OFFENSIVE 227  Over the summer of 1943 hopes pinned on the YB-40, a B-17 modified to serve as a bomber escort cruiser, proved unfounded. Earlier, how- ever, in the autumn of 1942, the USAAF had made preliminary inquiries into a technology that ought, by rights, to have received more attention sooner: the jettisonable auxiliary fuel tank. Work on suitable tanks pro- ceeded in the spring of 1943, and, in July, the USAAF used them on a combat mission for the first time. Production difficulties in both Britain and the United States held up more extensive use of improved tanks, even as mounting bomber losses in the late summer and autumn gave greater urgency to their manufacture and employment. Not until De- cember 1943 were they arriving in numbers that would allow them to make a difference.“  Adequate numbers of capable fighters were also slow in coming. Fol- lowing a tour of operational units in England in the spring of 1943, Asst. Secretary of War Robert Lovett realized the importance of escorts; he informed General Arnold that th
