orces would be called upon to play a direct role. Thus, they both sought to shape the nature of that role. On 13 January 1944, Harris had written a memorandum explaining that the heavy bomber had evolved as an independent strategic weapon designed to operate at night and, as such, had significant limitations as a “tactical weapon.” He concluded that “the best and indeed the only efficient support which Bomber Command can give to Overlord is the intensification of attacks on suitable industrial centres in Germany as and when the opportunity offers.”*  The Air Ministry countered his memorandum point by point, and came to two significant conclusions: that the failure of Overlord would result in far graver repercussions than a temporary cessation in the bombing of German centers, and that Bomber Command’s role in Over- lord would be “determined by the C.C.O.S. after they have had General Eisenhower’s recommendations.” Harris, undeterred, told Portal that it was harmful for Bomber Command to be tied to the same target list as Eighth Air Force, since it committed him in advance to targets in regions where the weather was questionable, resulting in frequent can- cellations or ineffective raids. Angling for the flexibility he had won under Pointblank, he asked for “full discretion” regarding the targets he would attack on any given night.**  For some time Portal had worried that Harris was relying on an in-  234 CHAPTER S$  creasingly outdated concept of Bomber Command’s capabilities, and was using this as an excuse to focus on city raids. In a challenge to his field commander, Portal ordered Bomber Command to undertake trial raids, on moonlit nights, against airfields, transport targets (including six French marshaling yards), and ammunition dumps. These would de- termine the real operational capabilities of the force. As the British of- ficial historians pointed out, the results, “though not universally suc- cessful, were outstanding.”** They foreshadowed Bomber Command’s
