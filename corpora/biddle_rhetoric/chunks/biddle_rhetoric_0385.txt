way to bomb cities than he had expected. In a second surprise, Bomber Command proved perfectly capable of hitting  236 CHAPTER S$  the tactical targets Eisenhower and Tedder had prioritized. After trying hard to excuse himself from the transportation plan, Harris made a significant contribution to it: between 17 April and 6 June Bomber Command waged nearly one hundred attacks on railroads, coast de- fense installations, and airfields in France and the Low Countries. These raids, flown with the latest navigational aids and using well-developed Pathfinder marking techniques, helped dramatically to reduce rail traffic on lines in France. With a big bomb bay, a crew of only seven, and less weight of armament for self-defense than their American counterparts, Lancaster bombers could carry a more sizable bombload (with bigger, more destructive bombs) than B-17s. With their increased accuracy, and with less to fear from the Luftwaffe, they were a potent force capable of fulfilling tasks that were sometimes beyond the capabilities of American day bombers.  Spaatz also found himself able, in a limited way, to follow his own instincts. Though respecting the 25 March decision he continued to press his case, and to find—and make—opportunities as he could. Each of the important oil refineries in Ploesti, Rumania, had a marshaling yard located nearby. On 5 April, Spaatz used the Fifteenth Air Force to attack the refineries, under the guise of attacking the marshaling yards. And Spaatz found another “back door” method to legitimize oil targets in central Germany. The 17 April directive had called on USSTAF to maintain pressure on the German air force. Spaatz knew, of course, that the Luftwaffe relied on oil, and that they would defend their sources heavily. Thus, he viewed it as wholly within the terms of his directive to attack oil installations—indeed, he felt such attacks were essential to bring German fighters into the skies in large numbers. Eisenhower con- curred, and on 19
