to have primary authority for the guidance of the bomber forces, a new targeting debate commenced; it would be just as charged and consequential as the pre- Overlord debate. Tedder favored extending (into Germany) attacks on transport and communications lines, so as to cripple Reich military ef- forts and industry; Spaatz pinned his hopes on reducing the German oil supply; and Harris sought to maintain his focus on city raids.  Spaatz, whose progress in the spring and summer had made him more committed than ever to oil, knew that he was working against time: his crews, dependent on visual bombing methods for significant results, would be handicapped once the autumn weather closed in. Other Allied leaders shared his concerns.’ Harris, whose crews had also begun to attack oil, remained true to the assumptions he had held since taking charge of Bomber Command: cities were the best, most efficient targets of Allied bombers. The debate resulted, again, in a com- promise. On 25 September executive responsibility for control of the Allied strategic bombing campaign reverted to Portal who, under a new arrangement, would share his authority with Arnold. The bombing di- rective issued at the same time identified priority targets: the petroleum industry, with special emphasis on petrol (gasoline), the German rail and waterborne transportation systems, tank production and plants, ordnance depots, and motor transport production and plants. But Har- ris was able to find plenty of room to continue his offensive as well, since priority targets were listed “subject to the exigencies of weather and tactical feasibility,” and the directive specified that when “weather or tactical conditions are unsuitable for operations against specific pri- mary objectives, attacks should be delivered on important industrial areas, using blind bombing technique as necessary.”"™*  In a conception of air strategy he would make explicit in October, Tedder essentially integrated the oil plan into his ov
