n important industrial areas, using blind bombing technique as necessary.”"™*  In a conception of air strategy he would make explicit in October, Tedder essentially integrated the oil plan into his overall transportation plan. He pointed out that strategic air operations could take advantage of the fact that German road, water, and rail transport were interde- pendent and complementary, and that the oil plan would affect move- ment by road and air. He perceived his strategy as coherent and com- prehensive: it could not fail but to have a direct impact on the German. capacity to continue the war since any loss of transport traffic would produce a shortage or a delay that unavoidably would affect the Reich war effort. In Germany—in contrast to France during the pre-Overlord campaign—bombed-out transport lines could be replaced only at the cost of other key programs. Also, the campaign in Germany—unlike  COMBINED BOMBER OFFENSIVE 243  the the one in France—would be unhindered by the need to avoid col- lateral casualties to the greatest extent possible.’  In October, U.S. bombers were able to launch only three completely visual attacks on oil targets, allowing German production of aviation gasoline to triple. Even in the best conditions, oil plants were demand- ing targets. A postwar study by the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, which covered the effects of fifty-seven American “precision” strikes on three separate synthetic oil plants, revealed that only 2.2 per- cent of the bombs dropped hit “damageable” buildings and equipment; no less than 87.1 percent “were spread over the surrounding country- side”—outside the perimeter of the plants.” Weather affected Bomber Command’s campaign as well: in October Harris dedicated only 6 per- cent of his force’s bombs to oil.  A review of strategic priorities resulted in a new directive, put for- ward in late October, which listed simply the petroleum industry and transportation/communications. Again, though, it authorized
