A review of strategic priorities resulted in a new directive, put for- ward in late October, which listed simply the petroleum industry and transportation/communications. Again, though, it authorized attacks on “Important Industrial Areas” whenever weather or tactical conditions made other operations infeasible. In November the Eighth Air Force was able to put 39 percent of its bombs on oil targets—although con- tinuing bad weather insured that none of it was purely visual; the Fif- teenth was able to achieve 28.4 percent on oil. The overall effect was not enough, however, to maintain the crisis situation imposed on the Reich over the summer.”  Even as USSTAF formally committed itself to “precision targets” in its public rhetoric, it continued the practice of area bombing through overcast. Back in July 1944 variable weather had caused USSTAF to place a high percentage of its total tonnage on the target category “cities and towns.”"* The worsening weather in the autumn meant a continuation—and intensification—of this trend. Between 1 September 1944 and 31 December 1944, weather forced the Eighth Air Force to rely heavily on H2X bombing. Of 140,807 tons dropped on the pri- mary targets, 81,654 tons of it was H2X-guided. And of that total, only 674 tons got within 1,000 feet of the aiming point.” Poor weather continued to plague bomber operations in early 1945, and Spaatz pressed Arnold to hasten the ongoing implementation of H2X equip- ment. A March 1945 joint British-American conference on bombing ac- curacy revealed the situation faced by American bombers: in conditions of heavy cloud cover, which included the majority of missions for the Eighth Air Force over the winter of 1944-45, 42 percent of bombs fell more than five miles from the target. Of those inside the five-mile ra- dius, the average circular error was 2.48 miles. Gross errors (bombs falling more than 3,000 feet from the aim point) and mission failures  244 CHAPTER S  (when less than 5 percent of total b
