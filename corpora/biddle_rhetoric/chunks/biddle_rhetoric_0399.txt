asingly undertook low-level attacks and strafing raids against enemy matériel. This had an important consequence: attacks on marshaling yards (large, identifiable targets in urban areas) had the ef- fect of greatly inhibiting the German transport of coal, which was the backbone of the German industrial economy. Tedder had indeed identi- fied a crucial artery in the German war machine. But such attacks were done by blind bombing techniques, and they utilized high percentages of incendiary bombs. Though they were designated and recorded as at- tacks on transport targets, these were, in essence, area raids on German cities. As Richard Davis has argued, “a well-hit marshaling yard meant a well-hit city, with block upon block of residential areas gutted, fami- lies left homeless, small businesses smashed, and workers and others— including women and children—blown to bits or, more likely, burned or crushed by the hundreds if not thousands.”"* Standard U.S. incendi- ary bombs, with their poor ballistic properties and lack of blast or frag- mentation effects, were not well suited to rail yard bombing. They were utilized in the role, “to take advantage of the known inaccuracy of H2X bombing in order to maximize the destruction of warehouses, commer- cial buildings, and residences in the general vicinity of the target.”'*  COMBINED BOMBER OFFENSIVE 245  A memorandum of 29 October 1944 specified the procedure for oper- ations when weather precluded higher priority targets, explaining that to meet the criteria for “secondary” and “last resort” targets, a town or city in Germany had to contain within it (or immediately adjacent to it) one or more military objectives, defined to include railway lines, junc- tions, marshaling yards, road bridges, industrial plants, military camps, oil storage tanks, airfields, and ammunition depots. It pointed out that towns and cities large enough to produce an identifiable return on the H2X scope “generally contain a large proportion of the mili
