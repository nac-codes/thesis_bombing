storage tanks, airfields, and ammunition depots. It pointed out that towns and cities large enough to produce an identifiable return on the H2X scope “generally contain a large proportion of the military objec- tives listed above,” opening them to attack. This criteria applied to just about any German city with a population of 50,000 or more." If mar- shaling yards were considered legitimate military targets under the laws of war, air force leaders were nonetheless aware of the full impact of their rail yard program: they described it euphemistically as “pressure” on the enemy.  The American wartime and postwar emphasis on “precision bomb- ing” and “pickle barrel accuracy” was for public consumption: the Americans wanted very much to distinguish themselves from the British and distance themselves from the RAF’s area campaign. But these over- sold phrases ought not to obscure the reality of American bombing in Europe. While there is no doubt that the Americans generally believed in and identified themselves with the selective targeting called for by the industrial web theory—their initial unwillingness to join the British in area bombing was only one indication of this commitment—belief and practice were by no means one and the same.  The fact that the Americans reflexively returned to “precision” tar- gets whenever weather permitted meant that they were motivated by a theory of air war distinct from that which animated Harris. And the USAAF never sought to develop or employ in Europe the specialized fire-raising methods used by the RAF. Certainly, intent and motivation matter for ex post facto judgments. But the problems posed by opera- tional circumstances and the lure of finding a quick end to the war caused the Americans to stray very far indeed from their “precision” ideal. The toll this took on German civilians—formally considered “col- lateral casualties”—was enormous.  HARRIS’S BATTLE FOR CITY BOMBING  Battles over targeting priorities took place at practica
