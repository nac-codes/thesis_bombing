ad capacity higher than that of American bombers), they were capable of doing very serious damage: every single raid made a difference.  Portal worried (with cause) that Harris continued to see oil and trans- port targets as the latest in a long list of “panaceas,” and that he had found—and would continue to find—a variety of reasons to avoid them and pursue his own priorities. In the same way that the Air Staff had failed to control Trenchard during World War I, they now faced the prospect of failing to control Harris.’” Thus Portal felt compelled to persuade Harris of the significance of oil. The vigorous written debate that ensued between the two men was about the close calls—the times when weather might or might not permit something more accurate than area bombing. Portal did not want Harris to opt for a city when there was any reasonable chance of successfully hitting an oil target. Though targeting was the main topic of discussion, the letters spanned the range of issues shaping the relationship between the CAS and his principal field commander; they were, in many ways, an eruption of built-up ten- sion and exasperation that had accumulated over the years of the war. Portal and Harris wrestled over power, authority, loyalty, and mutual respect. Indeed, the debate was even about personal style, and—to some extent at least—class, as the refined, restrained, Oxford-trained Portal squared off against the blunt, outspoken Harris. Both men felt strongly about their views, and both were highly articulate."*  In his effort to persuade Harris about the merits of oil, Portal faced  COMBINED BOMBER OFFENSIVE 247  an uphill struggle. All through 1944 Harris had campaigned hard to retain his freedom. Back in January he had warned that the defensive burden imposed on Germany by city bombing had been enormous, and, if the campaign were to cease, all those men and resources tied up in defensive operations would be suddenly free to join and support the ground war in the west.
