And, significantly, he was also convinced that the German people would not tolerate the prospect of a postwar situa- tion in which all their cities were obliterated—leaving them to face long years of difficult economic recovery.”  Harris had pitted his own views and assumptions against those held by other individuals both inside and outside the Air Ministry. Wary of intelligence and the input of “experts,” he systematically discounted in- formation that did not accord with his expectations. Instead he relied on his own hunches and assumptions, and on any incoming information that seemed to support his case. At first, Harris was largely in step with his colleagues in this: as we have seen, following the February 1942 directive, Portal and others in the Air Ministry had seized upon data that seemed to support the area offensive.
