If by this Portal had been looking to provoke a debate, his tactic worked. On 1 November, Harris sent back a lengthy response that argued, in no uncertain terms, for maintaining the area offensive. Throughout their detailed exchange, which continued well into the new year, Harris argued two things in particular: (1) the weather and other variables strictly limited his ability to attack selected targets, and that under the circumstances it made more sense to attack targets that had a guaranteed payoff—cities—than to gamble on single-target theories that might well prove meritless; and (2) the Germans were likely to disperse their oil production or to find substitutes for it, as they had with so many other “panacea” targets.’*' If the implication of the first was, “I can’t do it,” then the implication of the second was,“It’s a bad idea anyway.” This aroused Portal’s suspi- cion: if the first part of the argument was really true, then there was no need to add the second part.  Portal responded by questioning Harris’s decisions to eschew oil at- tacks on two specific nights when weather appeared, to Portal at least, to support such attacks. He had hoped to provoke a clear and convinc- ing response from Harris, but he mainly provoked a mini-debate on how to interpret weather data. In addition, he worked vigorously to convince Harris that the quality of intelligence work supporting the tar- geting directives was very high and very reliable. Portal figured that he might make his case through sheer force of logic. But Harris put up resistance. He had always resented what he felt was the Air Ministry’s micro-management of Bomber Command, and he reacted defensively to Portal’s specific queries on targeting. He insisted to the CAS that he took oil seriously, and that he sought to attack it on every suitable occasion."?  With respect to intelligence, Harris was jaded by the early war years when the search for selective targets deemed crucial to the German war effort had been f
