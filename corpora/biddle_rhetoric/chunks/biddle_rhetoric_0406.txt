attack it on every suitable occasion."?  With respect to intelligence, Harris was jaded by the early war years when the search for selective targets deemed crucial to the German war effort had been fruitless, or when a declared “bottleneck” was later discovered not to be one. “You will recall,” Harris wrote, “that in the  COMBINED BOMBER OFFENSIVE 249  past MEW [Ministry of Economic Warfare] experts have never failed to overstate their case on ‘panaceas,’ e.g. ball bearings, molybdenum, loco- motives, etc. in so far as, after the battle has been joined and the origi- nal targets attacked, more and more sources of supply or other factors unpredicted by MEW have become revealed.” Asserting that “the oil plan has already displayed similar symptoms,” he insisted, “I am quite certain that there are dozens more benzol plants of which we are un- aware, and when and if we knock them out I am equally certain we shall eventually be told by MEW that German M.T. [motor transport] is continuing to run sufficiently for their purposes on producer gas, steam, industrial alcohol, etc., etc.” Later he told Portal that while he was doing his best to attend to oil, he felt compelled nonetheless to inform the CAS that the plan, “like all previous panaceas so enthusiastically put forward by MEW” was “chimerical.” Indeed, Harris’s enmity for the MEW was so deep—and his desire to discredit it so strong—that he accused it of “amateurish ignorance, irresponsibility, and mendacity.”** The alternative, Harris pointed out, made far more sense. He argued, “If the Germans were asked today ‘oil plants or cities,’ they would reply ‘bomb anything you fancy except the cities’-—that is the whole tenor of everything we hear from Germany today.”"*  The more Harris dug in his heels the more Portal harnessed the ener- gies of his entire staff in an effort to push him—or drag him—in the preferred direction. Oil facilities, Portal patiently explained in his letter of 8 January 1945, were too large and too
