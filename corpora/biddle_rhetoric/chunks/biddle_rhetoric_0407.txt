Oil facilities, Portal patiently explained in his letter of 8 January 1945, were too large and too complex to have easily es- caped the notice of determined and competent intelligence efforts.“* At- taching to the letter several intelligence files on oil—including the latest Ultra information—Portal sought one more time to deploy the facts in his favor. He particularly pointed out that the “prodigious efforts” the enemy was making to protect its remaining oil was incontrovertible proof of the soundness of the oil plan. But he suspected all along that his efforts were falling on deaf ears. He believed, and there was plenty of evidence in Harris’s letters to fuel the belief, that Harris was simply too invested in city attacks to be able to develop enthusiasm for another approach. Portal wondered whether the “magnetism of the remaining German cities” had not been the principal driver in Harris’s targeting decisions. Later on, both the official historians of the British strategic bombing campaign, and the official historians of British intelligence in the Second World War, would suspect the same thing. Some of the new writing on the subject, however, has been more open to Harris’s argu- ments at the time.’  Portal tried to wear down Harris’s commitment to cities, challenging his stubborn belief that Germany was being brought to the brink of collapse through urban area attacks.
