many that offered potent, synergistic effects with the ground war. Very much a central element of Harris’s debate with Portal was the former’s contention that to use bombers “to deprive the enemy fighter aircraft in order to stop the enemy opposing us in the air, or to deprive him of oil to the same end in the air and on the ground” was to use them “defensively.” This, in Harris’s mind, was a fundamental mistake that denied air power the benefits of its greatest strength: the relentless offensive designed to force the enemy into a hopelessly defensive posi- tion.’ Here were strong echoes of Trenchard. Harris, far more than Portal, Spaatz, Eaker, or Tedder, held a radical view of the role of strate- gic bombardment in war. “A point of major difference between us,” Portal wrote, “seems to be that you would apparently regard the oil plan as a failure so long as the enemy continued to be able to fight at  COMBINED BOMBER OFFENSIVE 251  all, whereas we would regard it as successful as soon as the shortage of oil began to have a really substantial effect on the enemy’s power to resist.”!*!  After receiving Harris’s letter of 18 January 1945, Portal had to ac- knowledge that his great efforts at persuasion had failed.'* Harris sim- ply could not overcome his earlier prejudices against intelligence agen- cies to see their work in a new light; indeed, he even suggested that the Germans were likely locating oil plants underground or “inside ordi- nary farm, village, town, and city housing.” Nor could he persuade himself that attacks on oil facilities would do more damage to the Ger- man war effort than city attacks had done—and would continue to do if the Air Ministry would simply let him finish the job. Even in the face of all Portal’s efforts to persuade him otherwise, Harris remained as committed as ever to city bombing, which he felt certain was responsi- ble for Germany’s distress and for the ongoing advance of Allied ground forces on both the eastern and western fronts.
