On eleven occasions more than one oil target was attacked in a single night. “Thus,” the official historians concluded, “if by no means a maximum effort, the Bomber Command part in the oil campaign of 1945 was intensive and concentrated. It was also exceedingly destructive and, in combination with the even more frequent but somewhat lighter attacks of the United States Strategic Air Forces, it proved to be a great deal more than the already badly mauled oil industry could withstand.”"® In a letter (on another matter) to Portal of 22 February 1945, Harris de- scribed the oil plan as “a faith to which I am not only not a convert, but against which I have waged unceasing and unrelenting opposition within the widest limit of my duty and my subordination.” But, at the end of the letter, he added, “I have tried my best in the Oil Plan, and in everything else which I have been ordered to undertake.” Harris and Portal remained in a truce of sorts until the end of the war, and Harris never lost what was a genuine respect for Portal.

Certainly they believed that their own actions had been justified by German attacks on such places as Warsaw, Rotterdam, and Coventry—as well as the V-weapon attacks on British soil.
