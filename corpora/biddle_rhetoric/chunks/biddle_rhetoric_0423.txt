This was not technically correct because while the Soviets had suggested that Anglo- American bombing might aid the advance of Soviet armies by attacks on Berlin and Leipzig, they had never specified Dresden.” As it turned out, the story did not generate profound public interest in the United States. Headlines in those weeks tended to concentrate on the great bat- tles being waged in the Pacific, the Yalta Conference, and the advance of ground armies in Germany and the Philippines.”  The flap following the Dresden raid caused USSTAF to implement a new press policy that called on public relations officers to emphasize the military nature of targets attacked and always to describe raids (even if they were aimed at city centers) in terms of specific targets contained within them.
