tu- dents that large sections of Japanese cities “are built of flimsy and highly inflammable materials.” They argued that the earthquake disas- ter of 1924 “bears witness to the fearful destruction that may be in- flicted by incendiary bombs.” In 1940, Gen. Claire Chennault, who had been hired in 1937 as an advisor to the Chinese Air Force, suggested  262 CHAPTER S  a China-based air campaign against Japan that would include the use of incendiary bombs against Japanese cities. Washington policymakers, in- cluding the president himself, enthusiastically embraced the plan as a way to check Japanese advances without arousing domestic opposition to war. But plans to put bombers in the hands of the Chinese aroused concerns in the War Department—in particular, such an effort would delay getting more bombers to the British, who were then making im- mediate and desperate demands for them. As anxieties about Japan con- tinued and intensified, a number of highly placed Washington officials maintained an interest in the prospects for air war against Japan—and for fire raids against Japanese cities.”  In 1941 theory and speculation were increasingly replaced by con- crete plans as the Intelligence Division of the Air Corps began to collect data on Japanese economic targets. By July, the Air Corps was ferrying B-17s to the Philippines, hoping to deter Japanese expansion, and to interdict it if it flowed southward. This decision, as Michael Sherry has pointed out, “measured the desperation about the Far East and the opti- mism about the bomber’s potential that arose despite the formidable practical obstacles to deployment of the big bombers.” This optimism was nowhere so strong as in civilian circles: Secretary of War Henry Stimson proclaimed that the bomber had “completely changed the strat- egy of the Pacific.”** Such optimistic assessments rested in part on the idea that the Japanese were intensely afraid of aerial bombing, and that they would be prone to panic or collapse in
