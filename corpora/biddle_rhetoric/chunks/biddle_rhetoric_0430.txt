1943 targeting for the Japanese theater reflected the ongoing pri- oritization of selective bombing of key industries, along with the in- creasing lure of urban incendiary bombing. A March report prepared by AAF Headquarters selected eight target systems consisting of fifty-seven key targets. At the same time, a COA plan and a joint U.S.-British tar- geting effort were underway. The latter indicated that bombing would likely be a prelude to invasion, and thus would need to deal a significant blow to Japanese war industry. Bomber bases would be spread over a wide area, but basing in China—despite logistical difficulties—would offer the best operational possibilities. A Combined Chiefs of Staff plan released shortly thereafter listed the Japanese aircraft industry as the  264 CHAPTER S  most important immediate target. This plan, too, envisioned operations out of China. But it postulated that the planned offensive could not be completed until October 1945.2"  At the same time, investigations into the potential of urban incendi- ary attacks were ongoing. A study appearing in early 1943 indicated that Japanese industry and population were concentrated in a small number of large cities, and that these were vulnerable to the effects of fire. The Americans, however, had not lost their concern about moral and legal questions; indeed, a May 1943 request for a study of the prospects for urban incendiary raids admonished, “It is desired that the areas selected include, or be in the immediate vicinity of, legitimate mili- tary targets.”*"' Such a request not only helped to ease the consciences of those requesting the report, but allowed for urban and selective tar- geting to be conflated in the minds of those doing the targeting. A pa- tina of legitimacy was thereby applied to raids that were, in both con- ception and in operational technique, urban-incendiary attacks. This would mean, inevitably, that the “indirect effects” of bombing would be elevated to a position of increa
