tieth, com- manded by Gen. Kenneth Wolfe, faced a painfully slow build-up of fuel, ordnance, and supplies, due to the formidable problems of bringing it in by air “over the hump” of the Himalayas. (To deliver eight tons of fuel and cargo, a converted bomber required twenty-eight tons of gas for the round trip.) Other problems proved overwhelming as well. Not only did crews have trouble reaching and finding targets, they had trouble get- ting home again. Fully 70 percent of the Twentieth’s bombers lost were lost to causes other than enemy action. General Arnold fired General Wolfe less than a month after the Twentieth’s first combat mission.”* Wolfe was replaced by Gen. Curtis LeMay, who, in Europe, had proven himself a determined and technically proficient combat commander— much like Harris.  LeMay did what he could to improve the combat performance of his organization, but, in light of the problems posed by the theater, he had only modest expectations. He insisted that an alternative staging area be sought. In the meantime he used the opportunity to train his crews and to learn from experience. In December, LeMay was persuaded by his immediate superiors to fly an incendiary attack on Hankow, a Chinese city being used as a base for Japanese operations. The raid was consid-  266 CHAPTER S$  ered a great success by the Americans.”” By that time the Twenty-First Bomber Command, under Gen. Haywood Hansell, had commenced its own bombing operations out of the Marianas Islands. On 24 November the Twenty-first carried out its first large-scale attack on the Japanese homeland. General Hansell, a former staff officer, was a product of ACTS and one of the authors of AWPD/1. Unsurprisingly, he was a proponent of selective targeting. But Hansell’s early attempts against Japanese industry, with priority placed on the aircraft industry, were disappointing—indeed they produced little consequential damage. This made Arnold particularly uneasy, for he feared that if American bombers
