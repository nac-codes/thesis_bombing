In the text accompanying the graphic, Arnold admitted that casu- alties had caused “significant effects in the dislocation of industrial manpower and on enemy morale.” “The Japanese,” he noted with satis- faction, “have stated that air attacks killed 260,000, injured 412,000, left 9,200,000 homeless, and demolished or burned down 2,210,000 houses.”** Just as Harris had celebrated Bomber Command’s destruc-  270 CHAPTER S$  tion of over sixty German cities, so too did Arnold celebrate his destruc- tion of over sixty Japanese cities.

And race did account entirely for the rhetoric associated with the Far Eastern air campaign. Hatred of the Japanese, and the course of the war in the Pacific made American planners confident that the American people were unlikely to object to or to raise many questions—at the time or later—about fire raids against Japanese cities.  In Japan the Americans did not wholly abandon their preferred theo- ries of air warfare. As in Europe, American bombers typically returned to selective targeting whenever weather permitted. But the willingness of American planners and policymakers to cross the line and prosecute mass fire raids on a repeated and systematic basis represented a descent to a new and terrifying level in the hell of total warfare. And it surely helped to smooth the way—intellectually and emotionally—for the atomic attacks that would follow. On 6 August, over Hiroshima, no moral threshold was crossed that had not been crossed much earlier in the year. Those military planners who knew about the atomic bomb before it was dropped viewed it as another tool in the Allied arsenal. If they hoped it might have an
