not been crossed much earlier in the year. Those military planners who knew about the atomic bomb before it was dropped viewed it as another tool in the Allied arsenal. If they hoped it might have an impact, they did not assume it would end the war. Planning for a ground invasion went on as usual, conventional air raids on a variety of Japanese targets took place in between and after the two atomic attacks, and the navy continued its stranglehold on enemy shipping and supply. The Japanese military, government, and population were to be afforded no relief and no quarter until surrender was achieved under terms then being contested at the highest political levels.  ASSESSMENT AND RESULTS  On 30 April 1945 the Air Ministry and USSTAF issued a joint state- ment on the strategic bombing offensive. Naturally, both organizations were interested in highlighting the contributions of bombing to victory in Europe. They stressed the following: (1) the achievement of air supe- riority before the invasion of Normandy; (2) the reduction of the Ger- man oil supply; (3) the use of bombers to isolate battlefields, to interdict supplies, and to encircle ground troops; (4) the delivery of unprece- dented levels of explosives; and (5) the reduction of the numbers and potency of enemy special weapons, including V-bombs and jet aircraft."

But the significance of the air campaign—the political and moral arguments that grew up around it during and after the war, and the high stakes involved for the different organizations affected by the results—would insure that evaluations of it would be contentious and contested. Lives had been lost, large sums had been invested, and national and individual reputations had been put on
