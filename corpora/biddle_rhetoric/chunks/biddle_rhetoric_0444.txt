cited portions of the survey for Europe.” The Summary Report for the Pacific war, written mainly by Paul Nitze, was the most widely read portion of the survey assessing the Far Eastern campaign. These three reports were the only ones that bore the unqualified approval of the USSBS chairman's office."  The statistical analyses supporting the USSBS European reports were based on questionnaires submitted to industrial firms in Germany, ex- amination of the internal records of those firms, and interrogation of their managers. While these methods were more rigorous than those employed for the First World War bombing surveys, they had inherent disadvantages based on the unreliability of the answers. Frequently the firms questioned did not have all the data required, and in some cases it was impossible to know if the figures utilized by analysts were actual or instead merely estimated production levels. Survey officials sought to do the best they could under the circumstances, and attempted to correct for errors as often as possible.” The nature of the USSBS, with so many different reports under the control of so many different individuals, meant that it would be large, unwieldy, and comprised of a variety of opinions—some radically at odds with one another—regarding the con- tribution of strategic bombing to the war effort. Because the survey was so broad in scope and contained so much data, it subsequently has been used to support a range of differing arguments about bombing.  Though disappointed by their failure to persuade the Americans to undertake a joint survey, British officials continued making plans for an independent investigation. The British Joint Chiefs approved a plan in principle by the Chiefs of Staff on 10 August 1944, and in the autumn various parties having some stake in the outcome of a British survey began jockeying for position.
