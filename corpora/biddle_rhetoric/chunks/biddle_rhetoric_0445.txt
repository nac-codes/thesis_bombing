some stake in the outcome of a British survey began jockeying for position. Professor Solly Zuckerman, who had been Tedder’s principal advisor and who was now a guiding force in the  COMBINED BOMBER OFFENSIVE 273  newly established Bombing Analysis Unit of the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF), urged a scientific study to com- pare the results of area and precision bombing. Harris suggested a lim- ited survey done mainly by Bomber Command personnel who had an intricate knowledge of the workings of the force, but who, soon after Germany’s defeat, would depart for their civilian occupations. These individuals, Harris suggested, would spend six to eight weeks investigat- ing a small sample of German cities “with a view to confirming or refut- ing theories which have already been built up on the evidence avail- able.”**  But the Air Ministry set out its own course, planning the establish- ment of a British Bombing Survey Unit (BBSU), which was ultimately to be absorbed by a larger British Bombing Research Mission (BBRM). In November 1944 this plan went to Churchill, who did not respond until January, when—to the surprise of those involved—he refused it. The prime minister, who was anxious about what such investigations might reveal, was prepared to support only a small-scale survey that would be in a position to have results “soon enough to be of material assistance in the war against Japan.” In light of this news, Portal made prepara- tions for a more modest program, but Churchill erected more road- blocks in March and April 1945 against what he termed a “sterile task.” He was insufficiently moved by Portal’s strong warning—issued in late March 1945—against allowing the USSBS to be the sole record for posterity.**  The Air Ministry scrambled to do the best it could within the narrow bounds set by the prime minister, ultimately turning to SHAEF where Professor Zuckerman had been attempting to make investigations with the few people available to
