seemed: “air power” was used instead of “strategic bombing,” and “Western Europe” instead of “Europe.” The term “de- cisive,” in the context of the overlapping influences affecting the war’s endgame, is so hard to specify as to be almost meaningless. Still, most Americans heard Alexander’s statements as endorsements of bombing— a fact that no doubt came as a relief to the personnel of the USAAF.“  The authors of the Over-all and Summary Reports could not resist highlighting the bombing campaign’s final crescendo. Alexander told the press, “It [bombing] brought the economy which sustained the en- emy’s armed forces to virtual collapse, although the full effects of this collapse had not reached the enemy’s front lines when they were over- run by Allied forces. It brought home to the German people the full impact of modern war with all its horror and suffering. Its imprint on the German nation will be lasting.”*’ Even here, though, the argument was not as strong as it appeared: admitting that Allied air forces had not stymied the Wehrmacht independently of Allied ground forces, Al- exander stressed the psychological impact of bombing on the German people.  The summary reports and quotes to the press were obliged, to some degree at least, to stay within the boundaries established by economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who had directed the USSBS study of the im- pact of bombing on the German war economy. He had concluded, in a report titled “The Effects of Strategic Bombing on the German War Economy,” that its impact was limited until the latter part of 1944 when the air campaign worked in combination with other factors to contribute to Germany’s collapse. (Galbraith’s report made clear that, despite bombing, Germany’s total munitions output reached its peak in July 1944.) Indeed, Galbraith argued that strategic bombing may have helped streamline the German war economy by allowing German eco- nomic czar Albert Speer to impose more stringent measures and restruc- turing th
