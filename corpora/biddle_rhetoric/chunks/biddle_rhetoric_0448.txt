But even if Galbraith’s report had not been everything that air advocates hoped, it still acknowledged that “the attack on transportation beginning in September 1944 was the most important single cause of Germany’s ultimate economic collapse.” The author explained, “The operation of Germany's raw material in- dustries, her manufacturing industries, and her po
