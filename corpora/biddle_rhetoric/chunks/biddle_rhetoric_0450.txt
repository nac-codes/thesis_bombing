ough the insistence of its officers, effective immediately, and decisive within less than a year, this campaign proved to be a clear-cut illustration of strategic air-war doctrine.”** Galbraith’s report on the German economy explained, “Heavy Allied attacks on German oil production began in May 1944; two months later oil had replaced aircraft as the first priority strategic bombing tar- get. From the German point of view, this was disastrous.”**  The USSBS Oil Division Final Report suggested that attacks on oil, if carried out earlier in the campaign, almost certainly would have had more of a deleterious effect on the Luftwaffe than the campaign against the German aircraft industry did. The Galbraith Report concurred, ar- guing, “From the point of view of grounding enemy aircraft, the attacks on synthetic oil works were the most effective of all strategic bombing.” The Oil Division Final Report suggested as well that the oil campaign would have been enhanced if the Americans had earlier recognized the important links between the German oil, chemical, and rubber indus- tries, and if they had used larger bombs, more incendiaries, and fewer defective bombs on oil targets.**  After the war it was recognized, often with the help of German offi- cials, that certain relatively untouched target sets might have been use- ful in helping to bring about the collapse of the German war economy. The German Quartermaster General Department ranked powder and explosive plants second behind oil targets. USSBS analysts argued that concentrated attacks on German rubber manufacture would have served Allied ends. Finally, Albert Speer, German Minister for War Pro- duction, argued that the German electrical power net was highly vulner- able to attacks. Even though this target had been prioritized by AWPD/1, it did not receive dedicated attention because American au- thorities in England believed the system to be more highly developed and robust than it actually was.”  The USSBS and British
