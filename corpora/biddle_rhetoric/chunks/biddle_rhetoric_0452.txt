Bradley was criti- cal of Operation Clarion, however, which he claimed “had no immedi- ate or apparent results on the ground battle” since it did not concen- trate on transportation facilities immediately available to the opposing forces or their reserves.**  USSBS assessments of bombing’s impact on German morale were not uniform, but they contained some overlapping general conclusions. USSBS reports stressed that though bombing demoralized civilian popu- lations, this did not have a direct reflection in either production or pres- sure for surrender. The “Area Studies Division Report” (which evalu- ated area attacks for the European theater) echoed the World War I American survey, arguing that lowered German morale had not contrib- uted directly to a decline in German war production. While pointing out that factory managers reported declines in worker efficiency due to air raids, specifically area attacks, the authors claimed that they could find “no concrete evidence of such a decline.” They did, however, argue that city attacks had “a permanent effect on morale and political thought,” and “made life in Germany . . . progressively more difficult.”2°  The USSBS report titled “The Effects of Strategic Bombing on Ger- man Morale” argued that heavy bombing was not proportionally more effective than moderate bombing, and that sustained heavy bombing led to diminishing returns in morale effects (not stiffened morale as has been sometimes argued based on a misreading of the reports). It also maintained that though “bombing was less important than other mili- tary developments in producing defeatism,” it nonetheless “aided greatly in convincing civilians of Allied superiority” and discredi
