maintained that though “bombing was less important than other mili- tary developments in producing defeatism,” it nonetheless “aided greatly in convincing civilians of Allied superiority” and discrediting Nazi propaganda. While bombing “seriously depressed the morale of German civilians” the effect was not necessarily transferable into active opposition, since “German controls ... helped to prevent depressed morale from being translated into subversive activity seriously detri-  278 CHAPTER S  mental to the war effort.” And though lowered morale “expressed itself in somewhat diminished productivity,” this only became a serious prob- lem at the end of the war when German controls failed to overcome the “increasing apathy induced by bombing.” The Over-all Report on the European War, explaining that German armaments production contin- ued to mount through 1944, claimed that depressed and discouraged workers were not necessarily unproductive workers: the German people “continued to work efficiently as long as the physical means of produc- tion remained.” In a 1958 volume entitled The Social Impact of Bomb Destruction, Fred Charles Iklé would argue that “[flindings from Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Hamburg and other areas of large bombings in World War II do not indicate that serious mass panic occurred at any time."  The authors of the report on German morale highlighted the vagaries and assumptions that pervaded both Allied and Axis thinking on the subject. Basing their work on interviews with 3,711 German civilians and on official German documents, the authors explained that the en- emy had collected “no accurate, quantitative data on the effect of bombing on the morale of their civilian population or on the relative effectiveness of the various control steps which they took.” They pointed out that the Allied Command had not made systematic at- tempts to gain such data either, and suggested that if either side had in fact sought such information, it would have been useful to
