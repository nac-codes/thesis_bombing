ey pointed out that the Allied Command had not made systematic at- tempts to gain such data either, and suggested that if either side had in fact sought such information, it would have been useful to them.**  Several USSBS Pacific theater reports reinforced and emphasized the general arguments about morale made in the European survey. While two key reports—“The Effects of Air Attack on Japanese Urban Econ- omy” and “The Effects of Strategic Bombing in Japanese Morale”— went to great lengths to point out that USAAF raids had caused pro- found social disruption, absenteeism, and deprivation, neither one argued that lowered morale and apathy produced by the raids were decisive factors in the outcome of the war. The authors of the first re- port argued that the economy had been so badly battered by the naval war prior to the area attacks that the raids could have had little direct economic impact in most cases anyway. The authors of the second re- port maintained that, regardless of low morale, loyalty to the Emperor meant that the Japanese would go on working and fighting so long as they were physically able. Taken together, these assessments revealed not only that civilians could and did endure very high pain levels inflic- ted by bombing, but also that the relationship between high pain levels and surrender is anything but straightforward.  Despite these findings, the Pacific War “Summary Report” asserted that conventional strategic bombing had been crucial in pushing Japan toward unconditional surrender, and would have culminated in that re-  COMBINED BOMBER OFFENSIVE 279  sult even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped. The difference of views could be traced back to Paul Nitze, principal author of the Pacific Summary Report. In the summer of 1945, before heading to Japan to participate in the Pacific survey, Nitze helped draft an air plan for ending the war in the Far East, based on information gained in the European war. By July he apparently had concluded tha
