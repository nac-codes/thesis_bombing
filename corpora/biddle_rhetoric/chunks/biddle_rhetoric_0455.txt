Japan to participate in the Pacific survey, Nitze helped draft an air plan for ending the war in the Far East, based on information gained in the European war. By July he apparently had concluded that conventional bombing would be enough to force Japan’s surrender. His pre-Hiroshima conclu- sion was incorporated into the Summary Report, even though it did not flow naturally from arguments presented elsewhere in the Pacific Survey. In a much-quoted section of the report, Nitze argued, “It seems clear that, even without the atomic bombing attacks, air supremacy over Ja- pan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion.”**  Supporters of the navy had felt vindicated by the conclusion that the Japanese economy had, in effect, been destroyed by strangulation prior to the onset of the great air raids in March 1945. Thus they were pleased with neither the Summary Report’s assumptions about bombing nor its failure to credit the antishipping campaign with being “deci- sive.” Air force-navy antagonism over the Pacific war survey reached its peak, however, in the conflict between the Military Analysis Division and the Naval Analysis Division. The rift was personalized by the Navy’s Adm. Ralph Ofstie and the USAAF’s Gen. Orvil Anderson, and intensified by the USAAF’s postwar bid for independence. Ofstie’s Naval Analysis Report, “The Campaigns of the Pacific War” (USSBS Pacific Report #73), had come to conclusions quite different from Anderson’s report, “The Over-all Air Effort against Japan.” The latter was an un- abashed propaganda tract claiming that air power dominated both na- val forces and ground forces. The report also recommended a preven- tive war against the Soviet Union—an argument which, when he made it more explicitly in 1950, would usher Anderson out of command.“  Ofstie, appalled by what he read, fired off his critique to Nitze:  The volume presents a completely inaccurate and entirely biased acc
