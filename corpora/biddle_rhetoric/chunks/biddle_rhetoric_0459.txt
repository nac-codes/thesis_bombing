e effectiveness and “precision” of their own campaign. In- deed, the bias was so evident that the American official historians felt compelled to apologize for it in 1951, writing, “the deprecating tone with regard to the contribution of the RAF which ran through much of the survey’s work, especially the specialized reports, did not reflect a judicious appraisal of the RAF effort.””” If RAF leaders had feared a scenario in which an American survey would provide the only public, authoritative analysis of wartime strategic air operations, their fears proved justified.2”*  Harris, whose views had been essentially silenced by the noncircula- tion of his final dispatch, attempted to correct the situation and get his perspective across through his war memoir, Bomber Offensive, pub- lished in 1947. In it, he offered a straightforward if not overly reflective account of his years at the helm of Bomber Command. It defended area bombing and stressed that its contribution to the Allied war effort was enormous.”* Emphasizing the many handicaps under which Bomber Command labored, and the endless “diversions” to which it was sub- jected, Harris maintained his long-held argument that bombing might have won the war essentially on its own: “I am certain that if we had an adequate bomber force to attack Germany a year earlier, that is, in 1943, or if we had not had the pre-invasion bombing and the bombing  282 CHAPTER S  of the V-weapons sites to divert us in 1944, we should never have had to mount an invasion on anything like the scale that proved necessary.”*”  Harris took issue with some of the conclusions reached by the USSBS “Area Studies Division Report.” In particular he pointed out the dis- crepancies between the results of the USSBS and the investigations of Bomber Command’s Operations Research Section (ORS). He argued, for instance, that a difference in the definition of “destruction” caused the USSBS to list much lower percentages of German housing destroyed by Bomber Comma
