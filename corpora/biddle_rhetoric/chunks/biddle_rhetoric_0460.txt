ations Research Section (ORS). He argued, for instance, that a difference in the definition of “destruction” caused the USSBS to list much lower percentages of German housing destroyed by Bomber Command than ORS did. Harris also found much to criti- cize in the USSBS’s attempt to assess the loss of production as a whole resulting from Bomber Command’s attacks on cities. He felt that Ameri- can measures did not adequately account for the vast expenditure of labor and material necessitated by German efforts to cope with city raids.’  Not until 1948 did the Air Staff send Harris’s final dispatch into lim- ited circulation—and did so with an accompanying written statement that took issue with both the tone and substance of the document. Un- surprisingly, the dispatch was wholly consistent with Harris’s strong views throughout the war, and, equally unsurprisingly, the postwar Air Staff was ill at ease with it. The Air Staff statement pointed out that the dispatch did not take into consideration the subsequent conclusions of the bombing surveys; it argued as well that Harris tended to inflate the impact of area bombing. Additionally, it explained that while area bombing had been seen by the Air Staff as a temporary expedient, Harris had not perceived it that way and had delayed switching to selec- tive targeting later in the war when his Command had the means to do 02”  The dispatch itself stressed the destruction of German cities, which, Harris argued, not only disorganized and dislocated the whole of the German economy but also demoralized the German people. He stressed also that city bombing forced the enemy on to the defensive (“a verit- able army of at least 2,000,000 men”) and caused a shortage of war materials on all fronts. He admitted that the results of Bomber Com- mand’s attacks on oil “exceeded my expectations and frustrated the German hopes.”*° Harris argued that though the demands of the Nor- mandy campaign gave German cities a “virtual respite from bombing”
