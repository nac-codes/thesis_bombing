he delivered the Lees Knowles Lectures at Cambridge University in 1947 on the topic: “Air Power in War.” Arguing that air power— though “interlocked with sea and land power”—was essential in World War II, he insisted that its usefulness rested on the achievement of air superiority. He added that the value of air power had to be assessed in terms of the way it was used in the war: the Allies, he pointed out, had not attempted “to win [the war] by means of air power alone—or even by air power as the primary factor.” Tedder’s conception of targeting, articulated during the war, rested on the idea of air power as part of a larger joint effort by all the services. He identified what he termed “common denominator” targets, the destruction of which could “col- lectively affect the whole war effort.” These included railways, canals, power plants, iron and steel plants, and oil. Bomber attacks on these affected enemy efforts, and the German economy in general, in myriad and interrelated ways, allowing all of the Allied fighting services to benefit.“  Only in 1961 did the British produce an official history of their World War II strategic bombing campaign. Its authors noted that, in the in- tervening years, “myth and misconception have grown and been un- assailed.”** But if the delay had allowed misconceptions to emerge, it had also given the official historians, Sir Charles Webster and Noble Frankland, the time and distance required to produce an exceptionally thorough and informed account. Their volumes, which allowed that Bomber Command had made a crucial contribution to the defeat of Germany, were nonetheless critical of the area bombing to which Harris had remained so steadfastly loyal. In their concluding remarks they ar- gued that Bomber Command’s operations gave essential aid to the cam-  284 CHAPTER S$  paign against oil and transport, and that even area bombing ultimately contributed “important by-products to the achievement of the main plans for oil and transport”
