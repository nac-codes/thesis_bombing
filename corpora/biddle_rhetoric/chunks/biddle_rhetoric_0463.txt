l aid to the cam-  284 CHAPTER S$  paign against oil and transport, and that even area bombing ultimately contributed “important by-products to the achievement of the main plans for oil and transport”? Tedder, who read the draft of the manu- script twice through, commended the authors on their “masterly” and “courageous” work; he admitted that he “had not thought that any- thing so near the truth would ever be likely to go on record.” But Harris, who would not read the draft, was determined to discredit it and its authors, whom he, for false and contrived reasons, deemed unfit to the task.”  The great contribution of the British official history was the applica- tion of balance, judgment, and in-depth knowledge (of a highly techni- cal and complex subject) to the assessment of the strategic air war. While Bomber Command was their main focus, Webster and Frankland provided a sophisticated analysis of the work of the USAAF—and the interaction of the two air forces comprising the Combined Bomber Of- fensive. Their writing offered up consistently perceptive comparisons of the ideas, behavior, and relative strengths and weaknesses of the British and American air forces during World War II. The authors highlighted, for instance, “the most important strategic problem of the bomber of- fensive”: that Anglo-American strategic air forces could not in the end avoid a battle for supremacy in their own medium. The future of the bomber campaign—and the Allied ground campaign too—depended on the neutralization of German fighters.
