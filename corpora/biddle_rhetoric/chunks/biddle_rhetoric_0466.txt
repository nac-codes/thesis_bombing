nded for a general readership, relied to a great degree on his scholarly investigations of the German war economy. In that realm he has argued that the rationalization of the German war economy, achieved under Speer, was the chief factor in transforming Germany’s wartime economic output. Rationalization, based on methods of indus- trial efficiency, necessarily concentrated production in the largest and  286 CHAPTER S  most efficient enterprises, and reduced the stocks of raw materials held at the factories. But, Overy argues, strategic bombing undermined key features of the rationalized system, thereby placing a ceiling on the ad- ditional gains in output afforded by the increased scale and speed of production. Bombing interrupted “in arbitrary and unpredictable ways the web of supplies of materials and parts on which the whole industrial structure depended.” And bombing forced dispersal just at the time when concentration was paying off. Paradoxically, the only way for Speer to cope was to insist on “even more rigorous rationalization— concentrating production on a handful of weapons, reducing all unnec- essary and sophisticated equipment, and cutting back on all military production not directly concerned with priority weapons.””*  Using Overy’s work on the German economy, Sebastian Cox has re- cently critiqued the BBSU study for its conclusions on area bombing, pointing out that dispersal of industry—which he argues was provoked mainly by the area offensive—made the German economy more vulner- able in the long run because of the increased importance of the trans- portation system. He contends that the BBSU report “credits the trans- portation attacks of 1944-45 with enormous success in destroying the German economy, but it perhaps fails to give due credit to the area attacks in helping both to cap the German economy, and to handicap rationalisation and force dispersal, thus making transport a more lucra- tive target.”**° What Harris might have made of this analysi
