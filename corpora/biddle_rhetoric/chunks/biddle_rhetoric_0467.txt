attacks in helping both to cap the German economy, and to handicap rationalisation and force dispersal, thus making transport a more lucra- tive target.”**° What Harris might have made of this analysis is hard to say; he never envisioned city attacks as a way of making other targets more lucrative. He did, however, believe that his campaign had had a tremendous impact on every element of the German war infrastructure.  As scholarship reveals more and more about the wartime German economy, it may become possible to piece together ever more sophisti- cated analyses of what bombing contributed to the Allied war effort. But, because it is a difficult and complex question, there is unlikely ever to be a final answer to it. And arguments about effect will not, in the end, put to rest the many moral and ethical debates that still weigh heavily on discussions of bombing in World War II.  errr  The record of strategic bombing in the Second World War has deserved the attention historians have given it to date. Though its contribution to Allied victory was hard to specify and to separate out from other effects—and though there can be no final answer regarding its “decisiveness”—several points can be made about it nonetheless. It placed a heavy defensive burden on the Germans and prevented them from creating and sustaining an even more powerful war machine than  COMBINED BOMBER OFFENSIVE 287  they did create. It undermined the German war economy in general by forcing dispersion of industry and then limiting the means to sustain that dispersion, and it helped strangle the German fuel supply. By the end of the war it had crippled the Wehrmacht’s ability either to supply itself or to maneuver on the battlefield. Those air commanders who, like Tedder, searched for ways to use aerial bombing to exploit oppor- tunities created in part or wholly by the other services, discovered in this role its greatest strength. In addition, bombing kept a check on the development of new weapons in
