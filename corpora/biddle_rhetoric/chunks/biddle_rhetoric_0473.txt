n. In the 1930s, Trenchard’s successors had to sort out these problems under the pres-  CONCLUSION 291  sures of an increasingly ominous political situation. As they did this, they reevaluated and pulled away from many of the central elements of Trenchardism—at least temporarily.  During the interwar years American airmen were increasingly at- tracted to claims centering on the economic vulnerability of modern societies—and the bomber’s ability to exploit it. They postulated that an air force, having determined the key elements in an enemy's indus- trial infrastructure, could destroy that economy efficiently through ae- rial attacks against those “key nodes” or “bottlenecks.” If the credit due Tiverton and his colleagues was largely lost along the way, the ideas survived and helped form a body of thought that the Americans em- braced and developed further, adding an emphasis on “precision” bombing by groups of high-altitude, self-defending bombers. This “in- dustrial fabric theory” assumed that modern economies were made up of an intricate weave of highly integrated threads, and that pulling on a key thread could unravel the entire fabric. It assumed, too, that one could identify these vulnerable points and attack them with sufficient precision and weight to create the desired effect. Both would prove problematic in the event.  None of the assumptions on which British and American ideas rested was pulled from thin air. The airmen’s expectations—and hence their arguments—revealed the way in which they interpreted the world around them and in which they sought to promote their own interests. The claims they made and the policies they advanced reflected specific cultural, political, social, and institutional contexts. Likewise, their fail- ure to see the potential problems and flaws in these ideas—and the ramifications that might flow from them—reflected the cognitive short- cuts of seeing what we expect to see and what is in our interest to see. But, these particular
