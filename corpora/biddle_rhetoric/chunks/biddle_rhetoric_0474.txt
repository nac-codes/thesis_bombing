and flaws in these ideas—and the ramifications that might flow from them—reflected the cognitive short- cuts of seeing what we expect to see and what is in our interest to see. But, these particular ideas—and their flaws—would prove tremen- dously consequential during the Second World War.  Both the British and the Americans had overestimated bomber’s abil- ity to penetrate enemy defenses and reach targets unaccompanied by long-range escorts. Similarly they had both been far too optimistic about bombardiers’ ability to find and hit specific targets in cloud- shrouded northern Europe. And they had overestimated their enemy’s frangibility: civilians, industrial workers, and war economies all proved much more robust and resilient than interwar theories had presumed. These problems might have been anticipated to a greater degree if air- men had scrutinized more objectively their experience in World War I. But that experience had been seen through particular lenses and was interpreted selectively. There was, in addition, too great a readiness to focus on the future without rigorously considering the past. This is an endemic problem in air forces, which develop their institutional identity  292 CONCLUSION  around claims to see and understand the future more clearly than other services do.  During the Second World War, Anglo-American air planners had to make constant adjustments and real-time modifications to cope with the many problems they faced, not only as a result of the gaps they discov- ered between expectations and realities, but also from the shifting de- mands imposed by the course of the war itself, Their responses reflected the cognitive patterns one might expect in such circumstances. In shift- ing to a general area offensive, British planners embraced (or more ac- curately reembraced) arguments about the power of the moral effect of bombing. As elements of the German war economy came to appear more robust than expected, German morale increasingly seemed like
