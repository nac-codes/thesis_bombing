bomb- ing mission, stressing it as the justification for service autonomy and downplaying other more modest and cooperative roles for aircraft, however important they might be. This rhetoric was only intensified by a major debate over the structure of the American military and by tight postwar budgets. The result was, as in interwar Britain, an overselling of “air power” and, in consequence, inflated expectations among poli- cymakers and the public about strategic bombing.  The USAAF’s position as the nation’s only nuclear-capable arm rein- forced this propensity to focus almost exclusively on strategic bombing and to pronounce on the unlimited power of bombers. In his final war dispatch in 1945, General Arnold stated simply, “It [atomic energy] has made Air Power all-important.”’ And, with the 1946 establishment of their postwar long-range bomber arm, Strategic Air Command (SAC), American airmen proclaimed triumphantly that, with nuclear weapons, the airplane was “the greatest offensive weapon of all times.”? But atomic bombs were, in some sense, a parallel to the RAF’s moral effect: they aided claims to autonomy and placed a heavy focus on deterrence— but they made it easier to avoid thinking through the still poorly under- stood relationship between bombing and enemy capitulation. Like Trenchard’s immediate and incessant offensive, they postulated a sce- nario that was attractive for purposes of deterrence (and cost cutting), but unrealistic in terms of the way states actually enter into and fight wars.  294 CONCLUSION  These problems made themselves felt in the 1950s and 1960s when American airmen found themselves fighting limited wars in Asia, where the theories underpinning Anglo-American strategic bombing had little relevance to the circumstances at hand. At the outset of the Korean War in 1950, SAC bombers were moved overseas to reinforce the Far East- ern Air Force (FEAF), under the overall control of Gen. Douglas Mac- Arthur, commander-in-chief in the Far
