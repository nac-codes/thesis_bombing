outset of the Korean War in 1950, SAC bombers were moved overseas to reinforce the Far East- ern Air Force (FEAF), under the overall control of Gen. Douglas Mac- Arthur, commander-in-chief in the Far East. The commander of SAC’s Fifteenth Air Force, Maj. Gen. Emmett O’Donnell, became commander in chief of FEAF Bomber Command (Provisional). In consultation with SAC chief, Gen. Curtis LeMay, he quickly requested MacArthur's per- mission “to do a fire job on the five industrial centers of northern Korea.” He thought MacArthur should announce that the communists had forced him, against his wishes, to use “the means which brought Japan to its knees.”* This approach reflected traditional air force war- fighting concepts as well as recent experience: fire raids would under- mine the enemy’s will and capacity to fight; waging them immediately would intensify their psychological effect.  Initially, though, MacArthur was unwilling to escalate so dramati- cally. O'Donnell chafed under orders that saw his bombers “diverted” to tactical support of ground troops. In late summer, bomber missions were expanded to include interdiction strikes and attacks on North Ko- rean industry. Following Chinese entry into the war in November, Mac- Arthur permitted attacks on a wide range of targets—including fire raids on North Korean cities—in order to do everything possible to stem the tide of Chinese advance. He held back on striking North Ko- rean hydro-electric plants, though, hoping they might prove useful bar- gaining chips for negotiations. Incendiary attacks on Pyongyang in early January 1951 burned out 35 percent of the city. Training for atomic missions went forward, but authority for actual use of A-bombs was withheld.‘ The wider use of bombers, however, did not translate into discernable progress toward victory, and, as time passed, American B-29s became increasingly vulnerable to North Korean air defenses: by the end of 1951 they were forced to fly almost exclusively at night.‘
