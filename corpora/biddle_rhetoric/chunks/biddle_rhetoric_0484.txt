g late in 1965. Johnson did in fact expand the air campaign in 1966 and 1967: in June 1966, North Vietnamese oil storage was bombed for the first time; in May 1967, Hanoi’s main power station was attacked.””  Unsurprisingly, the air force chafed at the early restrictions: both dur- ing and after the war the air force claimed that Rolling Thunder had been undermined by civilian meddling in timing and targeting. Gradual-  298 CONCLUSION  ism, they argued, flew in the face of well-established war-fighting princi- ples. While it is true that all major targets were not destroyed until 1967 (whereas the air force would have preferred an all-out assault in 1965), the civilian intervention may not have been so consequential as the USAF has maintained. The JCS list grew from 94 to 242 targets shortly after Rolling Thunder began, and the latter number changed little through the rest of the campaign. In 1965, 158 of these targets were destroyed (nearly all of them military targets below the 20th paral- lel); in 1966, 22 more were destroyed. Johnson released nearly all the remaining targets for attack in 1967, and by December almost all of North Vietnam’s industrial war capacity had been destroyed. There was, by the end of the war, virtually no target left unbombed that might have been bombed. Indeed, during the course of the war the USAF dropped some 6,162,000 tons of bombs—vastly more than had been dropped by the Allied powers in all of World War Il." Yet this had not brought capitulation.  Robert Pape has argued that there is “no evidence that executing the sharp knock in 1965, instead of 1967, would have produced better re- sults.” Structural factors (including Vietnam’s economy and geogra- phy) and the nature of the war itself helped insulate the North Viet- namese and Viet Cong against interdiction and coercive air power. This insulation was furthered by evacuation programs in all major towns and villages. Finally, even if an earlier all-out air assault had convinced the
