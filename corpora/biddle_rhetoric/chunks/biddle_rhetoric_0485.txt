Finally, even if an earlier all-out air assault had convinced the North to stop supporting the Viet Cong, this was no guarantee that they would not have continued the war on their own, and at their own pace.”?  The Nixon administration instituted a program of “Vietnamiza- tion”—a means of reducing American involvement by returning the main responsibility for the ground war to the South Vietnamese. In ad- dition, the president allowed the JCS to give more freedom to U.S. air commanders. Operation Linebacker, an aerial interdiction campaign to halt Hanoi’s 1972 spring offensive, largely succeeded and appeared to put a settlement within reach. But North Vietnamese negotiators stalled, prompting Linebacker II, an eleven-day campaign (18-29 December) to bring enemy negotiators back to the table to sign a final accord. Line- backer II concentrated on military assets in and around Hanoi. On 29 December, communist leaders indicated their willingness to resume se- rious negotiations. This reflected the success of both Linebacker cam- paigns, which were oriented toward fundamentally different circum- stances and goals than Rolling Thunder had been.”  Many observers, civilian and military, argued that if a Linebacker- style campaign had gone forward from the outset, the war would have ended much sooner. Frustrated over the political constraints placed  CONCLUSION 299  upon them, airmen argued—in the tradition of Harris—that they might have won had they been free to fight as they saw fit. Writing in the June 1975 Air Force Magazine, General T. R.

Linebacker I’s success was facilitated by the
