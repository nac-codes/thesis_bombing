In the thirty years since Vietnam, strategic bombing has, if anything, become even more prominent as a mode of warfare. For America alone, wars in the Persian Gulf in 1991, Bosnia in 1995, and Kosovo in 1999 have seen air attacks against opponents’ vital centers in an effort to coerce concessions from hostile regimes. In many of these conflicts, air power theorists have claimed to have developed a new mode of strategic bombing. Pinpoint precision attack of leadership, political control, and civilian economic targets is now said to offer coercive leverage unattain- able by older methods; some even see a “revolution in military affairs” in this apparent combination of new technology and new ideas.**  It is probably too early to judge the efficacy of precision air attack as a political tool; certainly its effectiveness remains hotly contested as this book is written.” Yet much of this new debate has a familiar ring. Since 1918 airmen have sought to find and destroy a critical Achilles’ heel in an opposing society, polity, or economy so as to win wars without fight- ing one’s way through the mass land armies of previous eras. Through more than eighty years and the experience of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, the underlying philosophy and central implementing ideas of strategic bombing have changed remarkably little. The tools of air war- fare have changed dramatically since the canvas and plywood planes of the First World War, but it is striking just how little the basic ideas behind the use of those tools have changed. Profoundly influential for nearly a century, these foundational ideas continue today to animate a debate over bombing in an era otherwise almost unrecognizably differ- ent from the world of Tiverton and Trenchard.*  Yet these ideas are neither self-evident nor the inevitable conse- quences of aircraft or the technology of flig
