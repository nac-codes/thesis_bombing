otherwise almost unrecognizably differ- ent from the world of Tiverton and Trenchard.*  Yet these ideas are neither self-evident nor the inevitable conse- quences of aircraft or the technology of flight. Rather, they are the prod- uct of a complex social, political and cognitive context in which airmen  CONCLUSION 301  have tried to understand their world and their missions. This context has been formed from overlapping and interactive influences, including the perceived social consequences of industrialization, urbanization, and increasing economic interdependence; popular concerns and expecta- tions about the development of new technologies for war-fighting; the intellectual demands of envisioning uses for a new tool of war, and the inevitable cognitive hurdles and obstacles to which that process inevita- bly is subject—including the tendency to be overly impressed by initial experience, and the resistance to new information that does not conform to previously formed ideas; and the pressures imposed by the require- ment for organizational survival in hostile bureaucratic environments.  To suppose that strategic bombing doctrines have been mere reflec- tions of the demands of good practice is to overlook the experience of the world’s most energetic attempt so far to wage war from the air—the Anglo-American strategic bombing campaign in the Second World War. The near-catastrophic failure of the RAF, and later the USAAF, to make good the prewar claims for their new methods cannot be explained by looking at the methods and the equipment alone. This failure lay funda- mentally in a process of learning and perception in which the larger environment conditioned thought in powerful and ultimately very prob- lematic ways. To understand the history of strategic bombing thus re- quires an understanding of the process by which those ideas took form and the influences that molded them.  But this is more than an issue of historical understanding alone. The continuing influence
