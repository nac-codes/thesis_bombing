Bannerman, “The Difficulty of Aerial Attack,” Journal of the Royal United Services Institution 53, no. 375 (May 1909); Maj. B. Baden-Powell, “How Airships are Likely to Affect War,” Journal of the Royal United Services Institution 54, no. 387 (May 1910); W. F. Reid, “Explosives in Aerial Warfare with Some Remarks on Methods of Defence,” Journal of the Royal United Services Institution 55, no. 400 (June 1911); Col. Louis Jackson, “The Defence of Localities Against Aerial Attack,” Journal of the Royal United Services Institution 58, no. 436 (June 1914). Since all of these were first delivered as lectures, the printed commentary from the audiences is also helpful.  14.
