NOTES TO CHAPTER 1 311  71. On the French bombing program in the latter part of the war, see George K. Williams, “Statistics and Strategic Bombardment: Operations and Records of the British Long-Range Bombing Force During World War I and Their Implica- tions for the Development of the Post-War Royal Air Force, 1917-1923” (D.Phil. thesis, Oxford University, 1987), 94-111. This work has recently been published, in slightly abridged form, as Biplanes and Bombsights: British Bomb- ing in World War I (Maxwell AFB, Ala.: Air University Press, 1999).

The failure of the Joint War Air Committee in April 1916 triggered the creation of another body, the Air Board, headed by Lord Curzon.
