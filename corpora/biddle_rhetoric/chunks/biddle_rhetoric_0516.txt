Jones, The War in the Air, 6:146, where the official historian noted la- conicaily that fifty-four aircraft were wrecked “from various causes” on the British side of the lines.  174, Lt. Col. J. Gammell to DFO, 15 October 1918, in AIR 1/461/15/ 312/107. To make his point, Gammell cited the loss figures for Sth Group, RAF, which had only three aircraft lost on the British side of the lines during August and September. While Gammell allowed that pilots flying longer distances might be more prone to accidents, he still found the numbers telling.  175. Williams, “Statistics,” 298. He has calculated that “[bJattle casualties alone [for] the day component of the LE. amounted to 257 aircrew between  318 NOTES TO CHAPTER 1  June and November 1918, or 178 percent of total assigned strength at the Armi- stice. Total losses to these squadrons amounted to 407 flyers, equal to nearly twelve full squadrons.” See also Air Commodore H. R. Brooke-Popham, “The Air Force” (lecture delivered to the Royal United Services Institution on 3 De- cember 1919) printed in the Journal of the Royal United Services Institution 65, no. 457 (February 1920): 49.  176. Wise, Canadian Airmen, 326.  177. Ibid. 321, 324-25. Wise points out that “[t]he success of the German interceptors . . . led to a natural exaggeration of their magnitude by Trenchard and by later commentators.” It might be pointed out, as well, that British losses behind British lines surely reduced the numbers of aircraft the Germans had to commit to defensive operations.  178.
