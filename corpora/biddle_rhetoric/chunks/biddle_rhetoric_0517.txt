Official statements that made their way into the American Expedition- ary Force’s air intelligence bulletin (titled “Summary of Air Information”) habit- ually emphasized the “moral effect” of bombing. See, for instance,“Summary of Air Information,” Air Intelligence Bulletin, GHQAEF Second Section, General Staff, 4 April 1918.  186. “Huns Raid Panic,” Daily Mail (London), 21 September 1918, copy in AIR 462/15/312/116.

In response to a toast in his honor in December 1917, Secretary of State for Air Lord Rothermere said, “It is our duty to avenge the murder of innocent women and children. As the enemy elects, so it will be the case of ‘eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,’ and in this respect we shall slave for complete and satisfying retaliation” (quoted in Williams, “Statistics,” 203). On 25 March 1918, M.P. Sir Henry Norman drew up an elaborate bombing scheme. He envi- sioned a force that would deliver twenty tons of bombs hourly for ten consecu- tive hours, so as to bring victory ‘in sight’ in a month. He was, however, a bit out of step with reality as it had taken the 41st Wing five months to drop forty- eight tons of bombs on German targets. See Williams, “Statistics,” 199-203.  190.
