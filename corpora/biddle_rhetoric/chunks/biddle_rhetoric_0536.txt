officers were not forceful. See John Ferris, The Evolution of British Strategic Policy, 1919-1926 (London: Macmillan, 1989), 7. Trenchard himself admitted in 1919 that “many good officers have left [the RAF] owing to the uncertainty as to the future of the Air Force.” See “Memorandum on Why the Royal Air Force Should be Maintained as Separate from the Navy and the Army,” 11 September 1919, in TP, MFC 76/1/21.

Jones, The Beginnings of Strategic Air Power, 22-28; Powers, Strategy Without Slide Rule, 164-67; Malcolm Smith, British Air Strategy Be- tween the Wars (Oxford: Clarendon, 1984), 19-28; and, though it is not quite as helpful here as one might hope, Andrew Boyle, Trenchard (New York: W.

See Ferris, Strategic Policy, 4, 17-18, 20-21. Ferris argues that though some scholars date the “Ten Year Rule” from 1919, this is incorrect since it was never really enforced for the Navy and the RAF before 1925, and since the phrase itself was not used until 1926 (and was not used regularly until after it was
