Kier, however, tends to overstate cultural distinctions between the Army and the RAE, giving the RAF more credit than it deserved for encouraging “individuality” and “freedom of thought” (130).  83. Shelford Bidwell and Dominick Graham have documented this trend to- ward amateurism in the interwar Royal Artillery. They argued that The Journal of the Royal Artillery, which, right after World War I had been filled with tech- nical articles, disintegrated into “a sort of house magazine rather than a serious professional journal, with articles on pig-sticking, shooting, and even a motor- ing holiday in Spain.” See Shelford Bidwell and Dominick Graham, Firepower (Boston: Allen and Unwin, 1985), 157-58.  84, Slessor, The Central Blue, 84; see 82-85 generally.  85. “Operations Record Book (RAF Form 540), the former Library of the RAF Staff College Library, now part of the Joint Services Command and Staff College.
