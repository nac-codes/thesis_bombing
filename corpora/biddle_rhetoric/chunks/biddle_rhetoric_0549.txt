nder of The Shadow of the Bomber (41-160) sh efforts through 1939. A sense of the sincerety of British efforts in the early 1930s can be discovered in the documents relating to the Conference, in AIR 8/173. For other descriptions of these events, see AIR 41/39, pp. 251- 54; Smith, British Air Strategy, 112-21; Kennett, A History of Strategic Bomb- ing, 58-71.  165. L.E.O.

As urban historian Joseph Konvitz has written, “Predictions of air raids on cities exploited contemporary concerns about the nature and behavior of crowds in the modern city. . . . It seems as if strategists, reacting to contemporary anxieties about class conflict and antisocial behavior in cities, projected fears about cities into a theory of air war.” See Joseph Konvitz, “Cities as Targets: Conceptions of Strategic Bombing, 1914-1945,” paper no. 85, De- cember 1987, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Washington, D.C, p. 5.  168.

Research on high explosive or incendiary bombs had suffered due to efforts at economy; see Titmuss, Problems of Social Policy, 6-7. For further detail, see O’Brien, Civil Defence, 52-60.  170.

In raids on Barcelona, the figure cited was 3,000 casualties for forty-two tons of bombs. Of this number, 1,000 were killed and the remainder injured (the latter number was divided arbitrarily by the Air Raid Precautions Dept. into “slightly” and “badly” injured). Thus it was estimated that for every ton of bombs, twenty-four persons would be killed, twenty-four would be badly in- jured, and another twenty-four slightly injured.  172, See Report by the Advisory Committee on London Casualty Organiza- tion, 20 July 1938, in Ministry of Health (MH) 76/128, Public Reco
