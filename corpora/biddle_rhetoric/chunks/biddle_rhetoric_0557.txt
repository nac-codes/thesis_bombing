There has been a debate in the political science literature over who de- serves credit for insuring that the British paid attention to defensive measures on the eve of World War II. Barry Posen gives credit to civilian intervention, argu- ing that without it, the “RAF never would have invested sufficient resources in Fighter Command.” Stephen Peter Rosen takes issue with this. Though he ac- knowledges that “civilian intervention in the late 1930s eventually altered the balance of resources in favor of fighter aircraft,” he points out that one must look at the activities of the RAF itself in the development of air defense in the years prior to 1935. He believes that the success of the air defense net used in 1940 was the product of “long-standing interest on the part of the RAF leader- ship in the problems of command, control, communications and intelligence in support of defensive fighter operations.” See Barry Posen, The Sources of Mili- tary Doctrine (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1984), 161, and, generally, 159- 76; Stephen Peter Rosen, Winning the Next War (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1991), 15, and, generally, 15-19; also, Rosen, “New Ways of War: Un- derstandin
