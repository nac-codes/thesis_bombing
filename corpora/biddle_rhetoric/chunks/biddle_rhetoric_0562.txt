This inclusion of women and children is not merely a sentimental and economic one, but during the last war was an actual one from a military standpoint. . . . The entire nations were combatant forces. We must expect, therefore, in case of war, to have the enemy attempt to destroy any or all of our combatant or indus- trial forces—his attacks being entirely controlled by the dictates of strategy, and the means of bringing the war to a quick conclusion.”  31. Ibid., 177.  32. According to Mitchell, “The personnel of entire cities—men, women and children—can be destroyed by gas attacks from the air” (ibid., xxii—xxiii).  33.
