The quote is from WE, 1:332-33.  105. See WE, 1:331-32.

In October 1917, Churchill wrote, “It is improbable that any terroriza- tion of the civil population which could be achieved by air attack would compel the Government of a great nation to surrender.” See Churchill’s “Munitions Possibilities of 1918,” reprinted in H.
