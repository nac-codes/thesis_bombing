fighters shot down by Fortresses are correct though made with complete sin- cerity, and the dangers of daylight bombing will increase terribly once outside fighter protection and as the range lengthens” (Churchill to Hopkins, 16 Octo- ber 1942, in AIR 8/711). Churchill was not opposed to daylight bombing per se; he merely felt that it would be impossible without long-range fighter escort.  152, The circle included Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Charles Portal, Chief of the Air Staff, RAF; Sir Archibald Sinclair, Secretary of State for Air; and Air Vice-Marshal John Slessor, Assistant Chief of the Air Staff for Policy.

See Sinclair to Churchill, minute, 28 October 1942, and also “Note by the Secretary of State for Air,” [October?] 1942, in AIR 8/711. In the latter, Sinclair wrote, “Americans are much like other people—they prefer to learn from their own experience. In spite of some admitted defects—including lack of experience—their leadership is of a high order, and the quality of their air crews is magnificent. If their policy of day bombing proves to their own satisfaction to be unsuccessful or prohibitively expensive they will abandon it and turn to night action. ... They will not turn aside from day bombing till they are convinced that it has failed: they will not be convinced except by their own experience.” See also WE, 1:360-63.  157. Portal to Churchill, minute, 7 November 1942, in AIR 8/711. On 12 January 1943, Sinclair once again urged Churchill to be diplomatic, and to give the Americans a chance (see Sinclair to Churchill, minute, 12 January 1943, in AIR 8/711).  158. Col. Edgar P.
