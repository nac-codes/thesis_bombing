pulation. Sinclair attempted to assuage Salisbury’s fears by pointing out that there had been no change in the government's policy. He explained that “Harris is an airman, and he thinks of Germany in terms of War. He thinks of Berlin as the heart of the German war organism.” Sinclair then went on to list for Salisbury the many war manufactures represented in the capital city.

Harris to Street, 23 December 1943, in AIR 14/843. (See also Street to Harris, 15 December 1943.) Street finally answered Harris on 2 March 1944. He explained that while the Air Ministry recognized that “the attack on Ger- many’s war economy must entail heavy casualties to the civil population your directive neither requires nor enjoins direct attack on German civilians as such.” But he then added that there had been no attempt “to disguise from the public the fact that your Command’s attacks are aimed at the destruction of vast acre- ages of industrial cities.” Harris was prepared to settle on such wording. On 7 March he wrote Street to say that he was “relieved to find . . . explicit recogni- tion of the fact that Bomber Command's attacks aim deliberately at the destruc- tion of vast acreages of German industrial cities.” See Street to Harris, 2 March 1944, and Harris to Street, 7 March 1944, in AIR 14/843.
