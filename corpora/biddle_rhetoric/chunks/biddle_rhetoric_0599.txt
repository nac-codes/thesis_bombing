Despite the great differences in their ap- proaches to strategic bombing, Harris and Eaker actually had a strong friend- ship. For example, see letter, Harris to Eaker, 18 June 1945, in HP, folder 28.  50. See Davis, Spaatz, 289-90.  51, The British view was summed up well in a letter from Portal to Churchill, of 3 June 1941. The CAS told the prime minister, “Experience has shown . . . that the long range fighter is not able to operate successfully with the radius of action of the enemy’s short range fighter force.” Churchill responded simply, “This closes many doors of hope and opportunity” (in PP, folder 2 [Corre- spondence with prime minister, April-June 1941]).  52, AWPD/2, quoted in WE, 2:77.  53.

Hays Parks, “Precision and ‘Area’ Bombing: Who Did Which and When?” The Journal of Strategic Studies 18, no. 1 (March 1995):145-74, esp. 148, 153. In a question period following remarks to the press in October 1943, Arnold admitted that the Americans “do pattern bombing sometimes.” But he confused the issue and misled those present by implying that pattern bombing, rather than the normal mode of all operations, was a distinct form, “done more for the breaking of morale of the people, confusion, and that sort of stuff in a community, and for destroying a city, more than it is to knock
