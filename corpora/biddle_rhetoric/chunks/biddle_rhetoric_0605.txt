A mid-September memo by the British Chiefs of Staff  372 NOTES TO CHAPTER §  reiterated the priority of oil attacks, but added, “Rapid developments in the strategic situation are now taking place. It may become desirable in the immedi- ate future, to apply the whole of the strategic bomber effort to the direct attack of German morale.” Memorandum by the British Chiefs of Staff, CCS 520/3 (Octagon), 12 September 1944, p. 4; copy in SP, box 18, (diary).  111. Eisenhower concluded by stating, “The policies under which you are now operating will be unchanged unless in my opinion an opportunity arises where a sudden and devastating blow may have an incalculable result.” See Spaatz to Eisenhower, 24 August 1944, and Eisenhower message to Spaatz, 28 August 1944, in SP, Box 18 (diary).  112. Spaatz quoted by Davis in “German Railyards,” 52. In recent years the topic of morality and American strategic bombing has garnered attention in the literature. See Ronald Schaffer, Wings of Judgment (New York: Oxford Univer- sity Press, 1985); Michael Sherry, The Rise of American Air Power (New Ha- ven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1987); Conrad C. Crane, Bombs, Cities, and Civilians (Manhattan: University Press of Kansas, 1993). For an earlier but still useful study, see Gary Shandroff, “The Evolution of Area Bombing in American Doctrine and Practice” (Ph.D. diss., New York University, 1972).  113. AWPD / 1 argued that: “Timeliness of attack is most important in the conduct of air operations directly against civil morale. If the morale of the peo- ple is already low because of sustained suffering and deprivation and because the people are losing faith in the ability of the armed forces to win a favorable decision, then heavy and sustained bombing of cities may crash that morale entirely” (AWPD / 1 quoted in Davis, Spaatz, 435-36).  114.
