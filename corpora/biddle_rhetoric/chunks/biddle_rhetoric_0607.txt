Of the 12.9 percent of bombs that hit within the factory perimeter, 1.8 percent of the total failed to explode, 7.6 percent landed in empty spaces, and 1.3 percent hit pipelines and other utilities. See United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS), Oil Division Final Report, 2nd ed., January 1947, p. 121.  127. These figures are from Davis, Spaatz, 500.  128. Ibid., 433-35.  129. The force bombed through 8/10ths to 10/10ths cloud cover fully 50 percent of the time. In addition, heavy bomber accuracy was dramatically af- fected by the number of combat boxes attacking a given target. The accuracy achieved by the first three boxes of the formation was over twice as great as that of succeeding groups.
