Some dispersal was achieved by building small distillation plants in sheltered places and increasing the number of benzol plants, but this could only make a small contribution to the total supply. In addition, the plants were too complicated to build quickly. See WE, 3:231.  146. Portal to Harris, 8 January 1945, in PP, folder 10C; Portal to Harris, 12 November 1944; in PP, folder 10B.

In 1961, Webster and Frankland strongly implied that Bomber Com- mand did not take full advantage of an opportunity presented to it by the oil offensive. They speculated that attacks that might have been undertaken in Oc- tober and November were likely to have been as effective as the attacks that were in fact undertaken by Harris (after great pressure from Portal) in Decem- ber and January (WE, 3:242-43), In 1988, F H. Hinsley and his coauthors argued that while intelligence information on the increasingly critical German oil situation spurred the USSTAF to greater efforts against the target in mid- September, the intelligence “produced no change ... in Bomber Command’s programme.” The authors added that Bomber Command made “only token gestures to the oil offensive, a strategy by which the Air Staff now set great store.” In their concluding remarks on the issue, they pointed out that, “it is not possible to doubt that, effected in July or August and maintained into the au- tumn, comparable marginal diversion of its effort from areas bombing to the oil offensive would have brought forward to an earlier date the reduction of Ger- man pro
