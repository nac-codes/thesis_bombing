In Greenhous (The Crucible of War), Stephen Harris argued, “It would be an exaggeration to say the the AOC-in-C ever did his utmost to knock out the German oil industry. Operations in November and December featured an eclec- tic mix of objectives in which the proportion of sorties given over to the destruc- tion of the enemy’s synthetic oil plants was less than one in four” (847). Re- cently, however, Sebastian Cox has argued that instead of mere ex post facto arguments, Harris’s assertions that weather and other tactical factors put con- straints on him were indeed legitimate claims at the time. See Cox’s introduction to Harris's Despatch on War Operations (London: Frank Cass, 1995), xxi- xxiii.  147, Portal told Harris, “In view of the doubt which exists as to the point to which area attacks must be carried to be decisive in themselves, it is clearly the sounder policy now to employ the bomber forces so that they can make a calcu lable contribution to the offensive as a whole.” (Portal to Harris, 8 January 1945, in PP, folder 10C).  148.

Insisting that enemy counter- measures had gotten ahead of Bomber Command before it was able to bring the area offensive to a decisive point, Portal argued that it was only the American air campaign that had made Overlord possible and had given Bomber Com- mand “a new lease on life” in its own
