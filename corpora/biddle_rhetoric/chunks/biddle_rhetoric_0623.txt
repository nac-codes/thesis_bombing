ate, Air Ministry, 11 April 1945, in AIR 14/902.  276, Harris wrote, early in the book, “As a matter of strict calculation it was therefore obvious that the policy of destroying industrial cities, and the factories in them, was not merely the only possible one for Bomber Command at that time; it was also the best way of destroying Germany's capacity to produce war material” (Bomber Offensive, 88).  277.

Harris concluded that Webster, because of his affiliation with the Lon- don School of Economics, had leftist leanings. Harris assessed Frankland, on grounds that are far from obvious, to be a disgruntled former RAF navigator and a “rabid individual.” See Noble Frankland, “Some Thoughts about and Experience of Official Military History,” Journal of the Royal Air Force Histori- cal Society,” no. 17 (1997): 7-18.  288, WE, 3:291-93.  289. The authors added, “In the event, the Eighth Air Force was cast by a combination of resolution and rigidity into headlong assault on the German fighter force. It was almost involved in tragic defeat, but the ultimate result was the downfall of the Luftwaffe” (WE, 2:38-39)
