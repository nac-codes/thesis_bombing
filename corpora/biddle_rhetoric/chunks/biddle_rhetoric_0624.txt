In the conclusion to his comprehensive history of General Spaatz and the World War II strategic air war, American historian Richard G. Davis credited strategic bombing for ending the war months earlier than otherwise might have been the case—and thereby saving the lives not only of Allied soldiers but also of those suffering at the hands of the Third Reich (Spaatz, 596).  295.

Following Overy, Cox levels a general critique of the BBSU authors for their heavy reliance on a flawed analysis of the German war economy written by Dr. Rolf Wagenfuehs, a former senior official in the Reich Statistical Office.
