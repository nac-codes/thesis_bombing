forces, and the dreadful suffering of its civilian population, would alone have warranted it. The course and end of the Second World War was also determined by the defeat in the theatre of war in the skies above the Reich that had begun in January 1943, and that is described in detail up to the early summer of 1944 in the present volume. Three extensive sections cover the Allied air offensive, the German air defences, and the offensive response in which the reaction of German leaders to the Anglo-American raids went beyond an intensification of their own counter- measures. In all three there is evidence of the inescapable wearing-down of the German ability to fight in the air. In both quantity and quality the Luftwaffe had long lagged behind its enemies, who from the spring of 1944 enjoyed, at least in daylight hours, mastery of the skies over Germany. For the Allies, too, this brought substantial losses; but with their almost inexhaustible resources and uninterrupted arms production these could readily be made good. It was a possibility denied to the Germans, who were forced to recognize that in some ways they had fallen behind technologically, and who most of all were suffering intractable shortages of both men and materials. The to varying degrees indis- criminate attacks by Allied bombers on industrial targets and residential areas did not, however, lead to the level of demoralization among the civilian population that some of their commanders had hoped would put pressure on the German leadership to accept defeat. The Allied air forces nonetheless severely weakened the German fighter strength, overloading the German air defences as a whole and hastening their collapse. Matters were made no easier by Hitler continuing to vacillate between arming for defence or for attack-between building fighters or building bombers; not until June 1944 did he halfheartedly decide to concentrate on fighters. In the Luftwaffe sector too, including air defence, the Germans were fa
