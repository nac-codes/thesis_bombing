f action so as to cripple the three main components of the German military machine-the U-boats, the Luftwaffe, and ground troops-as well as the correspondng factories.10 With hindsight we can see that the joint 'Jockey Committee' set up to identify the POINTBLANK targets, and the Committee of Operations Analysts understandably made mistakes. They were, for instance, wrong in attaching too much importance to airframe factories compared to aero-engine works, and to the U-boat bases and yards (in ignorance, in the latter case, of the move to modular construction); and they underestimated the significance of the oil and fuel industry and its close links not only with synthetic rubber and nitrogen production but also with that of the chemical industry as a whole. Remarkably, the electricity supply network was also left out of the reckoning;11 it was thought to be too flexible to be vulnerable. The new selective programme, also known as the Eaker Plan, was put to the US chiefs of staff by Eaker in Washington on 29 April 1943.12 It roughly matched the Western Air Plans13 with which RAF Bomber Command had entered the war in 1939, and which had been judged impossible to carry out in daylight by closed-up bomber 'box' formations without fighter cover. The British were therefore understandably sceptical. But the Americans, on the basis of the small number of raids they had made on targets in northern France and north-west German in the first three months of 1943, felt that precision pattern bombing by day from heights between 6,000 and 9,000 metres was possible despite the Germany flak and fighters; and they believed that 100 heavy bombers could hit and destroy a target within a radius of about 900 m 10 Army Air Forces, ii. 348-70; see criticism from the Ministry of Economic Warfare, 3 Apr. 1943, Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 222, 279, 282; iv. 267-72; Hinsley, British Intelligence, ii. 291, 491. 11 Army Air Forces, ii. 348-76; Kuehl, 'Electricity', 239.
