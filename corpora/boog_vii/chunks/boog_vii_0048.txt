a contest between the two bomber forces so long as the feasibility of the American proposal was not certain. Among the British, at least, the moral issues played hardly any role when judging the right way of bombing. What mattered were, as already at Casablanca, prag- matic considerations, questions of assumed effectiveness, the operational possibilities, and the strategic objectives. This was generally also true of the Americans; with them, however, there was also the need to consider the ethical image of their bomber forces in the eyes of their own people; this could be safeguarded better with selective targeting than with area bombing. The latter was therefore happily left to the British,24 since both methods were after all intended to lead to the same end. The Eaker Plan for a combined bombing offensive from Britain was accepted by the combined chiefs of staff on 14 May 1943,25 with a few amendments favouring the position of ACM Harris, and thereupon approved by Roosevelt and Churchill deliberately without discussion (which would only have called attention to the plan's inconsistencies).26 The plan said nothing at 19 'The German Fighter Position', report 7 Mar. 1943, LoC, Arnold Papers, Box 274. 20 CCS 217, encl.
