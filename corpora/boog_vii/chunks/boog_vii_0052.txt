so the need to consider the ethical image of their bomber forces in the eyes of their own people; this could be safeguarded better with selective targeting than with area bombing. The latter was therefore happily left to the British,24 since both methods were after all intended to lead to the same end. The Eaker Plan for a combined bombing offensive from Britain was accepted by the combined chiefs of staff on 14 May 1943,25 with a few amendments favouring the position of ACM Harris, and thereupon approved by Roosevelt and Churchill deliberately without discussion (which would only have called attention to the plan's inconsistencies).26 The plan said nothing at 19 'The German Fighter Position', report 7 Mar. 1943, LoC, Arnold Papers, Box 274. 20 CCS 217, encl.

Bomber Command Night Raids 14 all about what British bomber operations were to be like, merely stating that they would complement the American operations and referring with satis- faction to the frequent 'identity' between British area-bombing targets and the American industrial ones-an identity that in fact only partly existed. Further, the night fighters were also included as an 'intermediate objective' since they could bring the British night raids to a halt or lessen their effect, though the main reason was to make the attacks on the German fighter-aircraft factories palatable to Harris. He, however, found this no more attractive. Placing his trust in the successes achieved in the early months of 1943 wi
