to make the attacks on the German fighter-aircraft factories palatable to Harris. He, however, found this no more attractive. Placing his trust in the successes achieved in the early months of 1943 with the new scientific aids of OBOE and the H2S panoramic radar, and with the new target- marking bombs,27 he believed that his night area-bombing raids could be 'lethal' to the Germans within 'a surprisingly short period of time'.28 Yet the new plan declared German fighter production to be for the time being the main (the text called it 'intermediate') target ahead of the U-boats, particularly since the latters' defeat in the Atlantic was by then in sight. The real main target remained, as in the Casablanca Directive, the progressive destruction of sources of German power and the sapping of the will to resist. But-and here we see the influence of Harris on the final wording-the temporary main, or interim, target (the German fighters), the four primary targets (U-boats, aircraft fuselages, ball-bearings, and fuel), and the two secondary targets (rubber and military transport vehicles) were now allocated solely to the 8th Air Force. The task for Bomber Command was described vaguely as 'separate' and aimed at the general destruction of German industry; operations were to complement those of the Americans only 'so far as practically possible'. The POINTBLANK Directive (as the plan was now also known) finally handed to the two bomber forces on 10 June 194329 was an invitation to the Americans to give proof of the effectiveness of their 'daylight precision raids' (which were in practice the area bombing of selected industrial targets and their immediate surroundings), and a licence to Harris to carry on with the indiscriminate area bombing of German industrial cities by night.30 The British did not go along with Gen. Arnold's attempts to give bomber operations a tight and unified overall command; they were afraid that with the growing material superiority of the Americans the
