The British did not go along with Gen. Arnold's attempts to give bomber operations a tight and unified overall command; they were afraid that with the growing material superiority of the Americans they would lose their independence in the air war.31 Though the thus loosely controlled bombing war was meant to be only the necessary preliminary stage leading up to an invasion, both Gen. Carl A. Spaatz and Harris were secretly quite sure in their own minds that before then they could, each in their own way, bring about the fall of Germany by bombing and without a land offensive; one reason for the latter's belief was the widespread 27 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, iv. 3-17; Harris, Despatch, 67-8, 70-90; Germany and the Second World War, vi. 573. 28 Harris to Portal, 15 May 1943, Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 25. 29 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 22-31 and iv. 273-83. 30 Ibid. ii. 22-31; Terraine, Right of the Line, 542-5. 31 Hastings, Bomber Command, 186-7. 15 aversion in Britain to a repeat of the bloody trench warfare of the First World War, together with memories of the defeat in France in 1940.32 2.

Around a third of the aircraft were now the four-engined Lancaster, which had gained for itself a reputation towering above that of all other types. The number of twin-engined bombers, on the other hand, had halved, and they were now used for training. Bomber Command was much more combat- ready than before. The number of aircraft used in operations rose four-and-a- half times
