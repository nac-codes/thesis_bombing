mbers, on the other hand, had halved, and they were now used for training. Bomber Command was much more combat- ready than before. The number of aircraft used in operations rose four-and-a- half times between February 1942 and February 1943, while over the same period the bomblift capacity had also doubled; and the upwards trend con- tinued in 1943. The actual aircraft strength of Bomber Command doubled by the beginning of 1944, with three times the number of Lancasters, as did the total of aircraft sorties and the tonnage of bombs dropped. Moreover, light bombers were, where use of them was not ruled out for tactical reasons, gradually replaced with the fast and enormously versatile twin-engined Mos- quito, which the German fighters could at first barely catch up with. It was an ideal aircraft, built of wood, and was in early 1943 to bring an improvement to Bomber Command's still very poor bomb-aiming accuracy.33 By the turn of 1942/3 the navigational, bomb-aiming, and target-marking procedures so urgently needed to remedy this were ready to come into use.34 The OBOE radio-navigation system had already been tested over northern France during the winter of 1941/2 as a blind-bombing method, and used in a series of smallish test raids in the area along the Dutch-Belgian-German border to gather data on the accuracy achieved. The relative precision of the bombing amazed the Germans. Already by 28 July 1942 a single Mosquito had hit a target at Krupp's in Essen very accurately with four 225-kg bombs, causing substantial damage in the crankshaft shop.35 Faced with repeated bombing raids like this, the Germans made an intensive search for the reason for this level of accuracy.
