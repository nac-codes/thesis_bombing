DIAGRAM I.I.I. RAF Bomber Command's OBOE guidance system, from December 1942 counter-measures were still not possible because the British had by then moved their radio-navigation transmissions from the 1.5-m waveband down to 9 cm and even shorter, which could not be jammed.36 According to British calculations, the test raids showed the average deviation from the aiming point to be around 600 m, though occasionally it could be up to 2 km or more. 37 In a raid on Essen on the night of 9/10 January 1943, 60 per cent of the bombers 36 Dahl, Bumerang, Price, Instruments of Darkness, 122, 124, 133-4, 137, 139, 164, 176, 189-91, 207-8, 218-19, 228, 236; Boog, 'Oboe Case'. 37 Harris, Despatch, 12, ยง 31. 17 dropped their load within a 5-km circle around their aiming point; previously, only 20 per cent had managed this degree of 'accuracy'. In theory, OBOE allowed accuracy to within 90 metres. By the standards of the day, the new bomb-aiming system brought considerable progress. In the OBOE system, an aircraft was guided along a path at a fixed distance from a ground station with the aid
