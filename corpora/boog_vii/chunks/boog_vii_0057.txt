s. By the standards of the day, the new bomb-aiming system brought considerable progress. In the OBOE system, an aircraft was guided along a path at a fixed distance from a ground station with the aid of radio signals that it amplified and sent back (hence its German name of 'Bumerang'); the time interval needed for the return of the pulses indicated the aircraft's position. When a pilot kept on the planned course, he heard a constant tone-similar to the sound of an oboe-in his headphones. If he strayed, short and long pulses (dots and dashes) told him to make corrections. The circle the aircraft was tracing passed close to one side of the target, since after release the bombs would travel on a tangent, that is to say outwards. If the height and speed of the aircraft was known, all this could be calculated precisely. Unlike the German system which worked on much the same principle, OBOE did not use a permanent guidance beam that could be either jammed or used to locate the aircraft. A second ground station (called 'Mouse') sited around 160 km from the first (called 'Cat') was also able to calculate the course of the aircraft, and gave the signal to release the bombs when it reached the right point. Like the German 'Y' navigation system, the ground station determined the moment for bomb release irrespective of the weather or of any battle situation the aircraft was in. The system had its disadvantages, in that during any ten minutes (the time needed to get an aircraft onto the right track and send it the individual signals to prepare for bomb release) only one aircraft could be guided, that it had to fly on a fixed course for that length of time, and had to transmit signals (albeit brief ones) from which it could be located by the enemy. The latter weak spot could in practice be ignored, given the high speed of the Mosquitoes, and was later avoided entirely by the switch to the 3-cm waveband which the Germans, due to a shortage of radio valves, could neither jam nor
