ctice be ignored, given the high speed of the Mosquitoes, and was later avoided entirely by the switch to the 3-cm waveband which the Germans, due to a shortage of radio valves, could neither jam nor use for plotting. The first disadvantage was avoided by using the light Mosquito not as a bomber but as a target marker, precisely placing marker bombs on which the following mass of bombers could drop their bomb-load. The range of OBOE was limited to 400-500 km, with the release height needed for the bomber rising with its distance from the ground station; over the Ruhr this was some 8,000-10,000 metres. The Mosquito, with its light weight and high operational ceiling, was well suited to altitudes like these. Quite accurate bombing from a great height was now possible.38 There was, moreover, a further radar-navigation system available to over- come the range limitations of OBOE, usable right up to the full operating range of the bomber, since both transmitter and receiver were on board the aircraft. This equipment, known as H2S, was first used operationally (though without 38 Harris, Despatch, 67-8, 84-6; Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, iv. 7-11; Jones, Most Secret War, 274-5; Groehler, Bombenkrieg, 100-2; Trenkle, Funkst√∂rverfahren, 128.  1.1.
