they did drift with the wind they allowed relatively more accurate bombing than hitherto when cloud or mist prevented a clear view of the ground. Three target-marking methods were developed, given codenames derived from the commander of the Pathfinder force, the New Zealander Air Vice-Marshal Clifford Tyndall Bennett. 'Parramatta' (Bennett's own birthplace) stood for blind ground marking and 'Newhaven' (the home town of his corporal) for visual ground marking, while 'Wanganui' (the home of an officer friend) was sky marking. In 'Parramatta', the aircraft released their 39 GL development meeting, 12 Mar. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/35, sheet 3263; Reuter, Funkmeß, 114. 41 Reuter, Funkmeß, 30-1. 40 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 102. 42 Galland, The First and the Last, 69. 43 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 94 and iv. 11-13; Harris, Despatch, 70-2, 79-82, 135; Harris to Churchill, 17 Apr. 1943, PRO, PREM. 19 parachute flares using electronic navigation; follow-up marker planes then pinpointed the target area more closely with 'spot-fire' TIs. 'Master bombers' watched over the target from aloft and directed the bombing, bringing a further refinement to the method by using R/T to speak to the bombers. For 'Newhaven' the target area was first illuminated with flares, and the aiming point then identified visually by special marker aircraft and indicated with spot-fire TIs. When clouds covered the target area, the airspace above it was simply marked out using the 'Wanganui' method: by the middle of 1943 the burn-time of the markers had been increased to twelve minutes. In cases where the lead aircraft was fitted not with H2S but with an OBOE gear (which was far more accurate), the word 'musical' was added to give 'Musical Parramatta', and so on.44 An important British weapon in the bombing war was the jamming of German radar. During the raid on Bruneval on 27 February 1942, and again later that year at El Alamein, Würzburg radar sets-as parts
