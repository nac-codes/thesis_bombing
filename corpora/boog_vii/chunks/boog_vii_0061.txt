An important British weapon in the bombing war was the jamming of German radar. During the raid on Bruneval on 27 February 1942, and again later that year at El Alamein, Würzburg radar sets-as parts or complete-fell into British hands. During the Dieppe raid in August the British had also got a closer look at the Freya gear, and this enabled them to discover the wave- lengths used, and develop jamming methods. The best-known, and simplest, of these was WINDOW.45 It involved scattering, during bombing raids, bundles of aluminium or tinfoil strips cut to half the wavelength of the German radar; this produced a diffuse, cloudy shimmer on the radar screens that made plotting the bomber's position well-nigh impossible. Jamming did not affect the 9-cm waves of the British airborne radars, though it did-as was strongly suggested by a kind of decoy flight late in 1942, and then confirmed in May 1943-cause interference on the wavelength of the Lichtenstein airborne interception (AI) radar carried by German night fighters at the time.46 Although it had long been known in Britain that the Germans were doing research along the same lines, this means of jamming had not been used through a fear that the Germans could then cripple Britain's defensive radar in the same way. In particular, both the inventor of radar in Britain, Sir Robert Watson-Watt, and RAF Fighter Command were against using it prematurely; the former because this would expose the whole vulnerability of his invention, and the latter because it felt Britain was still on the defensive and the German bomber force still too powerful. For a long time the use of the WINDOW metal strips was blocked since the minister for home security feared that the Germans could likewise use their 'Düppel' aluminium foil (as they called it, from the site where it was first tested) against Britain and make life even more unpleasant for its population than it had been in 1940. The story of WINDOW thus illustrates the extent to which the
