towns were destroyed.48 Between the time the raids were ordered on 14 January 1943 and called off on 6 April, more than 3,000 bombers dropped their loads on U-boat targets a instructed, without any success. There was no lessening in the intensity of the U-boat war over this period, though it did give an opportunity for further practice with OBOE using Mosquitoes. The diversion of resources to Italy was considerably less, and in the first three months of 1943 involved only 336 bombers. It provided further tactical experience with the new electronic navigation and target-marking methods, a purpose also served by the first attacks of their kind on Lutterade on 20 December 1942 (OBOE), Berlin on 16 January 1943 (target indicators), and Hamburg on 30 January (H2S). When Cologne was raided on 2 February 1943 all three were tested at the same time but without a satisfactory check on their results being possible. Experience gained between February and April 1943 led to the conclusion that H2S, with its lesser accuracy, could best be used for an initial illumination of the target area, to make visual identification of the target easier. Blind target-marking with H2S was too inexact for bombing purposes. The trial attacks in the early months of 1943 convinced Harris that Bomber Command was 'at long last ready and equipped'49 for launching the really big bomber offensive.50 In his report after the war, he therefore entitled the chapter starting in March 1943. 'The Main Offensive Opens'.51 The prologue to it was the raids on the northern Italian ports and industrial cities of Genoa, Milan, Turin, and La Spezia from 23/4 October 1942 to 14/15 February 1943.52 47 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 97; Harris, Bomber Offensive, 137. 48 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, iv. 152-3, 155; DÃ¶nitz quoted from ibid. ii. 97. 49 Harris, Bomber Offensive, 144. 50 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 100-7. 51 Harris, Despatch, p. xv (introd. by
