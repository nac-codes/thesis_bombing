Frankfurt a. M. o LUX (b) The Battle of the Ruhr From the spring of 1943 to spring 1944 Bomber Command-fortified in it war strategy-waged, spread over time and in deliberately chosen order, three great air battles: the Battle of the Ruhr, from 5 March to 14 (or 30) July 1943 the Battle of Hamburg, from 24 July to 18 November 1943; and leading on from that the Battle of Berlin, up to 31 March 1944. The sequence reveals the operational plan to work step-by-step towards the centre of German power Berlin; this would be done while building up the offensive means, strength and tactics, perfecting bombing accuracy, and adapting to the available navigational and bomb-aiming techniques and the differing hours of darkness with the tactical possibilities these provided. With Berlin knocked out, Harris believed, the German population's resistance would be weakened to the extent planned in the Casablanca Directive. Highlighting these three major operations does not mean that Bomber Command's attention was limited to these three target areas. Time and again. Moselle E C Meuse Z Ober- hausen.
