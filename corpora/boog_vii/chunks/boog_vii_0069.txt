1943. As the home of the fabled Krupps works, Essen58 was at the same time for the British a synonym for the German military might they were fighting against. For them it formed the very heart of German armaments, so air raids on that city were especially popular in Britain. Even those who opposed area bombing excluded Essen from the list of towns that should be spared.59 The city was a difficult target. Industrial haze, and the way its built-up area merged into that of other conurbations, made it hard to identify. On top of this there was the stiff defence by German flak and fighters that, during raids that (at least up to the end of 1942) were not particularly successful, inflicted heavy losses on Bomber Command and even caused a crisis among the bomber crews. Harris, however, pressed on with the attacks;60 the British aircrews' ironic name for the Ruhr area was 'Happy Valley'.61 Essen was, after Berlin, the second most heavily bombed city in Germany; it was under attack for almost five years, from 24 May 1940 through to II March 1945, when 1,053 British heavy bombers yet again dropped 4,737 t of high-explosive and incendiaries. In all, some 36,000 t of bombs fell on the Ruhr metropolis, killing around 6,600 people.62 With its 667,000 inhabitants living in 62,200 dwellings spread over 188 sq. km., it was Germany's sixth largest city, where there were 22 coal mines, 20 engineering works, a hot-rolling mill, 25 iron and steel works, six foundries, a car factory, eight coking plants, two glassworks, and 31 clothing factories.63 Symbolic of this concentration of industry stood the Krupp concern, with its plants in the centre of the city, including in particular the works producing cast steel for making armour plating, heavy artillery, and tank turrets. Krupp employed about 43 per cent of a 99,000 local industrial workforce. The British, however, undoubtedly overestimated the importance of Essen and the Ruhr for Germany's total armaments effort, 64 for the value of the
