Its steel production amounted to only I per cent of the total German capacity, and for that reason Essen concentrated more on the testing of new weapons and the manufacture of ultra-heavy special artillery 27 pieces.65 If one disregards the synthetic fuel plants on the outskirts of a few of its towns, only little was produced in the Ruhr that was of immediate use or essential for the German war effort. Its contribution to arms production amounted to no more than 25 per cent or thereabouts; in tank manufacture it was only 10 per cent; and there was only one aircraft factory. Furthermore, the machine tools equipping the Ruhr factories were fairly immune to destruction, as the following raids were to show.66 Harris had hoped in the spring of 194267 that when using the GEE navigation system at least 50 per cent of the bombs dropped in any one raid would hit a city like Essen; so his expectations of the far more accurate OBOE system, which was unaffected by industrial haze and bad weather and now ready for use, were all the higher. Although the aiming-point for the night of 5/6 March 1943 was an industrial precision target-the Krupp works-this large-scale raid brought no variation from the tactic that had been the rule for a year past of always having the focus o
