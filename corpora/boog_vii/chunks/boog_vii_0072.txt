ight of 5/6 March 1943 was an industrial precision target-the Krupp works-this large-scale raid brought no variation from the tactic that had been the rule for a year past of always having the focus of the attack in the middle of a city, where there would be the most tightly packed buildings and densest population and that (because of the centuries-old town centres with their half-timbered houses) would also catch fire most easily. The Krupp works lay right at this centre. In this connection, Harris stressed once again in his memoirs that, except in Essen, in no instance were we aiming specifically at any one factory during the Battle of the Ruhr; the destruction of factories, which was nevertheless on an enormous scale, could be regarded as a bonus. The aiming-points were usually right in the centre of the town ... The object of the campaign was to reduce production of the Ruhr at least as much by the indirect effect of damage to services, housing, and amenities, as by any direct damage to the factories or railways themselves. 68 The raid on 5/6 March was made using 'Musical Parramatta', and was extremely successful. The first OBOE-equipped Mosquito reached Essen at 2058h, two minutes early, and released its marker flares blind. It was fol- lowed at intervals of a few minutes, until shortly after 2130h, by other OBOE Mosquitoes of 8 (Pathfinder) Group, who did the same. These blind markers were backed up by 21 heavy bombers who more or less simultaneously dropped green flares inside the target area already marked out in red. Then came, partly overlapping, three waves of mainly heavy bombers which dropped a total of 1,014.8 t of bombs, over half of them (524.4 t) incendiaries, which Portal termed 'the main weapon for lasting destruction'. A third of the HE bombs were fitted with delayed-action fuses, so as to hinder the work of the fire-fighting services. Out of 442 aircraft, 367 arrived over the target; 61, including three OBOE Mosquitoes, had to abort; 14 bombers
