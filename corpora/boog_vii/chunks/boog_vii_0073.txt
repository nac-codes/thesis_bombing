tted with delayed-action fuses, so as to hinder the work of the fire-fighting services. Out of 442 aircraft, 367 arrived over the target; 61, including three OBOE Mosquitoes, had to abort; 14 bombers (a relatively small total) were lost, while 38 more were damaged. Only 153 bombers managed to place their bomb-load within a 3-mile (c.5 km) radius of the aiming-point. By 65 USSBS, ii.

The Krupp works and city suffered severe devastation with about 0.6 sq. km of the built-up area totally destroyed; in about a further 1.8 sq. km the bombs damaged or destroyed three-quarters of the buildings This was the first major success against a previously hard-to-hit target.69 It soon became clear, however, that similar results could not be hoped for beyond the range of the OBOE system. On the night of 8/9 March 335 planes attacked Nuremberg using the H2S-guided Newhaven procedure. Visibili was poor, and some of the Pathfinder illuminators had to place their TIs using the radar image; some of the sets were not working. The bombs fell widel scattered, and only by chance fell on some of the suburbs and factories. 70 The cities of the Ruhr and Rhineland, on the other hand, did suffer severel from the night raids; on 12/13 March71 Essen was hit even harder than the weel Inge before. But weather, tactical and technical errors, and other circumstances infrequently made all the bombers' efforts fruitless even within OBOE ran Duisburg, the city that received most attacks during the Battle of the Rub withstood four raids relatively well, but then suffered much destruction durin the fifth and final one on 12/13 May.72 The OBOE marking was extremely precise so that around 85 per cent of all b
