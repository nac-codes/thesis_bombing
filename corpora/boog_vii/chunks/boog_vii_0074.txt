he Rub withstood four raids relatively well, but then suffered much destruction durin the fifth and final one on 12/13 May.72 The OBOE marking was extremely precise so that around 85 per cent of all bombs fell within 3 miles of the aiming-point In the Rhineland and Ruhr the number of civilian casualties exceeded all those so far in the air war over Europe. The two raids on Wuppertal-Barmen on 29/20 May and 24/5 June claimed almost 5,000 lives.73 That in May was particularly heavy, with both the red TIs and the green flares from the OBOE visual markers well placed. In good visibility these were backed up by 44 'fire-raising' bombers carrying incendiaries, so that the main bomber stream could readily identifi the target. Out of 611 attacking bombers 475 hit within 3 miles of the aiming- point, destroying 90 per cent of the town centre and half of the outlying districts A great many factories were also hit, making this one of Bomber Command's most effective area-bombing raids ever. On the other hand, the two raids on Pilsen, 74 for instance, which had to be carried out using the H2S panoramic radar, showed again how inaccurate this was. During the first, on 16/17 April, the Pathfinders confused the Skoda works with a mental hospital near Dobrany. During the second, on 13/14 May. they achieved a good concentration of bombs in open country some 2-3 miles north of the factory. Yet the attack on Stettin on 20/1 April, also carried out using H2S, destroyed an area of quarter of a square mile in the industrial district plus a substantial part of the town centre. 75 69 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 108, 114, 118.
