Only four to six weeks of industrial output were lost, as the dispersal of industrial concerns such as Rheinmetall-Borsig of Düsseldorf78 had already begun.79 The cost to Bomber Command of 43 major raids was, however, considerable: about 18,500 bomber sorties were made, with a total loss of 872 (4.7 per cent) of the aircraft, with their crew-members numbering some 6,000, and a further 2,126 aircraft sustained sometimes irreparable damage.80 With average total losses of 5 per cent, the offensive would have been unsustainable in the long term, and already 16 per cent of all aircraft used were falling into the two loss categories. The main weapon of this bomber offensive, OBOE, had however proved its worth, and despite the high losses the total fleet of bombers was actually increased, from 663 in March 1943 to 776 in July.81 (c) Partly Successful Day and Night Precision Raids, But No Departure from Area Bombing While the raids in the Battle of the Ruhr usi
