s was actually increased, from 663 in March 1943 to 776 in July.81 (c) Partly Successful Day and Night Precision Raids, But No Departure from Area Bombing While the raids in the Battle of the Ruhr using OBOE and H2S still varied in their effectiveness, at least those carried out with OBOE showed how to move from area to precision bombing: at both Essen and Wuppertal-Barmen they had achieved an impressive concentration of the bombs around the aiming- point. Though the Mosquitoes that made this possible were unarmed, they were, because of their speed, almost invulnerable to the German defences. 82 Instead of city centres, it had been possible to take factories on the outskirts as the aiming-point. Yet here again the efficiency calculations of Lord Hugh Trenchard83 come to mind; these had in fact been confirmed by the attack on the Skoda works in Pilsen. In night raids on selected industrial targets lying mostly on the edge of or outside cities, most of the bombs fell in open fields and did no damage. As Harris later wrote,84 he could at this stage of the war see no alternative in respect of the means and methods for attacking German industry. At the same time, however, he had good reason to assume that the indirect effects of the general devastation would in the long run be enormously 76 According to Middlebrook and Everitt, Bomber Command War Diaries, 415, the night raid on Remscheid on 30/3 July 1943 brought the Battle of the Ruhr to a close. 77 Levine, Strategic Bombing, 53. 78 Ibid., and USSBS, Report No. 105: Rheinmetall-Borsig, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, NA RG 243. 79 Levine, Strategic Bombing, 53.
