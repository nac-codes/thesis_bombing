There had earlier been protests from Charles de Gaulle about Allied bombing of French towns causing heavy civilian casualties, followed by others from the French and Dutch governments-in-exile. The recommendation stemmed from an instruction on the subject from Dwight D. Eisenhower, and a subsequent Air Ministry directive of 29 October 1942. It told bomber crews to bomb only exactly defined and militarily relevant targets, and to call off a raid if the civilian population would be disproportionately affected. This restraint applied expressly only to countries occupied by Germany, such as France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.
