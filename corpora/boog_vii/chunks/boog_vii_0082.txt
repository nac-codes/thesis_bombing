Naturally this could not happen without great losses among the German civilian population; but these were, according to a letter from the Air Staff, not the intention in the RAF's bombing raids on the German war machine.101 No government spokesman ever expressed Schadenfreude at the destruction of German houses On the contrary, when the Polish government-in-exile called at the end of 1942 for strikes against small German towns in retaliation for the inhumane German occupation policy, this was refused with the comment that onl 97 See HQ Bomber Command to undersecretary of state, Air Ministry, 7 Sept. 1944, PRO AIR 14/764. 98 B.Ops. 1, 28 Sept. 1943, PRO, AIR 19/393. 99 Czesany, Bombenterror, 369-70. 100 Parliamentary Debates, House of Commons, ccclixv, col. 337-8; see Fuller, Conduct of War 280; Irving, Guernica, 102; Goebbels, Tageb√ºcher, Pt. 2, viii. 380 (28 May 1943); PRO.
