trod very carefully in answering the question of exactly what was being targeted; often only half the truth or an outright lie was told when refuge could not be sought in equi- vocation and ambiguity. Apart, however, from a minority with a keen moral sense, the British public did not greatly care if German civilians died in the bombing. It was seen as well-deserved punishment, and many even felt, on the basis of their cultural and historic prejudices, that the 'materialistic' (because bent on territorial gains) Germans would crack under bombing sooner than the British, who defended more spiritual, that is to say higher, values.102 Which was what, mutatis mutandis, German propaganda was claiming.

Whatever else he may be accused of, Harris was more honest. In order to avoid his crews gettin
