a way of acting that at base did not follow the traditional norms at least of accepted international law. Whatever else he may be accused of, Harris was more honest. In order to avoid his crews getting the feeling they were having to do something of which the Air Ministry was ashamed, he called on the ministry in October 1943 to say unambiguously that 'the aim of the bombing offensive was to destroy German cities, kill German workers, and make civilized life in Germany impossible'.

So far this had brought on ce aircraft isolated successes, usually incurring heavy losses, when out of consideration least for friendly nations there had been attempts at it. The Air Staff did however, for whatever reason, entirely lose interest in it.106 De Havilland's new light bomber and long-range reconnaissar the Mosquito, was, because of its high speed (almost unmatched by Germ fighters), ope
