for whatever reason, entirely lose interest in it.106 De Havilland's new light bomber and long-range reconnaissar the Mosquito, was, because of its high speed (almost unmatched by Germ fighters), operational ceiling, and range, seen by some of the military as id not reall for the selective attacks they were aiming at; its cheap wooden constructie meant a saving of materials in short supply, so it could be mass-produced. Th Air Staff, however, took a sceptical view of the Mosquito and, knowing what to do with it when it came into frontline service in March 1943 at first used it solely for long-range reconnaissance.

In setting targets, more thought was given to the built-up areas themselves than to the factories these contained although Mosquitoes had not been designed for area bombing. 109 On & December 93 twin-engined bombers, including ten Mosquitoes, flying low b daylight, hit the Philips works in Eindhoven with 60 t of bombs, causing severe damage to a factory whose output was important for electronic warfare. but at 15 total losses and 53 aircraft damaged, the cost had been high.110 Great hopes for use by day were also placed in the four-engined Lancaster which was introduced in the spring of
