Only eight reached their 106 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 71. 108 Terraine, Right of the Line, 497. 111 Harris, Despatch, 155- 110 Ibid. 263-5. 107 Bowyer, 2 Group R.A.F., 236-7. 109 Bowyer, 2 Group R.A.F., 259. 112 USSBS, Report No. 93: Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg AG, Augsburg, Germany NA RG 243; Pöhlmann, Augsburg; Barker, 'Daylight Over Augsburg'. 35 target, and five limped home damaged after a flight of more than 2,000 km. The other seven succumbed to flak or fighters. This raid, carried out in the acceptance of high risk and costing 49 aircrew their lives (a loss that, according to Harris, 'was not excessive in proportion to the importance of the objec- tive'),113 caused only slight damage and did nothing at all to hamper production of diesel engines, since these were also made on five other sites.114 It showed Harris once again that, in 1942, daylight raids without fighter cover were impossible without prohibitive casualties. 115 The summer of 1942 still saw more than 200 daylight flights over Germany, most of them aborted. The British felt sure that the Germans would be intimidated by these, and that the air-raid warnings would cause a substantial loss of production; they were also already assuming that the German will to resist was weakening. Besides these, there were still several other large raids, such as that by 33 Lancasters, flying in cloud and mostly over water, on U-boat building yards at Danzig on 11 July 1942.
