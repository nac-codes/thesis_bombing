esides these, there were still several other large raids, such as that by 33 Lancasters, flying in cloud and mostly over water, on U-boat building yards at Danzig on 11 July 1942. Since they met hardly any flak or fighters over the whole 2,500 km of the trip, only one bomber failed to return. The damage caused in Danzig was minor.116 Meanwhile 5 Bomber Group was trying formation flying with four-engined Lancasters in daylight, in order to carry out, on 17 October, their biggest daylight raid yet, on the great Schneider steel works at Le Creusot in central France. Once again, part of the route was flown at only 30 m to keep under the German radar, and in a wide arc out into the Atlantic; the works were bombed shortly after 1800h from 1,200 to 1,800 m with 120 t of HE and 40 t of incendiaries, meeting with no interference from a defence that had been taken by surprise. Only one aircraft was lost. Despite first impressions, the raid was a failure due to inaccurate bomb-aiming; this was put down to night bomber crews being used on a daylight attack and using different aiming methods. 117 A daylight raid on the molybdenum mines at Knaben in Norway on 3 March 1943, with ten Mosquitoes, was more successful. For the loss of only one aircraft, the site was so badly damaged that production was halted for about a year and the Wehrmacht economic staff was very fearful for the supply of specially hardened steel.118 Particularly successful was a long-range attack on the Zeiss works at Jena on 27 May 1943, by only 1I out of 14 Mosquitoes that took off. Five of these were, however, lost. It was one of the deepest penetrations by this light bomber into Germany. In spite of heavy flak, only 24 high-explosive bombs of 225 kg each caused a 90 per cent loss of production. Seven civilians in the town were killed, a further seven badly and 47 lightly injured.119 Remarkably, there is no mention of this raid in the official British 113 Harris, Bomber Offensive, 141 114 Terraine, Right of th
