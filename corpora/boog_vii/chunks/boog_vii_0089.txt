6 per cent) losses, while the Lancaster attack on MAN Augsburg alone cost over 48 per cent total losses, and that of the light bombes against Eindhoven 16 per cent. Total losses in the Lancaster raids on the Rul dams were 42 per cent. In making these comparisons, it must be borne in min that the loss of a Mosquito meant that of only two aircrew and two engine while losing a Lancaster or Stirling cost seven men and four engines. Upt November 1943 a further 819 Mosquitoes were used for nuisance raids and setting off frequent air-raid warnings, and for diversionary or feint attacks d for split up the German air defence, as well as for defensive sorties or precisio raids. They suffered only 13-that is, 1.6 per cent-losses. In the followin period to the end of March 1944, only ten, or 0.4 per cent, of the 2,00 Mosquitoes in action were lost.122 In 1944 some versions of the Mosqui could even carry a 1,800-kg bomb all the way to Berlin. Undoubtedly the light strategic bomber units, consisting of Mosquitoar with their aircrew-saving speed and precision, would, as Bowyer has written have been able to achieve even greater daylight successes and done 'so muok more for victory', had the tactical development they already had at the stam been taken further, and 'had 2 Group been equipped entirely with them'. Thi view was shared by the planners in the Ministry of Aircraft Production, One of whom, Sir Alec Cairncross, wrote: 'The Mosquito might very well hav surpassed the record of the Lancaster in terms of damage done per hourof work in building it'; 123 it was much cheaper to build and delivered its bomb on individual targets with greater accuracy, while the Lancaster could bomk 120 Harris, Bomber Offensive, 142, 220-1; Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive 121 Middlebrook and Everitt, Bomber Command War Diaries, 365 ii. 66-7, 292. 122 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 149, 198-9 and iii. 124, 176; BowTer 2 Group R.A.F., 299; Sharp/Bowyer, Mosquito, 23
