The building of heavy bombers should, he said, have been left to the Americans, since their four-engined machines were equipped for the more accurate daylight bombing. The Air Ministry had, on the contrary, given the building of heavy bombers 'overriding priority', and showed no interest in the light Mosquito bomber. Although almost as many Mosquitoes (6,710) were built during the war as Lancasters (7,372), most of the early ones were used as fighters. 124 Harris gave the following, not very convincing, explanation for neglecting the Mosquito as a light bomber in favour of the heavy Lancaster The decisive factor was the supply of pilots; the heavy bomber carries about three times the load of the medium type [the Mosquito], but both aircraft only need one pilot. It is certain that even with the whole resources of the Empire Training Scheme we should never have got enough pilots to fly enough medium and light bombers to drop the bomb load that was dropped by the heavies. And, of course, the problem of con- centrating the bomb load, if it had been carried by many light bombers instead of by a comparatively few heavies, would have been insoluble.125 This argument gives the impression of reasoning in economic terms, and ignores the fact that the far more accurate Mosquitoes needed far fewer bombs than the heavy Lancaster to destroy a target, so that the number of pilots needed cannot logically be set against the absolute tonnage of bombs. The thought that more accurate bomb-aiming would mean fewer civilian casualties did not even cross Harris's mind. The supremacy of the bomber doctrine, with its area attacks
