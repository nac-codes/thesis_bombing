The whole undertaking was led by Wing-Commande Guy P. Gibson, who controlled operations over the target by VHF R/T while also in direct W/T contact with 5 Bomber Group headquarters. This wa the first use of the master bomber, or 'master of ceremonies', and as such matched the characteristics of the bouncing bomb, being preferred. produced an earthquake-like explosion deep down. The release height wa over any obstacles such as torpedo nets, sank down close to the dam wall, and 18 m above the surface of the water at a prescribed speed. They then skippa diameter, were given a backward spin and had to be dropped from exact barrel-shaped bombs, each weighing 4.5 t, nearly 1.70 m long and 1.25 min low-level flight to the dams. They had been practising for several weeks. The 21 March that year, took off with a total of 19 Lancasters on their difficul waves of 5 Bomber Group's elite 617 Squadron, which had been formed During the evening hours of 16 May 1943 and shortly after midnight thre fering modes of construction of the three dams that led to the first two, whisk before the war, and was no longer entirely accurate. Probably it was the d'e in April 1943 that the Eder dam contributed nothing to the Ruhr industm' water supply, and the Möhne very little. Wallis's information dated from Sorpe, which was built of soil with a concrete core. The Air Staff knew alread bomb, designed for masonry dams like the first two, was poorly suited to th were any bombs left-the Sorpe dam. But the Ruhr's main water supply cam from the Rhine to the west, and from the dam at Haltern in the north, besid the Sorpe basin. The last-named dam was also seen by the Ministry & Economic Warfare as the most important of the three planned targets. Wallis. the Möhne and then the Eder dam were to be attacked,
