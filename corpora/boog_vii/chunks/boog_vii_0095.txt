German dams were immediately given better protec against low-flying aircraft by heavier flak, balloon barrages, timber obst tions, and electrically detonated floating mines. From 9 January 1944, and the rest of the war, the defence of German dams as a whole tied down ar 32 medium and light flak batteries and four-and-a-half balloon batteries Bomber Command a second low-level attack of the kind was inadvisable raid on the dams, though quite remarkable for being flown throughou heights of 20 m over the sea and around 300 m overland to stay below German radar, cost the British eight out of the 19 Lancasters, and 56 out of - of their most highly trained aircrew. But for the first time, using the ma bomber technique, it achieved an almost instantaneous radio guidance ou great distance, and an extraordinary degree of accuracy in precision bombi by moonlight. 127 Despite his dislike for elite units and panacea targets, Harris surprising kept 617 Squadron in being, to use it for similar tasks in the future. Poso he was wanting to keep the deputy chief of Air Staff, AM Sir Norm H. Bottomley, and his director of bomber operations, Air Cdre. Syd O. Bufton, happy-both of them were urging precision raids. 128 The squadre was never, however, part of his main bomber force. On 15/16 September 104 when eight Lancasters tried to breach the walls of the Dortmund-Ems canal this demonstrated once again that, as Harris had expounded back on 127 On the dams attack, see Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 66, 160 289-92; Sweetman, Operation Chastise; Groehler, Bombenkrieg, 151-6; Levine, Strategic Bomk 53-7; Verrier, Bomber Offensive, 17, 216-21; Brickhill, Dam Busters; Euler, Dämme; Schon Flakartillerie, viii. 36-7; Cooper, Dambusters; PRO, AIR 14/844 (battle order B 976) and 2l- (after-action reports); reports by Gibson and Hans Rumpf on the dams raid, MGFA, Grabm collection, R 1031 and 1048; report by Dr.Ing.
