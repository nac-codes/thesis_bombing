Despite hits from 40 m with two delayed-action bombs weighing nearly 5 t apiece, the canal walls held. Only three out of the eight aircraft made their way home. All six of the Mosquitoes sent to provide fighter cover and draw off the light flak in the target area, however, returned safely. The raids by 617 Squadron on the Anthéor viaduct in southern France on 16/17 September and 11/12 November 1943 brought no success, though only one aircraft was lost. Flying too low meant almost certain heavy losses from the light flak; flying too high meant difficulty finding the target, or missing it altogether. The threat posed by the V-weapon launch sites being built in northern France, however, forced a continuation of such precision attacks, using Wallis's newly developed 5.5 t 'earthquake' bombs, since area bombing would not find these small targets. To avoid losses and achieve maximum accuracy, OBOE Mosquitoes of the Pathfinder group acting as target-markers supported nine Lancasters undertaking a high-level attack on a launch site near Abbeville on the night of 16 December 1943. They did not, however, succeed in damaging it, because the ground target indicators had not been placed accurately enough. A further raid on the same target and two on similar targets in the closing days of December were likewise unsuccessful. Better results were achieved in a pre- cision raid by 12 Lancasters of 617 Squadron on the night of 8 February 1944 on the Gnôme-Rhône aero-
