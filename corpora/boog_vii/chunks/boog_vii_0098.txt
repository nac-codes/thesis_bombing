Luftschiffbau, Zeppelin GmbH, Friedrichshafen-on-Bodensee, Germany, NA RG 243.  I.1. The Allied Bomber Offensive 42 I.I.2. Bomber Command Night Raids Würzburg radar and was also planned to produce the V-2 rocket, was attacke, a nep the following night by 60 Lancasters directed by a 'master bomber'. As we as the tactic of using parachute flares dropped using H2S navigation, a procedure was also tested here: the attack was made after passing a mark point outside the target area (and hence clearly visible, as it would not son shrouded by smoke), on the basis of a predetermined overshoot distan. Although heavy flak forced the bombers to fly very high, and bomb-aiming flares was not all that precise, the new method proved to be remarkak accurate. The Zeppelin works was destroyed, and the plans t to build V-2 there had to be abandoned; facilities producing diesel and aero ro-engines als suffered. All the aircraft continued on their first 'shuttle flight' to North Afri while the German fighters waited for them to return to base by p passing France. Civilian deaths in Friedrichshafen totalled 44. Not a single bomb was lost. 131 Prof. Jones, who had proposed this attack on German rad production, 132 later wrote: Had we realized the improvement in our bombing technique we might have abandon area bombing earlier, or at least have put more effort into precision attacks at nigh Here [ = the Zeppelin works] we used the Master Bomber technique, and when . was combined with OBOE pathfinding, precision attacks became e distinctly feasible Even without OBOE at Friedrichshafen, the random bombing error was no more th 400 yards. Jones was perhaps being somewhat over-optimistic. The air raid on rocket-testing station at Peenemünde showed afresh the difficulties of carrvin out at night a mass precision attack of the kind needed to take out specis. targets on this site. Three widely separated targets had to be hit: the scientists their living-quarters, two factory workshops building the
