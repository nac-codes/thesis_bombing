ss precision attack of the kind needed to take out specis. targets on this site. Three widely separated targets had to be hit: the scientists their living-quarters, two factory workshops building the V-2, and the devel opment works. The planners waited for a moonlit night, so that the bombin could be done from low altitude. For the first time, the master-bomber teck nique was to be used to direct a mass raid, with some 600 heavy bombers. The attack, codenamed 'Hydra', was on instructions from a war cabinet meeting on 29 June to take place on the night of 17/18 August 1943. For several night before Mosquitoes had been sent past Peenemünde and on to Berlin, so that on the night of the raid the eight Mosquitoes flying to Peenemünde would, at least in the early phase of the raid, draw off the German night fighters from the bomber streams approaching over the North Sea, Denmark, and the Baltic, The early TIs did not at first fall where they should, so that most of the 1,535t bombs fell on the forced labourers' camp at Trassenheide and on the residen quarters, killing 732 persons, including 600 of the workers. The not very extensive damage to the other installations held up V-2 production for perhans two months. An attack at an earlier stage in the development of the rocket would undoubtedly have had a greater effect. Despite the use of a new type 131 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 187-9; Middlebrook and Everitt, Bomks Command War Diaries, 399-400. 132 Jones, Most Secret War, 230, 304 43 ground marker ('red spot fire') and ideal weather conditions, together with weak and tardy air defences, the targets were not hit accurately. The Germans left the debris where it was, to hide from enemy air reconnaissance the fact that some facilities were still working. As it was feared that the British would soon be back, activity, mostly on development and production of the V-2, was moved else- where. The British, however, regarded their mission against Peenemünde
