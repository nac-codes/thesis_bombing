As it was feared that the British would soon be back, activity, mostly on development and production of the V-2, was moved else- where. The British, however, regarded their mission against Peenemünde as completed. Compared to those in the previous weeks, their losses has been substantial-40 of the aircraft (6.7 per cent) had been lost, and a further 32 damaged; most of these were due to the German night fighters that arrived late on the scene, and made the first use of 'Schräge Musik', two 20-mm cannons pointing diagonally upwards and fired from the blind spot beneath a bomber.133 Although bomb-aiming accuracy in the raids on Friedrichshafen and Peenemünde still left much to be desired, and because of the good weather and of the targets lying on the water's edge and thus being easy to identify the attacks were not 'normal' ones, they might have been further encouragement along the path to precision bombing, particularly since the requirements for this-OBOE and H2S, VHF communication, new TIs, the master-bomber method, marker points outside the target area, and so on-were all in place. Moreover it was known from intelligence reports that while the German population feared the night raids on towns, what Hitler and the military were afraid of were daylight precision attacks on industrial targets.134 But Harris showed little inclination to build on the new opportunities, especially since the renewed attack on the Peugeot works at Montbéliard on the night of 16 July was a major failure. Though only three aircraft were lost, the factory was as good as untouched and the civilian population badly affected, after the Pathfinder's markers went down nearly 650 m off-target. The successes achieved in night-time precision attacks by heavy bombers were still not clear enough for him.135 Being of an empirical turn of mind, he preferred to put his trust more in experience than in theoretical possibilities.
