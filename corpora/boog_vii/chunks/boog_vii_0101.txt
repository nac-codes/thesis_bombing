135 Being of an empirical turn of mind, he preferred to put his trust more in experience than in theoretical possibilities. (d) The Battle of Hamburg Although successful night-time precision raids with an acceptable level of losses were, up to the middle of 1943, still the exception, and adopting this method was still not on the cards for the mass of heavy bombers, the short time left before the invasion nonetheless prompted increased efforts to bomb the way clear to Berlin. The bombers had to be better protected against the growing German night-fighter force.

Although they located around 1,180 night fighters within a ten-week period, only 20 air combats resulted, because the Beaufighter was too slow. At the same time, therefore, further radar methods had to be developed to track German night fighters and jam their radio traffic. 136 For the moment at all events the British bomber losses were rising, making introduction of the WINDOW method (which had been known since April 1942) ever more urgent. 137 Given the fact that during the Battle of the Ruhr around 36 per cent of the British bombers shot down had fallen prey to German night fighters equipped with radar, the chief of Air Staff, Portal, felt that if WINDOW had already been in us
