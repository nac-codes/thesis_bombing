'total destruction' would bring enormous damage to the German industrial war machine and to German morale, and make an important contribution to shortening and winning the war. To achieve this, he estimated that several raids and at least 10,000 t of bombs would be needed 140 For this, Bomber Command still needed to be sufficiently strengthened. It 45 136 Ibid. 140-I; Price, Instruments of Darkness, 140-2, 148-9; Jones, Most Secret War, 287-0 See also p. 19 above. actual strength rose between I March and 5 July 1943 from 1,029 to 1,293 bombers; the number of the obsolete twin-engined Wellingtons dropped from 243 to 144, while that of the four-engined bombers rose from 729 to 1,088, or 84 per cent of the whole bomber force (478 Lancasters, 380 Halifaxes, and 220 of the less well-proven Stirlings). The number of Mosquitoes increased only slightly, to 71.141 Every week Bomber Command was now receiving 1.000 fresh aircrew. The crews were becoming a multinational force, and this evidently caused a few headaches-on the one hand, because it highlighted the dearth of personnel in Britain itself, and on the other, because a 'domin- ionization and alienation' was being felt within the Royal Air Force.142 Around 37 per cent of pilots came from the Commonwealth and friendly countries, more than half from Canada and a good third from Australia and New Zealand, followed by Rhodesians, South Africans, Indians, West Indians, Norwegians, and French, as well as two squadrons of Poles.143 The attack on Hamburg was preceded by interesting political discussions, as can be seen from an exchange of correspondence between Prof. Henry T. Tizard, scientific advisor to the Ministry for Aircraft Production, Churchill, and Portal. On 22 July Tizard wrote to the prime minister telling him that the importance of Hamburg lay more in trade than in production (other than the building of ships and U-boats). Its harbour could be useful to Britain after the war. It would be better, he said, not to dest
