It would be better, he said, not to destroy Hamburg, because occu- pied Germany could be administered better from there than from Berlin (which would serve only to increase Russian animosity towards the West). Furthermore, the Hamburgers held anti-Prussian, anti-Russian, and anti-Nazi views; if one were to destroy Hamburg rather than Berlin, this would, when the war was over, make it more difficult to eliminate the Prussian hegemony. Portal, answering on Churchill's behalf and via the air minister, stressed on the contrary that Hamburg was the fourth most important town in Germany after Berlin, Duisburg, and Bochum-Gelsenkirchen, and that under bombing the anti-Prussian and anti-Soviet feelings might perhaps be raised even quicker. Why should a trading centre not be bombed, too? And the control of Germany after the war would anyway be ensured only by weak though mobile land forces but primarily by air power; and for that there was no need of big cities. The Air Staff saw Hamburg as an important industrial city, the destruction of which would hasten a victorious end to the war.144 Indeed, 408 out of a total I,131 U-boats had been built on Hamburg slipways, and in the production statistics of the Reichsgruppe Industrie the city took second place after Berlin, with a 3.36 per-cent share. 145 The belief that Germany could be kept in check from the air after the war, with minimal support from a small expeditionary 141 PRO, AIR 14/1077. 142 See correspondence between Harris and Sinclair, Jan./Feb. 1943, PRO, AIR 14/3513. 137 See p. 19, and Germany and the Second World War, vi. 567. 138 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 141-5; Levine, Strategic Bombing, 6o- Hinsley, British Intelligence, ii. 518-19; Price, Instruments of Darkness, III-21, 124-8, 130-40 148-53; Gundelach, Luftwaffe im Mittelmeer, 62
