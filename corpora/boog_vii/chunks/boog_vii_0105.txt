At 25 miles north of Hamburg the bombers swung onto a north-south course. The plan was that from 0058h the first 20 Pathfinders would illuminate the target area with yellow parachute flares using the Newhaven procedure, and a further eight would then drop 40 red ground TIs two minutes later; after that, Pathfinders scattered among the main mass of bombers would refresh the target marking during the 50-minute bombing phase, with 200 green TIs.
