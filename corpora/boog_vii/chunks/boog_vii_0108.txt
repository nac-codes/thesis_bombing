People burned to death in the hurricane of heat, or were suffocated in their air-raid shelters from a lack of oxygen or from carbon dioxide. The end of the raid brought a horrific sight. Streets were strewn, and air-raid shelters crammed, with thousands of corpses in various stages of incineration, down to small heaps of ashes, and in a variety of postures from still and peaceful to twisted in their death-throes, naked and charred or clothed and stifled.
