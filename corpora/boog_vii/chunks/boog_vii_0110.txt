ols, however great their willpower.154 Seen from the Allied side, the figures added up as follows: during the for major raids the British lost 552 aircrew and 97 bombers, 87 of which wer shot down over Germany, including 59 by night fighters and II by flak. Th remainder were lost through other causes; 174 aircraft were damaged the 3,095 aircraft employed, 2,285 bombers dropped 8,344t of bombs Hamburg, half of them incendiaries. Aircraft losses rose from 1.5 per co during the first raid to 4 per cent during the fourth, indicating that the Germe air defences were beginning to get over the shock caused by WINDOW. From- July on, the German night-fighter control had in fact switched to broadcast- a 'running commentary', which gave their pilots in broad terms the positi and course of the bomber stream. 155 At 2.8 per cent overall, the total bomk- losses remained far below the 4.7 per cent suffered during the Battle of se Ruhr. Comparing Bomber Command's total losses over Essen in spring To with those at Hamburg, the former were at 19.9 per cent and the latter onleo- per cent; evidently the use of WINDOW had saved a great many bombers fre being shot down or damaged.156 III Night raid 29/30 July Sequence of raids 24/25-6 July | Day and night raids II Night raid 27/8 July Alster Totally destroyed Severe damage Light damage Densely built-up Lightly built-up MAP I.I.3.
