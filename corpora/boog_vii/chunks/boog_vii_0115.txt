British Intelligence, 299-300. 51 interruption to war production if they had fallen on the industrial area to the south of the city centre. 159 After this terrible prelude of the Battle of Hamburg, the British night raids varied between western Germany and Berlin, the final target of the air offensive. But until the next mass raid in the series, on Peenemünde, the targets mainly attacked were in France, where V-weapon sites were suspected, and in Italy, where the invasion of the continent was to be prepared and it was hoped to induce the new government quickly to come to terms. Out of the 2,783 aircraft used in the these operations, only 29 were lost and 70 damaged, mostly by flak. 160 Heavy raids on Essen on 25/6 July and Remscheid on 303/1 July showed once again the effectiveness of the OBOE system. Well over half the crews scored hits within 3 miles around their aiming-point, the Krupp works was again more than 50 per-cent destroyed, and great damage and fires that burned for days were caused in Essen. Even more devastation was done in Remscheid, though not even half the number of bombers used at Essen was involved.161 Bomber Command now set about improving the effectiveness of its bombing methods beyond OBOE range, where over the preceding months the use of H2S had not been all that successful. For the time being the con- centration on individual targets was no longer as intense as at Hamburg, so that-as the example of Peenemünde showed-similar effects did not occur. The attack on Leverkusen on 22/3 August was also a complete failure. Blind marking with H2S during the ensuing large-scale area raids on cities along the 'road to Berlin' was nonetheless good enough to allow quite accurate visual marking. Mannheim-Ludwigshafen suffered badly during the night of 5 September, since the majority of the 512 attacking bombers found their mark within the 5-km radius of the aiming-point and numerous fires were started in both cities. Frankfurt am Main experienced its firs
