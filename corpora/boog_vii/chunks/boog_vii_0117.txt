Night Raids I.I. The Allied Bomber Offensive The heaviest raid in this series was on Kassel on 22/3 October. 163 While nearly all the strings of flares overshot their target, the last two were sufficient to allow extremely accurate ground marking with around 80 red spot fires which went down within a radius of only 800 metres of the aiming-point, the town centre. Most of the 444 attacking bombers dropped their loads here and in the surrounding area. The result was the worst disaster for any German city since Hamburg and until almost the end of the war. Almost 6,000 people were killed-2.65 per cent of the 226,000 inhabitants, proportionally 0.2 per cent more than in the four raids on Hamburg. About 3,600 were injured, and more than 8,000 suffered damage to their eyes from the smoke and heat. Around 62 per cent of the population-123,800 persons-were made homeless. The historic town centre was wiped out. More than 9,400 out of 16,000 houses were destroyed or severely damaged, as were most of the cultural building and monuments. Of 55,000 dwellings, 35,000 were no longer habitable. With 'social index' (reflecting the degree of destruction) of 164.1, Kassel was far ahead of Hamburg with 'only' 115.4; Bomber Command could cross it off it list of targets. Although this had been a pure area bombardment aimed at the town centre, the arms factories in the suburbs were also hit. They include the Henschel works, the biggest locomotive builder in Europe and during the war the major manufacturer of tanks and artillery, and the Fieseler aircrak works, which made the Me 109 fighter, the Fi 156 'Storch' army co-operati reconnaissance aircraft, and the Fi 103 'Kirschkern' (i.e. the V-I flying bomb known in England as the 'doodlebug' or 'buzz-bomb'). As early as I ation/ Bomber Command had looked on Kassel as one of the five most important targets in the German aircraft industry. Industry here was affected not co S 1940 much by direct hits as indirectly through the destruction of tra
