Industry here was affected not co S 1940 much by direct hits as indirectly through the destruction of transport links an the water, electricity, and gas supplies, as well as the absence of a great staff from their workplaces; in December 1943 some 15 per cent of r workforce was still missing. The shortfall in production, taken over the whol. year, was 12.8 per cent for the Tiger I tank and 13.4 per cent for anti-tank gun Output of 88-mm anti-aircraft guns fell by more than half, and took months to recover. Damage to the Henschel works also affected V- duction, and further losses resulted from the dispersal of production. Over however, the damage to industry was not as dramatic as the loss of life. H too, the Nazi regime did everything possible, just as it had in Hamburg keep the catastrophic results of the big raids a secret from the public. propaganda played them down so that people should not be alarmed.
