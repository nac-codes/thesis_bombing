uld have been able to leave their shelters in time. 164 The raid on Kassel cost Bomber Command more dearly than the previous one in the summer of 1943. The German early-warning system had recognized the impending raid in good time; 43 of the bombers (7.6 per cent) did not return to base. Because of poor visibility and markers badly placed with H2S, a number of raids such as those on Munich on 6 September, Hanover on 27 September and 18 October, and Leipzig on 20 October were just as much of a failure as that on Kassel on 3 October mentioned earlier. During the three attacks on Berlin on the nights of 23 and 31 August and 3 September, only 27 out of a total of 1,719 bombers hit inside the 5-km zone around the aiming-point. The bomb-carpet crept back up to 50 km in the approach direction. A city as large as this with no clear features produced a very unclear echo on the navigators' radar screens. Of the bombers dispatched to Berlin, 7.2 per cent did not return, and 6.8 per 164 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 203 and iv. 23, n. 3; Middlebrook and Everitt, Bomber Command War Diaries, 440.  54 I.I.
