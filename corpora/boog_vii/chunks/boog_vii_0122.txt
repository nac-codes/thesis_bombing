vii (introd. by Cox). 55 made homeless. Monthly output of tanks from the Daimler-Benz works at Marienfelde dropped temporarily from 80 to 40 in August, rising to 68 in September. The electronics industry was also affected. There was a worrying effect on workers' discipline, which the authorities tried to combat with imprisonment for breaching their work contract and by issuing special rations-in other words, with both sticks and carrots. A large-scale campaign of evacuation, which Goebbels had called for, was already under way. Since it was women who bore the brunt of restoring primitive living conditions and who made up almost 50 per cent of the Berlin workforce, they had for the greater part to be replaced by 'foreign workers'; the number of forced labourers in the Berlin economy rose from 84,000 in July 1943 to around 250,000 by February 1945.167 Meanwhile, the new 'G-H' navigation and blind-bombing system was ready for use, and was tried out more or less successfully in a large raid on DÃ¼sseldorf on the night of 3 November. This was a combination of OBOE and GEE. While with the latter on its own accuracy fell off with increasing distance from the ground stations, this was not the case with G-H. In contrast to OBOE, it could be used not just by one aircraft but by up to 100 at the same time, with the altitude playing no part. 168 In the Battle-of-Hamburg phase more aircraft had been used per raid than during the Battle of the Ruhr. Out of 33 main operations, seven had involved 700-800 sorties, seven had 600-800, four had 500-600, five had 400-500, another five involved 300-400, there were three with 200-300, and one employed fewer than 100 aircraft. Of a total of 17,021 aircraft used, 695 or 4.1 per cent were totally lost, and 1,128 or 6.6 per cent damaged, equivalent to a loss rate of 10.7 per cent. This result was better than that during the Battle of the Ruhr.169 3. DAYLIGHT RAIDS BY THE US 8TH AIR FORCE, 1943 (a) First Penetration into German Airspace During
