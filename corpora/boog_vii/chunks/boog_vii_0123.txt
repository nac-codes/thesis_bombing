DAYLIGHT RAIDS BY THE US 8TH AIR FORCE, 1943 (a) First Penetration into German Airspace During the first four to five months of 1943 American bomber operations against Germany had still been experimental in nature. The Casablanca Directive still had to be recast in the form of concrete instructions for action, as the 'POINTBLANK Directive', a process that took until June of that year. The 8th Air Force was still having to send a great many new aircraft and trained aircrew to the Mediterranean front, as the battles in North Africa were taking longer than originally expected.170 The average daily operational bomber strength of the 8th Air Force in February was thus only 74 aircraft.

The Allied Bomber Offensive more than 100 available, and it was the end of May before a bare 300 bombers could be used as the basis for planning operations; 171 this was the number that Eaker had demanded as the minimum for a successful raid with box forma- tions in the fourth phase of his strategic plan. 172 This operational strength required there to be at least twice the number as the actual strength, which amounted to 614 bombers in May, 845 in July, and 1,279 in November 1943.173 As a start, an attempt was made to assess the strength and tactics of the German daylight-fighter and flak defences, to build up experience, and to work out corresponding tactics of one's own.
