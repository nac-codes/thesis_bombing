a start, an attempt was made to assess the strength and tactics of the German daylight-fighter and flak defences, to build up experience, and to work out corresponding tactics of one's own. The dangerous head-on-from- above attacks by the German fighters were countered with the stopgan installation of nose armament (which was not fitted as standard until the la summer of 1943)174 and by tighter formating by the leading bombers so tha more than just one could fire at an attacker.175 175 Things were still going badly where the Americans' own fighter cover was concerned. On the one hand the 8th Air Force was having to send all its P-38 Lightnings to the Mediterranean theatre. But on the other, it also believed that long-range fighter cover could be replaced by flying in tight box formation and, from March 1943, by providing YB-40 escort bombers crammed with 30 cannon and machine-guns ranging from 20 to 40 mm calibre. The P-47 Thunderbolt fighter made available from the turn of 1942-3 in place of the P-38 was still having teething problem Much of the radio equipment was unsuppressed, making R/T contact betwe the pilots impossible, and a lack of drop-tanks meant that its range was much greater than that of the Spitfire, already found unsuitable as a fight escort for just the same reason. Eaker had been asking the British Ministme Aircraft Production from as far back as October 1942 to supply him with dros tanks, but had still had no reply in February 1943. In the early months of year the 8th Fighter Command was formed, initially with three groups. began its operations on 8 April with smallish sweeps over the French Dutch coasts, flying its first escort sorties on 4 May, to Antwerp.176 Up to the early summer of 1943 the 8th Air Force was occupied for the m part with its main task of combating the German U-boats. In the first hale 1943, 63 per cent of all the bombs dropped fell on U-boat targets. Target Germany were attacked only sporadically; most of these lay close to th
