During the second raid on naval targets at Wilhelmshaven German fighters tried, unsuccessfully, to drop bombs among the enemy formations. The successful bombing of the marshalling yards at Hamm on 4 March-the most distant target-saw a high level of accuracy, though the bulk of the bombers got lost in bad weather or dropped their bombs on the return flight on secondary targets at Rotterdam. Raids in depth without fighter cover were clearly still too risky. The Americans did not allow themselves to be discouraged, and looked forward to the early availability of their own escort fighters; they hoped, too, that with the imminent increase in the number of bombers their loss percentage would drop, especially since the German fighter defence could be split up if several targets were attacked at the same time. This optimism was also based on an almost tenfold overestimate of German fighter losses, which fed the hope of being able to gradually wear down their daylight- fighter force. This conviction was strengthened by the raid on the U-boat yard at Vegesack on 18 March, when only two out of 103 bombers were shot down  I.I. The Allied Bomber Offensive 58 I.1.3. Daylight Raids by US Air Force for an assumed German loss of 52 fighters.177 The Americans were even more mistaken about the effect on U-boat production. The yard was not in fact put out of action for a year, nor were seven U-boats destroyed or damaged-the commissioning of just one U-boat was merely delayed by 14 weeks.178 This showed afresh the futility of such attacks on shipyards, though they still offered more promise than those on the U-boat pens on the Atlantic. Success there did not come until 28 June 1943, when the balance in the Battle of the Atlantic had already turned against the German U-boat command and the U-boat danger had been averted: a 2,000-lb bomb penetrated the con
