come until 28 June 1943, when the balance in the Battle of the Atlantic had already turned against the German U-boat command and the U-boat danger had been averted: a 2,000-lb bomb penetrated the concrete roof of a U-boa pen at St-Nazaire, which led to the Germans reinforcing the roofs of all the U-boat pens at the expense of work on the Atlantic Wall.179 In March and the following weeks the US 8th Air Force returned to m U-boat and transport targets along the French and Dutch coasts. On 17 April the first attack was made on a German aircraft factory, the Focke-Wulf work at Bremen. An attempt to dodge the German defences for as long as possible by approaching the target over the sea failed, as a German radar patrol aircraft had detected the formation over the North Sea. The bitterest air battle so developed, with the Americans flying for the first time over Germany using the 'combat box' formation. 180 Only two of the 97 attacking bombers were down. German fighter losses were not 52, as the Americans wrongly estimate but only five. The fighter pilots discovered that, because of the provisi sional fitting of nose armament to the bombers, a head-on attack from above was. longer as effective. Despite excellent placing of the bomb-loads, the damp done to aircraft production at the Bremen works was not great, since most this had already been dispersed. 181 On 14 May a total of 224 heavy bomb attacked various targets at Kiel, Antwerp, and Courtrai; incendiaries wo used for the first time against the shipyards at Kiel, since given the right cumstances the heat from these could do greater damage. While the 8th Force still got off fairly lightly during this raid, that carried out on hark facilities and U-boat yards on 13 June, which became known as the 'Battle Kiel', saw the downing of 22 out of 60 bombers. All that mitigated this diso was that in the simultaneous raid on the Bremen U-boat yard only four of 122 attacking bombers were lost; a success due to the fact that the
