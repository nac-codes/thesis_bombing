wning of 22 out of 60 bombers. All that mitigated this diso was that in the simultaneous raid on the Bremen U-boat yard only four of 122 attacking bombers were lost; a success due to the fact that the Ge fighter defence had been split up by several raids taking place at the time. 182 During the daylight raid on the Hüls chemical works by 183 R. o far 177 Freeman, Mighty Eighth War Diary, 35, 40, 43, 46-7; Army Air Forces, ii. 326-6 Groehler, Bombenkrieg, 125; USSBS, Report No. 100: Bremer Vulkan, Vegesack, Ger RG 243. 178 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, i 179 Levine, Strategic Bombing, 83. 180 See Germany and the Second World War, vi. 594; Army Air Forces, ii. 332. 181 Army Air Forces, ii. 330-3; USSBS, Report No. 10: Focke Wulf Aircraft Plant D Germany, 1, 7, NA RG 243. 182 Army Air Forces, ii. 345, 670; USSBS, Reports No. 95: Deutsche Werke AG, Kiel, C and No. 97: Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft, Kiel, Germany, NA RG 243. On the bomk German U-boat yards in general see also USSBS, iv, Report No. 92: The German Suke 59 including eleven YB-40 'gun-ship' escort bombers, the Americans again suffered a severe setback with 16 total losses and well over 100 aircraft damaged. Because of a simultaneous, smaller diversionary raid on Antwerp, the attack took the Germans by surprise, and cost almost 200 lives and 1,000 injured on the factory site. Hüls accounted for 30 per cent of German synthetic rubber (buna) output; clearing away the rubble and carrying out repairs meant that production now came to a total halt for a month. After six months buna production had almost got back to the May 1943 figure of just on 4,000 t. The total shortfall of buna output for 1943 was 12,000 t, or 10 per cent of the overall German production. Here, too, the Americans clearly overestimated the extent of the destruction caused, and failed to recognize how critical a shortage of synthetic rubber could be. As a result, they did not follow up with another massive raid on the works. It
