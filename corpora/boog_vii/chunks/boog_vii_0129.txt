mated the extent of the destruction caused, and failed to recognize how critical a shortage of synthetic rubber could be. As a result, they did not follow up with another massive raid on the works. It would undoubtedly have been possible to cripple the whole of German synthetic rubber production if the buna works at Ludwigshafen and Schkopau had been attacked as well. Both of these were, however, still too far into the heart of Germany. The high American losses prompted Gen. Eaker to call off attacks on targets in Germany for four weeks.183 Further action by the 8th Air Force was now directed against the German aircraft industry, whose products were causing most of the losses among the bombers. The turn taken in the Battle of the Atlantic meant that the U-boat pens on the Atlantic and the U-boat yards were no longer a prime target. 184 To the Allies' surprise (they had imagined the German fighter force to be fully occupied supporting the army in its fierce defensive battles in the east and the Mediterranean), the strength of the Germany daylight fighters grew in the first six months of the year, by their estimates, from 350 to 600 aircraft defending the airspace over the Reich and in the west. In the 18 raids made by the 8th Air Force over Germany in the first half of 1943, 1,953 bombers were employed, 1,588 of which dropped around 3,700 t of bombs. Total losses amounted to 117 B-17s and B-24, or 6 per cent, and more than 1,160 expensively trained aircrew. These figures were not seen as exorbitant. Though there had been no really decisive successes, a great deal of experience had been gained, especially in the control of large battle formations. Most of all, bomb-aiming accuracy was improving. While in February 1943 it was better than average to get a mere 20 per cent of bombs within 300 m or so of the aiming-point, by March and April this was true of only 30 or 40 per cent. Only seldom did more than 50 per cent fall within this radius; this degree of accuracy rose
