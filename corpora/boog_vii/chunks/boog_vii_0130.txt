f bombs within 300 m or so of the aiming-point, by March and April this was true of only 30 or 40 per cent. Only seldom did more than 50 per cent fall within this radius; this degree of accuracy rose on average from 19.8 per cent in March, via a low point of only 9.4 per cent in June, to 32.4 per cent in November 1943.

The Allied Bomber Offensive I.1.3. Daylight Raids by US Air Force Bombs falling within a 600-m radius of the aiming-point rose from 28.5 per cent in February to 56.4 per cent by November. 185 Since all the bombers in a group released their bombs together on a signal from the lead aircraft, these results show the growing effectiveness of flying in tight formation-something impossible for the British bombers operating at night. The YB-40 'gun-ship' escort bombers used from the end of May proved to be too slow in level and climbing flight, and tail-heavy; they were not, therefore, judged a success.186 The high level of casualties caused by flak led to the introduction of armoured 'flak aprons' for the bomber crews. In mid-1943 the 8th Air Force concluded that the daylight bombing offensive had not so far presented any insuperable difficulties, and that the main obstacle to strategic success was the German daylight-fighter force-a view that had been echoed in the POINTBLANK Directive. Eaker wanted to see this force 'reduced to impotence' within the year.187 The course of the British and American bomber offensive so far against targets in Germany was also judged positive by the British Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee (JIC).
