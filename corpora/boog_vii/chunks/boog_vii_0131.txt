e British and American bomber offensive so far against targets in Germany was also judged positive by the British Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee (JIC). Although only a small part of the German production capacity had been attacked so far, this had, it considered, already had the effect of the Germans having to switch to airborne defence, and to withdraw their fighter aircraft from the land fronts.188 The US Army Air Forces were doing everything they could to ensure good press coverage along these lines at home, and to win supporters in the Congress budget committee. 189 (b) The Costly Bombing of Targets Inside Germany The failure of the YB-40 gun-ship underlined the fact that the solution to the problems presented by raids deeper into Germany lay in providing escom fighters with the necessary range. As none existed (the B-26 Mitchell could not fill the gap), Eaker repeatedly called for the provision of jettisonable external tanks to increase the range of his fighters. For a variety of reasons, and in par because of the shortage of sheet metal, these could not be produced straigh away in the quantity and quality required. The 75-gallon steel tank W introduced in July 1943, and extended the range of the P-47 Thunderboltto 540 km; the British 108-gallon tank that followed a month later even provided an operational radius of 600 km.190 The fact that drop-tanks were final- supplied is due largely to the under-secretary of state for the army air force 185 See Table I.I.6 above, and the Report of Lt .- Gen.
