While Trondheim harbour was badly damaged and activities at the Heroy works were wholly or temporarily halted, the latter operations were far less of a success. In Kiel an elderly cruiser, and a U-boat that had just been launched from the slipway, were sunk. While the attacks on targets at Hamburg and Hanover on 26 July demonstrated co-operation with the British Bomber Command, they brought heavy losses. Rubber production at Hanover was cut to 75 per cent as a result of the raid in August. On 28 July the Americans bombed the AGO aircraft factory at Oschersleben making the FW 190 fighter, and the Fieseler complex in Kassel; the latter was attacked again on 30 July. While all three Fieseler factories suffered damage ranging from 5 to 20 per cent, AGO lost a month's production of 40 to 50 FW 190s. There was a fierce air battle over Oschersleben, in which 40 per cent of the attacking aircraft were brought down. For the first time, the German fighters fired 21-cm air-to-air rockets from beyond the range of the bombers' guns, but at Bocholt, where Thunderbolts fitted with drop-tanks were waiting for the returning bombers, they were prevented from pursuing them.193 On 29 July the targets were harbour facilities at Kiel and the Heinkel aircraft works at Warnem√ºnde. The latter built both the FW 190 fighter and the Ar 196 seaplane and Ar 232 transport aircraft; the drop in production here was estimated at 20 per cent. All these attacks on German aircraft production were 191 Levine, Strategic Bombing, 91; Parton, Eaker, 279. 192 Parton, Eaker, 264-5, 273-4, 288; Levine, Strategic Bombing, 92; Army Air Forces, ii. 720. 193 Army Air Forces, ii. 677-8; Levine, Strategic Bombing, 93-4; Freeman, Mighty Eighth War Diary, 78-80; Prien and Rodeike, JG I und II, 375-7, 381-2, 396-7; Groehler, Bombenkrieg, 127-8.
