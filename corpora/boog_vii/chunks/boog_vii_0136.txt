so that finally it was the 'Tidal Wave' plan to bomb Ploiești from low level that was given the go-ahead by Arnold and George C. Marshall. 197 Romanian oil formed the main source of fuel for the German army, though not for the Luftwaffe, 92 per cent of whose aviation spirit came from hydrogenation. The attack was therefore intended mainly to help the Soviet forces.198 Since 20 July 1943 five B-24 groups of IX Bomber Command had been practising the attack on a model of the town of Ploiești built in the desert near Benghazi. The Norden bombsights were replaced with simpler ones for the low-level attack, extra fuel tanks were fitted to allow the total mission distance of around 2,700 miles, and the lead formations were given extra armament to deal with flak sites. The approach was to be over the Mediterranean to the west of Greece and then northwards over Albania and Yugoslavia, returning via Corfu. The attack altitude was between 30 and 100 metres. The Americans somewhat overestimated German fighter strength, while at the same time underestimating the flak defences and the effectiveness of camouflage. It was also clearly not realized that there was a pipeline linking the various refineries, making it possible to compensate at once for the loss of one or other of them. Finally, the German radio monitoring service had been listening to the prac- tising near Benghazi from the outset, and knew the date and route of the attack in plenty of time so that defensive measures, including smokescreens, could be prepared. 199 Of the 177 bombers that took off on I August 1943, 154 reached the target area; but because of the unexpectedly heavy flak, the camouflaging, and navigational and other tactical errors they were not always able to destroy 196 Ibid. 682-4 and i. 341; Levine, Strategic Bombing, 95; Germany and the Second World War, iv. 586; Note by the Air Staff on the Development of the Air War Against Germany by the Use of Bases in Northern Italy, 31 July 1943, LoC, Arnold P
