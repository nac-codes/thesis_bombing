Eaker Papers, Box 56. 65 Regensburg alone, it was sa s said, would mean a lost output of up to 2,000 fighter aircraft, which would be felt at the fronts within six to eight weeks. The crews, suffering from combat stress, were told that continuing the series of attacks on Regensburg and Schweinfurt up to the end of 1943 could bring about the end of the war. 203 They were startled, during the mission briefing, by the great distance to the target. The machine-gunners took on extra ammunition as a precaution. Though both bomber wings were originally meant to take off at the same time, heavy cloud over the airfields resulted in a three-and-a-half- hour gap between the 4th leaving for Africa via Regensburg, and the Ist heading for Schweinfurt and then returning to England. This gave the German fighters, after attacking the first formations, enough time to refuel and rearm before tackling the second. The American fighters accompanying the first group of bombers could thus not be used to protect the second. However, B-26s of VIII Air Support Command and British Typhoon bombers made diversionary raids on airfields in Holland and France, to tie down the German fighters based there. 204 The Regensburg contingent of Col. Curtis LeMay was attacked, even before its Thunderbolt escort had turned back at Eupen, by German fighters, some 300 of whom were waiting, stacked in depth, to make a continuous onslaught on the bombers. The result was that by the time these had reached their target, the fighters' fuel and ammunition were exhausted, and defence of the target fell to a handful of test pilots from a local unit. The flak defence was not all that strong. Bombing was from a height of 5,000 to 6,000 metres, and fairly accurate. Almost 300 t of bombs caused
