Almost 300 t of bombs caused severe damage on the factory site, destroyed several newly built aircraft, and killed 400 people. The most important building, the vast aircraft assembly shop, was not hit, and aircraft production did not suffer greatly. Most of the machine tools were fit for further use, and by dispersing manufacture it was soon possible to build up output again. The bombs did, however, destroy the jigs for building fuselages for the Me 262 jet fighter. Twenty-four of the bombers were shot down, the remainder landing in the evening at poorly equipped bases in Tunisia. On 24 August 85 of them took off to attack Bordeaux, but only 55 of these landed back in Britain; the idea of shuttle bombing had thus suffered a severe setback.205 Since the German fighters had been expecting the returning bombers from Regensburg to head directly for England, they had prepared themselves for a further air battle, which was now, however, to be against the bomber force under Gen.

In the early afternoon this found itself exposed for almost three hours on end to the German fighters, some of them equipped with rockets and parachute bombs, and 36 out of its 230 bombers were lost.
