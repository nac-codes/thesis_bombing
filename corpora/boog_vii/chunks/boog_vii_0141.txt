ad been so badly mauled that the final groups who were meant, if there was smoke over the ball-bearings factories, to bomb the city centre with incendi- aries, did not even hit this. Of the 424 t of bombs dropped, 35 t of HE and 6 t of incendiaries fell on the Kugel-Fischer site and destroyed 8 per cent of the works facilities. For a short while 34 per cent of Schweinfurt's ball-bearings output (accounting for around 60 per cent of total German production) was lost. Roller-bearings production fell from 8,379,000 units in July to 7,600,000 in August. There were 141 fatal casualties, 326 wounded, 99 were buried i the wreckage, and 20 were missing.206 The raid otherwise achieved little success. Substitute supplies began to be ordered from Sweden and Switzer land, temporary bottlenecks were overcome by the ball-bearings being carried from production to assembly in rucksacks, there was a changeover to makin simpler bearings, and it was soon discovered that the firms still had enough ball-bearings of each type stockpiled.207 ng For the American aircrews the raid on Schweinfurt was their worst experien so far. The loss of 60 bombers in a single day hit the 8th Air Force hard. A furthe II had later to be scrapped, 164 were damaged to varying degrees, and 30 b been left behind in North Africa. Practically a third of the bombers used in raid were written off. On top of this, there were 601 losses among the aircrew killed, taken prisoner, or interned in Switzerland; 38 managed to escape fro n the German-controlled territory. The Americans reckoned they had shot down German fighters, but the figure was in fact only 27. German aircrew casualt totalled 17 dead and 14 wounded.208 The Americans-and they were not alone n 288 overestimated their defensive fire successes by a wide margin; between Januar and October 1943 they believed they had downed 3,320 German fighters, a quite unrealistic number. But this boosted their fighting spirit, for one of the purpos of the air offensive was
