osses, an over-sanguine assessment of their own successes, and unfavourable weather made a fresh penetration deep into Germany during the next few weeks seem inadvisable. Attention was concentrated instead on aircraft works and German airfields in France and the Netherlands, as part of Operation STARKEY. This was an attempt to tie down German forces so that they were not moved to the eastern front, while at the same time trying out the moves for a later invasion in the Pas-de-Calais. Not until 6 September was a ball-bearing factory, at Stuttgart, again included among the targets for destruction. Bad weather, however, prevented success. Of the 407 aircraft that took off, only 312 arrived at the target. Running out of fuel, and the German defences, brought about 45 total losses, and a further ten bombers were damaged beyond repair. This disaster was evidently, as a loss-free attack the following day against Watten and other targets near the coast showed, mainly the result of the lack of fighter cover.212 In September the 8th Air Force was reorganized as three bomber divisions each with three wings of three groups; the groups comprised four squadrons each of 12 heavy bombers. In the meantime the B-17 had been equipped as standard (as the B-17G) with two remote-controlled 12.7-mm machine-guns in a chin mounting. The stiffening of the fighter escort with new P-38 Lightnings was again put on hold because of their slowness. Fighter cover was still limited to north-west Germany. After tests with the British navigation system GEE had proved unsatisfactory, a number of bombers were fitted with the H2S ground-mapping radar, while at the same time the Americans were developing their own version, known as H2X, because the British could not supply enough sets. 213 On 27 September two waves of B-17s, each led by two H2S aircraft, totalling 246 of the 308 that took off, and for the first time with a fighter escort over the whole distance, attacked the docks at Emden which, because
