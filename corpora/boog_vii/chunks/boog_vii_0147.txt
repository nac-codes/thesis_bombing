US 8th Air Force targets in 1943  1.1. The Allied Bomber Offensive 70 the aiming-point. Even though American losses were low, this procedure seemed suitable for use only when there was poor visibility, and to keep up the pressure on Germany. The crews' ironic term for operations of this kind was 'women's and children's day'. Their advantage was that when visibility was poor the German fighter pilots, still lacking experience in blind flying, stayed on the ground. The Americans did not use OBOE, because the British felt that heavy bombers flying in daylight over Germany were more likely to be shot down-thus giving away the secret of the system-than Mosquitoes, and because OBOE's operating range was much too short for American strategic needs. Finally the 8th Air Force too, in the autumn of 1943, adopted the dropping of light metal strips, which they called 'Chaff'; around 2,000 of these strips produced the radar echo of a B-17. The CARPET jamming transmitter used against flak gun-laying and fighter AI radars, was first used on 8 October at during the mass raid on an aircraft factory in Bremen and the U-boat yard Vegesack, and was responsible in part for the lower losses among the forme tions equipped with it. Thirty of the 399 bombers that took off that day were lost, and 26 severely damaged; more than half suffered less serious damage usually from flak. The attack cost the Germans 33 fighters.214 This first mass raid marked, in the first half of October 1943, the start of the phase that has gone down in the American history of the air war as 'Critico Week'.215 A day later came the operation by 378 B-17s and B-24s against targets for away over the Baltic-the Arado aircraft works at Anklam, the Focke-Wul factory at Marienburg
