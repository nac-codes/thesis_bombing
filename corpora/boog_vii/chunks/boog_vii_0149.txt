Spaatz put it after the war, 'not on religious or moral grounds' but because it was felt that attacks on strategic targets were more effective. Eaker, his successor in the 8th Air Force command, likewise said later that he had never had the feeling that moral considerations deter- mined the decisions of the American air-force commanders.
