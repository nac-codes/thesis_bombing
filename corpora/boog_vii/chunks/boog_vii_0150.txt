In September 1943 Arnold considered the champion and propagator of what was ultimately indiscriminate carpet bombing, the still very active Lord Trenchard, to 'still [have] a good brain, and a very good concept of air warfare'.219 It is therefore no surprise that the US Army Air Forces were giving thought to gas warfare, and preparing for 216 Freeman, Mighty Eighth War Diary, 123-9; Prien and Rodeike, JG I und 11, 501-5; Groehler, Bombenkrieg, 134-5. 217 Quoted from Schaffer, Wings of Judgment, 37, 224, n. 4. 218 Collier, Defence, 261; Germany and the Second World War, iv. 330. 219 Arnold diary, 'Trip to England 31 Aug .- 8 Sept. 1943', 6 Sept., LoC, Arnold Papers, Box 271.
