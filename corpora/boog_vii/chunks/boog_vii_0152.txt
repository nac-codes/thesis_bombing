Eaker and Anderson were already thinking of an area attack on Berlin, which would have 'a terrific impact' on the German population and would give the people back home an impression of American air power over Europe.227 By attacking residential areas, the whole bombing offensive could be made more effective and less costly. Residential areas and factories were such broad targets that no bomb that fell on them could be regarded as wasted. One of the main advo- cates of this view was LeMay, who had led the raid on Regensburg and later played a leading role in the annihilation of Japanese cities.228 The first American raid to adopt this principle to the full was that on MÃ¼nster on 10 October 1943.229 According to the Tactical Mission Report signed by Gen. Anderson, the city centre was chosen as the aiming-point because it was believed this would kill the Reichsbahn workers living there.230 In the pub- lished Combat
