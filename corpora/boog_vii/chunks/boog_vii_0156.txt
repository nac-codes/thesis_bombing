Eaker and Anderson were already thinking of an area attack on Berlin, which would have 'a terrific impact' on the German population and would give the people back home an impression of American air power over Europe.227 By attacking residential areas, the whole bombing offensive could be made more effective and less costly. Residential areas and factories were such broad targets that no bomb that fell on them could be regarded as wasted. One of the main advo- cates of this view was LeMay, who had led the raid on Regensburg and later played a leading role in the annihilation of Japanese cities.228 The first American raid to adopt this principle to the full was that on Münster on 10 October 1943.229 According to the Tactical Mission Report signed by Gen. Anderson, the city centre was chosen as the aiming-point because it was believed this would kill the Reichsbahn workers living there.230 In the pub- lished Combat Chronology, the Münster target was described as 'railways and waterways around Münster';231 in its secret half-monthly report on activities the 8th Air Force, on the other hand, gave the target factually as 'city centre and railway installations'.232 It proved impossible to provide fighter cover right up to the target. The Germans kept up an unceasing attack with fighters, night fighters
