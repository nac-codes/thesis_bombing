The Germans kept up an unceasing attack with fighters, night fighters, and even bombers, bombs, and rockets.233 An entire bomber group, the 100th, was wiped out with all its 12 aircraft. A secondary raid on an airfield at Enschede caused the unintentional death of 150 Dutchmen. The German fighter defence was so concentrated on one task force that this lost 29 of its 119 bombers while the other lost only one aircraft out of 117. The first force alone believed it had shot down 177 German fighters; in fact, the Luftwaffe's total losses in battle for the day amounted to only 14.234 This attack on M端nster was the forerunner of a long series of what were de facto indiscriminate carpet-bombing raids, which were radar-guided in bad weather. The war ministry under-secretary, Lovett, approved and encouraged such attacks.235 But Eaker needed no encouragement. Though he preferred precision raids, he thought it better to bomb inaccurately than to do nothing during bad weather, particularly since he believed this kind of blind bombing was specially demoralizing for the 227 Schaffer, Wings of Judgment, 66; letter from Eaker to Lovett, 9 Aug. 1943, LoC, Eaker Papers, Box 15; letter from Anderson to Eaker, 18 Aug. 1943, LoC, Spaatz Papers, Box 143. 228 Schaffer, Wings of Judgment, 66. 229 Hawkins, M端nster; Hueffner, M端nster; Freeman, Mighty Eighth War Diary, 125. 230 Levine, Strategic Bombing, 104; Schaffer, Wings of Judgment, 229, n. 17. 231 Combat Chronology, 200. 232 Eighth Air Force Semi-monthly Report of Bombing Results, 1-15 Oct. 1943, 13, LoC, Eaker Papers, Box 58; Hawkins, M端nster, I ff., gives the aiming-point as 'the steps of the cathedral'. 233 Prien and Rodeike, JG I und II, 505-11. 234 Army Air Forces, ii. 698-9. 235 Schaffer, Wings of Judgment, 67.
