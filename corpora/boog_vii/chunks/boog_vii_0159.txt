The 3rd Division suffered less. In all, only 288 of the bombers reached Schweinfurt. ] .

Sixty bombers were lost- the equivalent of six naval destroyers, a large cruiser, or a small aircraft-carrier Consolation was sought in the fact that aircraft could be built faster the ships.238 Five more bombers crashed in England, 121 were damaged, and further 12 had to be scrapped.
