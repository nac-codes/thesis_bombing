the success of the raid, claiming that Schweinfurt had been severely hit and that German resistance was not so strong that it could not be broken. He even sent a telegram to Roosevelt saying 'the once "invincible Luftwaffe" is in trouble', after Eaker had told him that Schweinfurt had seen 'the final struggle of a monster in his death- throes'.241 The Allies also overestimated, at nine months, how long it would take to carry out the necessary repairs. Some regarded the Schweinfurt ball- bearings factories as 'destroyed beyond repair'.242 The commander of VIII Bomber Command, Anderson, received numerous letters of congratulation, and Gen. Marshall called his bomber crews 'the pick of America'.243 Even Speer thought the damage was greater than it actually was, and judged that arms production would come to a standstill within four months if the Americans kept up their attacks at this intensity. But it was not until the end of February 1944 that the Americans returned, with the British, thus allowing him to move the ball-bearings industry elsewhere in the meantime. Under the direction of managing director Philipp Kessler, whom Speer appointed general commissioner for roller-bearings, the measures started immediately after the first raid to ensure the armaments industry's supply of ball-bearings of all types were stepped up. The Swedish ball-bearings industry gave active support. Simpler friction bearings, often made from ceramics, largely replaced the expensive ball-bearings, and made up for shortfalls that were in fact not all that great once it was found that German industry had stockpiled enough bearings for six to twelve months. Moreover, aircraft production was in any case being switched from bombers, which needed around 1,000 ball- bearings, to fighters which used only 150 each. There were problems with machine-tools, which had suffered more severely from the incendiary bombs than from the high explosive; here, again, Sweden provided replacements for many of the s
