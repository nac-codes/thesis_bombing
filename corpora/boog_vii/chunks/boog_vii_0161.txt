There were problems with machine-tools, which had suffered more severely from the incendiary bombs than from the high explosive; here, again, Sweden provided replacements for many of the special machines. It had turned out that ball-bearings factories were harder to destroy than had been thought. Though in April 1944 ball- bearings production did fall to 50 per cent for a few months, by September of that year output was back to the level of before the raids. The German ball- bearings industry could thus not be brought low by air raids, if only because of the speedy countermeasures that thwarted the Allies' plans to strike a fatal blow at German armaments.

I.I. The Allied Bomber Offensive 76 I.1.4. The POINTBLANK Crisis after the invasion of Sicily, had pulled back more than half its fighters to defend the Reich. Within six days the Americans lost some 150 aircraft and wer mourning around 1,500 men killed or missing; 621 bombers had suffered damage. It was now plain that without full fighter cover it was no longer possible to penetrate deep into Germany. The effects of the American 1943 bombe offensive remained modest and debatable, and the 8th
