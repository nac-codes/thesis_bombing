nd the invasion had already been established at the Allied conferences in May 1943 in Washington (TRIDENT) and August in Quebec (QUADRANT), where on 16 August Portal, as co-ordinator of the two bomber fleets, gave the combined chiefs-of-staff a glowing picture of the success of the British area-bombing campaign, and voiced his expectations that in 1943 the Americans would achieve superiority in the air over Germany by day, since there could otherwise be unpredictable consequences for the whole further conduct of the war.248 But now POINTBLANK was in a state of crisis.249 Portal did not go along with the idea of Bomber Command, as part of an agreed coalition-directed conduct of the war focused on a successful invasion, now focusing on air-armaments targets; undoubtedly this was not least because of the low probability of night bombers hitting individual targets. His deputy Air Marshal Bottomley was, on the other hand, given the situation, in favour of switching Bomber Command's targeting from cities to aircraft factories and associated industries. For him, in September 1943, a Schweinfurt was more important than a Berlin, even though his superior Portal had in August still been encouraging Harris from Quebec to undertake raids on Berlin 'on a Hamburg scale' as a sort of crowning-point of the whole bomber offensive.250 If the fighter screen were destroyed, then every centre of the German armaments effort would, as Bottomley had already been arguing, be opened to systematic bombing by day and night.251 The British would still have liked to see the Americans change to making night raids, while the latter criticized the British for not attacking Germany by day. The British in turn saw the American doctrine as too rigid; the Americans, it was felt, did not think as flexibly and pragmatically as did the British, with their greater experience of war in the air. The chief of the American air forces, Gen. Arnold, had never held a frontline command. Churchill and Portal strove
