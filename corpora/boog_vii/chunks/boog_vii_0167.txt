When, on 3 November 1943, Portal was told by the intelligence services of the likely strength of the German fighter force by the date of the invasion-a figure of 2,865 fighters, where only around 650 had been reckoned on-it came as a shock to him.256 Time was pressing; the invasion was set for I May 1944, that is to say, one month after the end of POINTBLANK. On 3 December 1943 Portal was obliged to tell the combined chiefs of staff that POINTBLANK was three months behind schedule. 257 At this time, in fact, only RAF Bomber Command was capable, under cover of darkness, of attacking the fighter-manufacturing plants in central and eastern Germany, even though with no precision beyond the range of OBOE. Did this, however, mean that British Bomber Command should give up its main activity and main objective of destroying German industrial cities by carpet bombing? On the contrary, Harris saw a great opportunity for himself in the continuation of his area-bombing offensive; he was quite convinced that this alone would bring a decisive result. Nineteen cities, he wrote to Churchill on 3 November 1943, had already been virtually destroyed to the extent that they were now only a liability to Germany; a further 19 were more seriously damaged than, say, Coventry, and nine were damaged.
