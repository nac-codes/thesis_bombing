e more seriously damaged than, say, Coventry, and nine were damaged. Compared to Cov- entry, where in 1940 only 100 out of 1,922 acres of built-up area had been flattened, the level of devastation in Hamburg had by now reached 6,200 out of 8,382 acres, in Essen 1,030 out of 2,630, and in Elberfeld as many as 825 out of only 1,068. This damage had been brought about mainly since March 1943 with the aid of OBOE, H2S, and the Pathfinders. He looked on the Ruhr area as by now largely 'dealt with', and for Germany as a whole he prophesied collapse if this programme, already half complete, were pressed on with. He had here particularly in mind the destruction of Berlin.258 Harris made no mention of either OVERLORD or of the German fighter defences still to be overcome, so certain was he in his belief that the war could be won by strategic area bombing alone. The logical follow-up of his activity to date was now to make Berlin the main target. For him no other priorities existed, especially as he felt that because of weather, the phases of the moon, and other tactical considerations, priorities could in any case not be kept to. The head of his secret intelligence service, F. F. Inglis, was also sure that Bomber Command's offensive was doing more to shorten the war than all the other offensives including the Russian one. He and Harris saw support for 256 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 38-47. See also Portal's note of 15 Aug. 1943 to the CCS, in which he says that despite Allied successes in the Mediterranean and Russia the figure that German fighter numbers needed to be below for OVERLORD to succeed, namely 2,000 aircraft, was still exceeded by 13%; he therefore called on the Americans to step up their strike power as much as possible: PRO, AIR 8/1103. 257 Army Air Forces, ii. 715. 258 PRO, PREM 3/14/1 and AIR 14/3507.
