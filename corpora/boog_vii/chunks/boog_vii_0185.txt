on Aachen, Frankfurt, and Essen, or of leaflet drops to the south of Berlin. As the Third Reich's seat of power and administrative centre Berlin was not only a prestige target but also an important industrial centre. At the end of 1040 the Wehrmacht estimated the number employed in the city at 1.27 million, or 7.8 per cent of all German workers, and the number of firms at 276,000 or 8.7 per cent. The capital accounted for 14 per cent of the economy's total turnover. It was home, for instance, to 57.5 per cent of the manufacturing capacity of the German electronics industry, plus a sizeable production of machinery and vehicles as well as of chemicals. Ninety-five per cent of all radio sets, 75 per cent of all telephones, 60 per cent of all field cable, so per cent of all aero-engines, 30 per cent of all airframes, 70 per cent of all torpedoes, and roo per cent of all electric U-boat motors were made in Berlin or its environs.287 This put Berlin's economic significance far above the German average, and the Allies too were aware of this. They knew, for example, that more than a quarter of German tanks-though not the most modern Panther and Tiger types-and half of German field artillery were produced here.288 For all these reasons the city was of course very heavily defended, by both flak and fighters. On 1 January 1944 there were 104 heavy flak batteries, around 25 medium and light batteries, and 35 search- light batteries. No other German city had such extensive anti-aircraft defences. 289 A further factor affected the Allied decisions over Berlin: because most of the population of Berlin had voted for the left in 1933, it was thought in Britain that, given this lukewarm attitude towards the Nazi regime, they would under heavy bombing rebel against the German war policy, as they were suffering particularly badly from the nights of area bombing.290 The series of Bomber Command raids that began in November ended with one on the night of 24/5 March 1944, in which the Bri
