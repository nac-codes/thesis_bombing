The Allied Bomber Offensive 92 I.1.5. Crisis Management OBOE, made a very successful attack. In spite of thick cloud cover the city badly hit, and out of 705 bombers only nine (1.3 per cent) were lost as againstas German fighters. Bomber Command had been able to show once again when vere was capable of when flying a short distance over enemy territory; but those not the conditions its crews were meeting in their attacks on Berlin. They well aware of the difficulties, and of how relatively little effect they were have The nervous strain of the long flight over Germany with no superiority in the grew worse with every trip. The physical stress, with temperatures inside aircraft often far below zero, became close to unbearable. On top o of this there was the constant danger of being shot down-on average, it was to be e expected after at most 30 missions or so over enemy territory. After the heavy losses in particu. operations in February and March 1944, even Harris was now asking himself this kind of bomber offensive deep into Germany could be sustained. The cesses of the light twin-engined Mosquito suggested a radical change in the e suc- craft type to use in the bomber formations. Irrespective of the role they given-as target markers for the main force, in small groups for independe precision or intruder raids, or in diversion or feinting attacks- they 7 suffered relatively low losses. Of the 2,034 Mosquito sorties during the Battle of Berlin instance, where never more than 50 or so were used at a time, only ten-a me 0.4 per cent-were lost. And despite their small size, their high speed and bomb-load of up to 1,814 kg gave them a great potential to inflict damage. But many reasons it
