used at a time, only ten-a me 0.4 per cent-were lost. And despite their small size, their high speed and bomb-load of up to 1,814 kg gave them a great potential to inflict damage. But many reasons it was by now too late to make such a switch in aircraft types. S; the aircrews had to carry on flying their heavy bombers to Berlin. These mar have come close to the ideal for the kind of bomber fleet that had been concei in the 1930s and dreamed of long before that; but with their inadequate a ment of 7.6-mm machine-guns, a moderate speed of 350-460 km/h, a low semi- were Hent y well ceiling of some 7,600 m, their ponderous flight, and being given away by flames from their exhausts and by electronic radiation from their navigation y the fighter-detection devices, they were an ideal target for the German night fight The new German combat methods put them most at risk over the target, and fo that reason attempts had been made as early as October 1943 to cut down th time a bomber stream spent over the target to no more than 26 minutes. All the circumstances made a heavy drain on the bomber crews' morale and will& combat. To make their aircraft faster and more manoeuvrable, and thus easier- 1 for defend, they often already dropped their bombs over the North Sea. The Park finder chief, Air Vice Marshal Bennett, believed that many crews were 'baulki the jump', as they already had for the first time at Essen in 1942, and were 'failin to carry out their attacks in their customary determined manner'. This, too, lessening the success of the offensive. 295 The devastating effects of the bombing that 'put the fear of God' into Speer in Hamburg were not seen in Berlin, though his his own ministry was in fact 295 Ibid. 195-6, 199-200, 203, 207-8; Groehler, Bombenkrieg, 190-5; Hastings, Bomk Command, 264. 93 bombed out during the night of 23/4 November 1943.296 Together with Goebbels, Speer did everything in his power to keep things moving in the centre of the city, and after every rai
