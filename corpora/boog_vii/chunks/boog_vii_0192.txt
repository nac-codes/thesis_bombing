nk-building industries at Alkett, were hit more or less severely. Taken as a whole, however, the effect on Berlin's industry was still not significant, even though it may at first have seemed so at the time. In spite of a temporary drop in output, industrial production quickly rose again. Nonetheless the evacuation of industry now began, also bringing about a temporary fall in production. In February 1945 there were only 884,032 workers left in Berlin, 1.2 million fewer than in March 1943. The real inroads into industrial output did not occur until the summer of 1944.300 One curious fact about the Berlin raids that remains to be explained is that the two big power stations (West and Klingenberg) on the outskirts of the city-the latter of which had been on Bomber Command's list for destruction since 1940/1- were never attacked at all.
