Bell's closing words were that the Allies were fighting, as the liberators of Europe, for something that was greater than might-for justice; and this had to be more important than force. His speech provoked uproar. The archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple, who might have given Bell moral support, did not attend the House of Lords that day.316 Rolf Hochhuth, in his play Soldiers, later made the scene the subject of an imagined conversation between Churchill and Bishop Bell.317 Bell's attack had no immediate effect, any more than did a protest in the journal News Review on 23 March 1944 by 26 leading personalities-including Benjamin Britten-against the 'Attack on Humanity'. When in January 1945 Bell sought to travel to the United States at the invitation of the Federal Churches of America, the Cabinet feared that while there he might condemn the bombing of German cities, which would be 'embarrassing'; it decided to prevail on him not to make any political state- ments. Only then would the trip be permitted.318 During these debates the Battle of Berlin continued, and British losses, which had still been relatively light in autumn 1943, rose to more than 9 per cent (e.g. in the raid on Leipzig on 19/20 February). The German defences were by now becoming accustomed to the northerly route usually taken by Bomber Command, so it now chose a southerly approach. But this too was a fiasco, which brought the series of heavy raids on cities inside German to a temporary halt. But there were other reasons as well for this. The raid on Nuremberg on 30/1 March 1944 was intended to be the end of the Battle of Berlin. The city had been chosen as a target because it had not suffered as badly as others so far; at the same time, as the home of the Reich Party gatherings it was for the British an important political
