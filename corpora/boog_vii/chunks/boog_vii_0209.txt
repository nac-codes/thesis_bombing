n success was seen in a temporary stepping-up of German fighter numbers south of the Alps at the expense of other areas. At the end of December 1943 the US 15th Air Force had 564 aircraft, just on 5,000 officers, and 33,000 other ranks. In January and February 1944 it attacked the Italian war economy, as well as a number of armaments targets at Maribor and Klagenfurt.332 The 15th Air Force, too, was constantly strengthened. With effect from 1 January 1944 the two air forces were brought together under Lt .- General Spaatz, supreme commander of the newly formed United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF). He came under the orders of the British chief of Air Staff Portal, who was on behalf of the combined Allied chiefs of staff acting as co-ordinator between the British and American air forces in Europe. The merging of the two strategic bomber fleets under a single command went back to a plan formed by Arnold in 1942; what he had in mind was not just better co-ordination of strategic daylight bomber operations from England and Italy in order to split up the Germany air defence, but also to place the American bomber chief on a par with the British one (i.e. Harris). In view of the growing numbers of the American air force personnel in Europe, which soon exceeded that of the British, this was wholly natural. For reasons of national prestige the British did not look kindly on this development, and rejected the plans of Arnold and Spaatz that went beyond that and proposed a single supreme command over all British and American air forces in Europe, under Gen. Eisenhower. They feared that their Bomber Command might end up commanded by an American. What the American air force generals had in mind with the setting up of such a command was to achieve a greater degree 332 Army Air Forces, ii. 563-73, 583, 716-17, 723-5, 729, 748; iii. 7-8, 11, 18, 25-6; Freeman, Mighty Eighth, 98-9; Rust, 9th Air Force.
