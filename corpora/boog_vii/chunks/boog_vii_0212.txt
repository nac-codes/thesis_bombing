ly less than that of the Lightnings with two 62-gallon drop-tanks. The 15th USAF, too, received Lightnings, and P-47 Thunderbolts fitted with a 62-gallon jettisonable belly tank. With this the P-47 could already in July 1943 reach the western borders of Germany from England, and in February 1944, with two 88-gallon external wing tanks, its range stretched roughly to Kiel-LÃ¼beck-Frankfurt am Main. The Mustang, in March 1944, could with two 62-gallon external wing tanks penetrate 1,000 km inside Germany, and with 88-gallon tanks even 1,300 km-the equivalent of from England to Vienna. Both these aircraft types were, however, still having teething troubles with their engines and propellers, and the fuel supply from the drop-tanks did not always work. Occasionally the 12.7-mm machine-guns jammed in a tight curve. It was, however, less the escorting Mustangs that in the spring of 1944 saved the American bomber force from defeat over Germany, and helped win the necessary superiority in the air, than the lower-performance Thunderbolts and Lightnings with their extra fuel tanks. With an average of 2,000 to 2,600 machines in the early months of 1944, there were three-and-a-half to four times more of these in Europe. But beyond their operating range, and soon over the whole of central Europe, it was the Mustang that formed the backbone of the American fighter protection and the main basis for American air superiority. The fighter squa- drons were therefore increasingly equipped with the P-51, the numbers of which by the end of 1944 came to around three-quarters those of the other two types. Yet even without the Mustang the Americans would have been able, though more slowly and with higher losses, to win superiority in the air by day.334 A further innovation, the H2X bomb-aiming radar (an American version of the British H2S, though, as the MEDDO gear, working on a much shorter wavelength of 3 cm), was for a while coming only very sluggishly into use.
