MAP I.I.7. Locations of RAF Bomber Command and US 8th Air force units, 1944 107 worked in theory even without sight of the ground, thus contradicting the Americans' earlier conviction that an effective bombing war could be conducted only through daylight precision bombing using optical bombsights. As H2X allowed daylight raids in bad weather, it reduced the level of the bombers' weather-dictated inactivity, and forced the German fighters to take off and form up ready for battle under like conditions. With pilot training becoming ever poorer, and with a lack of blind-flying training and equipment, they found this difficult; but they had to face the challenge if they did not want to watch important targets being destroyed without putting up a fight. This matched exactly Spaatz's intention of pinning the German fighters to the ground.335 The growing number of heavy bombers and escort fighters now available, together with the new radar aids, led from January 1944 to a fundamental change in American attack tactics. It was now no longer necessary for self-defence purposes for the bombers to fly in tightly grouped and stacked formations of 54 bombers in a box measuring around 3,800 × 870 × 810 metres; and with more aircraft being lost to flak this had in any case become too dangerous. The fighters no longer needed, against their nature and their higher speed, to stick close to the bombers they were protecting; guarding these no longer took priority over shooting down enemy fighters. The fighter pilots were naturally glad to be let off the leash to range and hunt at
