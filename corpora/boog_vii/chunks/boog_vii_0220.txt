The Over-All Report of the US Strategic Bombing Survey342 frankly that attacks on marshalling yards inside cities took on states quite the character of area raids on those cities. But in accordance with the declared aims of th attackers, they were recorded as 'precision raids' (using H2X through clo on transport targets. 'Marshalling yards' was, as Richard G. Davies, the off: oud biographer of Gen.

The inaccuracy of H2X bombing through cloud was always knowingl. taken into account: it was high. With optical visibility, around 25 per cent bombs fell within a radius of about 300 m of the aiming-point of a marshall yard; using 'radar visibility', it was only 2 per cent. Added to this was the & that still in late 1944 more than half the American bomber groups did not ha H2X-equipped target-finding aircraft, and that there was a lack of aircr trained to operate the equipment. Only some 5 per cent of all Ameri bombers in Europe managed, when using radar, to get their bombs within 300-m radius of the aiming-point. That the US Army Air Force nonetheless always tried to distance itself from the Royal Air Force's bombing methods n a and never endorsed deliberately indiscriminate attacks on German cities (indeed, it vehemently disowned them), had not a little to do with its wish be set free from the army. This was an independence that could be won onl if it was, in the eyes of the public, morally without a stain. The American did not, besides, see German cities as their top-priority target, and did not like Harris, contemptuously dismiss specific industrial targets as 'panacea targets'; they bombed these whenever visibility was good. Spaatz believed the war would be won more quickly, and with fewer losses, by destroying selective targets. Nor did the Americans in Europe de
