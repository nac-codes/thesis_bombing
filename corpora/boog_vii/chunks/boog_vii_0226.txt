Other targets were in Frankfurt am Main, Braunschweig, Solingen, Kiel, Osnabruck, MÃ¼nster, and Ludwigshafen, as well as in France and Belgium.351 On only a few of these operations was there clear visibility-as, for instance, for bombing the molybdenum mine and processing plant at Knaben in Norway (which had already been damaged by RAF Mosquitoes in March 1943). This fresh attack did no great damage, so the supply of molybdenum to the German steel industry was not endangered; German experts were able, besides, to make up for any shortfall in other ways. The raid on the same day on the heavy-water plant at Rjukan, which was highly important for the German atomic research effort and had been brought back into production following Norwegian sabotage, led to its being moved to Germany.352 In general the attacks carried out during the winter months had no great effect on the German war industry; they did, however, serve to acclimatize the new bomber crews to conditions in Europe.
