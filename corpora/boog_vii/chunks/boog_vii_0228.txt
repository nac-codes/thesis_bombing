The main blow was delivered in 'Big Week', lasting from 20 to. February; this had been planned, under the codename ARGUMENT, November 1943, but had had to be repeatedly postponed for lack Â· since sufficiently long period of good weather.355 .355 On 19 February, however, it of on the basis of the meteorologists' forecasts and of intercepted Germo ENIGMA signals, expected for the following day.356 The 15th US Air Force to take part in the big attack: it was allotted the Messerschmitt works Regensburg and Augsburg together with the ball-bearings factory 353 Galland, The First and the Last, 273; Freeman, Mighty Eighth War Diary, 149. 354 Army Air Forces, iii. 22-6; Freeman, Mighty Eighth, 104-7; Davis, Spaatz, 303, 360; Price Battle, 115-20; Galland, The First and the Last, 276; Prien and Rodeike, JG I und II, 674-705.

Henry Maitland Wilson, C-in-C of the Allied forces in the Mediterranean, however, felt that the 15th Air Force was more urgently needed in Italy on the Anzio front, and at first refused to release it for the 'Big Week' operations. Spaatz thus began these on 20 February with 1,003 heavy bombers and 835 fighters of the 8th and 9th US Air Force
