y on the Anzio front, and at first refused to release it for the 'Big Week' operations. Spaatz thus began these on 20 February with 1,003 heavy bombers and 835 fighters of the 8th and 9th US Air Forces, supported by 16 squadrons of RAF short-range fighters. At the same time 135 medium bombers of the 9th Air Force made diversionary raids on airfields in occupied western Europe. The 8th's targets for the day were aircraft factories and repair shops and airfields in north- eastern and central Germany. On 21 February similar targets in Braunschweig and north-western Germany were hit by 891 heavy bombers guarded by 679 fighters, with in particular the city of Braunschweig suffering heavy damage rather than the parts-industry works. Further mass raids were made on installations connected with Luftwaffe armaments on 22 and 24 February. From the 22nd the 15th Air Force joined in, bombing targets in Steyr, Regensburg, and elsewhere. On 25 February 'Big Week' was brought to a close with a double raid by the 8th and 15th Air Forces on Regensburg. As the 15th was flying without fighter cover it lost 33 of its 179 bombers-19 per cent, a loss-rate unsustainable for any length of time and equivalent to a 'lifetime' of only five or six missions per aircrew and aircraft. The Americans were finding with their daylight raids that the more targets they attacked, and the further apart these were, the heavier losses they suffered. British Bomber Command took part in 'Big Week' with night raids on Stuttgart on the 20th/2Ist, Schweinfurt on the 24th/25th, and Augsburg on the 25th/26th. The British night raid on Schweinfurt was the first to match the intention of the combined bomber offensive of 'round the clock' bombing; it followed on from an American daylight raid.358 In 'Big Week' the Americans had made more than 3,800 heavy bomber sorties, more than 500 of them by the 15th Air Force, and dropped over 13,000t of bombs during the five days. There had been 3,673 sorties by escorting fight
