in March 1944 was 800. A few days later he was giving thought to which factories could be switched from producing bombers and transport planes to turning out fighters. German aircraft production did, it is true, drop in February 1944 compared to January; but in March it was already back up to 2,672, and by July even reached 4,219, the highest monthly output figure of the whole war. The worst-hit fighter factories turned out 1,555 aircraft in January 1944, only 1,104 in February, but already again 1,638 in March. Clearly, the output of fighters was rising faster than that of other types of aircraft. The gap between the actual and planned production of all types, however, became ever wider.371 In January 1944 this was 517 aircraft, widening to 1,103 in February; in June it was still at around 1,000, and from September onwards became wider still. In Me 109 and FW 190 production the shortfall from planned output moved from - 10.7 per cent in August 1943, through - 51.4 per cent in December, - 38.5 per cent in February 1944, and - 35 per cent in May, to reach nil in July/August 1944, only to soar dramatically from the autumn onwards. In February the planned rise in production had to be postponed by more than a month. In April only 3,034 aircraft were built instead of the planned 3,819, and in July 3,626 instead of 4,631. The bombing of the synthetic fuel plants producing the bulk of aviation spirit supplies that began on 12 May quickly led to a serious curtailment of pilot training and of bomber sorties. In July a great many new fighters had to stay on the ground for lack of fuel. The now more intensive relocation of factories was a further cause of 368 Ibid. 327. 369 Script for telex to Arnold from Anderson, 27 Feb. 1944, I, LoC, Spaatz Papers, Box 67. 370 Galland, The First and the Last, 275; GLM conference with heads of department, 15 Feb. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/59, 4873 ff .; GLM conference, 23 Feb. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/28, 8970 ff .; Grabmann, Luftverteidigung, BA-MA ZA 1/24
