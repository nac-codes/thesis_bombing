Whereas in the late autumn of 1943 the British and Americans had had to resort to difficult diversionary and feintine manoeuvres in order to get to somewhere like Marienburg in East Prussia, the Americans now, under their fighter cover, had no problem in bombing air armaments targets even in north-eastern Germany. What fighter opposition appeared came under attack, as on 16 March over Arnsberg when ZG 76 lock 21 of its 43 twin-engined 'destroyer' fighters. Now, heavy fighters like thesa could be used only with twice the number of single-engined fighters accom panying them; and because of the differing speeds, and of the problem of assembling all of them at the right time in the right place, this was vem difficult. It proved better to use the heavily armed and armoured FW 190 A. 'storm' fighter, with its two 13-mm and four 20-mm machine-guns, in groups each protected by two groups of single-engined fighters.

But the 'storm' fighters proved less vulnerable than the 8th US Air Force 1942 1943 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th Bomber Wing 1st, 2nd, 3rd, Bomber Wing 44th Bomber 91st Bomber 92nd Bomber 93rd Bomber 97th Bomber 301st Bomber 303rd Bomber 305th Bomber 100th Bomber 306th Bomber 15th Sqd. 9 Groups 1 Sqd. 44th Bomber 91st Bomber 92nd Bomber 93rd Bomber 94th Bomber 95th Bomber 96th Bomber 303rd Bomber 305th Bomber 306th Bomber 322nd Bomber 323rd Bomber 351st Bomber 351st Bomber 379th Bomber 381st Bomber 381st Bomber 384th Bomber 384th Bomber 385th Bomber 386th Bomber 387th Bomber 388th Bomber 389th Bomber 390th Bomber 392nd Bomber 401st Bomber 422nd B.Sqd 1944 1st, 2nd, 3rd, Bomber-Div. 34th Bomber 44th Bomber 91st Bomber 92nd B
