Crisis Management twin-engined destroyers, and when they managed to reach the bombers the inflicted appreciable losses.380 In bad weather the American escort fighters flew low-level attacks, usin. their guns against Luftwaffe ground targets, railways, and other mov targets. Successful though operations like this were, they lost American aircres to light flak. The purpose of this strafing and fighter sweeps was, as Spa wrote on 9 and 18 April 1944, to bring home to the German civilian popular. the weakness and impotence of their own air force, and thus undermine the tion will to resist. 381 The American pilots often took this very literally, and shot grazing cows, pedestrians, cyclists, and farm carts. The German populatie was thus understandably more incensed at pilots like these than against the bomber crews who, anonymous to those on the ground, were killing thousand of civilians from 6,000 or 7,000 m above. Shot-down American fighter pilot were not infrequently violently attacked by the civilian population.382 From late April the strategic bomber units were used mainly on targets ; occupied western Europe to prepare the invasion. The German fighter defences had been decisively weakened. The official history of the US Ar Air Forces even says that the Luftwaffe was beaten on I April 1944, desnis the Americans having suffered a fiasco on that very day.383 Of 440 bomk dispatched, only 165 found their target after half of them turned because of bad weather. The others bombed ba bed as far as 130 miles to the south. even hitting Schaffhausen in Switzerland
