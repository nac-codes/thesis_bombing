Forces, iii. 66. 384 Davis, Spaatz, 377-8. 125 against Germany rose from 6,367 in January to 19,825 in May and 28,925 in lune, those by light and medium bombers from 1,649 to 11,944 in May, and by escort fighters from 7,167 to 36,210 in May and 55,460 in June; taking all American warplanes together, the figures climbed from 15,183 in January to 67,979 in May and 96,096 in June. The total of 329,067 sorties by American aircraft in the first half of 1944 (197,331 fighters, 91,055 heavy and 40,681 medium/light bombers) was countered by only 23,411 fighter sorties by the Luftwaffe (19,515 single-engined, 3,896 twin-engined).385 Seen against this ratio, Galland's assertion that during the defence of the Reich the odds were seven enemy aircraft to one German seems to be very much glossing over the true situation. His figure can relate only to the actual aircraft strengths, and on that basis the Americans had 8,351 warplanes confronting the German home fighter defences in May 1944. The entire German daylight fighter force, covering all theatres of operation, had on 31 October 1943 an actual strength of 2,042 single- and twin-engined fighters, and by 31 May 1944 this was only 1.988. Over the whole of Europe they were faced with 5,445 American daylight bombers and 12,025 daylight fighters. If one adds to this the night fighters and their counterpart, the RAF bombers, then on the dates just mentioned 2,639 and 2,686 German daylight and night fighters were set against 16,956 and 25,416 British and American bombers and fighters, respectively.386 These statistics demonstrate clearly the now hopeless inferiority of the German fighter defence. Inevitably, this had an effect. Already by March 1944 the Americans were getting the impression that the German fighters were attacking less persistently than before. They no longer rose to meet every American incursion, and since 'Big Week' were attacking only on selective occasions, when they were massed387-a clear indication of inadequat
