ersistently than before. They no longer rose to meet every American incursion, and since 'Big Week' were attacking only on selective occasions, when they were massed387-a clear indication of inadequate numbers. This weakness seems also to have affected the fighting spirit of the pilots, which in view of the unequal numbers is not surprising; one is only amazed that they carried on in spite of it. The shrinking number of engagements with the enemy by the daylight fighters shows that in May their activity had reached its zenith. While in March and April contact with the attackers had always resulted from some 50 per cent of single- and twin-engined fighter sorties, in May this was as high as 65 per cent (3,130 out of 4,849). From June/July, however, and despite a growing actual strength in fighter numbers, engagements with the enemy stagnated at between less than 800 to 1,100, before rising again to 1,875; all this at a time when the Americans were each month putting up just on 20,000 heavy and 4,000 to 9,000 medium 385 Figures in: Report by General of Fighters, Gruppe I (Ic): Major incursions over Reich territory (by day), January to June 1944, 17 Aug. 1944, in Price, Battle, 130; Davis, Spaatz, Apps.
