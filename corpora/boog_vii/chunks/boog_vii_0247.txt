No air for could stand losses like this for even a short while. Around 85 per cent of th losses were against the enemy in the west, that is, by day and mostly against the Americans, who thus played the key role in defeating the German daylight fighter defence. 389 When some of the fighters were downed, the pilots were look as well; deaths among them rose from 12.1 per cent in January to 21.7 per cent in March and 25 per cent in May 1944.390 Because of this, and of the shortas of aviation fuel that set in soon after the Americans started to attack the synthetic fuel plants, the training hours for fighter pilots had to be curtailed. on the one hand to save petrol, and on the other so as to turn out enough piloto to fly the growing number of fighters being produced. This, however, Wan cutting off one's nose to spite one's face-fewer training hours meant poorer training and thus higher losses, which in turn meant providing further repla cements for them. It was a vicious circle. Whereas up to the late summer of 1942 a German pilot was getting up to 260 flying hours of training, and in 1940 still around 175 hours (30 of them on his front-line aircraft type), by mid-1944 he was being given only some 110 hours, and often only 12 or 15 on the front li
