In March 37 aircrews chose internment in one of Europe's neutral countries. In April 20 heavy bombers landed in Sweden and 32 in Switzerland: from 30 December 1943 to the end of February 1944 only five crews had chosen this way out of the war. 396 Naturally the same thing happened with German crews. The American leadership were becoming concerned that aircrew, who after completing 25 missions over enemy territory were given 30 days home leave, were spreading pessimism. Some of them were suffering from depression. Rotating crews between the front and home was consequently discontinued, on the grounds that the Army Air Forces had completed their build-up and now no longer needed experi- enced aircrew to train their new personnel back at home; the impending invasion would call for at least two sorties a day, thus rendering the 25-mission tour obsolete; and moreover, the large number of escort fighters by now available had reduced bomber losses and the experience gained by the aircrew had made their raids more effective. With the invasion coming up the crews were, as Gen. Doolittle told them, 'not done yet with the war' once they had completed their 25 sorties. Though a tour was eventually limited to 30 frontline sorties, the possibility of this being extended because of special circumstances was still a drain on aircrew morale.
