According to Piekalkiewicz, Schweiz, 349-54, a total of 167 American aircraft, mostly bombers, landed in Switzerland between August 1943 and April 1945, about 80% of them in 1944, plus during the whole war 59 German, 12 British, 4 Italian, and I Hungarian. In Sweden during the war 141 American, 63 British, and 126 German aircraft landed or were forced to land (Widfeldt, Luftwaffe in Sweden, 9).

From POINTBLANK to OVERLORD which had lost 15 aircraft over Berlin on 6 March and was almost completel worn out, there were symptoms of a pronounced breakdown of morale they to Spaatz's consternation, appeared elsewhere as well after the dropping crew rotation.

It was only the fall-off in their losses from May onwards the overcame the crisis in morale.397 6. FROM
