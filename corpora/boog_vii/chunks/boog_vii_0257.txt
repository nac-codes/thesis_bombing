Gen. Marshall also turned against it, and Arnold had to fall into line, 403 r the Leigh-Mallory and Spaatz differed, too, in their views of the strategic air war, and this also became evident in their basic assessments of OVERLORD, it importance, and its prospects. Spaatz, a strategic bombing war proponent of the 'air power alone' persuasion, looked on providing support to the landings as unavoidable, but a distraction from his main task. He did not want to hand over his heavy bombers for supporting the army too soon, since this would severely hamper the POINTBLANK offensive which he regarded as a higher priority.404 When, on taking over his command of the American strategin bomber forces in January 1944 in London, he learned that Leigh-Mallom 402 Letter from Arnold to Spaatz, n.d.

On Spaatz's views on the air war see also Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, iii. 22-4 and 33-4. 133 considered support from the heavy bombers to be necessary as long as one or two months before the landings, he voiced fears that in the short time this left it would not be possible to achieve the purpose of POINTBLANK, that of decisively crippling the German armaments industry. There will be no opportunity, he said, of carrying out air operations of sufficient intensity to justify the theory that Germany can be knocked out by air power.405 He therefore tried to limit the obligation on his heavy bombers to provide support to OVERLORD to a short period, from just before the landing until a bridgehead had been established. When it became clear that Leigh-Mallory in fact wa
