ligation on his heavy bombers to provide support to OVERLORD to a short period, from just before the landing until a bridgehead had been established. When it became clear that Leigh-Mallory in fact wanted to have the bombers for longer than that in order to paralyse the French and Belgian transport systems, he developed an alternative plan. Under this, OVERLORD was to be supported only indirectly, through continuing to ground the Luftwaffe as part of the bombing of German sources of power. He put the bombing of German marshalling yards, for instance, ahead of those in France, since German fighters would undoubtedly be stationed in Germany rather than in France and the Luftwaffe could thus be beaten in German airspace instead. Together with alternative proposals for waging an air war from Norway (after a landing there, thought to be less difficult) or over the Balkans, Spaatz planned to bomb the synthetic fuel plants on German-held territory, since that was also where the fighters would have to be stationed. In January 1944 both he and Portal had still been resisting a similar proposal from the combined chiefs of staff. After 'Big Week', however, American experts in economic warfare were advising precisely that. Spaatz joined in-even though he regarded an invasion as neither necessary nor desirable, nor offering much hope of success-so as not to have to take the blame for it failing. But only once that had happened would he be able to show how bombing wins a war.406 An invasion, in Spaatz's opinion, was basically unnecessary if the US 8th, 15th, and 9th Air Forces under a single command were able to continue with the strategic offensive for 15 to 20 days each month, four or five of them with good visibility.407 Success in the plan to attack fuel supplies would also be needed for the sought-after independence for the US Army Air Forces, since the nature and location of the targets meant that a close co-ordination with the land forces-such as there would be with transp
