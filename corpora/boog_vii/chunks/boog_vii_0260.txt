Speaking as one who had previously commanded fighter groups, and in the certainty the superiority the Allied air forces already enjoyed, he felt sure that mastery y of the air over the landings could be won even against the strong German fights units still in existence; and indeed not before but at the actual time of batel- on the beaches, in which the Luftwaffe would be bound to take part.
