On 25 March Eisenhower went against Spaatz, who was still saying that a fuel offensive had a longer-lasting effect, and decided-with only limited agreement from Portal and Harris but the wholehearted support of Tedder and Leigh-Mallory-that a transport offensive would be the best use to make of heavy bombers for OVERLORD. Yet Churchill persisted in rejecting the transportation plan, even though this had been reduced to 74 targets and the likely civilian losses were now estimated at 'only' 10,500 dead and 5,500 severely wounded. Roosevelt, whom Churchill asked for advice, replied on 11 May 1944 that from his great distance he could not give Eisenhower any instructions that could possibly jeopardize the success of OVERLORD. Their joint insistence overcame Churchill's opposition, though not his conviction that the plan was wrong- headed. Finally Bomber Command was allocated 39 and the 8th Air Force 23 targets in France, Belgium, and western Germany, and the 15th US Air Force a few more in south-eastern Europe. Here Spaatz was in early April to be almost surreptitiously initiating his fuel offensive.417 This patent divergence of interests among the leaders of the Allied air forces had already been apparent in the tussle going on at the same time about a
