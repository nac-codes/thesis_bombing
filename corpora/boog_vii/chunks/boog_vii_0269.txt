. It was, however, chaired by Leigh-Mallory, not Tedder. A further attempt by Spaatz, shortly before the invasion, to set up a high command covering all American air forces in Europe was rebuffed by Eisenhower, who constantly emphasized the virtues of Allied unity, and Spaatz himself finally let it drop since it would have resulted in an altercation with the British.
