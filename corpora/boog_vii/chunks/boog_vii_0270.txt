lready under way. From 10 March the 9th US Air Force was switched from supporting the 8th to missions preparing the way for the invasion. From I April the needs of the invasion were given priority in all the Allied air forces. The change in priorities was naturally not overnight or total. Even Eisenhower was aware of the continuing value of the strategic bombing missions-the 8th Air Force, for instance, was in its operations over Germany destroying hundreds of German fighters a month in the air and on the ground, so that sorties by the tactical bombers against airfields in France met with hardly any fighter opposition.

The top objective remained that of the POINTBLANK offensive, the continuing destruction and paralysing of the German military and economic and industrial system, together now with the destruction of the major trans- port arteries.
