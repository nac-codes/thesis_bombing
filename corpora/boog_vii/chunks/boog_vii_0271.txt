em those of the American strategic bombers in that they as far as possible a struck at the Luftwaffe and the rail network. Leigh-Mallory's tactical bomb had the task of knocking out the V-weapon sites in northern France necessary calling on the strategic bombers to help in this.420 Exceptionally, Harris actually did, besides continuing attacks on near the German border, concentrate very largely on the transport syst in France.421 Though Bomber Command's attempts to carry y out preci attacks had still in 1943 met with such varying degrees of success focusing entirely on these had not seemed advisable,422 the changed obie tives forced it to do so now that Bomber Command was, a against all its commander's resistance, involved in bombing the railways to prepare t ground for OVERLORD. Heavy bomber crews accustomed to targets covering wide area now had to get used to compact ones that could be destroyed on by precision bombing. This change in habits was also needed because more transport targets lay in German-occupied territory, whose population had as far as ever possible, to be left unharmed. This meant that the attacki king formations had to be smaller, which was besides necessitated by the fie ierce countermeasures put up by the German night fighters, for whom a de bomber stream always offered an easier-to-find and rewarding target. 7 · The aim was, therefore, to harry and scatter the defenders by splitting up the attacking aircraft into a multiplicity of groups. Since Bomber Command non had very many more aircraft available, this was now quite possible while being able to keep up the pressure. The British called this new tactic 'divid concentration'. 423 that The first attempt at precision bomb-aiming was made with the raid by Lancasters from the elite 617 Squadron on the Gnome-Rhône aero-engine works at Limoges on 8/9 February 1944. Flying at only 60m, Wing-Cd Cheshire himself first placed his target indicators exactly on the target, onto which the others could then
