e Gnome-Rh√¥ne aero-engine works at Limoges on 8/9 February 1944. Flying at only 60m, Wing-Cd Cheshire himself first placed his target indicators exactly on the target, onto which the others could then drop their bomb-loads very accurately from 2,000-3,000 m. The factory was demolished without the town or its civilians suffering any harm. Most of the destruction was caused by only five 12,000- pound bombs, released from around 3,000 m with the aid of a stabilized 420 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, iii. 13-25, iv. 167-70; Army Air Forcet. iii. 79-83, 142, 149, 164; Levine, Strategic Bombing, 127-8. 421 See Middlebrook and Everitt, Bomber Command War Diaries, 491-520. 422 See above, pp. 44-74 423 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, iii. 125-35. 14I automatic bomb-sight.424 All the aircraft returned to base. There had, it is true, been no air defence at Limoges. Equally effective results were achieved on 16/17 March in a similar raid on the rubber factory at Clermont-Ferrand.425 The series of successes continued, with the initially only experimental attacks by Bomber Command on railway targets, and showed that this kind of mission was feasible. The 'Musical Parramatta' procedure was used: an OBOE-equipped lead aircraft dropped marker bombs, and these were renewed and/or corrected by OBOE bombers that followed; from 10 April, to enhance accuracy, the bombing was even continuously controlled and corrected by R/T instructions from a 'master bomber' circling over the target, a system called 'controlled OROE'.426 Since the Pathfinders, trained for area attacks with a bomber stream, were not particularly well suited to this, each of the main force groups now had to develop its own marking and bomb-aiming technique. Soon the British bombs falling in the target area were almost matching the accuracy of those dropped by the Americans in daylight and with good visibility; 55 per cent were within a circle of around 1,200 m.
