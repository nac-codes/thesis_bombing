e target area were almost matching the accuracy of those dropped by the Americans in daylight and with good visibility; 55 per cent were within a circle of around 1,200 m. Between March and May the accuracy achieved by Bomber Command improved by 165 per cent.427 While Harris, on the one hand, left no doubt as to his preference for area bombing, it is interesting to see that in May he was pressing for even better accuracy and, after the German daylight fighters had in April finally lost their air superiority to the Americans, even went over to daylight precision raids by bomber formations at squadron strength. The bomb scatter in the target area decreased, thanks in particular to techniques developed by Wing-Cdr. Cheshire, first to within 340 m and then further to 250 m. The new 'dive- marking technique', also known as '5 Group visual', involved first a proximity marking by OBOE-equipped Mosquitoes, then illumination of the target with flares, and finally marking by shallow-diving Mosquitoes. The targets in France were only lightly defended, and this favoured this technique, since they could be used from lower altitudes-around 3,700 m for OBOE, and 2,200 m for dive-marking.428 The latter technique failed in Germany when first tried out on 22/3 April over Braunschweig, which also saw the first use of 30-lb liquid-filled incendiaries. Things went better over Munich on 24/5 April, but less well against Schweinfurt on 26/7 April because of strong fighter defences. The raid on Friedrichshafen on 27/8 April showed how accurate the bombers could now be, even by moonlight and just with standard Pathfinder marking 424 Ibid. ii. 181-7; Hastings, Bomber Command, 283.
