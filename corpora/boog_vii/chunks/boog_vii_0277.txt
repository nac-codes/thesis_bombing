f June it was especially coastal batteries and German radar stations along the Channel coast that provided Bomber Command and the 8th Air Force with their targets. In the nine weeks up to D-Day, British and American aircraft dropped, about half each, a total of 195,000 t of bombs, losing 1,953 aircraft (1,251 of them American) and more than 12,000 aircrew in the process. 432 A large part of the effort went into warding off a latent threat, long recog- nized, to airfields and assembly areas for the invasion forces in southern England from the German V-weapon sites in Belgium and northern France.433 On 24 December 1943 the heaviest attack so far by the Allied strategic and tactical air forces(US 8th Air Force, US 9th Bomber Command, and 2nd (British) Tactical Air Force), with more than 1,300 aircraft, including 722 heavy bombers and 670 Lightning, Thunderbolt, and Mustang fighters and fighter-bombers, was launched against 23 of the V-I sites. For the Americans especially, who in December had begun regular raids on targets like these (Bomber Command joined in only gradually), this meant a clear diversion of their heavy bombers away from the strategic bomber offensive.
