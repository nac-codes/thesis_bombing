. A large proportion of the bombs dropped by heavy bombers on marshalling yards would have been better used on the German armaments industry, but Eisenhower could not be sure the interdiction plan would work and did not want to wait until the invasion for the proof. Because of this, and because all he had to go on was the experience of bombing railways in Sicily and southern Italy and the interpretation of this by Tedder and Zuckerman, Eisenhower felt he had for safety's sake to put the far more costly transpor- tation plan into effect early on.431 In the months leading up to the invasion a great many other targets were naturally also bombed in preparation for it. In Germany the strategic bombers went for military installations and fuel and ammunition depots, in France and Belgium mainly the airfields. The latter had a direct effect on the Luftwaffe, as the German fighters deliberately held back or were moved further inland; but an indirect one as well-later on, the devastated airfields in northern France, where in spite of intense repair work they could not be made serviceable again, presented German fighter units moved there shortly after the invasion started with enormous difficulties and unpleasant surprises. In May and the first few days of June it was especially coastal batteries and German radar stations along the Channel coast that provided Bomber Command and the 8th Air Force with their targets. In the nine weeks up to D-Day, British and American aircraft dropped, about half each, a total of 195,000 t of bombs, losing 1,953 aircraft (1,251 of them American) and more than 12,000 aircrew in the process. 432 A large part of the effort went into warding off a latent threat, long recog- nized, to airfields and assembly areas for the invasion forces in southern England from the German V-weapon sites in Belgium and northern France.433 On 24 December 1943 the heaviest attack so far by the Allied strategic and tactical air forces(US 8th Air Force, US 9th Bomber Comm
