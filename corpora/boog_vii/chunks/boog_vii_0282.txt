retend activities on the sites. Rather than make conventional attacks on the V-weapon sites, Spa e ol would have preferred to put the power network in the Pas-de-Calais German gyrocompass production, out of action, and considered the or tinctive building works were merely an attempt by the Germans t s to draw t the heavy bombers away from targets in Germany. In this he was not entirely wrong; Field Marshal Milch, too, welcomed the raids on the V-weapon sites France, since the bombs would otherwise have fallen somewhere else when they would have done greater harm to German arms production.434 So that V-weapon targets on the Channel coast, which now had to attacked, could be put out of action at least without a great expenditure be aircraft and aircrew losses, the Americans carried out tests on a full-scale of model at the Eglin air base in Florida to see what method of attack would viel the best results. The most effective and economical turned out to be not lere high-altitude flight by heavy bombers, but dive-bombing by fighter-bomber- which was in line with Spaatz and Arnold's thinking. Leigh-Mallory, however feared that this would bring heavy losses to the fighters from German flak, an- insisted that heavy bombers be used. The conflicting views on how CROSSPO should be conducted remained unchanged. Because of British worries abo the threat to their island from V-weapons, Eisenhower in April went again the views of the American air generals and ordered that these sorties should given priority over all others except POINTBLANK. 435 d be In the meantime, and virtually on the quiet, Spaatz's counterstroke to o the unloved rail transport offensive was getting under way. When on 5 April the 15th US Air Force was attacking marshalling yards in Romania, the refineri eries at Ploie»ôti were, in a quite intentional sideshow, also bombed.
