the 15th Air Force during the raids in April and May on oil depots and refineries was, because of defensive smokescreens, not all that great. In June, the 15th had damaged about a half of the 60 fuel-production plants lying within its range (which also included northern Italy, Hungary, and Yugosla- via). In that month the Balkan oil offensive was stepped up further when, from 2 May, the Americans had access to airfields in Russia which allowed bombing operations using 'shuttle-bombing'. The first of these operations, which were codenamed FRANTIC,437 took place on that day when 130 four-engined bom- bers of the 15th Air Force, taking off from Foggia with an escort of 70 Mus- rangs, attacked fuel plants in Hungary and Romania, and then landed on the Russian airfield at Poltava; the following day they flew back from there, bombing German airfields in Romania on the way. Further raids on fuel targets in Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Romania followed in May. For some of these a low-level approach was adopted so as to avoid detection by German radar and prevent early deployment of a smokescreen over the targets. On a number of occasions fighters were sent on ahead, to locate targets without a smokescreen and report this to the bombers. The attacks on Ploiești continued until 19 August 1944, with support from the RAF on 17/18 August. Since April 1944 the 15th Air Force had, with a loss of 350 aircraft, dropped a total of 13,469 t of bombs on oil targets around this city. In August oil output dropped to 10 per cent. Between May and August some 1,200 mines were sown in the Danube, and claimed 125 tankers; the mining of the Danube by British aircraft was also very effective, as was an attack on the tankers from the air. The German minesweeping organization, using boats and 15-20 Junkers Ju 52 aircraft, was able in May to clear or deactivate 139 of the 354 mines dropped during that month. Oil imports to Germany from Ploiești and the Balkans fell from 186,000 t in March 1944 to 81,0
