On 12 May good visibility allowed the first heavy raid of the fuel offensive against targets in central Germany; the 8th and 9th US Air Forces launched 886 heavy bombers and 980 escorting fighters-more than half of them Mustangs-to bomb in particular the Leuna works at Merseburg, Wintershall AG near Lützkendorf, and petrol installations at Böhlen, Zeitz, and Brüs dropping a total of 1,687 t. Violent air battles occurred over the Rhine-Main area, with some 200 single-engined and 50 twin-engined German fighters taking part. Forty-six bombers were brought down, 34 by fighters and three by flak, plus 12 American fighters. The German fighter force lost 54 aircraft, with 28 aircrew killed and 26 wounded. They were unable to prevent the bomber from reaching their targets, and these were thus able to drop their bomb-loads relatively undisturbed. On this day Leuna suffered the first of 22 major raids: the damage to the hydrogenation plants was fairly severe, though daily pro- duction fell by only one-seventh or so, to 4,820 t, and by 25 May was almost back to its previous level. Nonetheless the temporary loss of production was 100 per cent in Most (Brüx) and Zeitz-Tröglitz, 60 per cent at Leuna, and 28 May 1944 29 May 1994 Chemnitz Gera 14 25.2 Hof 4 Other targets 265 2.
