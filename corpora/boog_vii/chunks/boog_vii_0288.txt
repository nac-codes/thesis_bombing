at were meant to be moving from Russia to France were being diverte to the Tröglitz hydrogenation works, and that flak units were being take away from aircraft factories to protect the hydrogenation works at Pölitz an Blechhammer. As early as 3 May a radio message sent by the Japanese milito and attaché in Berlin on 30 March was decoded, which spoke of German fe about the possibility of the hydrogenation plants being bombed. There had fact already on 14 April been surprise expressed in the Luftwaffe high com mand that the enemy had not already done so, though their highly developed tactics would have made this easily possible.440 On 21 May the Allies inte cepted a message from the Kriegsmarine high command to Marinegrup West mentioning a drop in petroleum production. A message from Luftwaffe high command to the First Paratroop Army on 5 June, decoded on- the June, stated that even the most basic training needs could no longer be because of the shortage of petrol brought about by the raids on the hydr e me genation plants. The British Joint Intelligence Committee was already on May reckoning that if attacks on the production installations were kept u German fuel production would, within three to six months, have reached such a state that Germany would be unable to remain fully operational on all thr ree fronts. Moreover, ULTRA was revealing on 7 June that to maintain its defensive capacity in the east the Luftwaffe was having to draw on its strategic reserves of petrol; for this reason Spaatz on 8 June upgraded the fuel plants to first priority for operations by the 8th Air Force. He could now in good conscience pursue his two main objectives-overpowering the Luftwaffe, and destroying the synthetic fuel industry.441 439 Army Air Forces, iii. 176-9; Levine, Strategic Bombing, 146; Davis, Spaatz, 396 ff .; Freeman.
