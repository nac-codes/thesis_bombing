On 3 June the Air Staff told Harris to bomb ten hydrogenation plants in the Ruhr as soon as the situation on the invasion front allowed, and until December 1944 these formed special targets for Bomber Command. Harris was, however, not exactly enthusiastic about the fuel offensive; while the Americans had in the first four weeks of their attacks on these targets needed only 5,166 t of bombs, he felt he would need 32,000 t to destroy the ten plants. And yet as ULTRA intelligence showed, his first raid, on the Bergius Gelsenberg hydrogenation works at Gelsenkirchen on 12/13 June with 271 Lancasters, brought the works to a standstill for several months. Further raids on hydrogenation plants during June had less success, in part because of the weather. They cost 93 out of 832 bombers. All the same, the joint offensive against German fuel production was now under way; this was a key group of targets, eliminating which had a decisive effect on the further course of the war. 442 In the summer of 1944 the main task of the strategic bomber forces, how- ever, remained direct and indirect support to the ground forces in landing and securing a bridgehead in Normandy and then advancing further into France.
