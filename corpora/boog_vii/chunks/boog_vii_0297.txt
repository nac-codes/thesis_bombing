reat interest in aerial reconnaissance photographs of devastated German residential areas.452 There were, essentially, two very practical obstacles standing in the way of the Red Army carrying on a strategic bombing offensive (which, as Marshal Vasili D. Sokolovsky wrote after the war, it would have gladly done). It lacked the necessary heavy bombers (production was geared largely to building tactical aircraft), the equipment, and aircrew trained to undertake long-range operations.453 Furthermore, the Soviet air war theoreticians and planners had to recognize that, like Germany, the Soviet Union was first and foremost a land power with long borders. This geostrategic situation meant the air force had to co-operate closely with the ground forces, of which it was a part. The influence of Giulio Douhet's maxim that wars could be won by strategic bombing was up to the mid-1930s naturally felt in the USSR as much as it was in Germany. Alexander N. Lapchinsky,454 an early Soviet air war theoretician, recognized the importance of strategic bombing in the 1920s, but did not go as far as Douhet and did not see this use of bombers as the be-all and end-all of war, nor even as war-winning. The air force should rather be an integral part of the armed forces. Its main priority was supporting the army, not conducting an independent bombing war. With the appearance of Germany and Japan as potential adversaries whose inland sources of power lay within the range of Soviet bombers, Vasili V. Chripin455 in the mid-1930s also developed 450 Soviet Air Force, 7-8. 451 As, for instance, Groehler, Luftkrieg 1910-1970, 135, 148-52, 202.
