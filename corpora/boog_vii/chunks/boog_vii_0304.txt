g seriously threatened from the air. At the same time a critical situation was developing everywhere on the land fronts in the east and south, and dealing with it meant moving fighter aircraft away from the Reich itself. For the first time, the German daylight fighter force was facing a crisis. In 1943 the Allies' strategic bomber fleets dropped 346,166 t of bombs on Germany-occupied territory-450 per cent more than they had in the year before. Of these, 177,263 t fell on Germany alone, compared to 45,000 t in 1942. The new nature of the bombing war could also be seen in the greater concentration of the British bomber streams: while in May 1942 a thousand bombers dropping 1,500 t of bombs on a target had taken an hour and a half, 400 bombers were now releasing the same bomb-load within 15 minutes. The number of those killed in air raids rose from about 6,800 in 1942 to around 100,000 in 1943, and that of civilians wounded from something over 24,000 to around 200,000. In Germany in 1943 approximately 173,000 buildings were destroyed, and 212,000 damaged.1 The new situation was also marked by the expansion of the British night- fighter capability, and the gradual extension of the range of the American daytime escort fighters beyond the western border of Germany. On 15 April came the first major encounter between some 60 American P-47 Thunderbolts 1 For the figures see USSBS, i.
