at altitudes above 8,500 m. Göring refused to accept this as a reason for t German losses, sacked the man in charge of fighters in the Holland/Ruhr are and castigated the German fighter pilots for 'letting him down'. Only wi- difficulty could he in the end be persuaded of the shortcomings of the BM 801 engine at high altitudes.2 On 4 May 79 B-17 Flying Fortresses attack Antwerp, and were for the first time escorted throughout the trip, out and bac cked and over the target, by an even larger number of fighters. German fights did in fact shoot down four P-475, but none of the bombers. The range of hters American fighters, without drop-tanks, was still limited to Brussels-Utrek Texel. By 28 July P-47s fitted with 75-gallon wing-mounted auxiliary tank were already reaching a line through Aachen-Arnhem-Zwolle. In October « er the P-47, now with a 108-gallon belly tank, had a range of some 600 km, reachi Strasbourg-Frankfurt-Hanover-Hamburg. Following their heavy losses Regensburg and Schweinfurt, the American daylight bombers were for time being attacking only targets within the range of their escorting fighter r the whose numbers had meanwhile risen to 300 operational r machines, now including a wing of the twin-boom P-38 Lightnings. Though the latter had even greater range, they were tactically inferior to the German fighters, 3 Other new features of the bombing war over Germany in 1943 were the rapid growth of American aircraft numbers, especially in the second half of th year, from 1,671 in June to 4,242 in December, coupled with an average attal the strength of 183 bombers in August and 506 in December, or a monthly cou ranging from 50 aircraft in January to around 3,000 at year's-end. The level the principally American daylight sorties, at more than 12,000, came to one third that of the mainly British ones by night in 1943. From August onward there were also more diversionary raids by the RAF, and by the autu Bomber Command was also able to mount raids in large num
