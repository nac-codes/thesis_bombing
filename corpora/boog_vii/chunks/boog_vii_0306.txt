third that of the mainly British ones by night in 1943. From August onward there were also more diversionary raids by the RAF, and by the autu Bomber Command was also able to mount raids in large numbers against main targets at once, thus splitting up the German fighter defence. A further st two innovation was the target-marking described earlier, with master bombem directing operations from over the target by R/T; and finally there were the jamming and partial crippling of the German radio and radar (to be discussed later), and the introduction of centimetre-wave navigational and target-locating radars that allowed blind bombing by night and in poor visibility (which, in particular, made the work of the German daylight fighters very difficult).4 Against all this was pitted, as 1943 began, a German fighter force that was overstretched after almost four years of operating on all fronts.

Of these, 109 and 298 respectively were in serviceable status. They found themselves facing some 600 serviceable and mostly heavy British bombers and an American force of 300 serviceable bombers and 100 escort fighters.5 Of the Luftwaffe's other day fighters, 370 were in the west, 254 in the s
