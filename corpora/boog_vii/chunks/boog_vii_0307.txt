me 600 serviceable and mostly heavy British bombers and an American force of 300 serviceable bombers and 100 escort fighters.5 Of the Luftwaffe's other day fighters, 370 were in the west, 254 in the south, and around 400 in the east. In addition, there were roughly 140 twin-engined 'destroyer' fighters and 130 night fighters stationed on the other fronts. The low number of daylight fighters allocated to guarding the Reich skies indicates that up to now it had been felt that Germany Was relatively safe during the daytime, but is also a sign that the fronts in the south and east were making heavy demands.6 Unlike earlier, when bomber and dive-bomber manufacture had far out- stripped that of daylight fighters, the production of offensive and defensive aircraft and the numbers coming from repair in February 1943 were, at 956 compared to 958, almost on a par; deliveries of bombers, ground-attack air- craft, and twin-engined fighters were in that month, at 732, well above those of only 382 to the daylight fighter arm. This shows very clearly that the shift in air armaments, begun in 1942, to a larger share for defence had still not got under way, even though around three fighters could have been built for the outlay on making one medium bomber. The actual strengths of the frontline units even show an excess of 200 offensive aircraft (bombers, destroyers, ground-attack aircraft, fighter-bombers, dive-bombers, and seaplanes), with a total of 2,121 as against 1,910 defensive aircraft.7 When Milch, complaining of the relative neglect of air defence in favour of the bomber arm that was still evident in the spring of 1943, said that none of the damage to towns and factories would have happened and no enemy bombers would have flown over Germany if there had been enough day and night fighters, he was stating the obvious.8 And yet it was precisely at this point that the attacking-action mindset that dominated the German leadership was bolstered by Hitler's demand for counter-terro
