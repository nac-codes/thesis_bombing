not the slightest hope of overcoming the handicap that, because of the rushed arms schedule, had existed from the outset of having day-fighter pilots with no training in blind flying.19 In fact, in March 1943 the night-fighter force was 51 short of the number of fully operational crews experienced in blind flying needed to fly the 360 serviceable aircraft. The bomber force was short of 364 crews. Only the Zerst√∂rer force had a surplus, of 23 crews; but these were also needed for giving ground support to the army. With the single-engined fighters there were only 1,187 fully operational pilots for an actual strength of 1,535 machines-meaning that some 350 fighters had to be flown by pilots with only limited operational training (assuming they all had even that). Among the fighter aircraft, however, only 66 per cent were fully serviceable. 20 The general of fighters strikingly compared the Reich's air defence situation to 'a house without a roof.21 Milch stressed that any war would be bound to be lost if there was not air superiority in the places where it was needed.22 President Roosevelt had already commented that there was no such superi- ority, in his message to Congress on 17 September 1943 in which he spoke of Hitler's having a 'fortress without a roof, which meant that it was not impregnable. In fact there had never been a roof, because after the initial blitzkrieg wars Germany had been cradled in soothing security and had never got round to building one. When those in charge recognized-too late-the need for it, the overall war situation was, as Galland writes, making it neces- sary to 'use up' the available fighter forces on the land fronts in the east and south. So long as this roof was not restored and strengthened to cope with the increased demands, 1943 was for Milch 'a year to sit tight and clench our teeth. The situation will change a lot in 1944, and these basic changes must already begin to appear in the autumn [of 1943].'23 16 Reich minister for aviat
