made a defensive air war unavoidable. (a) Daylight Fighter Operations At the beginning of 1943 daylight fighter defence of Reich airspace was based wholly on Jagdgeschwader (JG) I, deployed as two Gruppen in Holland and two covering the German Bight. Their Me 109s and FW 190s had a maximum flying endurance of 11/2 hours, and an operating radius of 350-400 km at 8,000-9,000 m, though to make full use of this required landings to refuel. 24 Boog, Luftwaffenführung, 119-21; Irving, Rise and Fall, 176. 25 Speer, Third Reich, 290-1; Galland, The First and the Last, 247; Irving, Rise and Fall, 238. 26 Toliver and Constable, Galland, 203. 165 There was a dense network of airfields for this, though the problem was keeping all of these permanently provided with sufficient ammunition, fuel which was already rationed), and personnel. In good weather, and with favourable conditions, the operating radius from Holland stretched to roughly Rendsburg-Hamburg-Braunschweig-Frankfurt, and from the German Bight as far as Cologne-Frankfurt-Halle-Berlin. To stiffen the daylight fighter screen over the Reich and protect central Germany and Berlin, Gruppe III of IG 54 of Air Fleet 3 was moved to daylight fighter control Centre; Vienna was protected by calling on operational units from No. 8 fighter flying school (at Bad Vöslau). Beyond the range of enemy fighters, sections from more than 16 night-fighter Gruppen could be used to tackle daylight bombers flying without a fighter escort. Now and again operational units from factory self-defence Staffeln also saw action.27 In the first four months of the year the quite modest day-fighter screen cost the Americans flying over Holland, Belgium, and north-west Germany a 6 per-cent loss rate (43 out of 703);28 this was far from enough to dissuade the ever-stronger 8th Air Force from making further attacks. At that time Galland pressed the view that it would be better, given the great distances that the small numbers of single-engined fighters bein
