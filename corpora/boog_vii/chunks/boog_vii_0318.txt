mber 1943 GÃ¶ring had resignedly to tell the Gauleiters that 'for the time being' the Mosquitoes could not be caught.35 Test Unit 25', comprising two Staffeln and formed in spring 1943, played a leading role in developing and testing ways and means for combating the American day-bomber formations. Tests were carried out with 210-mm sockets, to be fired into the formations by light and heavy fighters; with fitting 27-mm Flak-18 and Flak-43 guns in bomber-destroyers and Ju 88s, and with installing the 50-mm AFV cannon in the Me 410 (which proved unsatisfactory because of its 850-kg weight, poor accuracy at 1,000 m, frequent jamming, and the slowness of the gun platform); with fitting 30-mm MK 103 and MK 108 cannon; with Hs 293 H glider bombs to be air-launched by FW 190 fighters; with parachute bombs of various calibres and rockets, to be dropped by destroyers and bombers and fired by fighters, respectively; with aerial-release containers holding 105 SD-2 delayed-action bombs (known to the Allies as (butterfly bombs'); and so on. In summer and autumn 1943 all of these were still at the experimental stage. Not all turned out to be useable. In the case of the bombs there was the problem of detonating them: as there were no proximity fuses available, attempts were made to achieve accurate bombing of the American formation by using acoustic, altimetric, and delayed-action fuses-though all in vain.36 The actual number of day fighters for use over the Reich increased only slowly, and was boosted by the creation in April 1943 of Jagdgeschwader II. It rose from 154 fighters on 10 April to 292 on 30 June, and those in serviceable status from 120 to 238.37 Since it could be assumed that the range of the American escort fighters would increase, it had to be ensured (with experience during the Battle of Britain in mind) that the enemy fighter cover was fully engaged before an attack was made on the bombers. Thus, a crucial part of air defence was formations of light fighters to ke
