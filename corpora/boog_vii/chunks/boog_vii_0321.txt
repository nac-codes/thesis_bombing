ere making it important to make better use of the existing defence organization, simplifying and centralizing it (especially since ever-wide areas were being involved). Yet on 24 May Hitler had already turned down a proposal from the commanding general of XII Air Force Corps, Josef Kammhuber, who was responsible for day- and night-fighter defence, that the two be combined (on the model of British Fighter Command) under a fighter fleet with three fighter corps each of two fighter divisions; Hitler considered the estimates of Allied armament production on which this was based to be too high. Göring, who was also present on that occasion and had already in earl January been given the relevant armaments figures by Milch, offered no 38 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 444 ff. 39 See Special Intelligence Summaries on the German Air Force in PRO, ADM 223/97, ok- Hinsley, British Intelligence, ii. 517. 40 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 442 ff .; MGFA, Sammlung Grabmann R 1239-1241. 41 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 444 fi 169 protest, even though he had originally approved the plan.42 On 21 June he rejected a second proposal by Kammhuber for a single organization covering day and night fighters, using the same radar gears, and for forming a fighter deet comprising only two fighter corps as a central command for the fighter defence over Germany and up to the Channel and Atlantic coast; he did not see this as urgent, though he appreciated that splitting up day- and night- fighter defence between Luftwaffe Commander Centre and Air Fleet 3 could not be sustained in the long run. The (functional) fighter fleet would make the (regional) air fleets superfluous. Underlying this was the showing of consid- eration for the head of Air Fleet 3, Field Marshal Hugo Sperrle, who was jealously guarding his domain. Though Göring was balking at a completely new command structure, he knew quite well that the existing one was untenable; so it was a
