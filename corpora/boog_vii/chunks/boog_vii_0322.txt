Field Marshal Hugo Sperrle, who was jealously guarding his domain. Though Göring was balking at a completely new command structure, he knew quite well that the existing one was untenable; so it was agreed that the generals of day and night fighters, Galland and Kammhuber, together with the Luftwaffe Commander Centre Weise, would each for their own arm (with Weise dealing with flak) work out pro- posals for a command organization.43 On 29 June 1943 Milch presented to Göring his report on a tour of inspection, from 7 to 12 June, of Air Fleet 3 and XII Air Corps.44 In this he repeated the main thrust of Kammhuber's proposal, calling for a fighter strength of 650 to 800 machines-four times as many as there were bombers attacking by day at the time-and felt that defence by daylight would be secured if this demand was met. He too sug- gested a single command over the day and night fighters, plus a functional structure for the Luftwaffe modelled on the British. This was going too far, and on 3 July Göring turned down everything. Kammhuber, Milch, and Galland might well be unanimous in wanting a three- to fourfold strength- ening of the daylight fighter force, but they could not prevail; much worse would have to happen first.45 The main reason they could not get themselves listened to-apart from the demands of CITADEL (the German attack on the Kursk Salient)-was the heavy loss of fighters in combat against the superior Allied air forces in the Mediterranean, and the switching of most new fighter production on Hitler's orders to that theatre.46 These losses, mostly on the ground due to airfields being evacuated too late during the retreat in North Africa/Tunisia in the first half of 1943, were so high that fighter units there at the time had twice to be re-equipped with new machines. This explains why, in spite of a total of 7,477 Me 109 and FW 190 day fighters being supplied from the factories during the first eight months of 1943, few were available for stiffening units d
