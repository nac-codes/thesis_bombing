88, there were the following addition in that month: I Aug .- I/JG 5; 2 Aug .- Staff JG 26; 3 Aug .- III/JG 26; 4 Aug .- II/JG 26, II and III/JG 3 (on this see Karl-Heinz Langer: Notes for the history of the Jagdgeschwader 'Udet', 6 Sent 1943, 37 ff., BA-MA RL 10/639); 14 Aug .- I/KG 51; 20 Aug .- Staff JG 3; 21 Aug .- II/JG 51; 2000) Aug .- III/JG 27; 27 Aug .- Io/ZG 26. By 18 Aug. II/JG 26 had already been recalled. I71 fighters and bomber-destroyers coming from new production and repair.51 In October a 'Sturmstaffel' of FW 190s was formed in JG I; the aircraft had armour at the front, two 13-mm and 20-mm machine-guns above the engine, and two wing-mounted 20-mm guns. These very heavy fighters were meant to bring the four-engined bombers down at close range using their massive frepower, and if necessary to ram them. This last was, however, left to the judgement of the pilots, who did not need to sacrifice their own lives but could bail out.52 At Bad Zwischenahn, 20/JG I began its battle against the reconnaissance aircraft and heavy bombers with the Me 163 B rocket-powered fighter, a technically far from mature design; at the same time the unit was tasked with developing the basic tactical and technical principles for employing and piloting these aircraft.53 The most important addition to the fighter strength by day lay, however, in the two Zerst√∂rergeschwader 26 and 76 mentioned earlier, mustering together 62/3 Gruppen. The day-fighter force did in fact, in August 1943, have an average actual complement of 588 day fighters and 103 destroyers, with 399 and 63 respectively of these fully operational; but this soon fell off as a result of the American raids on fighter factories that started in the summer; according to Milch, these cut output by around 25 per cent.54 Taken overall the temporary boosting of numbers was, when seen against the increasing threat, of only minor significance. It did, however, bring momentary successes, as when in the American attack on Schw
