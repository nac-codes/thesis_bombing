n overall the temporary boosting of numbers was, when seen against the increasing threat, of only minor significance. It did, however, bring momentary successes, as when in the American attack on Schweinfurt and Regensburg on 17 August close on 20 per cent of the bombers were shot down, and large-scale American daylight raids against Germany were halted for a while. In all, the day-fighter force defending German airspace in August, while suffering 25 losses of its own, laid claim to 35 certain and 130 probable kills.55 When the Americans raided Emden by day on 27 September, with fighters protecting their bombers for the whole flight and over the target, only seven bombers (about 3 per cent) were shot down for 11 German losses; during a second, unescorted raid on Schweinfurt on 14 October, on the other hand, the Americans again lost around 26 per cent.56 Yet there was no stopping the massive American incursions by day, for the aircraft available were insufficient to build up big wings to oppose them.
