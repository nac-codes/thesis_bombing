sed from the tone of his conversations with Galland, commanding the fighters, on the one hand, and with Dietrich Peltz, leading the attack on Britain, on the other: it was benevolent towards the latter, irritated with the former. Göring was hoping that going onto the offensive would restore the Luftwaffe's prestige. While it does not seem entirely clear what decisive action might have been taken to regain air supremacy, the tendency towards mobilizing the troops' remaining mental reserves into a fanatical lust for battle, as a sort of substitute for that, is very evident. This was the simplest way of escaping the general feeling of help- lessness, the impotence that Göring disguised by saying that 'there were still no set ways of conducting day- and night-fighter defence'. The enemy was constantly coming up with new attack methods, and this made a standard tactic impossible; so one must remain flexible.73 There was thus a realization of the inferiority in material terms, and that the day fighters were being tac- tically overloaded, and there was criticism of the inaccuracy of the early- warning service and of it being split up between the Luftgaue, XII Air Corps, and the Reichsflugmeldedienst; but no practical measures were taken to improve matters. 'At the present time the flyers and the flak each have their own assessment of the situation in the air, so things are handled separately', Josef 'Beppo' Schmid, general commanding the home air defence corps, explained as late as 4 January 1944; he hoped to see a defence corps controlling all the various forces. 74 The minutes of the Reich marshal's conferences show very little sign of the systematic approach to the various problems that is so evident in records of meetings of senior commanders in the British and American air forces. Instead we find a great many ad hoc decisions being taken, and matters of opinion on even the tiniest detail being discussed when they should have been dealt with in subordinate bodies and c
