German day fighters went about th 1g eve task. They were often sent up to do battle in the worst possible (though usual for Europe) weather conditions, while the American flying out and back at altitudes of 7,000-8,000 m, above n bombers h qui and the rain, snow, and danger of icing; the bombers, well equipped w. e the bad 's wer weath navigation and bomb-aiming devices, were able to carry out and in most cases land back at their bases with no great difficulty. The Gerne t effective att day-fighter aircrew and aircraft were ill-prepared for coping with bad weark they lacked blind-flying instruments and training, which after a few trials the successes of the early war years had been deemed unnecessary for sinel engined day fighters. Because German air-war doctrine had from the and beginning attached less value to the defensive fighters than to the offensi bomber arm, the effort devoted to training had always been niggardly, not le because additional blind-flying training would have slowed down product of the required numbers of fighter pilots (and the rapid rate of build-upof the Luftwaffe in the pre-war and early war years ruled that out). Training bad-weather flying-resumed, too late, in the summer of 1943- -was, however, constantly hampered by the shortage of time, aircraft, and fuel.77 As a recul, most day-fighter pilots had little competence in flying on instruments landing in bad weather. Nor had they mastered assembling in large formation- (a skill that had been forgotten since the Battle of Britain), formation flying at Es or Geschwader strength, or flying through solid cloud cover. If this becam necessary, then attacks en masse were no longer attempted; they could h made only in much smaller groups, and this-given the defensive firepower of the dense bomber formations and the superior numbers and performance of the American escort fighters-brought high losses. Younger, inexperienced pilots often tried to escape the American fighters by diving away, unaware
