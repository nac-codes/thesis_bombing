during his current tour inspecting the troops. The public wanted to see bombers being shot down, and he himself wanted to have not just ordinary soldiers, but 'warriors'.81 His speeches were the usual mixture of abuse and appeals to morale. Every step must be taken at once to combat a 'negative attitude to the war and its outcome' and defeatist talk within the fighter force. It seemed, besides, that in order to raise spirits hopes were already being placed on splits between the Allies and the Soviet Union. 82 Göring further demanded that the single-engined fighters henceforth be stationed far enough forward to intercept the bombers before they reached their targets in the Reich. The accumulation of Göring's insulting accusations against the fighter pilots finally led to a confrontation with the general of the fighter arm. When, during one conference, the Reich marshal called them 'pampered' and unworthy of their high decorations-they had been failures as early as the Battle of Britain, where many of their commanders had 'faked their reports' to get their Knight's Crosses-Galland ripped his own Cross from his collar and slammed it down on the table in front of a speechless Göring; he did not wear his war decora- tions again for the following six months, and other officers followed suit.83 Göring's prime demand was that the day fighters should before all else shoot down the bombers. When, in autumn 1943, the American fighter escorts (whose existence Göring had initially refused to believe in) were already penetrating as far as Hamburg-Hanover-Kassel-Frankfurt, this strict order could no longer be followed, because the German pilots had first of all to break through the fighter screen. Tactics changed fast in the war in the air.
