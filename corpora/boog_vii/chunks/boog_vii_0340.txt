tory of of Jagdgeschwader 'Udet', 6 Sept. 1943: 'Erfahrung: Der erfolgreichste Angriff ist der von hinten oben mit viel Fahrt!', BA-MA RL 10/630 On American firepower, see Galland as quoted by Cooper, German Air Force, 306. 179 The reproaches so drastically heaped in October on the day-fighter pilots for their lack of fighting spirit, criticism that, according to Galland, was not wholly unjustified, 87 had their effect. An average of between 250 and 300 single-engined fighters, 100 night fighters allocated to daylight operations, and around 100 destroyers88 took off in some 3,000 daylight sorties during the big raids on targets in Wiener Neustadt, Emden, Frankfurt, Saarbrücken, Bremen, Neubrandenburg, Marienburg, Danzig, Gdynia, Münster, and Schweinfurt. Of the 2,520 bombers that had taken off 2,027 reached their targets; and of these 258 were, according to German figures, shot down for the loss of 118 Luftwaffe aircraft-more than 10 per cent, as against 4 per cent own losses. If the bombers that returned to their base but were past repair are taken into account, the American losses were a good deal higher.89 The defenders had scored a patent success, and the Americans later expressed their respect for the keenness of the German fighter pilots.90 Because of the high losses they had suffered the Americans limited themselves in November to targets in north-west Germany, so as to keep contact with the German defences as low as possible and stay within the range of their fighter escorts. The now frequently bad weather meant that they were often bombing with nil visibility of the ground; while this made their raids less effective, it also put the German fighters at a disadvantage, and for only modest results the latter had fairly high losses-6 per cent, against 3 per cent American casualties. These figures demonstrate the effects on the German day fighters, often mentioned before, of bad weather and the American fighter cover. The extension of the latter's operating rang
