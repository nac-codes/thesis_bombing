erican casualties. These figures demonstrate the effects on the German day fighters, often mentioned before, of bad weather and the American fighter cover. The extension of the latter's operating range as far as the Frankfurt area, and the increasing use being made of bad weather to bomb blind with the aid of one of the radar gears developed from H2S, made a planned and unhindered attack in large formations by German fighters impossible. Furthermore the Americans were putting up around three times as many aircraft as the Reich air defence had fighters and destroyers; the number of their escort fighters alone outstripped that of German day fighters by 40 per cent. Between the summer and winter of 1943, with an actual day-fighter strength that was decreasing, the number of serviceable aircraft rose about threefold compared to the start of the year (obviously a result of faster repairs); yet there were still not enough of them to cope with the massive American offensive in the long term. On their large-scale raids in December, for instance, the Americans flew 900 and more bombers and fighters; and they were faced by a Reich air defence totalling some 500 serviceable fighters, not all of which-because they 87 Galland, The First and the Last, 242-3. 88 See 'Operational availability of air units', BA-MA RL 2 III/727; MGFA, Sammlung Grabmann, R 1243. 89 The figures found in Army Air Forces, ii. 847-8, Freeman, Mighty Eighth War Diary, 120-31 and Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 467-8, are not always definite and differ from one source to another, so that it is impossible to be more precise here. 90 Freeman, Mighty Eighth, 73-9; id.
