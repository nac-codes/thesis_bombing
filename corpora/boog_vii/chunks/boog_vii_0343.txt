nemy force, offered the promise of success natural called for even more fighter resources. But from that aspect things did not look all that rosy. In 1943 the proportion of defensive aircraft (i.e. fighters, r , night fighters, and destroyers) among all frontline machines coming from the factories and repair shops-47.6 per cent, or 13,854 aircraft-was admittedly almost 16 per cen higher than a year before; of a total of 29,132 frontline aircraft, only 11,24 were single-engined fighters. But 8,286 defensive aircraft had also been lost and the surplus that remained was not enough to cover, besides the losses, the demands from all the fronts, to supply the fighter-pilot training schools, and to bring the Luftwaffe units up to nominal strength (the level of which was at the same time having to be raised).

Serviceability in the fighter units improved only slightly over this period, from 65 to 70 per cent (from 1,006 to 1,095 aircraft in the whole fighter arm), and was thus still unsatisfactory.97 Galland had now suggested increasing the complement of his units, so as to boost the fighters' operational strength. He began this in autumn 1943 with
