ghter arm), and was thus still unsatisfactory.97 Galland had now suggested increasing the complement of his units, so as to boost the fighters' operational strength. He began this in autumn 1943 with Jagdgeschwader 2 and 26 in the west, since that was where reinforcement was most urgently needed. Normally, a fighter Geschwader had comprised 124 aircraft. Now, by raising the strength of a Staffel to 16 instead of 12, it was going to number 160 aircraft. As a second step, in 1944, a 16-fighter Staffel was to be added to each of the three Gruppen in a Geschwader so that the Geschwader strength would be 208 aircraft (i.e. four Staffeln of 16 machines, plus four for the Gruppe staff, multiplied by three plus four aircraft for the Geschwader staff). It was planned in a final step to add a fourth Gruppe, so as to bring Geschwader strength including a Geschwader headquarters staff to a total of 288 aircraft. These nominal strength increases were in general brought in by November 1944, even if they were not matched by actual strength.98 In all of this, account also had to be taken of the shortage of officers to lead the units, which led to increases in complements being preferred over raising new units. In the whole of the Luftwaffe in the years 1943 and 1944 there was an average of around 80,000 officers, 32,000 of them in the flying branch. In the fighter arm, however, the number of officers serving as unit leaders and aircrew skippers or as instructors never exceeded 800, because losses were very high and because fighter-pilot training was not paid the necessary attention early enough.99 From the start of the war until 20 June 1943 the air troops branch lost almost 9,000 officers among total losses of 52,065.100 This is a high number if we bear in mind that, during 1943, only 12,164 aircrew of all kinds were trained, and in 1942 only 5,299 as pilots. Far from all of the latter were officers; and of these numbers only 5,311 and 2,329 respectively were trained as day- and n
