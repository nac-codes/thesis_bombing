12,164 aircrew of all kinds were trained, and in 1942 only 5,299 as pilots. Far from all of the latter were officers; and of these numbers only 5,311 and 2,329 respectively were trained as day- and night-fighter/destroyer aircrew. Still at that date the far more costly training of 'offensive' pilots (i.e. for bombers, ground-support aircraft, and so on) predominated.101 Galland himself had to admit that he had been too late in recognizing this problem over unit commanders in the fighter arm.102 97 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', ZA 1/2476, 566-72. 98 BA-MA Nachlaß Galland, BA-MA N 211/1, 31-2; Toliver and Constable, Galland, 234. 99 Boog, 'Offizierkorps der Luftwaffe', 290-1; id., Luftwaffenführung, 335, 455; Galland, The First and the Last, 228; Generalleutnant a.D.
