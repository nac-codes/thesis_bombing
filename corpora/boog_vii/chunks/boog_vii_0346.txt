g the standard fuel 1 tanks w d be make their sortie duration even shorter. The answer looked to be to fit a e hi tional inboard tanks, increasing the flying time by 20 minutes. 103 If the flying American bombers and fighters, and the British Mosquitoes, were be engaged effectively with the advantage of a greater height, he service cei needed to be raised. This was made all the more urgent by the likelihood of .18 Americans using their B-29 Superfortress in Europe; this operated at hei of 10,000-11,000 m, and according to Milch would render 80 current German fighter types impotent. Altitudes like this per cent of the fitted with the GM-1 (oxygen/methanol/water injection) needed fight version kit; and in September 1943 there were only 20 or so power-boost con of these available In the case of the Me 109s this kit altered their flying characteristics som that they could be used only in rear areas against bombers and reconnais aircraft, but no longer against fighters. The FW 190s, thanks to air-cool. BMW 801 F engines, had their performance improved. The Me 110 and 1 410 destroyers suffered similar problems. 104 The GM-I could also give the fiol fighte a higher speed, and this had a role to play particularly in combating the Mosquitoes. Attempts were made to increase their firepower by fitting the new MK 103 and 108 30-mm cannons. This had already been done on the Me Are but on the single-engined fighters they could be fitted only in pods under the wings, which badly affected their flying characteristics. Fighters armed wiek 210-mm rockets lost so much manoeuvrability that they could be employed only outside the range of the four-engined bombers' fighter escorts. A number of ways of improving the blind-flying capability of fighter crews were tried out in the fighter division at Deelen, but shortage of fuel and replacment of per- sonnel meant that in 1943 these could still not be incorporated into the training programme. By 1944, when the decision on this was finally ta
