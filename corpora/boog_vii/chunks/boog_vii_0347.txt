By 1944, when the decision on this was finally taken, tha conditions for doing so were even worse. 105 Finally, Galland set up the 'Rosarius Travelling Circus', a unit made up of captured Allied aircraft of all types that had been made airworthy again and flown by German pilots led by Capt. Rosarius, visited the various fighter-pilo 103 GLM conference, 17 Aug. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/24, 7199 ff.

This not only broadened their experience, but also boosted their morale. 106 But the project that earned the most attention was the Me 262 jet aircraft; Galland expected it 'to bring about such superiority that even small numbers would prove important'.107 The aircraft generated disagreements within the Luftwaffe leadership and led to an argument with Hitler, who wanted to use it as a high-speed bomber to combat an Allied invasion. 108 Here it must be said at once that Göring had the jet-fighter project altered along these lines, and ordered 'the jet bomber development is to be pushed ahead determinedly and to an unparalleled degree'.109 This decision did not match what Galland and the 'fighter wing' of the Luftwaffe leadership wante
