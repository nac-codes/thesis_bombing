ered 'the jet bomber development is to be pushed ahead determinedly and to an unparalleled degree'.109 This decision did not match what Galland and the 'fighter wing' of the Luftwaffe leadership wanted, and was for them a great disappointment (one that was subsequently to be overdramatized). Vet-contrary to what was said later-it was possible with the backing of the FÃ¼hrer decree to press ahead with development of this aircraft type as a priority; and from the manufacturing viewpoint there was no great difference between the fighter and bomber versions. Even as a fighter, the Me 262 would have become available in large numbers hardly any earlier; the technical problems played a greater role than Hitler's desire, keenly supported by Willy Messerschmitt, for a fighter-bomber.110 At the end of 1943 there was only a handful of experimental models being tested. In the last three months of 1943 the day-fighter defence was, given the right circumstances, still able to deliver severe blows-as it did during the raid on Schweinfurt on 14 October-and bring the American bomber offensive to a standstill for a while; yet in numbers and quality, tactics and technology, it was in crisis. A crisis that was deepened further still by the relentless increase in the American escort fighters' range; by the start of the raids by the US 15th Air Force from Foggia against industrial targets in northern Italy and southern Germany;111 and by the growth in the American warplane numbers in the European theatre. 112 (b) Night Fighters and Electronic Warfare The German night fighters' battle against the Royal Air Force, which generally attacked under cover of darkness, was technically far more difficult than that waged by the day fighters. Whereas in January 1943 the RAF's daily average of bomber sorties had been 514, of which 313 were by heavies, by December 1943 106 Galland, The First and the Last, 216; Toliver and Constable, Galland, 232. 107 GLM conference, 26 Oct. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/26, 8261-2
