In 1943, when 1,012 night fighters and 1,363 destroyers were lost, only 2,613 machines came out of the factories and repair workshops over the entire year. For the night fighters this meant that actual as a percentage of nominal strength dropped from 76 per cent at the end of the first quarter to 63 per cent by the end of the year; serviceability fell from 72 to 66 per cent of nominal level, even though establishment strength rose from 493 to 611 and the actual number of serviceable night fighters from 360 to 405. Given that nearly twice as many bombers were attacking in December 1943, this was a paltry increase, parti- cularly as more and more diversionary raids and problems with electronic guidance meant that the night fighters did not always make mass attacks on the intruders. 118 For the German night-fighter defences 1943 was a year full of unpleasant tactical and technical surprises. These can be encapsulated in terms like H2S, OBOE, and WINDOW; interference with radar and with R/T traffic;119 the pre- cision raids on the Ruhr dams and Dortmund-Ems canal; and the large-scale raids on Wuppertal, Hamburg, Peenem√ºnde, Berlin, and Kassel that caused widespread shock. 120 Already by 1943 Gen. Kammhuber, general of night-fighter forces and general commanding XII Air Corps responsible for day- and night-fighter defence, was trying to improve the night-fighter organization and overcome the weaknesses in his 'Line'
