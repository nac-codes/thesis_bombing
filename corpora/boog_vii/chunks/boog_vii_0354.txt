reasons for the refusal, such as overtaxing of the electronic industm and of manpower reserves. Göring later referred to this in a meeting with his new chief of general staff, Günther Korten, and the senior officers responsible for fighters and flak. 125 There had, he said, been doubts 'whether the expan. sion of night fighting with ground controllers, with all the vast demands that made on men and materials ... was feasible in Germany at all'. Moreover, the 121 Trenkle, Funkmeßverfahren, 12, describes the system thus: the radar transmitted 'on. frequency fI a modulated signal that is picked up by an [airborne] transmitter-receiver and immediately [i.e. instantaneously] returned at a frequency f2. Measuring the pulse timing (phase difference) between the transmitted and returned modulation thus provides the range, and a direction-finding plot the bearing, of the aircraft fitted with the transmitter-receiver.' 122 MGFA, Sammlung Grabmann, R 682(note by Kammhuber, 24 May 1955); Aders, Night Fighter Force, 61; MGFA, Kammhuber-Völker interview, 30 Oct. 1968; Toliver and Constable 123 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 493. 124 See Germany and the Second World War, vi. 541.

There were also not enough airfields in Reich territory. It can best be gauged what a fourfold increase in the night-fighter defences would have meant by looking at the personnel and equipment strengths for XII Air Corps on 31 August 1943.126 At this time the Reich air defence system had around 150 active night-fighter boxes, 20 of them on the eastern front and in Romania and Italy, wh
