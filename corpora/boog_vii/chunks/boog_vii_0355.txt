ment strengths for XII Air Corps on 31 August 1943.126 At this time the Reich air defence system had around 150 active night-fighter boxes, 20 of them on the eastern front and in Romania and Italy, which came under Kammhuber's command as general of night fighters but not as general commanding XII Air Corps. A further 102 were planned for north-eastern, central, and southern Germany, Austria, Italy, Romania, the Rhône valley, and along the Channel coast (see back endpaper). Fach of the night-fighter ground stations was run by a signals company numbering more than 100, and equipped with four heavy FREYA and GIANT WÜRZBURG radars. Controlling the number of night fighters now being called for would have needed 2,720 radars instead of 680, and 68,000-80,000 signals personnel instead of 17,000-20,000. Bearing in mind that up to the end of 1943 only 750 FREYAS and 850 GIANT WÜRZBURGS had been delivered to signals and fighter-control units, it is easy to calculate how long it would have taken fully to equip the night-fighter control system, in addition to the flak defences (which had priority and during the war set up 1,500 fixed GIANTS). 127 It would quite certainly have been completed too late. The signals troops, for instance, would have had to allocate around a quarter of their total strength, 128 at the expense of the seven air fleets, the air corps, and the air districts. The cost for XII Air Corps would anyway have been exorbitant. Keeping 756 operational aircraft-272 night fighters and 484 day fighters-in the air required on 31 August 1943 (and excluding airfield ground organization and engineering staff) a total of 88,112 persons: 2,352 officers, 681 civil servants, 66,778 NCOs, men, and civilian workers, 16,509 Luftwaffe women auxiliaries, and 1,792 Russian Hiwis. These, however, represented only 85 per cent of the nominal strength of 105,262 persons considered necessary to man around 26 night- fighter, 12 fighter, and four destroyer Gruppen together with two furt
