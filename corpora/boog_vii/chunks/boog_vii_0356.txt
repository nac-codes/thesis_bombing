Goring consequently showed all the more interest in other night-fiph. methods that did not depend on the Kammhuber system. On 27 July Maj. Hans-Joachim ('Hajo') Herrmann, who came from the bomber took to the minister a plan for introducing non-controlled night fighe (i.e. independent of the Kammhuber radar stations) using series-product single-engined fighter aircraft; this was the system that later became know- 'Wild Boar' (Wilde Sau). It had become obvious to him, as an expert worl in the tactical/technical requirements group (IT) of the Luftwaffe operati staff, and in regular contact with the foreign air forces
