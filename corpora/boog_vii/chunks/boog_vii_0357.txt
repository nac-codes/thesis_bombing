Boar' (Wilde Sau). It had become obvious to him, as an expert worl in the tactical/technical requirements group (IT) of the Luftwaffe operati staff, and in regular contact with the foreign air forces department (Ic), the Luftwaffe needed a great many more fighters to cope with the mas British and American bomber numbers. What the situation demanded, believed, was to strengthen the fighter force, not the bomber arm having been a bomber man, he became an advocate for the fighters. His From colleagues saw him as a 'traitor', while the fighter men looked d on the interlo with suspicion even though he was proposing a reduction of the bomber in favour of fighters. He had already, in late 1942, wanted to make up for the Is ow serious lack of aircraft among the night fighters in particular by using single engined fighters. He had himself, in April 1943, tried this out, more or less surreptitiously and against Kammhuber's wishes; and showed great courage : doing so, for it meant he was flying among his own exploding flak, and rh e in Führer's orders were that the flak must as a general rule never hold its6 cs fire With Galland's support, he was allowed to carry on with his experiment. H. explained to Göring that having the night fighters spread out in a line, 1943 that assive e, each tied strictly to the ground control of its Kammhuber box, was suitable only fo dealing with single, isolated intruders but not with a bomber stream, since i did not allow a defensive strike to be concentrated; limiting the night fighters opportunity for combat meant that only small numbers could be shot down The bomber streams flying through the defensive line were far too con centrated, and passed through too fast. What he suggested, therefore, was match the enemy's concentration with a defensive concentration of one' own, and in addition to the 'Himmelbett' system currently in use to let single engined fighters fly in large numbers to attack enemy aircraft caught in searchlights in the flak z
