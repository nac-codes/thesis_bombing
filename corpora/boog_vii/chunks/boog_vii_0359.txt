cial flares up above the clouds to act as a beacon; the problem of flying long distances to the target could be solved with external auxiliary tanks. The drawback of 'Wild Boar' was that it would work above the target only when this had already been bombed and set alight; it could not prevent the bombing itself, because to be successful the fighter pilots needed this to be able to see.130 Jeschonnek, head of the Luftwaffe general staff, backed Hermann's proposal, but pointed out that because of the shortage of machines the single- engined night-fighter pilots would have to rely on using day-fighter aircraft: that is to say, the pilots would have to be stationed on the airfields of various day-fighter units, and use those aircraft for night operations. They were known as Aufsitzer, or 'roosting' groups. Göring immediately ordered the forming of Hermann's single-engined night-fighter Geschwader; on 26 September Hermann received the order to raise three further 'Wild Boar' Geschwader (300, 301, and 302) and an illumination group, controlled by Hermann as commander of 30 Fighter Division and placed directly under Luftwaffe Commander Centre and not the general commanding XII Air Corps-a sign of the great importance being attached to the new night-fighting method.131 During the night of 3/4 July the 'Wild Boar' method was used for the first time, and successfully, against a large raid on Cologne and Mülheim in the Ruhr, when the armament of the FW 190 proved its worth against heavy bombers. Out of 30 bombers shot down, 'Wild Boar', using only 12 aircraft, accounted on its own for 16 of them, and attacks were made on 17 others.132 Hitler now called for a substantial strengthening of home air defence in the west, to which, as Milch proposed as well, half of each of two months' 130 Herrmann, Bewegtes Leben, 238-59, 264-5, 274; Aders, Night Fighter Force, 61-3, 97-9; Price, Instruments of Darkness, 145-7; Reuter, Funkmeß, 120-1, Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476,
