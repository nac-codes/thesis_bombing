The shadower, fighters, and ground stations were all on the same R/T frequency. Until such time as the recognition problem was solved by the DIENE-W IFF device still under development, there would need to be a ban on shooting at twin-engined aircraft (the category to which most of the night fighters belonged). The operations by Hermann's night fighters showed that even single-engined aircraft could be used at night without being controlled from the ground. Further night-fighter forces were to be called in, from boxes the enemy was not flying through, to hunt over the target area; the flak bursts would be limited to a certain altitude; parachute flare shells would be fired above the target to help the fighters find the bombers; and infrared SPANNER devices would be used to detect the exhaust flames from the engines of enemy aircraft. Taken together with the Hermann night-fighter Geschwader, which by October 1943 was still at much not more than Gruppe strength, these measures would make it possible to put up 200-300 fighters each night, about three times more than previously. Günthner set out the pros and cons of the previous 'Himmelbett', box- bound night-fighter system, of the new pursuit system (subsequently called (Tame Boar', Zahme Sau), of the single-engined 'Wild Boa
