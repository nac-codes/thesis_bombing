The technical means for doing this lay, he said, in the radar gen the firm was developing. He wanted these developments pressed ahead with a priority, with a concentration on test series. The equipment on which the new tactic would depend was thus still far from ready for use. The item involved included (a) the LICHTENSTEIN SN2 AI (airborne interception) n) radar which could not be jammed by the half-wave aluminium strips of the British WINDOW.
