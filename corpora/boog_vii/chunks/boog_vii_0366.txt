display for fitting the LICHTENSTEIN B/C wide-angle radar into a single-engined aircraft like the FW 100; (d) the BIENE-W device to solve the IFF problem between night fighters and between fighters and flak during pursuit operations over wide areas; (e) the PAUKE-A, a combination of the SN2 and BC(CI) LICHTENSTEINS that gave good close-up definition at distances of 150-200 m with accurate ranging, had an electronic gunsight display suitable for blind attacks on enemy bombers, and could be switched to alternative frequencies while in flight to avoid enemy jamming; all gears were to be enabled in this way by providing wideband antennas and wideband antenna switches. Delivery of the first two of these had already begun, and it was hoped to be able to supply or demonstrate the first CRT display unit by I August, 30 BIENE devices by October, and the first PAUKE-A by the end of the year. On 2 August Telefunken replied that 33 of the pre-series SN2s would be delivered by 15 August, with supplies of the main series then slowly increasing from October 1943 with 100 a month. Out of the order for 500 of the BC(CI) wide-angle antennas, 350 would be delivered by November. It would be impossible to provide the CRT display on schedule, and BIENE development had only just started. Delivery by October was very doubtful-and still in 1944 the flak gun-laying radar had not been fitted with IFF.141 The first PAUKE-A would probably not be ready until the end of 1943. Spot-frequency sets were not being manufactured because of objections from Speer's ministry. Moreover, the firm was understaffed to the tune of 49 engineers, 26 techni- cians, 41 commercial staff, 72 mechanics, and 6 labourers needed for coping with all this work; this lack of what is really quite a small number of personnel demonstrates in what a thin soil this new fighter system, deemed so important, was in fact rooted. Matters were much the same with the 'Y' control system for 'Tame Boar'. Expansion of the ground stations
