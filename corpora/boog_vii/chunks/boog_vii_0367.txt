Expansion of the ground stations was by September progressing well; but a shortage of industrial capacity was preventing an equally speedy equipping of the night fighters with the necessary radar sets. Difficulties were still being encountered with the new LICHTENSTEIN SN2 AI radar. 142 Although 300 of these had been delivered by mid-November, only 49 night fighters could be fitted with them, and of these only twelve were operational. The sets were often not ready for use when they arrived at the units, who did not have enough skilled personnel to install them. The close-range definition of only 800 m was insufficient to take the night fighters right up to within firing distance of the bombers; this meant their carrying in addition the old LICHTENSTEIN B/C which, while it was vulnerable to WINDOW, had very good close-range definition and greatly shortened the distance from which the pilot 141 Information sheet on new products, BA-MA RL 2 V/41. 142 Trenkle, Funkme√üverfahren, 108, 110.
