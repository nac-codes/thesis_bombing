NER, with a range of nearly 3 km an covering a 30-degree angle, was yielding such good results that single-engin fighters were increasingly being fitted with it. 144 The new night-fighter tactics were essentially ways of overcoming the h now evident shortcomings of the Kammhuber system, any further expansi ion of which would in any case have called for material and personnel resoure that were simply not available. Given this situation, it was s predictable th Kammhuber would be relieved of his position as general commanding X Fighter Corps and general of night fighters. Understandably, at least fre the human viewpoint, it was hard for him to see his defence system, which had worked well during the early years of the war, being pushed into background by new methods (for even now it was not entirely obsolete) warnings about the threat of the Allied bombers, and his belief that defen the of the German homeland had taken on decisive importance, had proved right, and after the shock of Hamburg were-at least for a while be shared by Göring and Hitler.

Here, however. be contrast to Loßberg's genuinely independent operation, what Kammhuk had in mind was controller-guided flying in formation at night, whichi Loßberg's opinion was an impossibility. The latter was thinking far mora in terms of shadowers-guided by radio beacons, choosing their own cour and skilled in blind flying-who could be drawn from the reservoir of sui ably trained bomber pilots: for Kammhuber thi
