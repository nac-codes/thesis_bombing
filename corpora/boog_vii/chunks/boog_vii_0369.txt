g far mora in terms of shadowers-guided by radio beacons, choosing their own cour and skilled in blind flying-who could be drawn from the reservoir of sui ably trained bomber pilots: for Kammhuber this was a new way of thinking He knew that the technical requirements for converting to 'Tame Boar'-style night fighting in particular were still far from being met.147 This change had merely been a forced response to the bomber stream and to the disruption of the 'Himmelbett' system. Kammhuber's dogged insistence on his system was 143 BA-MA RL 3/57, 3912; Aders, Night Fighter Force, 123. 144 Reich marshal's conference, 25 Sept. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/60, 4 (Loßberg's proposal on installing SPANNER). 145 GLM conference, 30 July 1943, BA-MA RL 3/23, 6668. 147 See Reuter, Funkmeß, 128. 146 Ibid. 6668 ff. 195 not just a matter of his own stubborn mindset; it also had to do with the practicalities as they existed. So it was not simply, as Loßberg thought, a matter of 'keeping his night fighters on hold'. 148 In the situation facing them, Milch and Göring were looking not for 100 per cent perfection but for an immediate effect-not least so as not to have to exacerbate Hitler's impatience any further. Göring consequently made not a few sensational appointments. Because of Kammhuber's reluctance to carry out trials with night fighters over the targets in collaboration with the flak, Göring wanted to make him, as general commanding XII Fighter Corps, subject to Maj. Hermann's instructions, 149 which the latter felt would be a mistake. Nonetheless, Hermann received his far-reaching powers as leader of the first 'Tame Boar' unit and later as commander of 30 (single-engined) Fighter Division, without thorough trials or co-ordination with Kammhuber's XII Fighter Corps. Unusual, too, was Loßberg's appointment as Göring's special representative on the staff of XII Fighter Corps. This had its counterpart in the naming of Lt .- Colonel Peltz to lead the attacks on England as a commanding gener
