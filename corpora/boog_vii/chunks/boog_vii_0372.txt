ges in the lon term. Radio and radar proved, however, to be two-edged weapons, which. infrequently were their own enemy. This 'war of the radar' started in the first week of December 1942, when during an attack on Mannheim a 300-km MANDREL screen was deployed to jam and curtail the range of the FREYA early-warning system, and R/T between ground control and the German night fighters was drowned out b traffic loud noise generated by the RAF's TINSEL device. During the raid on Dieppe on 19 August of that year, 154 the British had managed to get a closer look at the FREYA radar, discovered its operating frequency, and de d developed jam that were already being tested by early September. The MANDREL jamm was circumvented by shifting away from the main jammed frequency, ming ultimately by modifying the FREYA, MAMMUT, and WASSERMANN early-warning , and gears to operate on a lower frequency. Since German night fighters were able to detect aircraft carrying MANDREL, its jamming transmitter was always operated intermittently, for only two minutes at a time with similar intervals which halved its effectiveness. This was also reduced by the fact that only 200 instead of 600, aircraft could be equipped with it. After a short while the operators of the long-range warning radars in any case learned how to 'sea through' the MANDREL screen. The confusion caused among the German night fighters by TINSEL, however, lasted rather longer. Verbal instructions were misunderstood, or made incomprehensible, by the generated noise.
