pose of the device was not clear,159 though it was suspected that it worked in the 8-cm band. The two surviving members of the aircraft's crew refused to say anything about it, and this showed that it was something special. The find was a sensational one in that it overturned the conviction held among German radar scientists that hardly anything useful could be achieved in the centimetre wavebands, and then only at enormous cost-that it would be better to con- centrate on the range between 50 and 240 cm, where current radars were providing most of what was wanted. The substantial echo given by aircraft in the centimetre band was largely unknown-quite simply, no one had so far taken enough notice of these frequencies.160 As a consequence of this con- viction, Telefunken had in late November 1942 closed down its centimetre- wave laboratory. This had been done on the instructions of Gen.
