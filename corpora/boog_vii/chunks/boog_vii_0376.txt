to take a hand in matter. There was furthermore Staatsrat Dr Hans Plendl as Göring's plenipo- tentiary for high-frequency research, who was given charge of the Reich office for high-frequency research set up on 16 July 1943.166 lagged far behind its British counterpart was the suppression in Germany of In 1942 Germany had, in the radar field, only one-tenth of the research capacity available to the British, and it was spread over more than 100 sm institutes. There was now a retrieval campaign to bring back to the labor ories around 1,500 scientists who had been sent to the front. After the middle of 1943 the number of scientists and engineers working on high-frequency research gradually rose to more than 3,000.167 The shortcomings in the cen- timetre-wave area were seized on by Heinrich Himmler, in criticism seen by 163 Reich marshal's conference, 18 Mar. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/60, 5552. 162 161 GLM conference, 20 Aug. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/15, 1969-73; Reuter, Funkmeß, 197-9.

The grounds were that German industry and the military communications agencies were responsible for Germany's inferiority in the high-frequency field, and for the ensuing adverse course of the war. Goring, with good reason, did not pursue this any further. 168 Slowly and with great difficulty (parts of the first captured H2S set were lost during an air raid on Berlin on I March, but could be replaced from another cet captured at the same time), an equipment of this kind was assembled at Telefunken. From more recent comments made by prisoners of war a rough idea was formed of how it worked. Meanwhile Göring scoffed that the British were dropping bombs through
