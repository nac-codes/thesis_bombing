ge some 7,500 of them would have had to be set up around Berlin, and lack of manufacturing capacity made this impossible. The most effective way of dealing with enemy Pathfinders using H2S appeared, however, to be to have them shot down by fighters equipped with homing receivers. However, German thinking on the air war was still 168 Reuter, Funkmeß, 199-200. 169 Reich marshal's conference, 18 Mar. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/60, 5458, 5472, 5545; presentation by Dipl .- Ing.

I.11. Defending German Skies 200 I.II.I. Air Defence in 1943 dominated by an offensive posture, and the BERLIN radar (the German com version of H2S) was initially developed as a priority as a ground observar y navigation, and bomb-sight device for blind bombing. The first of these we into service at the end of January 1944. Compared to H2S, it had been rede in weight (from 235 to 180 kg), size (down to four cabinets), and bulk (fro 0.6 to 0.25 m3); the antenna was smaller, and its rotation increased from 80. 400 rev/min. The lack of faith in centimetric radar as a defensive weapon lasted for a long time, since its suitability for mapping the ground seemed rule it out for the pinpointing of aircraft by the aircraft warning s g service, by the from flak, or by night fighters. It was only when a test on 22 December r 1943 using captured H2S set in combination with a WÜRZBURG yielded a range of 30 k and it was noticed that the centimetre waves produced a strong echo from .. aircraft, that it was fully appreciated that centimetre technology had bes misjudged. When it was found that centimetric radars were difficult to: and realized that with a dwindling bomber force it would be hard to carm.
