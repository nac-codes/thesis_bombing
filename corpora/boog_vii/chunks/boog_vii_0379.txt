fully appreciated that centimetre technology had bes misjudged. When it was found that centimetric radars were difficult to: and realized that with a dwindling bomber force it would be hard to carm. jam an offensive air war for much longer, the military importance of the BERI radar for ground observation, navigation, and bomb-aiming faded from sight and-boosted by the successful test-the idea of using it for defence t wing. As the BERLIN BI, with an nose-mounted antenna covering 70 degrees was adopted for night fighters as an AI radar, and in early February Brand too launched a new programme for changing the whole of German r radar over t the centimetre waveband for location, observation, and jamming. It was hoped to move in three stages from 9-cm and 3-cm down finally to the I-cm wavebar This in turn would call for measurement and test equipment, the building and which would place heavy staffing demands on laboratories. Whether enemy's technological superiority could be held in check depended not the state of scientific knowledge and research, but most of all on hu and material resources. 171 Goebbels's leading article 'Die Uberholung den Vorsprungs' (Overcoming the Lead) in the weekly Das Reich for 30 July 10 was both premature and exaggerated, for even at this date there was still the slightest question of overtaking the enemy in the radar field. As could h deduced from the wreckage of aircraft shot down in February of that year, the British and Americans had already long before gone over to using the 3-cm waveband, with the gears codenamed H2X and MEDDO. As a precaution, in the meantime, a start had been made on developing radar warning and location devices against H2S, given the codenames NAXOS and KORFU; 'Z' (for Zielsuchger√§t, AI search radar) versions of these were produced for night fighters, making it possible to find and attack enemu aircraft that had their H2S set switched on. A 'W' (Warn) ground-based early- warning version could be used by the aircraf
