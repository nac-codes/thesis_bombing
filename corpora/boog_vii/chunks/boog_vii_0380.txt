were produced for night fighters, making it possible to find and attack enemu aircraft that had their H2S set switched on. A 'W' (Warn) ground-based early- warning version could be used by the aircraft warning service. By autumn 1943 a few airborne and ground examples of these were already in service. NAXOS-7 171 Presentation by Brandt, 8 Feb. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/57, 3907-32, esp. 3909, 3912-13, 3930 ff .; Reuter, Funkmeß, 117-18. 201 covered only the 8- to 12-cm band, and was thus ineffective against 3-cm cadars. By the end of the war 1,500 night fighters were fitted with NAXOS-L, allowing H2S aircraft to be located at distances of up to 50 km.172 By early September 1943 there were already 15 radar early-warning stations equipped with KORFU being tested, for instance on Mt Brocken in the Harz mountains, on the Eiffel Tower, and on the Zugspitze in southern Germany; it was capable of picking up H2S transmissions up to 400 km away. In Luftgau ITT the KORFU network fed into a plotting centre in Berlin. Since the British switched their H2S sets on 20 minutes before take-off and kept them on throughout the approach flight, their track could easily be followed by KORFU; even more accurate plotting was possible with the NAXBURG-DF radar, a combination of NAXOS with the dish antenna of the WÜRZBURG that had been devised on their own initiative by the troops operating the equipment. In October 1943, as a result, a special NAXBURG organization was set up in Luftgau VI to protect the Ruhr. 173 It had also been known since the spring of 1043 that using FREYAs with an altered frequency would trigger the IFF beacon of British aircraft at distances of up to 360 km. Since the IFF pulses generated fame-like zigzag peaks on the FREYA screens, this became known as the Flamme technique. It was first employed by 2 Fighter Division stationed at Stade. Because no one had reckoned with the British leaving their IFF permanently switched on, the signals experimental regiment at Köthen had init
