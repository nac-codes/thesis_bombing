as first employed by 2 Fighter Division stationed at Stade. Because no one had reckoned with the British leaving their IFF permanently switched on, the signals experimental regiment at Köthen had initially shown no great interest in it. 174 Development of the British MONICA tail-warning radar (which alerted bombers to a night fighter approaching from the rear) had also been based on the H2S principle. This meant that aircraft using it could be detected by German night fighters equipped with FLENSBURG from as far as 100 km away, whereas MONICA warned bomber crew of night fighters over a range of only 1.000 m, and that only within a 45-degree cone. It was not all that popular with British aircrews, since it also picked up other friendly aircraft in the bomber stream. Moreover, a British BOOZER tail-warning receiver also fell into German hands on I March 1943; this device had the advantage of not transmitting pulses, so that it could not be detected-it reacted passively to indicate the aircraft was in the beam of one of the flak's WÜRZBURG gun-laying radars or was being tracked by a night fighter's LICHTENSTEIN B/C AI set. Although it had been planned to make it standard warning equipment, it found no great use, for technical reasons (it also responded to MONICA, and WÜRZBURG signals were far too numerous). Capturing this gave the German 172 Presentation by Brandt, 8 Feb. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/57, 3919; Trenkle, Funkstörverfahren, 24-43; Reuter, Funkmeß, 116-19, 134, 136; Price, Instruments of Darkness, 175. 173 Presentation by Brandt, 8 Feb. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/57, 3917/1; Price, Instruments of Darkness, 176.
