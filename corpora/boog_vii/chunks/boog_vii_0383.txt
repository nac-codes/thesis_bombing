ll of the German fighter and d fla defences. 180 The principle of using wires or strips of tinfoil or aluminium cut to half rh wavelength of the radar it was desired to jam was known in Germany as w well As early as April 1942 Milch had suggested giving thought to whether 'som kind of wire' or the like might provide protection. A little later the Luftwaffe! chief engineer, Roluf Wilhelm Lucht, found that radar detection of aircraft was already interfered with when a wire was dropped-it did not even need jamming transmitter. Even small leaves of aluminium would suffice. The head of the domestic and foreign armaments department (the GLM's technical intelligence service), Oberstingenieur Schwencke, had in August 1942 repor- ted British attempts to jam the FREYA radar with strips of tinfoil suspended 175 On MONICA see also PRO, AIR 14/1826; Harris, Despatch, 135; Webster and Frankland Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 94 and iv. 11-13; Price, Instruments of Darkness, 139-40; GLM conference 27 Mar. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/19, 4736 ff. 176 GLM conference, 16 July 1943, BA-MA RL 3/22, 6318. 177 Jones, Most Secret War, 233-49.

In September there were reports of British bombers jamming the German night fighters' LICHTENSTEIN radar by scattering fine aluminium dust. The most important German radars could thus be put out of action. The Luftwaffe, too, carried out tests with tinfoil strips, which it called DÜPPEL after the Düppel estate near Berlin where these tests took place. Gen. Martini, the Luftwaffe's head of signals communications, took pains to ensure the utmost secrecy; tests were to be carried out only over the
