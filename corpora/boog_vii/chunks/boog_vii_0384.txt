ppel estate near Berlin where these tests took place. Gen. Martini, the Luftwaffe's head of signals communications, took pains to ensure the utmost secrecy; tests were to be carried out only over the Baltic, so that 'the objects' would be immediately destroyed by the sea water. In January 1943 he ordered that all such experiments on jamming the enemy's radar should be halted for the time being, since the same might be done to German radars and there was no countermeasure. He was instructed by Göring to lock all documents, even chose on tests he had done himself, away in a safe, so that nothing should be known of them until such time as the German bomber force had been built up again and DÜPPEL could be used in a renewed bombing offensive on Britain. Although Martini did make preparations, involving supplementary equipment and switching to alternative frequencies, to cope with any British jamming of his radar, it would seem that the excessive secrecy did not exactly help pro- mote the development of countermeasures. 181 On the morning of 25 July 1943, after the raid on Hamburg during which the RAF used its WINDOW aluminium strips for the first time, Luftwaffe Col. Eckhard Christian, personal general staff officer to the head of the Wehrmacht operations staff (later to become Luftwaffe head of operations and head of the Luftwaffe operations staff), was obliged to report to Hitler that 'during the past night the enemy has now used the means that we have long feared. He scattered hundreds of thousands of small leaves of tinfoil, as a result of which all our radars, short of FREYA, were jammed; this also led to the relatively poor score of victories by our night fighters.'182 At a single stroke, the night fighters' LICHTENSTEIN B/C AI sets, together with the position-plotting and gun-laying radars of the fighter control and flak-that is to say, the entire electronic basis of the night defences apart from FREYA and Y, which worked on different frequencies-had been blinded
