g and gun-laying radars of the fighter control and flak-that is to say, the entire electronic basis of the night defences apart from FREYA and Y, which worked on different frequencies-had been blinded. All that could be seen at first on the radar screens was clouds or a haze, generated by the myriad weak echoes from the aluminium strips; hiding somewhere behind all this were the bombers-or perhaps not, since WINDOW scattered from just a few aircraft could also create the impression of quite large formations. The biggest problem now faced by the German air defence was 'de- Düppeling' its radar systems-as one might say, 'cleaning the window so as 181 GLM conferences, 24 Apr. and 5 May 1942, BA-MA, RL 3/13, 398, 351; 12 June 1942, ibid., RL 3/12, 1094; 20 Aug. 1942, ibid., RL 3/15, 1868; I Sept. and 27 Oct. 1942, ibid., RL 3/16, 2229, 2952-3; 27 Nov. 1942, ibid., RL 3/34, 2575-6; 5 Jan. 1943, ibid., RL 3/18, 3990; Reich marshal's conference, 14 Oct. 1942, ibid., RL 3/60, 5324 ff .; Jones, Most Secret War, 299; Germany and the Second World War, vi. 617-18. 182 Hitlers Lagebesprechungen, 289-90 (midday, 25 July 1943).

On the day after the Hamburg raid, at a meeting of experts chaire by Gen. Martini, there was a proposal to make use of the Doppler effe (which is what causes the change in pitch of the sound of a passing locomos as it approaches and recedes) to overcome the interference: this would all. tive echoes from the fast-moving bombers to be distinguished from those for the clouds of aluminium strips drifting slowly down behind them. A skin operator would then be able to 'filter out' the aircraft from the WIN cloud on the screen by noting the different signals reflected by the bomb The 'add-on' developed for the WÜRZBURG radars was known as WÜRZI mber Plendl was given the job of speeding up the whole of radar research produc
