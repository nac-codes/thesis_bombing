by noting the different signals reflected by the bomb The 'add-on' developed for the WÜRZBURG radars was known as WÜRZI mber Plendl was given the job of speeding up the whole of radar research production, including the introduction of new equipment among those it. By the end of August 56 of the Reich air defence's 511 WÜRZBURG sets h been fitted with WÜRZLAUS. A further Doppler device, NURNBERG I, which made use of the propeller echo, was simpler to operate but proved less effective (though by December 1943 1,500 of these had already been produced) These measures were, however, far from restoring the original capability ).182 the warning radar-on the contrary, WÜRZLAUS cut the WÜRZBURG's rane y of ange. There were also problems when, for instance, the clouds of WIND were dense, and in high winds. It was believed that these could be quick- overcome, but in September the 'Himmelbett' system was, for all practic purposes, crippled. The flak, which unlike the night fighters could not simply adopt t an alternative tactic, was especially badly hit, since the WÜRZLAUS solutio ion, imperfect as that already was, could not be applied to all ground radar gear since there were too many versions of them. 184 Gen. Kammhuber's statemer on 8 October 1943 that the WINDOW problem had been 100 per-cent solved with the GIANT WÜRZBURGs but not yet with the flak's radars was undoubtedly premature, 185 since two months later Dr Karl Rottgardt of Telefunken saying that a change to the 10-cm waveband was unavoidable if the inter ence was to be really overcome. Experience with the NAXOS-Z homing receiver, which worked at the frequency of the British H2S, pointed in this direction. In March 1944 the flak test centre at Karlshagen was likewise seeing the answer to the problem in a switch to centimetric radars. At the end of 1942 two Ju 88 night fighters and one Me 110 were operational with NAXOS-Z; it had been fitted to a further four aircraft, and another ten had been earmarked for it. 186
