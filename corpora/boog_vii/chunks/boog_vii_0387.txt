At the end of 1942 two Ju 88 night fighters and one Me 110 were operational with NAXOS-Z; it had been fitted to a further four aircraft, and another ten had been earmarked for it. 186 During the war some 700 night fighters saw action equipped with 183 Reuter, Funkmeß, 124-30; Price, Instruments of Darkness, 173-4; Trenkle, Funkmeßverfahren. 41-2; Koch, Flak, 349-50. 184 Aders, Night Fighter Force, 122; meeting on night fighters, 31 Aug. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/30. 172 ff .; Dr Rottgardt at GLM meeting, 14 Dec. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/59, 4939-40; Grabmann 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 535 ff. 185 Reich marshal's conference, 8 Oct. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/60, 5801. 186 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 537.

The obvious way to make up for the weaknesses of the ground-based defences was to give priority to expanding and using the two new night-fighter methods, since these were to a very large extent independent of the ground cadar system-the great advantage they enjoyed over the flak. The measures quickly decided on very soon met with their first successes. When the RAF sided Peenemünde and made a feint attack on Berlin on the night of 17/18 August, 40 bombers were shot down, mostly by single- and twin-engined wild Boar' fighters. The figure might have been higher if the officers con- trolling the fighters, who had not been told of the significance of Peenemünde, and most of whom had up to then been employed only locally in the 'Him- melbett' system, had not let themselves be fooled. More than 148 night fighters and 55 single-engined 'Wild Boar' fighters had been sent hundreds of kilometres away from their bases to assemble over Berlin; there, the flak-still unaccustomed to working together with 'Wild Boar' fighters, and acting on mistaken orders from the head of the Luftwaffe general staff-opened a fur
