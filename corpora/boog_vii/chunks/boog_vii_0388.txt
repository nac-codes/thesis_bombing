bases to assemble over Berlin; there, the flak-still unaccustomed to working together with 'Wild Boar' fighters, and acting on mistaken orders from the head of the Luftwaffe general staff-opened a furi- ous fire on them even though they were making recognition signals. In spite of being redirected too late to Peenem체nde, the bombers' real target, 30 fighters were there able to shoot down 24 enemy aircraft. Twelve night fighters were lost, and many damaged. By no means a dazzling success, it was still a good start, even if with negative side-effects where the flak was concerned. Milch threatened to 'sort out' those responsible by having them court-martialled and shot, and complained, 'the Luftwaffe is being run by the flak people, and not by the Luftwaffe'. He described the behaviour of the flak over Berlin as 'unbelievable', and wanted to see better co-ordination in future. 188 Nothing provided better proof of the confusion in the senior command of the Luftwaffe due to varying reports on the situation in the air, and with regard to the new operational methods that had still to be mastered. Twin-engined night fighters had used over Peenem체nde the Schr채ge Musik technique that had been experimented with since May 1943. This used 20-mm twin cannon mounted in the cockpit or fuselage and pointing diagonally upwards at a 70-degree angle. Later complemented with a radar gunsight, these made it possible to creep up below an enemy bomber, without any great need for manoeuvring and often unobserved, and shoot at it from a relatively safe position underneath. 189 187 Aders, Night Fighter Force, 252. 188 Middlebrook, Peenem체nde Raid, 214 ff .; GLM conference, 20 Aug. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/24, 7068 ff .; Herrmann, Bewegtes Leben, 277; Price, Instruments of Darkness, 168-9. 189 Middlebrook and Everitt, Bomber Command War Diaries, 424; Kens and Nowarra, Die deutschen Flugzeuge, 643-4; Aders, Night Fighter Force, 67-8, 82.
