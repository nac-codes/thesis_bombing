According to Piekalkiewicz, Air War, 301, this technique can be traced back to the aircraft designer Gerhard Fieseler, who used it in 1916 during the Macedonian campaign. It was developed afresh in the Second World War by Capt. Rudolf Schoenert, Lt .- Col. von Loßberg and Sgt. Paul Mahle, after the method had been brought to the notice of the Reich air ministry in 1938, with no result, by the former Lt. Fritz Thiede. See also p. 43.  I.II.

Air Defence in 1943 Things went better during action against Bomber Command's night raid Berlin on 23/4 August, when it was believed that 76 bombers-10 per cent the attacking force-had been shot down; in reality the score was only aircraft, or around 8 per cent. 190 The Luftwaffe command began to feel cautious optimism. Göring counted 'Berlin Night' as a signal victory for nl 56 defences, most of all because it brought about, not only among the fight force but in the population as well, an upsurge in mood the public-m effect of which, given his battered prestige with Hitler and the Party, he gres prized. 191 Milch now felt 'the basis [was] now in place ... for attacking th orale enemy with our fighters by day and night', so that he would indeed have abandon 'the destruction of our arms production' and the associated por. the lation centres. For him, the homeland now ranked higher in importance the front. 192 The 'Tame Boar' pursuit method of night fighting was first used on a ma scale during the British raid on Nuremberg on 27/8 August. With only 12 kill out of the 33 aircraft downed during the night-that is, 4.9 per cent of the to bomber force-the result was not all that convincing. It had revealed technical and tactical weakness of the method. It proved impossible, using 'Y' system, to insert a night fighter into the bomber stream in such a way the the pilot kne
