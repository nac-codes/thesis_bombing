that convincing. It had revealed technical and tactical weakness of the method. It proved impossible, using 'Y' system, to insert a night fighter into the bomber stream in such a way the the pilot knew whereabouts in it he was, since the commentary gave only the vanguard of the stream and its altitude. It then came down once again to visual contact, with all its limitations at night, since the LICHTENSTEIN B/C or CI AT radars were affected by WINDOW. A skilled airborne radar operator coul however, since his aircraft was closing on a bomber comparatively slowly fro behind, still use these radars to separate the clouds of WINDOW coming toward uld, from ajor him rapidly from the bombers that were appearing relatively stationary his screen. The high-performance and long-range He 219 equipped the wide-angle LICHTENSTEIN SN2, which formed part of Loßberg y on with g and Günthner's ideal scenario, were still not available. A few of them, in a for E usable in normal squadron service, came into service only in the autumn, 1, and were initially a disappointment because of inadequate range. It was s easy, therefore, to lose sight of the bomber stream. There were also sizeable gaps in the Y-system's reporting and fighter-control organization; in some cases there were still no ground stations, while in others fighter units were still lacking the airborne equipment. The technical conditions for running 'Tame Boar' were still not fully in place. 193 190 Herrmann, Bewegtes Leben, 279-307; Middlebrook and Everitt, Bomber Command War Diaries, 425; Price, Instruments of Darkness, 170-1. 191 Reich marshal's conference, 27 Aug. 1943, MGFA, Sammlung Grabmann, R 41. 192 GLM conference on night fighters, 31 Aug. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/30, 263-81. 193 The first LICHTENSTEIN SN2 was installed in a Ju 188 shadower aircraft on 30 July 1943.
