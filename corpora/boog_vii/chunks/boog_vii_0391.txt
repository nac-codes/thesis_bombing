188 shadower aircraft on 30 July 1943. Bu February 1944 the first 200 such sets had been manufactured, and by May 1,000 had been made Until then, all night fighters were fitted with SN2s or NAXOS-Zs.

See also p. 193. 207 Nonetheless, while as an average for the year in 1942 only 65 per cent of contacts with the enemy had resulted in a kill, in August 1943 this had risen to more than 76 per cent. In total, the night-fighter force believed that while the previous monthly average for 1943 had been 135 aircraft shot down, in August could lay claim to 239, 48 of them using the conventional 'Himmelbett' technique and 182 with the 'Wild' and 'Tame Boar' methods, which had thus proved their immediate effectiveness. Of these kills 102 had been during the bombers' approach, and 128 during their return flight (that is, after they had dropped their bombs). The increased successes were, to start with, accom- panied by greater losses resulting from using the new tactics.194 The activity and experience report from the headquarters of XII Fighter Corps for August 1943,195 which gave a good overall picture of how matters stood with the night-fighter force at that time, also said that during that month 208 aircraft had spent more than 48 hours undergoing repairs. New aircraft were not being supplied in sufficient numbers: instead of its nominal strength of 1,102 night fighters, the corps had only 583, or 53 per cent of establishment. The day fighters were reported to be at 79 per cent of nominal strength. The actual strength of night fighters still appeared to be allocated entirely to the (Himmelbett' system with its 170 night-fighter boxes, for which the modest number of 247 operational twin-engined fighters would suffice. The technical equipment of the aircraft, the report said, still left much to be desired. Only 49 per cent of nominal, 85 per cent
