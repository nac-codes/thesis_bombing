nburg on 22/3 September so as to draw attention away from the main raid on Hanover; it then became possible ssible for the first time, on Â·8/19 November, to launch two simultaneous major raids each with a large number of bombers on Berlin and Mannheim/Ludwigshafen, in order to split up the German night-fighter force. 198 Most of all, the RAF tried to conceal the eme target for as long as possible by changing course several times during the approach flight. It also tried to circumvent the German radar and night-fighter stations by making wide detours out over the North Sea and Baltic, and by combining bombing and mine-laying operations (since the low altitudes usual during mine-laying offered scant opportunities for night-fighter attacks). When returning to base, flying at low altitude was used to try to avoid being picked up by German radar. Very often the bombers would dive quickly down to a low altitude shortly before bomb-release so as to fly through the flak zone ot maximum speed and at the same time, by throttling-back or closing down the engines, avoid being tracked by sound-detectors. More and more the British used long-range night fighters, which by the end of the year were flying as far as Berlin and engaging the German fighters in the air and as they were landing and taking off at their bases. During the raid on Kassel on 22/3 October the German night fighters' R/T traffic was interfered with for the first time; their pilots were thrown into confusion by counterfeit orders and false instructions given in German, and were no longer able to make concerted attacks. 199 The time the bombers spent over the target was shortened by spacing the formations at even closer intervals, leaving the German night fighters less time to make their attacks. The RAF made increasing use of 'back- to-front' weather conditions, so as to guarantee the bombers good visibility for taking off and landing and bad weather over Germany where, as with the Berlin raid on 22/3 November, t
