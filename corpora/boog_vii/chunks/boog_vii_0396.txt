ng use of 'back- to-front' weather conditions, so as to guarantee the bombers good visibility for taking off and landing and bad weather over Germany where, as with the Berlin raid on 22/3 November, this made it impossible for the night fighters to operate. This preference for bad-weather conditions-which, for the attackers equipped with H2S and OBOE, impervious to the weather, were less of a handicap than they were for the fighters with their still largely jammed radars-gave the night-fighter defence in the closing months of 1943 hardly any opportunity to concentrate its forces on heavily raided areas and inflict decisive losses on the RAF. All hopes were consequently pinned on an adequate supply of the jamming-proof LICHTENSTEIN SN2 AI sets for the twin- engined fighters and NEPTUN V for the single-engined ones. The 'Wild Boar' procedure, which in the summer still relied largely on pilots drawn from the bomber arm, lost more and more of its effectiveness in the poor weather conditions and with the expansion of its organization; this had been foreseen, since the intake of younger pilots was of lower quality and for the most part not 198 Middlebrook and Everitt, Bomber Command War Diaries, 432, 452-3. on Bomber Com- mand's feinting tactics see Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 202-4. 199 Middlebrook and Everitt, Bomber Command War Diaries, 441; Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, iv. 23, n. 3.
