range night fighting was doomed to ure. It was, in any case, hoped that improving the aircraft warning sem o fail- would make it possible to defeat the RAF's spoof raids.201 Despite a lack of equipment, pursuit night fighting using the 'Y' system also had some success in the second half of 1943, especially when bad weather worked against 'Wild Boar'. The night-fighter force was still not beaten. A 1943 turned into 1944 matters were, with the help of new airborne and ground radars, and thanks to a reorganized aircraft reporting system and a new order of battle for the homeland air defence, on the mend. The Damocles' sword hanging over it was the shortage of personnel and industrial capacity, together with the enemy's shift to even higher centimetre-wave frequencies that Brand had warned of.

The fighter defence force thus formed a sym- biotic whole in which, because of the insufficient numbers of aircraft being produced, the individual parts had to help each other out depending on where the main load was falling at any given time. The airspace of immediate importance for air defence of the homeland was clearly that of Air Fleet 3's forward area i
