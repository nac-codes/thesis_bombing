elp each other out depending on where the main load was falling at any given time. The airspace of immediate importance for air defence of the homeland was clearly that of Air Fleet 3's forward area in the west. The fighter strength there up to the autumn of 1943 averaged 350 day fighters and around 50 destroyers, with a serviceability level of between 66 and 85 per cent for the former and 50 per cent for the latter. A Gruppe of Ju 88C-6 destroyers were available to Luftwaffe Commander Atlantic, Lt .- General Ulrich Keßler, for long-range action against the RAF's U-boat-killer aircraft out over the Atlantic; they proved inferior to the Mosquito long-range fighters.203 The staff of Col. Max-Josef Ibel, Senior Fighter Commander West, with its fighter commanders 2, 3, 4, and South, was on 15 October converted i ed into the General Command II Fighter Corps under Maj .- General Werner Junck, together with 4 and 5 Fighter Divisions and Gen. Keßler's destroyers. The main units under this command were the two fighter Geschwader 2 and 26,204 a Gruppe of JG 27 and latterly a further two Gruppen of NJG 4, together with a few training units. The units were far too under strength for the size of the area to be covered, especially in view of their low serviceability level. This exemplified the shortage both of aircraft-in August 1943 total losses of day and night fighters were running at 50 and 73.5 per cent respectively of monthly production205-and of trained aircrew, the increase in the nominal strength of Staffeln without a corresponding strengthening of the units' technical capacity, and the decentralized dispersion of units in the face of increasing Allied raids on their airfields. Towards the end of 1943 the strength of II Fighter Corps fell to 237 day fighters and 52 night fighters, of which only 143 and 43 respectively were serviceable. Luftwaffe Commander Atlantic had around 40 serviceable fighters and destroyers.206 202 Presentation by Brandt, 8 Feb. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/57
