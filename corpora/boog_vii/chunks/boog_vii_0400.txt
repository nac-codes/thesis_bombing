In the west, the average losses suffer by the four-engined bombers was only 2.4 per cent. The German fighter firepower was too weak to make an impression on the structural solidity of +1 large bombers, and dropping bombs down among their formations proved fruitless as it had over Germany. The same was true of using the 210- das rockets. 207 Fighter operations over the Reich were relatively more successf than those in the west. There on the Channel coast, of course, the fight defences suffered from the short distance the enemy needed to fly, which bo made diversionary raids easy and gave the German fighters no time to gain necessary altitude. This lack of time in which to react, the dispersion of the fighter units along the periphery, and the inadequate radar and communi the tion equip
