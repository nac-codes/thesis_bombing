If they make bombing raids on German cities for two or three days, that's bad, but it's not fatal.210 His 'imminent danger in the west' order of 6 December 1943 was in line with this. 211 For fending off an invasion, Luftwaffe units in the west were to be strengthened with units from Luftwaffe Commander Centre, but only once a landing had actually started. When that happened, the Reich was to be largely stripped of its air defences, on the utopian assumption that the enemy would chen concentrate entirely on the landing and cease to make any bombing raids on Germany. Instead of providing air defence, therefore, the fighters were to be employed offensively in support of the ground troops; which would nat- urally include combat with the enemy strike aircraft in the landing area. Here we see once again (in this instance, also imposed by the shortage of aircraft) the priority given to offensive co-operation with the army over air defence; this uras a dilemma that kept recurring later, with the problem always solved in the came way. All that the leaders of units were required to do up to the time of an invasion was to familiarize themselves with likely operational and diversion oirfields in northern France. The ground organization was to be prepared appropriately. It was thinking in terms of pure theory to believe it would be possible in this way-despite the enemy's predictable superiority in the air-to make a decisive riposte from the air in the first hours of an invasi
