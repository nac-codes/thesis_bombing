nking in terms of pure theory to believe it would be possible in this way-despite the enemy's predictable superiority in the air-to make a decisive riposte from the air in the first hours of an invasion. Ten fighter Geschwader, that is, almost the whole of the Reich air defence force, were to be transferred entirely or to a major extent. To this end 3 Fighter Division in the Holland/Belgium area was to be placed immediately under Air Fleet 3, and thus removed from the central air-defence area controlled by Luftwaffe Commander Centre. If there were landings in Holland and on the Channel coast, I Fighter Corps (the successor to XII Air Corps) was also to be allotted to Air Fleet 3. It was thus planned that the organization of Reich air defence, which was on the point of being consolidated under Air Fleet Reich,212 would be dismantled again in favour of defending ground. Further fighter forces were, however, nowhere to be found. On 31 January 1943 there were on the southern front 219 fighter aircraft, 49 destroyers, and 15 night fighters, of which only 123, 24, and ten respectively were serviceable. These were far too few to cover a front stretching across North Africa, Tunis, Sicily, the Balkans, and Greece and Crete; and there the situation was becoming ever more fraught. On 13 May Army Group Africa surrendered at Tunis. For the Luftwaffe, the end of the African campaign was a disaster. Almost 40 per cent of the 3,194 Me 109 fighters produced between November 1942 and the end of April 1943 had been sent to the southern front, where most of them were lost. In April alone 247 fighters had to be written off 210 GLM conference, 28 Oct. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/61, 6087. 211 Reichsmarschall des Großdeutschen Reiches und Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe No. 8947/43 g.Kdos.
