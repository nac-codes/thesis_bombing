tion had been further reduced by the air raids. The situation where fighters were concerned should have made it plain to those in charge that, with the enemy's air superiority on the land fronts seemingly irreversible, the need to concentrate everything on the defence of the Reich was paramount. The fact that fighter losses of all kinds, which had been suffered since the beginning of the war, reached more than 50 per cent during the year 1943 alone makes it clear that the defensive air war had only now begun in earnest.222 As the widely scattered disposition of the fighter forces demonstrates, this state of affairs was only fleetingly understood by the Luftwaffe leadership.223 219 LwFüSt Ic (Rob.)
