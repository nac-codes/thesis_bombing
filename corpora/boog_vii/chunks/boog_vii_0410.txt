Only barrage-fire batteries shrank in numbers, from 96 to 41, after it was felt that putting up a barrage in bad weather and against high-flying bombers was wasting ammunition with very little hope of hitting anything, and troops needed to be freed to form new flak batteries. The increase in heavy batteries came through raising new ones and withdrawing 58 from the eastern Luftgaue. Taken overall, the heavy flak forces defending the Reich had more than doubled within a year; some of the medium and light flak, while increasing by around 170 batteries, switched from mobile to fixed operation since there were hardly any low-level attacks demanding a rapid shift of focus. The number of searchlight batteries rose considerably to support the 'Wild Boar' fighters, especially when WINDOW began to be used. The number of smokescreen companies deployed to conceal targets from view increased, as did that of barrage-balloon batteries (though the latter only slightly); barrage-fire batteries were drastically cut, from 209 to 31.225 A not inconsiderable role in the air defence of Germany was also played by the flak forces set up by the navy to protect its bases on the North Sea and Baltic. These were, however, reduced as 1943 went on and some of them had to be transferred to other fronts, from 162 to 144 heavy, and 66 to 58 light flak batteries, and from 51 to 34 searchlight batteries. Smokescreen companies, in contrast, were boosted fro I from nil to nine. 226 Also important for defence of German airspace was flak in Air Fleet 3's forward area in the west. Given the expanse of the area to be covered here, it was strengthened only insignificantly in 1943 from 185 to 223 heavy, and from 2
