of the eastern front. By the end of the year these had, because of the continuing fighting in the south of the eastern front, been increased by ro and 17 per cent respectively. The bulk of the flak forces in the east were divided into two flak corps, I with Air Fleet 4 and II with Air Fleet 6, each with three flak divisions, plus two independent divisions and a fak group Ostland with Air Fleet 1; they were used mainly in ground battles against Russian armour, though also to defend the airspace above the army's troops. The effective strengthening of the flak forces in the east, by only 91 heavy and 74 medium and light flak batteries together with 18 searchlight and four balloon barrage batteries, hides the much higher numbers actually supplied, since at Stalingrad alone 31 flak batteries had been lost. The 9th Flak Division newly formed in the Kuban bridgehead in February 1943 after the original 9th had been wiped out did indeed, between 8 April and 10 May, bring down 265 aircraft and destroy 189 tanks; but over the same period it lost 182 of its 88-mm guns and 547 medium and light pieces, 181 searchlights, 36 fire-control gears, 16 radars, and 5,715 troops (3,949 missing, 456 killed, and I,310 wounded). This proves not only that using flak in the army's operations on the ground was a much tougher business than defending the Reich's skies, but also that a great deal more effort in replacing personnel and supplies was needed to achieve the increases in strength that have been mentioned.236 The two American raids on Norwegian industrial sites at Rjukan (heavy water) and Knaben (molybdenum) on 16 November 1943, and two days later on the aircraft repair works at Oslo-Kjeller, again made clear not only the threat from the air on the northern flank (where Allied landings were, besides, constantly a fear) but also how effective flak was given good conditions.
