43 the share more than 3,200 flak batteries out of a total 4,500, and in early I to 3,463 batteries of all calibres; this at a time when the Luftwaffe held y Decemb batteries of all kinds and calibres, of which 4,395 were fully the 4,78g 232 partly so. During 1943 the number of heavy flak batteries grew from operational and to 2,236; of medium and light batteries from 1,253 to 1,586; and of searchliok batteries from 363 to 490. Over the same period the number of guns in a heo- 1 1,578 battery increased to six, eight, and often even more. Bearing in mind that 1040 was a year of major setbacks, with severe losses of men and matériel on the land fronts in particular, the growth in flak forces by 658 heavy and medium/light batteries and 127 searchlight batteries and other units refle the greater efforts made in pouring men and materials into the flak arm. Yeto 333 the whole of the eastern front, for instance, this amounted to only 25 per cent of the heavy and 50 per cent of the medium/light flak employed in defendin the Reich.239 It was not enough to overcome the ever-growing masses of Soviet armour. Yet as the British field-marshal Sir Harold Alexander once said, the German 88-mm flak gun was a 'formidable' weapon against tanks.240 Besides being man-intensive, the flak artillery also made great demande on matériel. In November 1943 the Luftwaffe personnel numbered around 3 million, of which some 2.1m. were troops, with 900,000 civilians and auxiliaries. The flak artillery, always the arm of the Luftwaffe with the greater 237 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', 640; Freeman, Mighty Eighth War Diary, 138-9; id., Might Eighth, 100-1; Jones, Most Secret War, 306-9; Hinsley, British Intelligence, iii/1. 278-81. 238 Figures arrived at from Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 42, 542, 641 239 BA-MA RL 2 III/1113 and 1163; Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', ibid.
