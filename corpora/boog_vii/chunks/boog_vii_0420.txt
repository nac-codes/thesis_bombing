Flak units on the land fronts were sent the younger, more able- bodied age-groups; older men or those no longer fully fit for service were left to defend the homeland. At the end of 1942 the flak accounted for a major part of the personnel of the 22 Luftwaffe field divisions, and in 1943 was once again bled for the army; the gaps this left had to be filled with auxiliaries. These included male and female 'flak helpers', men from the Reich Labour Service (RAD), and Russian prisoners of war serving as Hiwis, together with Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians; Göring remarked that his flak batteries were like a meeting of the League of Nations. There were also batteries manned by the personnel of local military establishments, and home-guard flak batteries raised from among the workforce of the factories and other premises they were protecting.

The 'Luftwaffe-' or 'flak-helpers' (Flakhelfer) were schoolboy soldiers who, besides being trained and used to serve the guns on flak sites, continued to have lessons from their teachers; their ages ranged from 15 to 17. The first of them were enrolled on 15 February 1943, as the result of a Führer decisi
