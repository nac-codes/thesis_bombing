d to serve the guns on flak sites, continued to have lessons from their teachers; their ages ranged from 15 to 17. The first of them were enrolled on 15 February 1943, as the result of a Führer decision of 7 January. As a rule they lived up to expectations, and generally made up in keenness for what they lacked in training. The Reich Labour Service provided 420 new flak batteries in Germany. One protecting the Pölitz hydrogenation plant at Stettin, to take one example, mustered one officer and 10-15 only partially fit soldiers. Some NCO posts could not be filled. The gun crews consisted of 15- to 16-year old 'flak helpers'; 18- to 19-year-old women auxiliaries operated the predictors. The shells were manhandled by some 20 Russian PoW Hiwis, headed by a Russian sergeant, who were guarded by the 'fak helpers' and brought to the guns when the air-raid warning was sounded. Searchlights were crewed by 17- to 18-year-old 'RAD girls' under the charge of a technical NCO. With such a mixture of personnel, whose members were frequently changing, it was impossible to ensure a peacetime level of training for the home-guard flak units. 242 The material demands of the flak artillery may be gauged from, inter alia, the fact that in the final year of the war around 800,000 men were employed on producing flak armaments, and one-third of the barrels produced in 1944 were 241 Koch, Flak, 303-4; Boog, Luftwaffenführung, 335; BA-MA RL 3/51, 1026 ff. 242 Koch, Flak, 298-323; Schätz, Schüler-Soldaten, 25, 105; Nicolaisen, Flakhelfer; Göring comment taken from Lee, Goering, 165.

A further revealing fact is that already in the early years of the war the flak force's raw-materials requirements were not only on a par those of the army (which was several times larger in terms of personnel), bur: the case of copper and aluminium even very much greater; the bulko materials went into making flak guns and ammunition.243 Jus
