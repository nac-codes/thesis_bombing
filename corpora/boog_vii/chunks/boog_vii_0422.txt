of the army (which was several times larger in terms of personnel), bur: the case of copper and aluminium even very much greater; the bulko materials went into making flak guns and ammunition.243 Just on half copper quota, which in 1941/2 was only slightly lower for the Luftwaffe the â‚¹ of of the for the army and navy together, went to the flak and its munitions. The A .- f of the sector was given 10 per cent of the aircraft quota of aluminium.244 beginning of June 1943 Milch urged the Luftwaffe general staff to ask Go to intercede with Hitler so that a greater share of the steel supplies be shif At from army and navy munitions to flak munitions for the Luftwaffe, 245 ing ited The number of flak artillery pieces with frontline units rose throughout the war, from 7,873 guns of all calibres when it started to 39,200 August 1944, a third of which were heavy calibre;246 it amounted to a fivefol stead increase. Flak artillery production quadrupled between 1941 14,575 to 58,745 pieces. 247 Heavy-calibre guns increased from 2,362 in 1930.+ I and 1943, from 13,260 in August 1944. The resulting rise in the consumption of raw material. is mirrored in the output of flak munitions: in 1941 74,711,000 rounds of all calibres were produced, and in 1944 190,099,000 rounds. Naturally German production of aircraft also quadrupled, from 10,826 machines in to 38,809 in 1944. While more and more heavy flak guns were being made. + average structural weight plus equipment per aircraft dropped from 5.26ti January 1941 to 4.683 t in July 1944, and the average airframe weight from e, the 4.33 t in September 1939 to barely 2.47 t; this was because the aircraft beis made were becoming ever lighter, so that from the viewpoint of raw-materi consumption there was an increase of only 50 per cent or so. The amount aluminium needed for flak munitions alone during the war would have been terials enough to build around 40,000 fighters. The figure naturally serves onl illustrate the important place fla
