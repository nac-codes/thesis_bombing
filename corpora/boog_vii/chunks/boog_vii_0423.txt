. The amount aluminium needed for flak munitions alone during the war would have been terials enough to build around 40,000 fighters. The figure naturally serves onl illustrate the important place flak had within the overall armaments effort. does not mean that all heavy flak manufacture should have been abandoned favour of expanding the fighter sector. Flak fulfilled a very valuable purposa since enemy aircraft, even if only occasionally brought down, were forced to take evasive action just as they were on the run-in to their target, and were thu prevented from bombing accurately. Both Harris and LeMay were opposed to such manoeuvring (which was, in any case, useless in thick flak) because it lengthened the passage through the flak zone.248 Above all, however, anti- aircraft guns were also an extremely effective weapon against tanks in a ground battle. Yet a few thousand more fighters at the right time, and a few thousand 227 t, and making their bomb-aiming more difficult. This did, however, entail firing huge numbers of shells. 243 Koch, Flak, 330; Germany and the Second World War, v/I. 665, 750. 244 Planning office GL/A-Pl 2 (OA), 19 Mar. 1942, PRO FO 5554/45. 245 GenStdLw No. 730/43 g.Kdos., 5 June 1943, BA-MA Lw 103/35. 246 Koch, Flak, 653; Boog, Luftwaffenführung, 208. 247 Deutschlands Rüstung, 24. 248 Boog, Luftwaffenführung, 90, 212-13; Westermann, Ground-based Defenses, 371-4, 520, fewer AA guns in the wrong place with more in the right place (i.e. fighting conks in the east), might perhaps have affected the course of the war. Decisive these shifts would not have been, for German material inferiority was too great for that. A look at the cost-effectiveness of using flak in its own, original context-defending the skies of the homeland-where it was seen as the crucial element',249 does nonetheless present a revealing picture. In the battle against the US 8th Air Force the flak shot down only 239 aircraft between August 1942 and the end of 1943, whereas fighte
