ucial element',249 does nonetheless present a revealing picture. In the battle against the US 8th Air Force the flak shot down only 239 aircraft between August 1942 and the end of 1943, whereas fighters accounted for 702. Where damage to the American bombers is concerned, on the other hand, the situ- ation is reversed-4,691 aircraft were damaged by flak against only 2,056 by fre from the fighters; by mid-1944 these figures had risen to 15,767 damaged by flak and only 1,217 by fighters, though at the same time American total losses through flak increased by 665 and through fighters by 980. Over the period in question, therefore, the fighters, with a score of 1,682 aircraft, shot down over Germany by day almost twice as many as the flak, with only 904. Comparing the numbers downed on all the fronts shows the flak in an even less favourable light. There, over the period from 25 June 1941 to 6 January 1943, 10,406 out of a total of 12,026 were credited to the flyers, and only 1,430 to the AA guns. While the fighters usually found just a few bursts enough to shoot an aircraft down, the flak up to late in 1942 needed around 5,000 rounds from light and 3,500 rounds from heavy guns to achieve the same end; in November and December 1943 it was even 6,500 light-calibre rounds and 4,000 rounds of heavy-calibre fire. 250 The absolute nadir of flak effectiveness came with the British night raid using WINDOW on Hamburg on 25 July, when 50,000 heavy-calibre rounds brought down only three bombers, while the fighters, whose AI radar was also being affected, scored three times that number.251 The statistics show that in causing the enemy total losses fighters were several times more effective than flak, whose main strength was in damaging the bombers, scattering them, or forcing them to higher altitudes and thus GÃ¶ring, speaking to the Gauleiters on 8 November 1943, put this state of affairs in dramatic fashion by saying that the numbers shot down by flak, 'even well lit [by searchli
