fished 5,721 aircrew out of the North Sea during the war-enough to man 572 B-17s or 817 Lancasters. Nonetheless, faith in the effectiveness of flak in general dwindled on the German side from 1943 onwards.264 The previous head of the raw-materials and planning office in Speer's ministry, Hans Kehrl, judged that 'to push flak as an air defence weapon was-leaving aside whether it was at all effective-economic and military foolishness, because we simply could not afford ... the waste of materials on producing the munitions for it'. Hitler, however, was still looking at flak from a different viewpoint, that of 'the supreme principle of German warfare, keeping the war away from the German homeland'. To do this, Goebbels wrote, 'the air defence too must be so intensive as to make air war practically impossible over German territory'.265 With Hitler, however, it meant firstly bombers to pin the enemy to the ground, then flak (which was quicker to produce), and finally fighters. g of more difficult to build alongside the bomber production'.259 Hitler judged the success of flak less on the number of aircraft shot down than on its effect on the morale of enemy bomber crews; in this he felt himself borne out by foreign press reports, which repeatedly mentioned the heavy German flak. H. believed that enemy pilots would think not twice but three times before flying through increasingly fierce flak barrages.260 The head of the fab development group, Gen. Otto von Renz, had already shown that to achieve 100-per-cent effectiveness against a bomber stream measuring 3 × 2 × 1 kilo metres, and assuming an effective burst radius of 10 metres, it would be necessary to assemble 750,000 heavy flak guns at the right place and all firing 254 MGFA, Sammlung Grabmann, R 439. 255 Below, Hitlers Adjutant, 41, 132-3 [not in By Hitler's Side]; id., By Hitler's Side, 116, 148 157-8, 169-70, 176. 256 BA-MA RL 3/50, 455 ff., 467 ff .; Irving, Rise and Fall, 153/4; Boog, Luftwaffenführung, 206-8 257
