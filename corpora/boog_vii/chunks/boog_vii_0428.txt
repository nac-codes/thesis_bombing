Overall some 61 per cent of misses were due to it, about two-thirds of them from taut nerves and taking evasive action, and one-third from moving to a higher altitude. The creep-back due to Into this strategy for armaments and defence, favouring an anti-aircraft artillery that devoured manpower and raw materials, the first aluminium strips of WINDOW dropped during the raid on Hamburg fell like a bombshell: for the time being, they totally blinded the flak's WÜRZBURG tracking and gun-laying radars, threatening to paralyse the whole concept of flak defence. A particu- larly dire consequence was that with WÜRZBURG inoperative, the height- ranging so important for directing anti-aircraft fire was also lost. The efforts that were immediately begun to overcome the jamming of the radars never 261 Germany and the Second World War, vi. 615/16; BA-MA RL 3/51, 1008(4 Aug. 1943).
