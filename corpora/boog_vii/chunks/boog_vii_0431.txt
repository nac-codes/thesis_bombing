On fighters shot down by their own flak see Westermann, Ground-based Defenses, 388-0: on the flak-fire directors, ibid. 374-7; MGFA, Sammlung Grabmann, R 41; Grabmann 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 608-9.

How, when the interference was slight, individual aircraft were to be engaged as before by large and single batteries using the Type 40 fire-control equip- ment; when it was severe the aircraft were to be fired on along their approach path, aiming-off by guesswork; when the radars were rendered totally ineffective, then barrage fire was to be used. For this a whole series of assessments were to be made, including data from further off, which made close contact between the individual tracking stations essential. The search- lights took on extra importance for both the flak and the fighters. On the whole, anti-aircraft fire remained extremely dependent on radar tracking, which was highly vulnerable to interference, and on good visibility; so it continued to be extremely inadequate and inefficient.270 Despite the parlous state of the flak defences, they were to be further reinforced-in the hope that the problem posed by WINDOW would soon be overcome. Hitler wanted them 'enormously' expanded.271 'The FÃ¼hrer tells us', Milch said on 12 October 1943, 'not one flak shell fewer, not one AA gun fewer, not one tank fewer, not one U-boat fewer, but for all that so much more for the flak'; and, resignedly, went on: 'We are not rich, and we cannot say "we can do everything".'272 Since out of the 4.4-6.4 per-cent losses being inflicted on the enemy still only just over I per cent were falling to the flak compared to between 3 and 5 per cent to the fighters, Milch preferred doubling fighter production to quintupling that of anti-aircraft artillery. The latter would make no difference to the level of flak hits-2 per cent at most-whereas the former would at least double ene
