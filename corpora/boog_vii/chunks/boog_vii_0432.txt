oubling fighter production to quintupling that of anti-aircraft artillery. The latter would make no difference to the level of flak hits-2 per cent at most-whereas the former would at least double enemy losses.273 The head of the planning office at Speer's armaments and war production ministry, already mentioned, took a similar view.274 Arguing against an increase in the AA artillery was also the realization by Luftwaffe Commander Centre that because of a lack of per- sonnel he would be able to man the growing number of guns only until February/March 1944 at most. This made Milch think about converting part of flak artillery production to making aero-engines for fighters, since AA guns with no one to fire them were pointless.275 Against this, the general of the flak arm was calling for a substantial rise in the entire modern AA armoury, that is to say, most of all the 88-mm Flak 41 and 105-mm and 128-mm Flak 40 models. Only these new, heavy guns were still effective at high altitudes.276 For seriously tackling enemy aircraft flying at ever higher altitudes, and given the limitations of the heavy flak guns, the development of anti-aircraft 270 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 610-11; Reichs minister for aviation and C-in-C of the Luftwaffe, general of flak troops/general of flak training, A/C No. 02370/43, 16 Aug. 1943, MGFA, Sammlung Grabmann, R 933. 271 Goebbels, Tageb√ºcher, Pt. 2, ix. 331 (21 Aug. 1943). 272 Development conference, 12 Oct. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/38, 4328-9, 4340. 273 GLM/secretary of state//RuK conference, 25 Aug. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/30, 413-14. 274 Kehrl, Krisenmanager, 389-91. 275 GLM conference, 24 Aug. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/24, 7051 ff. 276 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 643.
