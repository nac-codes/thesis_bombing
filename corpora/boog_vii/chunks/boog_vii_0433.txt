The general plenipotentiary special questions of chemical production, Prof. October 1942 had raised spirits again, and made the mass use of surface. surface missiles also seem achievable. The question was whether priority e-to- w Carl Krauch, who responsible for the supply of rocket fuel, wrote in a report on 29 July that it would be better to build defensive rather than offensive missiles rejected the idea that attack was the best means of defence, a and that rock bombardment would deter the British from their bombing offensive. British terror raids against German cities were, he said, being carried cket with a great personal investment of bomber crews, and were being supported The by British public opinion because this method was seen as less unfair the 1 out than for was y 1943 He rocket attacks. A German use of rockets would serve only to make the Brit step up their raids on cities, while the effect of these missiles was uncertain and German defence against any launched by the Allies was totally inadequate.279 Basically, however, the decision between offensive and defensive rock had already been taken, for on 25 July 1943 Hitler had ordered maxim effort on the A-4 rockets;280 meanwhile the development of anti-aircr missiles had continued, amid great difficulties and on the back burner- the planners were even unable to ag
