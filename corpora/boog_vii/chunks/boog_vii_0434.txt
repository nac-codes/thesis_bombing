tler had ordered maxim effort on the A-4 rockets;280 meanwhile the development of anti-aircr missiles had continued, amid great difficulties and on the back burner- the planners were even unable to agree on the future use of the weapons or or on producing the propellant that would be needed.281 Now, however, Göring n the pressure on. With their rocket launchers the flak would ... make a lot of show and noise, and force the enemy up high and make bomb-aim difficult. Here we must . work like the devil on the flak rockets, and I'd like to see this on both the light and heavy ones. The light fired in massive numbers, and if at all possible with an acoustic fuse to react when they pass close to a bomber formation a be detonated by the sound of the engines; and the heavy would have to be like half an on and A-4 and carry up an enormous charge of explosive, though it would need to be a dead certainty this would explode up there, otherwise it would come back down like a rom mine. One would have not to fire them up right above a city. 277 On surface-to-air missiles in general see Renz, Flug-Abwehr, 175-88; Ludwig, Flakraketen Schabel, Wunderwaffen, 259-71.

Once again, this reveals Göring's total lack of understanding of technical R&D.282 During the year 1943 the following flak rocket developments took final shape: WASSERFALL, calibre 700 mm, length 7.80 m, HE payload 100 kg; ENZIAN, cali
