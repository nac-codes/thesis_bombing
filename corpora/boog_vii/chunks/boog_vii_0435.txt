otal lack of understanding of technical R&D.282 During the year 1943 the following flak rocket developments took final shape: WASSERFALL, calibre 700 mm, length 7.80 m, HE payload 100 kg; ENZIAN, calibre 2.220 mm, length 9.80 m, HE payload 700 kg; RHEINTOCHTER, calibre 510 mm, length 4.7m, HE payload 23 kg; SCHMETTERLING, calibre 380 mm, length 4 m, HE payload 20-40 kg.283 These missiles were intended for use against targets at the range of the heavy flak and beyond, between 13,000 and 18,000 m. They had liquid-fuelled rocket propulsion, and (apart from the supersonic WASSERFALL) few at around Mach I, the speed of sound. Planning in the summer of 1943 allowed for a maximum monthly output of, for example, 10,000 WASSERFALL missiles.284 Overall it was believed that defending Reich airspace would need 870 WASSERFALL or ENZIAN batteries and 1,300 SCHMETTERLING batteries, arranged in four lines of defence one behind the other; manning these would call for around 110,000 men. The batteries would have to be protected from low-level attack by light and medium AA batteries, at a distance of 5-6 km. On top of this there would be a costly ground organization comprising transport vehicles, lifting gear, entrepôts, stores on site, command bunkers, and large quantities of reinforced concrete. Building up a defence system based on ground-to-air fak missiles was thus already a perilous undertaking, not only because of the infrastructure needed to operate it, but also because of a level of effectiveness and a consumption of materials that at the current stage of development were still unknowns. Which is what a meeting at the GLM was told on 27 January 1944 by the head of the aerial torpedoes and self-guided devices development department, Fliegerstabsingenieur Rudolf Brée. 285 Anti-aircraft rocket technology was still far from providing a usable solution. To use them successfully, four areas needed to be mastered: propulsion, guidance, a proximity fuse, and the explosive power of th
