raft rocket technology was still far from providing a usable solution. To use them successfully, four areas needed to be mastered: propulsion, guidance, a proximity fuse, and the explosive power of the warhead. At most, the rocket propulsion system was more or less ready to use; all the others were at the stage of theoretical discussion. Up to the end of 1943 not a single rocket had been tested.286 Nonetheless Milch felt obliged to draw armaments 282 Reich marshal's conference, 7 Oct. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/60, 5708-9. 283 Proposals for flak missiles deployment and ground organization, Staatssekretär der Luftfahrt u.
