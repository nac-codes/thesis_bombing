The advantage of an anti-air rocket, however, was in not depending on weather conditions; so the su would have to be built so long as there was no all-weather aircraft. A Milch more likely hoping that the anti-aircraft rocket would meant the end of the of flak artillery, of which he had never been particularly fond. In January however, he could not tell how the development of the four projects would he thought only that a decisive point might be reached during the half of 1944.288 The toing and froing of arguments, the contest between missile development and the production of V-weapons, and the admiss that the former was still in its infancy, allowed only scepticism in look at the future of surface-to-air missiles as a war-winning weapon of defen The same applied to the results so far of trials carried out by Test Unit (discussed at the same development conference) on airborne anti-aircr it 25 cannons, rockets, and flying bombs as weapons against enemy bom craft and formations. All of these projects had, mainly because of a lack of a proxim fuse, proved unpromising. 289 To sum up, the picture presented by the flak defence of the Reich in In 1943 was that, despite heavy losses on the land fronts, a considerable investmentof men and materials had brought about more than a doubling of its forces rendered imperative by the ever-increasing enemy bombing raids. But the flak faced three problems. The American bombers by day, and the RAF's Mosquitoes by night, were flying above the effective range of the guns; the flak's tracking and gun
