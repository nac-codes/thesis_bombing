g enemy bombing raids. But the flak faced three problems. The American bombers by day, and the RAF's Mosquitoes by night, were flying above the effective range of the guns; the flak's tracking and gun-laying radar was still being blinded; and the shift bu the Americans to blind bombing through cloud using H2X, and their use of CHAFF (the American name for WINDOW), was extending this blinding into the daylight air war as well.

But Hitler, and the engineers' hopes of still being able to crack the WINDOW problem and further improve flak performance, still did not allow making the radical decision to switch anti-aircraft manufacturing capacity to building fighters. With its adjustment fire and searchlights it was, after all, helping the night fighters; and it had had great success in defending Ploie»ôti (on I August), in good weather at Bremen and Schweinfurt (8 and 14 October), over the Ruhr and Berlin whe
