was, after all, helping the night fighters; and it had had great success in defending Ploie»ôti (on I August), in good weather at Bremen and Schweinfurt (8 and 14 October), over the Ruhr and Berlin where the heavy flak had been particularly concentrated, and most of all in providing a 'flak umbrella' at Messina. In defence against tanks on the land fronts heavy flak artillery was even in 1943 unsurpassable, and medium and light flak guns proved their worth against low-level attacks. As the year ended, with the flak manned to almost 50 per cent by auxiliaries, it was obvious that from the personnel viewpoint any raising of new flak units from February 1944 onwards was, unless some other solution could be found, a vain hope. Yet still the Luftwaffe was being asked to cut its manpower by a further 25 per cent, a move that in the view of Korten, its new chief of general staff, would mean 'practically the closing-down of the Luftwaffe'.291 Korten calculated that already, on 1I November 1943, more than 400,000 auxiliaries were employed in the flak artillery, and the motorized fak units at the various fronts were still short of 25,000 younger troops; and from I February 1944 13,500 more troops and 2,500 auxiliaries would be needed to man the flak guns being produced each month. The younger age- groups had already been withdrawn and moved to units in the field, and as far as possible replaced in rear areas and in the home theatre with auxiliary personnel. A pernicious fall-off in operational capability, and the abandon- ment of any new units being formed, were looming. There was a similar situation in other branches of the forces; but for the flak the outlook for 1944 was, for all the reasons given, especially dire.
