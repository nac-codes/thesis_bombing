war effort of the oil-producing facilities there after the American raid on Ploie»ôti, to be reinforced by a mobil ARP brigade and four smokescreen companies. Given the great difficulties i raising new ARP units, the sizeable increase in smokescreen companies from six to 46 deserves special notice. In 1943 these were stationed mainly at thetic fuel plants, harbours, special rocket-development sites, syn- import 'bottleneck' factories, aircraft factories, and Hitler's operations centre Berchtesgaden. There was, however, a shortage of chlorosulphonic acid used in making the smoke, such that each site had stocks sufficient for only one at two deployments. 293 To deal with air-raid damage the ARP organization could in 1 1943 draw on the forces of the fire protection police, the professional and volunteer G brigades in the cities and local communities, the local security and support services, the motorized ARP units of the Luftgau HQs, and the works fire brigades in industry, a total of around 100,000 active participants. In maior raids like those on Hamburg in July and August 1943 and on Leipzig on 3/4 December the forces available locally proved insufficient.294 One problem that could not be solved satisfactorily from all viewpoints was that of warnings for the civilian population. A rapidly rising and falling tone from the sirens signalled an impending air raid, while a steady and continuous tone gave the 'all clear'. So long as thi s this was warning at night of the approach of one of the RAF's concentrated bomber streams, the situation was straight- forward. But as soon as-for example, for the first time on 31 May 1942- handful of British high-speed Mosquito bombers were attacking, by day as well, warnings were having to be given at more frequent intervals. This led to -a substantial interruptions and interference in production in the armame factories. It was therefore decided, in discussions between Milch, Speer, number of industrialists, and Hitler, to introduce,
