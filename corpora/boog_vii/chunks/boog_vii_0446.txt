val of the bomber formations, this gave brief reports of the situation in the air at one-minute intervals, which made it possible to know whether it was merely a anisance raid or where the focus of the bombers' activity lay. This system proved very important when the local warning system broke down after heavy bombing. In March 1944 the provision of information to the public via cable radio passed from the Luftwaffe to the propaganda ministry, from the Luftgaue to the Gauleiters.

For the same reason these dummy installations were, when the were not within the area defended by the real targets' own flak, also equipped reas with a few light AA weapons against low-level attacks. Daytime decoys were naturally harder to create than those against night raids (leaving aside rada echo decoys). Then, finally, there were the large-fire decoys which, burning in open countryside, simulated cities on fire at
