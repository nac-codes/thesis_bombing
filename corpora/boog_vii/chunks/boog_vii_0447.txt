rally harder to create than those against night raids (leaving aside rada echo decoys). Then, finally, there were the large-fire decoys which, burning in open countryside, simulated cities on fire at night and drew follow-up bombero away from the real city centres. 300 Substantial passive-defence successes had been achieved early on-in the autumn of 1941, for instance, the RAF dropped up to 53 per cent of its HE and 41 per cent of its incendiaries on the decoys; bu their usefulness faded with the introduction of H2S, which was imperv to optical deception. ious The efforts made by Germany-and German propaganda-to create the impression at home and worldwide that in a war the whole civilian population would be sheltered in air-raid bunkers did not fail to have an effect in places like Britain; there, before the war, it was precisely this that was a main reason for rejecting for the time being any plans for waging an offensive air preparations were made instead for Britain's own air defence, though wirl everyone in bunkers it was likely that bombing raids would be ineffectual and war; peter out.301 In reality, however, the building of air-raid bunkers for the civilian population in Germany-an important element in waging total war- suffered from a lack of materials and labour. It had also long been realized that fully protecting the civilian population was impossible. It was therefore decided already before the war to include only the most important potential targets in the catalogue of those to be provided with ARP; they were graded in categories I to III, depending on their importance to the war effort. Limited means for creating a passive air-raid protection organization were available only for cities listed as Cat. I. From this, and the fact that it was primarily protection for factories that was promoted, it is again clear that, just as with the air-raid warning system, keeping war production going and safeguarding the armaments workers took priority over protecting
