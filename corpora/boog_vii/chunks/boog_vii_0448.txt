ion for factories that was promoted, it is again clear that, just as with the air-raid warning system, keeping war production going and safeguarding the armaments workers took priority over protecting the rest of the population. It could. besides, also be assumed that arms factories and industrial cities would be the prime targets. This was the constraint to which the building of air-raid shelters with limited means had to adapt. Göring had set out the priorities as early as 299 GLM conference, 18 Dec. 1943, MGFA, Sammlung Grabmann, R 937; Grabmann.

November 1939, when he said that the provision of air-raid protection, as Leassive measure, must take second place to active measures. In October 1940 programme of air-raid shelter building had begun that concentrated mainly akthe Ruhr and Westphalia. In March 1943 Göring approved the civilian air rotection working group's programme for that year, designed to meet the most Pressing needs of the prime target areas in Luftgaue VI (Münster) and Xl Hamburg). Central Planning was, however, able to allocate only a bare 50 per cent of the necessary steel and other building materials.302 This is not surprising, as the authorities had cut the total building volumes for the Reich for 1943 com RMIom. to RM3 m .; and in March the building workforce needed for chis was still 105,000 short. From having 13.5 per cent of the total building volume in the last quarter of 1943, air-raid protection's share in 1944 shrank to one-tenth of that for the previous year, and in 1945 to 0.7 per cent of the total aolume. By then, existing elderly shelters were having to be reinforced to stand up to the increasingly powerful bombs being dropped. After the decision in September 1942 to erect the 'Atlantic Wall', the build
