then, existing elderly shelters were having to be reinforced to stand up to the increasingly powerful bombs being dropped. After the decision in September 1942 to erect the 'Atlantic Wall', the building of air-raid shelters was in any case pushed into the background. Up to the late summer of 1943 5.3 m. cubic metres of reinforced concrete had been used in constructing shelters. Up to 1939 the 'Western Wall' had consumed 8.8 m. cubic metres, and to May 1944 the 'Atlantic Wall' 10.4 m. In 76 cities given preference for air-raid protection, 740,000 persons (3.87 per cent of the population) could in late summer 1943 be accommodated in bomb-proof bunkers, and a further 11.6m. (60 per cent of a total of 19.1m. inhabitants) only in splinter-proof shelters. In only a few industrially important cities were more than 40 per cent of the population protected in concrete bunkers. According to a report by the head of the civil air protection working group dated 18 May 1943, more than o million persons in the Reich were totally without protection.303 The closer link between air-raid protection and the Luftwaffe, however, now, with the destruction in cities and civilian casualties becoming ever more devastating, exposed the Luftwaffe to harsher criticism as to the appro- priateness of the ARP measures taken. This came not only from the public but also especially from the Party, since the efficiency or failings of civil air-raid protection had a direct impact on the relationship between the people and the NSDAP. After heavy bombing raids there was frequently sullen disapproval both of the Nazi regime, held to be responsible for everything, and-loudly- of German war policy.304 The Party, with its organizations for providing assistance, gave all the more attention to victims of the bombing, seeking in 302 On the ARP target catalogue see Germany and the Second World War, vi. 482; on materials allocations see Beauftragte f√ºr den Vierjahresplan, Zentrale Planung No. 33/43 g.Rs., 6 Mar.
