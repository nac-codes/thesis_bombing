anization of Reich Air Defence and the Aircraft Warning Service 1943-1944 The changes in the situation in the air over Germany by day and night ineu itably had consequences for the way Reich air defence and the aircraft warning service (AWS) was organized. The Allies' main and diversionary attacks were becoming ever more massive and widespread, and the two main fighter tactics 'Wild Boar' and 'Tame Boar', often entailed long-distance flights across the whole of German airspace; this demanded a wide-ranging, centralized, and flexible control over the deployment of the combined fighter and flak forces The activity and experience report of XII Air Corps general HQ for August 1943 consequently stated With the enemy bombers penetrating deeper and our own fighters having a greater range it becomes necessary to look on the entire area of the Reich including the occupied areas as a single air-defence zone. This central command is made possible through having a single technical means of control. The ever-growing strength of n of the enemy places the problem of the level of effectiveness of our defence in the forefront of concern, as does the greater depth of his incursions ... It makes little difference for the air defence if 80 out of around 500 aircraft are shot down while at the same time each enemy formation gets through to its target and aims its bombs. Only Geschwader grouped under a commodore are able to destroy an enemy formation in its entirety. And only by destroying the whole of an enemy formation is there a possibility of breaking the enemy's will to attack ... The enemy bomber formations flying deeper and deeper into the Reich make a wide-ranging and centrally controlled use of our fighters essential. 307 305 Hampe, Luftschutz, 251-2. 306 Boog, Luftwaffenf√ºhrung, 331. 307 Activity and experience report from Gen.Kdos.
