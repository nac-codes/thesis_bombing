XII Air Corps, which up to 15 September had been commanded by Kammhuber, was taken over by Maj .- General Schmid, a man who according to Goebbels, was fairly rare among Luftwaffe generals in being National Socialist.314 Renamed I Fighter Corps, it continued to come under Luftwaffe Command Centre, and have its headquarters at Zeist in Holland For the time being its only task, as before, was fighter operations by day and night over the northern part of the Reich and the Low Countries (though this activity was now combined in the fighter divisions).315 The corps continued to include the earlier Ist (now 3rd) Fighter Division at Deelen under Lt .- General Kurt-Bertram von Döring, 2nd Fighter Division at Stade under Col. Ibel, and the previous 4th (now Ist) Fighter Division at Döberitz under Maj .- General Joachim Huth.
