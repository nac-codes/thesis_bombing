, and Centre. forming centres of effort was also needed, so that numerically inferior fighter mits could at least temporarily be brought together to achieve superiority in the air.317 By November the commanders of the fighter divisions, who now themselves (or their deputies) had to conduct daylight- and night-fighter operations from the same headquarters, had been transferred out. Their place was taken by officers fresh to the task and-so it was believed-up to the difficult job. Col. Günther Lützow now had charge of Ist Fighter Division, Thel (promoted to Maj .- General) of the 2nd, Col. Walter Grabmann of the ard, and Maj .- General Huth of 7th Fighter Division.318 The ideas on centralization and defending broad areas of airspace also had their effect on the organization of the flak artillery employed on defending the Reich. When 1943 began there had been only two flak divisional staffs for the Hamburg-Bremen-Ruhr and Berlin-Leipzig areas. In the other areas local fak commanders operated on the principle of defending purely the targets facing attack. In certain areas, however, the newly formed and/or imported flak units were too numerous for them to be commanded just by regimental HQs. Early in the new year, therefore, two new divisional HQs and six brigade HQs were formed to take on responsibility for wider areas; it was a development that was to be taken further (see the organizational chart, Diagram I.II.2). It was intended, as part of unifying the air defence of the Reich, to have both day- and night-fighter operations looked after by a single command. Up to now, the generals in command of the two branches had been Maj .- General Galland for the day fighters and General Kammhuber for the night fighters. On 31 October 1943 Göring gave his agreement to 'the instituting of a single "General of Fighters"', with under him an inspector of day-fighter operations and another for night fighters.319 Galland had always refused, as imposing too heavy a workload, taking on
