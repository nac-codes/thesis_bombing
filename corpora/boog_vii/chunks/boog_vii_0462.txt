the WASSERMANN and MAMMUT types; these had ranges of 150 to 250 km,325 which allowed them to detect enemy aircraft flying at 7,000 m as far away as central England, and olot their course. Apart from these, the WÜRZBURG and longer-range FREYA cadars formed the AWS's standard equipment. Because of the shortage of cadar sets, there was still in August 1943 a large gap in coverage along the old horder of the Reich in south-west Germany; enemy formations approaching over France 'disappeared' into this hole, and were able to make dramatic changes of course quite unobserved.326 It was, in particular, very difficult, with the RAF employing ever more resourceful tactics, to tell the difference at night between main, nuisance, and spoof raids and feinting manoeuvres and to alert the fighters soon enough and deploy them at the right time and place. The reporting system using teleprinters entailed considerable delays in the information getting through. With the enemy aircraft flying increasingly higher and faster, the AWS was becoming barely able to fulfil its task. The FREYA early-warning radars were frequently being jammed by enemy trans- mitters when the British made their night raids. 327 Furthermore, other radar sets, like the flak's gun-laying radars, were being blinded by the strips of metal foil. In October 1943 the 8th Air Force on its daylight raids, too, began jamming the WÜRZBURG sets with airborne transmitters in the 40 to 70 cm band and from 26 November additionally with CHAFF, while at the same time 324 Golücke, Schweinfurt, 120. 325 Activity and experience report from Gen.Kdos.
