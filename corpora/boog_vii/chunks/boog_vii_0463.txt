Wolff, the Luftwass my commander for Luftgau Hamburg) failed, mistaking its own fighters enemy bombers. 329 All this jamming and these shortcomings not infrequentl- made it hard for the AWS to arrive at an accurate picture of the situation in air. Ultimately, the situation reports flowing into Luftgau headquarters co- from three different sources: alongside the AWS the flak artillery, with the for cam WÃœRZBURG and FREYA tracking and gun-laying radars, also provided a pich of what was happening, though mostly only a local one; and the night-fighter force with its control system provided a rather wider view across the areas ture covered. Co-operation between these various participants did not alwo work. During bombing raids the lines of communication between them the individual radar sites and observer posts could be severed. Moreover, tl radar plotting networks of the three organizations contributing to the over n an picture had developed differently. Insufficient production meant that the aircraft warning service was initially treated as the poor relation when it came to allocating radar equipment; the lion's share went to the flak and to the the central fighter division operations rooms, fully e
