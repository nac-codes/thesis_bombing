rning service was initially treated as the poor relation when it came to allocating radar equipment; the lion's share went to the flak and to the the central fighter division operations rooms, fully expanded by 1943, at Deelen Stade, Metz, and Döberitz, and the fighter control operations rooms, Schleißheim and Vienna. More and more the building up of a broad-aren picture of the situation in the air came to be based on these operations room s at which drew their information from the superbly equipped night-fighter stations reporting to them. The Reich aircraft warning service came more and more, through the direct link between its observer posts and the fighter operations rooms and night-fighter stations, to take on a customer role, , no longer at all independent and now merely passing on information on the situation to the air-raid warning service330 and civil ARP authorities.
