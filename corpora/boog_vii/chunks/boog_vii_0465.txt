ll filter centres set up linked to the night-fighter HQs, wide- cea coverage created by merging several filter centres, and the transmission of information speeded up (by replacing land-line teleprinter communication bur telephone links or radio reporting). These measures were decided on at the meeting with Göring on 25 September 1943.332 On the question of subordinating the AWS opinions were, however, still divided. The generals in charge of day and night fighters, Galland and Kammhuber, agreed with Göring in wanting it placed under the fighter command. Maj .- General Schmid of XII Air Corps/I Fighter Corps, Maj .- General Schwabedissen, commander of 5th Fighter Division, and Lt .- Colonel Herrmann were against this, though they wanted the right to issue orders and receive priority service. Generaloberst Weise argued for it to be placed under the Luftgau com- mands. Göring came to no decision, though he wanted the fighter comman- ders to have preferential and comprehensive treatment. Gen. Martini had already made a start on strengthening the aircraft warning network in the spring of 1943. He did so step by step, beginning with areas through which the Allied bombers were mainly passing-Luftgau VI (Münster), the Netherlands, western France, Luftgau XI (Hamburg), and so on. In Luftgau VII (Munich) the new organization was introduced on 6 December.333 In the areas of maximum effort the number of observer posts was increased, in particular through setting up small filter centres attached to the fighter defence's radar sites in order to complement or replace the radar contacts with visual/acoustic detection if the radars were put out of action by jamming. Martini had thus stepped up co-operation between the fighter controllers and the aircraft warning service. He further instituted three levels within the system-small and main filter centres, plus a wide-area coverage by combining several main centres at the Luftgau or flak division HQs. The 'commentary' system too had,
