tituted three levels within the system-small and main filter centres, plus a wide-area coverage by combining several main centres at the Luftgau or flak division HQs. The 'commentary' system too had, because of the radar interference from WINDOW, already been used for the first time by the fighter controllers during the Hamburg raid on 27/8 July.334 To obtain an overall picture of the situation across a wide area, Martini had FREYA 'hedgehog' sites (comprising three radars each covering a 120-degree arc) set up at effective points. And as has already been mentioned, flak-fire director officers had been attached to fighter-division HQs to provide better co-ordination between the flak and the fighters. The fighter command further tried to overcome the difficulties caused by the inadequate performance of the aircraft warning service, and by the jamming of radar, through the use of radio/radar DF stations, which were able 332 Reich marshal's conference, note No. 93/43 g.Kdos., BA-MA RL 3/60. 333 Reich minister for aviation and C-in-C Luftwaffe, head of signals communications (1/1-4/IV) No. 782/43 g.Kdos., I Apr. 1943, BA-MA RL 2/934; No. 1092/43 g.Kdos., 23 Apr. 1943, ibid .; No. 1951/43 g.Kdos., 16 June 1943, ibid .; item II, 20 June 1943, ibid .; No. 6208/43 g.Kdos., 9 Aug. 1943, ibid .; No. 77139/43 g.Kdos., 27 Dec. 1943, ibid.

The KORFU radars, for instance, could locate aircroc 252 using H2S so long as this was switched on, and the NAXOS gear could pinpoint British aircraft carrying the MONICA tail-warning radar. The FREYA rade dars were also used in the 'Flamme' method (by triggering IFF responses fro the British aircraft) mentioned earlier. The range of this UHF technic de
