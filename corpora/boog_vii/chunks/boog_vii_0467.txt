ying the MONICA tail-warning radar. The FREYA rade dars were also used in the 'Flamme' method (by triggering IFF responses fro the British aircraft) mentioned earlier. The range of this UHF technic depended on altitude, and with aircraft at 10,000 m could be 360 km que The 'Flamme' reports soon took on great importance for determining the situatie in the air. 335 Many gaps in the overall picture over Germany were filled in the use of air-reconnaissance aircraft, and by the JAGDSCHLOSS 120-km-t tion panoramic ground radar introduced in 1944.336 The relationships in the whole field of aircraft reporting and warning that had formed by this time were enshrined and given basic structure by GÃ¶ring' order of 28 February 1944,337 by which achieving 'an integrated overview of the situation in the air ... by removing the aircraft warning service from the Luftgau headquarters' brought about 'the organizationala and operation amalgamation of the aircraft warning and aircraft tracking services integrated fashion ... under the headquarters of the fighter commanders'T fighter divisions and fighter controllers, who had long had the fullest earliest overview of the situation in the air, thus became the central points which knowledge of the situation coming from all sources was pooled; they became responsible for providing the overall and up-to-date picture. These sources were, to list them once again, mainly the radar organization, the air craft plotting and warning organization, the radio/radar monitoring service.338 and the air-reconnaissance aircraft flying by day and night. From now on th sole means of passing the reports within the aircraft warning service and to the end-users was the 'commentary', and no longer the written word. The densit the and depth of the observer post network was laid down by the fighter con manders; they were to be sited around 30 to 40 km apart, and it was planned to have them closer together along the coasts and fronts. At the same time it was 335 OKL
