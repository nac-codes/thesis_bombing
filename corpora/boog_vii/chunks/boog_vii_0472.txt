Because of the fairly limite range of the WÜRZBURGS, second-rank radar stations were set up to provide. denser network in areas particularly subject to air-raids; these had no lon range radars, and were less generously equipped. They were also allocated observer posts, and the associated AW centre was similarly second-rank addition to these there were also third-rank sites and centres, all feeding the reports into a first-rank one.340 The fighter divisions produced the sole air-situation report, the use of which was obligatory for all; this ended the coexistence of three different views what was happening in the air (from the fighters, the flak, and the Luftoau and the confusion that often resulted.
