The area of the Alps was not adequately covered, so that most reports coming from the south were reaching 7th Fighter division in Pfaffenhofen too late; in that area the JAGDSCHLOSS sites were often being put entirely out of action by a heavy use of WINDOW. A drain of personnel being transferred to the army was getting in the way of forming a clear picture of the situation in the air, and slowing down the passing on of information to the Party's Gau headquarters (though this was less important compared to the operational needs).344 Implementing the concept of restructuring the aircraft warning service, ideal in itself, was besides meeting with fresh technical difficulties. 2. THE LUFTWAFFE SENIOR COMMAND IN 1943 Göring was well aware of the critical situation in which his Luftwaffe now found itself. He brooded on how this could be overcome, and on how he was to defend himself against Hitler's mounting reproaches.345 Stalingrad, Tunis, the raids on the dams, Hamburg, Sicily, Peenemünde, Kursk, the enemy's lead in the electronic war over the Reich-on every front Göring found himself facing nothing but setbacks.
