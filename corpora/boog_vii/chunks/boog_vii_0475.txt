In 1943 the Luftwaffe was losing an average of 1.000 aircraft a month; in the year as a whole, 22,689 or around 90 per cent of annual production. W Well over half of these-13,349 aircraft-were total losses. 346 Anyone who could understand the military/industrial facts of life could not fail to see there was no hope of winning the war in the air. But the watertight bulkheads between the various sections of the leadership, implicit in the dictatorial, vertical structure of the Nazi state, meant that this very overview of the war situation as a whole, essential as it was, was still limited to a handful of people; the stimulus for a radical rethink could 'normally' come only from them.347 But these few, for instance, Göring and Jeschonnek, his chief of general staff, had problems of their own to cope with. As prospects for the future became gloomier, tensions within the upper echelons of the Luftwaffe (already organized along antagonistic lines) became sharper.
