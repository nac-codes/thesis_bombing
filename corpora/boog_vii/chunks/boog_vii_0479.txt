hat 'details of tactics are being controlled from far off, without the C-in-C responsible being given the necessary freedom of action'. In 1942 Hitler decided on the deployment of the first of the new 88-mm Flak-41 anti-aircraft guns in Africa, without consulting the Luftwaffe operations staff beforehand. The growing intervention by Hitler in the tactical command of the Luftwaffe, bypassing the Luftwaffe operations staff, has been confirmed by generals Albert Kesselring and Kurt Kleinrath and by Göring's chief adjutant, Bernd von Brauchitsch.359 Milch grumbled: 'What is command? When command is dealing with the nuts-and-bolts, it's ceased to be command!'360 Gen. von Richthofen, too, complained during the Battle of Stalingrad about Hitler's interference, saying that he felt like a highly paid NCO.361 Not long after he asked Hitler to trust him, referring to the harm done by 'being led by the nose from above'.

Luftwaffe Senior Command this time Goebbels noted in his diary: 'The Führer has himself taken over now of the command of Luftwaffe.'362 A further reason for Göring's compliant attitude towards Hitler was hi complex about the succession: he had to keep himself ready to step Hitler's shoes should anything befall him.363 Even Richthofen regarded Ga- ing as the only suitable heir, because of the confidence the people had ; into him. 364 In fact Hitler had already, since 1934, named Goring as his success and had renewed this in the Führer decree of 29 June 1941.365 This can ale probably be seen as one reaso
