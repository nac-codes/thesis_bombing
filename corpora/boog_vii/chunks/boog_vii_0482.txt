von Ondarza, and the two adjutants Brauchitsch and Werner Teske. Originally it had been the relatively young chief of general staff Jeschonnek who had gathered the younger officers around him. Using these advisors, dubbed his 'kindergarten', Göring was often to bypass his general staff, and to the annoyance of the Luftwaffe commanders 'give orders to the troops'.372 Hitler, too, had for instance, together with Prof. Messerschmitt, bypassed Jeschonnek in 1941/2 and set the long-range aircraft project in train.373 It was not surprising that in these circumstances Jeschonnek became more and more alienated from Göring, who increasingly made him the scapegoat for everything that went wrong-failures for which Jeschonnek, as chief of general staff, naturally had to a large extent to carry the responsibility, but for which Göring and Hitler were primarily to blame. At their behest, for example, he had for too long neglected the preparations for a defensive air war in favour of tactical support for the army in the east, and had allowed the Luftwaffe too much to do the army's bidding at the expense of its bomber force. At the same time he had, by the summer of 1942 at the latest, become fully aware of the crushing American superiority in the air.374 But Jeschonnek was unable to prevail over Göring and Hitler. His upright personality, schooled to military obedience to orders, his quickness of mind and diligence, his military and general-staff skills coupled with his youth, had in 1939 been important reasons for Göring appointing him chief of the general staff at the age of not quite 40.375 A career soldier, he matched Göring's idea of what a chief of general staff giving operational assistance to the commander-in-chief, and taking orders from him, should be-the expression par excellence of the Nazi 370 Gen.
