ther.376 Göring, on the other hand, was so jealous that he banned his chief of staff for visiting the front for fear that his own popularity with the troops might suffer nor was he happy about such visits being made by other officers of the general staff. Because there were so few general staff officers, these visits were in anu case not all that frequent, which distanced the general staff from the troops 372 Göring had none of the upper-class self-assurance and calmly dominant personality that wins the confidence of seasoned soldiers and of younger colleagues like Jeschonnek-sensitive, but not a good mixer and thus a lonel- man-to whom he could have been a support. Up to 1943 Jeschonnek had as far as possible avoided Milch, Göring's state secretary and Generalluftzeugmeister, because when still commander of the training Geschwader Milch had reprimanded him for giving wrong low-flying orders that had had fatal consequences. Jeschonnek in turn was not on par ticularly good terms with his head of operations, Gen. Otto Hoffmann von Waldau; in spite of their earlier friendship, they soon fell out through Jeschonnek's yes-man attitude towards Hitler and Göring. Waldau left the Luftwaffe operations staff in 1942 to take up the post of air commander Africa His successor, Gen. Rudolf Meister, found Jeschonnek high-handed, taciturn and given to an icy politeness; this was clearly a defence mechanism, one that became more pronounced as the problems weighing on him grew. Jeschonnek had just as poor a rapport with his subordinate (who was years older, and critical of him) the Luftwaffe quartermaster-general Hans-Georg von Seidel The two would not see each other at all for months on end, and since the start of the war in the east had also been located hundreds of kilometres apart. 376 Suchenwirth, 'Jeschonnek', BA-MA Lw 21/5, 125; id., Command and Leadership, 152; Irving, Rise and Fall, 232. 377 Suchenwirth, 'Jeschonnek', BA-MA Lw 21/5, 126; Nielsen, 'German Air Force General St
