Had he not sent a purely tactical air force into the wrong war, a strategic one, against Britain-and then, in the hope of winning laurels for his more or less tactical Luftwaffe, given his support to the campaign against a German- occupied Russia that spread out further and further and wider and wider towards the east? Was it not he who had allowed a reaction to the threat to the Reich from the air to come too late, and allowed the bomber force to wear itself out supporting the army on the eastern front? Had he not too seldom stood up to Göring and Hitler, when he was far from always in favour of what they were doing? And now he had to watch his country in peril, his homeland being destroyed, and his air force being crushed. His code of honour would not allow him to resign, nor to tell Hitler the truth about Göring's failings (something on which he had in fact already drafted a memorandum).
