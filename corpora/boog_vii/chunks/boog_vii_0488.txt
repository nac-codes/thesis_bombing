A note beside the body read: 'It is no longe possible to work with the Reich marshal. Long live the Führer!' In his desk was another handwritten note, instructing: 'Diesing and Brauchitsch are not to attend my funeral.'385 On the same day Göring had the office safe opened and removed the memorandum criticizing him, which he kept to himself.
