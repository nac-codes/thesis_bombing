ned fighters392 (10,661 out of 13,854 machines) this would have called for a monthly production of up to 18,000 fighters with growing numbers, own losses dropped. To achieve this would surely have meant having to do without the bombers and probably the V-weapons as well -as and there were no plans for doing that. Aircraft production programme 221/2 of 15 October 1943 provided for the manufacture in June 1944 of 3,114 fighters (2,623 single engined, 491 twin engined) out of a total production of 4,982 machines. 393 Deliveries in that month, however, amounted to only 3,626 aircraft in all, with manufacture and repair providing 2,300 single-engined fighters and 654 twin-engined and destroyers.394 Leaving aside the fact that fighting along extended land fronts always requires fighters, bombers, and tactical close-sun port aircraft, purely technical considerations would have made such a rapid and total restructuring of the aircraft industry quite impossible. What is more, the number of airfields,395 the personnel-intensive but constantly depleted ground organization, and the training capacity at a time of increasing fuel shortage would have been quite insufficient for setting up and maintaining such a fighter armada. And that is totally ignoring the effects of the Allied bombing campaign Similarly, the still relatively undisturbed production of aviation fuel in April 1944 was already below the amount consumed in the following month, the last before the invasion, when the Luftwaffe had a total frontline strength of only around 7,000 aircraft of all types and would have been able, by using up the entirety of its fuel stocks, to keep some 28,000 frontline aircraft in the air (if it had in fact had that many).396 From the figures of enemy strength for 1943 known to Luftwaffe operations staff Ic it could be concluded that, however much the air armaments effort was intensified, the Germans were unable to keep pace with the Allies. It was already known by December 1942 that in
