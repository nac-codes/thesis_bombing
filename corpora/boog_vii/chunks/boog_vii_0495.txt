rations staff Ic it could be concluded that, however much the air armaments effort was intensified, the Germans were unable to keep pace with the Allies. It was already known by December 1942 that in 1943 the British were hoping to build 22,500 warplanes and the Americans 72,000.397 At the beginning of 1943 the RAF's frontline strength in Britain and the Mediterranean was put at 9,800 aircraft plus 2,000 training machines; the latter could of course, if necessary. be used for operations, as had already been done during the 1,000-bomber raid on Cologne on 31 May 1942. By early 1944 the numbers were expected to rise to 13,400 frontline and 2,500 training aircraft. To add to these were 6,000 US aircraft, making a total in January 1944 of 19,400 frontline machines 392 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 568. 393 USSBS, ii.

According to another estimate (LwFüSt Ic/III, ibid., RL 2/423) the figures were 13,157 British and American aircraft by 1 Oct. 1943 and 16,958 by 1 Dec. 1943. austered by the western Allies; and on top of this came the Soviet air force.396 Javertheless Milch expected, in October 1943, 'by November 1944 to inter- oct with the Americans' [production] curve where frontline aircraft are encerned'. 399 He hoped by the end of 1944 to be able to build 6,000 of these ich month. Even if it had been possible to produce only fighters, this would ne been a mere drop in the ocean seen against the 18,000 a month actually needed. That the future was nonetheless looked at with restrained confidence can be out down to Gori
