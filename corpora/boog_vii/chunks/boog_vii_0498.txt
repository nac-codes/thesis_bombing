s he final- became a permanent deputy to the C-in-C of the Luftwaffe, and could issue instructions to the head of aviation and the commander of the replacement ai- force in the absence of the secretary of state and inspector-general. Linke with this was the expansion of what was termed the 'general staff pillar', that i the dividing-up of the Reich aviation ministry into several areas according to function: the general staff, the head of aviation (the ministerial part), the Generalluftzeugmeister (technology), and general of flying training, and finally into the Luftwaffe high command (from May 1944) under the chief of general staff and (from March 1945) the Reich aviation minister under the head of aviation with the ministerial administrative and economic offices. The CGS's area of responsibility was substantially widened, through absorbing all the military, technical, and training departments relevant to waging the air war (in 1942/3 the last-named had still been under the secretary of state for aviation). Thus, in the summer of 1944 the yawning gap between tactics and technology that had existed since 1937 among those running the Luftwaffe could finally be closed. The command organization that under Jeschonnek had been restricted to tactical and operational concerns was freed up and adapted to the needs of a long-drawn-out war of attrition, one that demanded more than a purely military leadership. In particular there was a need for looking at the war in terms of overall strategy. How it was that this command reorganization was brought about too late, and in a Luftwaffe that had by then become irrelevant, is another matter.402 There was now forced through, in the wartime organization of the Luftwaffe, a functional structure for the various units that was better suited to independence of the air force and to a strategic conduct of the air war. Up to then units had in general been allocated regionally in air fleets, and within each of those areas had been drawn on f
