to independence of the air force and to a strategic conduct of the air war. Up to then units had in general been allocated regionally in air fleets, and within each of those areas had been drawn on for widely varying tasks to which they were not always suited. Korten saw this as a main reason for why large sections of the Luftwaffe had lost their fighting capabilities. The answer lay for him in the creation of 'thoroughbreds', units each suited to a particular purpose. One 402 Air Ministry, 239-40; Boog, Luftwaffenf√ºhrung, 260-341, esp. 261, 307, 334, 346-7, and 581-7. example of this was the creation of a post for a general of ground-support nis, the inspectorate for which now covered units that had previously come sortly under the general of bombers and partly under the general of fighters. with the post of general of night fighters abolished, the general of fighters had charge of both day- and night-fighter forces. Further examples of the functional structure being introduced included what was known from early 1944 as Air Fleet Reich; a fighter defence com- wand expanded to take in the flak forces; XIV (Transport) Air Corps, which bad already been set up in the summer of 1943; the now strategic IV Air Corps, which like the IX Air Corps used against England was modelled on the RAF's Bomber Command; VIII Air Corps, which had existed since the war began ond was the Luftwaffe's only close support corps; and the newly created Air Fleet 10, which was a kind of Training Command.403 On the one hand the preparations for strategic bombing offensives in the nost and west, and the measures running in parallel to stiffen air defence, 404 bad called for more means than were available at the time. But a good deal of che outlay and effort could also be recouped through obsolete aircraft types no longer usable in the west finding a fresh field of employment in the east, where enemy strength in the air was not so overwhelming.
