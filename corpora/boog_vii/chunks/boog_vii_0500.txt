craft types no longer usable in the west finding a fresh field of employment in the east, where enemy strength in the air was not so overwhelming. The following analysis of motives made by an officer in the American intelligence service is undoubtedly on the mark: 'Possibly the Germans, impressed by the effects that heavy Allied bombing operations have had in the west, have come to believe that by this means they can materially cripple the Russian war effort with limited cost to themselves. It is also true that long-range bombers represent the one category of aircraft not urgently required on other fronts. Thus . .. the new German Air Force policy seeks to make a virtue out of a necessity'.405 Göring clutched at this straw in the hope of improving the Luftwaffe's standing within the Wehrmacht-and at the same time, of course, his own.406 Addressing the Gauleiters on 8 November 1943, he gave his support to Korten's measures for boosting the strategic defence of the Reich and the strategic bomber offensive; the latter had, he said, from the outset lain at the heart of the Luftwaffe's activity: 'Anything [the enemy] can do, we must also be able to do.'407 He was hoping to be able to launch vengeance raids by the end of the year. The Luftwaffe's new strategic approach naturally also called for a matching mental one. For this Korten made use of the military science department of his general staff, which had already in January 1943-through being placed under Dept. I (Operations) and also by the head of the Luftwaffe operations staff Lt .- General Meister-been made aware of 'the demands of modern air war'. 403 Air Ministry, 239; Boog, Luftwaffenführung, 271-2, 239, 307, 309, 318, 332, 334, 346, 580-7; Cooper, German Air Force, 318-19; Muller, German Air War, 152-3. 404 Air Ministry, 288-93; see also Ch.
