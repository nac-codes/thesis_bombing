formations against Germany at a time when her forces were split up and overstretched eross the whole of Europe and North Africa. As this course of events was under way by 1941/2, Generalluftzeugmeister Milch had already, soon after taking over his office, tried to step up the building of fighters.418 Because attack-role units were also wanted on the land fronts, it proved impossible to push his plans through to the extent needed. On the night of 6 March 1943, a month after the disaster of Stalingrad, he tried during a long conversation with Hitler to win approval for his defence strategy. In 1943, he urged, Germany should limit herself to staying on the defensive in order to be able to go over to the offensive again in 1944. He proposed a production target of 5,000 fighters a month (as against the current 670),419 and warned against taking the Allied bomber production figures as being a bluff. He left the meeting despondent, and feeling that Hitler was not going to draw the conclusions he hoped for; the Führer had, indeed, called on him to focus his main attention on high-altitude, high-speed bombers. Hitler, echoed by Göring, refused to take any notice of what was now the defensive situation on land and in the air.420 Given that not only the experts421 but Göring too422 looked on the standard German attack-role aircraft, the Ju 87 dive bomber and Ju 88/188 medium bomber, together with the He 177 with its unhappy record so far, as too slow or not yet ready for action against enemies in the west, this was in line with the proposal that had been made by the general of bombers on 27 November 1042.423 He urged that the bomber force, which at that time had 51 (mainly) medium and heavy Gruppen plus 12 Stuka Gruppen, be remodelled to comprise 72 light-bomber, 18 dive-bomber, and 15 heavy-bomber Gruppen. 417 KTB OKW, iii. 1596; Hitler Lagebesprechungen, 142 (midday, I Feb. 1943); Boog, Luftwaf- fenführung, 124-30. 419 GenStdLw, Gen.Qu., 6.
