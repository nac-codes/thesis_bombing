manufacture of which Ly from gro to rise from 100 to 350 a month, were still allocated to the offensive secto ch wa Since three or four fighter aircraft could be built for the outlay on one mediu bomber, this shift of emphasis to fighters was a fairly modest one. That muchi evident from the fact that besides the 23,456 fighters to be built over the two year period there were also to be 15,285 bombers, 4,946 destroyers, and 3,535 dive bombers-that is, 23,766 aircraft with a primarily offensive role; and in later versions of the delivery plans the balance was to shift even further towards the attack role, by 1,500 aircraft. Achieving the rise in all areas, when Milch' rationalization and economy measures were only just beginning to bite, was seen as posing a major problem. It prompted Generalingenieur Heinrich Sellschopp to say: 'Now we are being asked to increase the fighters, while at the same time the other is still going on [i.e. Stukas] ... We cannot increase output in all areas.'427 One would have to be cut back if the other was to be raised, It was all very difficult; so a great many meetings yielded no result.428 Sometimes when, for instance, engines were needed for a particular model of bomber that could also be used in fighters, Hitler would opt for 'sooner a couple of fighters fewer, but a couple of the others more'. 429 Not least among the reasons it still proved impossible to take drastic measures to build up a stronger fighter defence was that Hitler and Göring did not want to believe the figures for Allied arms output that were now known, or regarded them as simply not possible. When, on 4 January 1943. Milch presented Göring with the estimated figures for the western Allies' output of warplanes in 1943 and 1944, 98,000 and 121,000 respectively,430 as 424 Reich marshal's conference, note No. 23/43 g.Kdos., 18 Mar. 1943, ibid., RL 3/60, 5332. 425 Ibid., RL 3/35, 2787 ff., 2827, 2932 ff .; ibid., RL 3/42, 6472; ibid., RL 3/60, 5345- 426 Aircraft programme
