tion there would always be tasks only these types could deal with'. 434 Milch further thought: 'What we need for waging war as a whole is a strong air force, one superior in defence with fighters and night fighters, and on the other hand capable of dealing the enemy a matching blow in attack.'435 He went on: 'The war can be won only with the air force .. . It is impossible for around troops to be victorious without our having superiority in the air, mastery of the air in our own airspace and at the places where the action is.'436 We see here the dilemma the Luftwaffe leadership saw facing it in early 1043, following the setbacks in North Africa and at Stalingrad and with the onset of the heavier Allied bombing offensive; it had to decide which theatre of war-the home air front or the land fronts-was to be given absolute priority, and then gear the air armaments effort to this. This was not just a concern of the Luftwaffe, which was feeling that its aircraft and fighter programme was suffering through the increased production of tanks.437 The head of the Luftwaffe general staff's armaments department, Col. Kleinrath, said: 'We are, in the main, now forced onto the defensive, and are having to move fighters forward',438 while the Generalluftzeugmeister (in spite of realizing the importance of air superiority and that 'we just can't have too many fighters') 439 insisted: We must attack Britain, so that the British don't come and smash us here. The whole of our future armament-air, land, and sea-depends on whether we can protect our own airspace, and the best way of keeping German skies totally safe is by attacking British bases, either their airfields, or their industry, or their people and cities.
