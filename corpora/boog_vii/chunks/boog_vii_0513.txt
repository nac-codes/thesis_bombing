Aircraft Programme 223 for the period up to September 1945.444 many In this, with 51,767 defensive-aircraft types to be manufactured, the day, night 1 1943 and jet fighters formed a clear majority. It was planned to raise output from 637 to 2,915 a month, including 2,305 Me 109 and FW 190 day fighters and do Me 262 jets. For attack roles there were to be 31,334 new aircraft, including 3,218 long-range bombers and 5,533 medium bombers, with the remainder mixture of dive-bombers, close-support and ground-attack types, fighter bombers, and destroyers. The obsolescent Ju 88, He III, and Do 217 medium bombers were to be discontinued by 1945 and replaced with modern fast bombers of the Ju 188, Do 335, and Me 410 types. In April 1943, it is true, the attack sector was still to predominate, with 757 aircraft as against 636 defence- role aircraft; but in January 1944 the balance was reversed, with 804 compared to 1,197, and by September 1945 there were to be 1,460 compared to 2,915-2 ratio of 2 : 1 in favour of defence.445 This programme continued the shift of emphasis from air attack to air defence that had been under way since the summer of 1940, even though this was, despite the changed war situation. pursued only very hesitantly; the overriding importance, given Germany's geographical position, of thinking in terms of attack was not, however, lost to view.446 In the meantime the British were stepping up their raids on the Ruhr. On average they were dropping 1,500 t of bombs during each raid, considerably more than the Luftwaffe was able to do against England.
