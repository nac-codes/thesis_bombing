eaders seemed, after the first successes of the new 'Wild/Tame Boar' and pursuit night-fighter tactics and the successes beating off the American day bombers over Schweinfurt and Regensburg once again to have gained confidence in the existing and expanded air defences.480 When one considers, however, that Maj. Werner Baunbach deputy to the general of bombers, had in August 1943 received only an evasive 476 Galland, The First and the Last, 222-5. Galland gives the date of the meeting as the first feu days of August 1943, immediately after the series of raids on Hamburg, and its venue as Göring' base at the 'Wolf's Lair' Führer headquarters in East Prussia (clearly, at Schloß Rominten) According to Milch's diary (BA-MA Nachlaß Milch, N 179) no such meeting took place until , and 3 September. The mention of Korten as chief of the Luftwaffe general staff would chime with this, since he was appointed to the post only after Jeschonnek's suicide on 18 August. Galland's also relating in this context the appointment of Peltz, the general of bombers, as 'leader of the assault on England' must be due to his misremembering, since Peltz had already been given this title in March 1943. Perhaps Galland was confusing the August gathering with his meeting with Göring on 26/7 July, on which he drafted a file note (No. 1198/43 g.Kdos., 28 July 1943, BA-MA RL 3/61, 5839-41), which opens with the sentence: 'Clear focus on day and night fighting. Irrespective of which conference Galland is referring to, this gives a striking picture of the situation If it had never happened, it would have to have been invented. 477 Obviously note No. 87/43 g.Kdos. on the Reich marshal's conference on 2 and 3 Sept. 1942 (BA-MA RL 3/60, 193 ff.) gives only the final outcome; it talks of the all-out effort to be made on building the jet bomber and heavily armed heavy bomber and on preparing strike forces, and after that mentions a further expansion of air defence. 478 Speer, Third Reich, 299. 479 Dornberger
