In the summer of 1942 he had considered che monthly output of 700 to 1,000 bombers just as urgent as that of 1,000 Sahters, to be reached by the end 1943/early 1944.482 In April 1943 he did not Hant bomber production 'to be reduced too much', because one could not know what subsidiary theatres of operations there might still be and what cepercussions these would have on the need for heavy bombers. 483 At the beginning of June 1943 he said: 'I cannot say that from now on we shall make only fighters and drop everything else.
