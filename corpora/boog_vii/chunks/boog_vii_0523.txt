The main people in charge seem themselves to have lacked the imagination and knowledge needed to see where their measures were leading, and this is evident in Speer's and Hitler's overestimating what the V-weapons could do and underestimating the negative effect they would have on the production of defensive armaments. It is understandable that those writing memoirs-and Irving's Rise and Fall of the Luftwaffe is to all intents and purposes Milch's memoirs-will try to justify their actions in the light of insights gained subsequently.
