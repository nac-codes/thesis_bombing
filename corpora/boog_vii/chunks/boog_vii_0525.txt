uce 1,40 more fighters than under Programme 223, that is to say 4,407, including 4,105 day fighters; these were to be mainly Me 109s and FW 190s-certainly no longer the most modern types, but well proven and thus mass-produceable without any teething troubles. By October 1944 output of the Me 109 was t rise to 2,376, and December 1944 was to see 1,420 FW 190s; they would then rapidly be replaced by up to a thousand Me 262 jet fighters, up to 746 Me 209s, 1,100 Ta 152s and 154 (Focke-Wulfs designed by Kurt Tank), and 30 Me 163 rocket-propelled fighters. The need was for aircraft in large num- bers for the time being, and time to change to more modern types. Milch. moreover, wanted more than one string to his bow where fighters were con- cerned:491 with the night fighters, it was planned to replace the Ju 88 and Do 217 with the He 219 and Ta 154. The output of attack-role aircraft was also to be stepped up, even though only slightly, from 1,460 to 1,519 in September 1945; this, however, meant a dramatic shift from heavy, long-range bombers to ground-attack aircraft and medium bombers. In total, 82,918 day and night fighters and 26,695 attack aircraft of all types (fighter-bombers, ground- support and ground-attack aircraft, and bombers, together with destroyers and dive-bombers) were to be produced within a period shortened by six months to two years.
