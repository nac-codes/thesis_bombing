there would need to be a fresh injection of a ,3.460-strong workforce, more than 7 million Reichsmarks' worth of factory face, enough raw materials, aero-engines, and 1,585 new machine-tools.495 Overall, there was for 1944 an average monthly demand of 26,000t of aluminium, of which only 22,000t could be counted on since all the other consumers were calling for a further 21,000 t.494 The total output of aircraft consequently stagnated between April and October 1943 at around 2,500 machines a month, and even dropped slightly. In October of that year Germany's manufacture of warplanes (for both attack and defence roles) was lagging behind even Programme 223's target by far more than 500 aircraft-a bare 1,300 instead of 1,860; the output of fighters, in particular, was short bur around one-third.495 Despite this, the plan was aiming at achieving within no-and-a-half years an increase in production of about 83,000 attack- and defence-role aircraft, to reach a total of 110,000. The German aircraft industry was, to be sure, still not yet fully mobilized,496 but in this area wishful thinking began, against the background of external events, gradually to lose all touch with reality. And yet Programme 224 did earn its title of 'homeland air defence programme',497 for it was trying to draw the right consequences from the situation and shift the bulk of production to turning out single-engined fighters ond attack aircraft; these best answered the most urgent needs of the moment-air defence and support for the army-and for this reason and because of the lack of means, thoughts ought for a while to have been taken off strategic offensive operations. There was, however, one thing that had not been reckoned with. The American daylight raids had already in August cut fighter production by 150 machines, and after Hamburg there was such a shortage of propellers that of the 42 Ju 188s due to be delivered in one month only four could be finished. Speer's staff, besides, looked on Milch
