In 1943 they had, he said, been lego and less able to achieve any effect. In that year, in fact, the bomber force had had, with an average strength of 1,415 machines, to be replaced three time over.501 Already at the beginning of 1943, Peltz said, 'the units are quite simple being broken up at such a rate that one cannot keep up with re-forming them again'.502 Besides a more concentrated structure under a single leadership along the lines of the RAF's Bomber Command, instead of the previous wasteful plethora of command authorities, he called for the strategic and tactical bomber forces to be separated, and for the former to be better equipped with jamming-proof navigational, DF, and bomb-aiming devices He did not, moreover, see the present bomber Geschwader numbers as suf ficient for carrying out the manifold tasks they were given; Programme 224 had done nothing to change this.
