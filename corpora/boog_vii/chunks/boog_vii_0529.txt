43 the frontline units mustered only some 1,100 serviceable bombers, and out of 52 Gruppen only six were equipped with the new Ju 188 or He 177 types; the front was thus relying mainly on obsolete types such as the Ju 88, He III, and Do 217.503 In the autumn of 1943 the bomber production figures were. however, tending to fall.504 Under Programme 224 the low point was to be in May 1944, with 226 machines built in this development. Milch was seeking in this way to free up capacity for producing fighters, so as to be able to come up with a strong fighter force by the spring of 1944.

Since che monthly average output of 368 bombers in 1942 and 393 in 1943 was efficient to raise the average monthly actual strength of the bomber arm to more than 1,415, the final target of a frontline strength of just on 3,000 bombers was unattainable. This, and the fact that in the final stage ten times as many fighters as bombers were to be built, had Peltz ringing alarm-bells. From bis viewpoint he was duty-bound to do so, and had every justification-his bomber-strength plan for the various war theatres was as follows:505 Atlantic (plus Arctic Ocean, Black Sea, and Mediterranean build-up): 5 special Geschwader, including I torpedo-bomber Geschwader Britain: 7 bomber Geschwader Mediterranean: I bomber Geschwader I long-range Geschwader (Ju 290s) I torpedo-bomber Geschwader South-East: I bomber Geschwader East: 6 bomber Geschwader 2 long-range Geschwader (Ju 290s) The main focus, the Mediterranean th
