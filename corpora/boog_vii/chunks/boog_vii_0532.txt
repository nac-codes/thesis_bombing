'I have heard just today,' Milch said in a meeting on 15 October. 'that yesterday the Führer, in the presence of Speer and the chief of general staff [Korten], made it clear that for him the homeland defence programme has precedence over all other matters.'513 But as Speer noted, Hitler was 506 Quoted from Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 458. 507 Irving, Hitler's War, 574-5. 508 Meeting in Göring's office, 9 Oct. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/61, 6308-14. 509 Irving, Rise and Fall, 243. 510 Meeting between Göring and the GLM and Industry Council, 14 Oct. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/61, 6252 ff. 511 Telex from Reich marshal, Adj., No. 1650/43 g.Kdos., 11 Oct. 1943 to GLM Milch, BA-MA RL 3/51, 7323; development meeting, 12 Oct. 1943, ibid., RL 3/38, 4385. 512 Göring's meeting with GLM and Industry Council, 14 Oct. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/61, 6191. 513 GLM conference, 15 Oct. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/39, 5243, and heads of departments meeting. 15 Oct. 1943, ibid.
