e been a real conjurin trick to have bumped up fighter production so quickly to 2,000 by April 1944.520 In fact, February 1944 saw the production of only 833 Me 109 and FW 190 fighters instead of the planned 1,487-a consequence of 'Big Week' Following this collapse in production, the influence of Speer's ministry on ai- armaments (increasingly evident since the summer of 1943) gained pace These activities were now already being directed by the 'Fighter Staff set un under the head of Speer's technical office, Karl Saur, until in the summerof 1944 the Luftwaffe's responsibility for matters connected with armamento production came to an end. This was a decision that was long overdue. It ha been realized for years that the various parts of the Wehrmacht were incapable of managing things side by side, and that arms production needed to be under had a single management. Air armaments passed into Speer's hands, thus giving him responsibility for the whole of German armaments production.521 It wa not until July 1944 that output of conventional day fighters of the Me 109 and FW 190 type nudged towards the magic figure of 2,000 a month. By which time the Allies, with their fighter escorts, had already secured mastery of the ai over Germany.522 It is pointless to debate whether Programme 225 meant a setback for the German air defence. Although this programme, set up only two months after Programme 224, did cause a certain commotion in a German air armaments industry that was already struggling to cope with rationalization, conversion. and the change to using economy materials, all that was possible in the short time available was mainly to continue the trend already set by Programme 223. where the ratio between attack- and defence-role aircraft did not anyway change to any dramatic extent. From the military and air-war strategy view- point there was nothing basically wrong with the principle of taking decisions during a war that were focused mainly on attack, especially given
