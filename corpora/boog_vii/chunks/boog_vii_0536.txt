c extent. From the military and air-war strategy view- point there was nothing basically wrong with the principle of taking decisions during a war that were focused mainly on attack, especially given Germany's position at the centre of the continent. The British, too, did not entirely cease their production of bombers when, from 1938 on, they made an all-out 519 GLM/secretary of state/RuK meeting, 27 Oct. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/31, 733. 520 Ibid. 732 (Speer). 521 See Boog, Luftwaffenführung, 296-313. 522 Gundelach, Luftwaffe im Mittelmeer, 728-30. 291 armaments drive geared to defence. And they carried out bombing raids at a me when Bomber Command was still weak and the Luftwaffe were attacking their country in force. The RAF did not, however, go over to its massive bombing offensive against Germany until it had secured mastery of its own skies. This was the sort of approach that Milch too had in mind: You needed to fight in the air from the rear towards the front, the same as on land: ¿ fict heavy losses on the bombers so as to drive them from the centre, then so they didn't get across the Rhine any more, then not across the borders, and finally if at all Possible not across the Channel. This was possible only by using the concentrated derength of one's entire force, but not with ridiculously small parts of it. Even doing this couldn't be left as long as you liked-once the enemy in the west could put up large formations of long-range fighters, it was too late! You'd missed your chance ... It was failing to do this that in the end dealt us the death blow.523 Countering this there was the view summed up by the head of Dept. 6 (Armaments) of the Luftwaffe general staff, Maj .- General Kleinrath, with the words: 'There are other fronts besides just defending the Reich-fine though that might be.'524 Even Milch had to admit at that time that there were 'two main tasks. One, to hold the front in the east: for that we needed 50 per cent of armament for the army, and 50 per cent
