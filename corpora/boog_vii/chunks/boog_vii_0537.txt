One, to hold the front in the east: for that we needed 50 per cent of armament for the army, and 50 per cent for the Luftwaffe. The other, to defend the homeland, where the Luftwaffe needed 100 per cent of the armament effort.'525 The persistence of the attack-dominated mindset526 that, because of the country's central position, was deeply rooted in the German doctrine of air war-shared fundamentally by the Luftwaffe general staff, and still determining general staff training-is also manifest in Göring's view in spring 1944 that 'the heavy bomber is at the core of air armament!'527 Trapped between the demands of attack and defence, the Luftwaffe's high command failed to switch soon enough from an offensive to a defensive conduct of the air war; when they did so, it was for far too long only half-heartedly, at the same time arming themselves to undertake bomber offensives in the east and west528 when they were not even masters of their own airspace. In the totalitarian Nazi state they were, however, not free to take their own decisions. 5. AIR DEFENCE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 1944 During the first five months of 1944 the German air defence found itself, compared to the same period the year before, facing an ever-increasing number of Allied air raids of increasing destructive power: many more enemy aircraft were dropping many more tonnes of bombs. Where in the same period in 1943 the western Allies had made 31,672 sorties, mainly by bombers, these 523 Milch, 'Erinnerungen', 320-1, typescript, MGFA. 524 Development meeting, 4 Feb. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/40, 5333-4. 525 GLM conference at Göring's office, 8 Feb. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/62, 6535. 526 See Ch.
