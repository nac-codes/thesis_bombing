The quantity of bombs falling on these target groups in France between 91,084 t of bombs on area targets, almost twice as many as in the same period in railways, fuel plants, airfields, and the like. Nonetheless the Allies dropped lessened because the strategic bomber force was needed for targets such a night, meanwhile, continued as before, though in April and May their intensit 'industrial areas'-a euphemism for cities-carried out mainly by the British as May the high tonnage (11,826) dropped came as a shock. The attacks on were suddenly plastered with almost 2,500 t; and railways, on which in April and airfields, which received a total of 8,970 t; fuel-producing plants, which in Mar onwards). The same trend could be seen in the Balkans and Austria. The prime targets in Germany were aircraft factories, on which 13,197t of bombs fell. The bomb tonnage followed the same trend. In the 1943 reference period this had been 86,806 t, in 1944 it was 433,773 t. Over the period in question in 1944 144,988 t had fallen in Germany and 134,059 t in France (in the latter care mainly on transport targets and airfields, and increasingly so from March months in 1944 saw 223,769;529 the bulk of the aircraft used were larger and I.II.
