Me 262 production at Augsburg, and once again ball-bearings output at Schweinfurt to suffer severely. On 24 April there was destruction at the Dornier works in Munich and Oberpfaffenhofen. Ninety per cent of the town of Friedrichshafen was destroyed, including two out of its three engine works. After 'Big Week', April brought German fighter production its second heavy blow. These raids and the attacks in May, when in the last ten days alone 133 aircraft were destroyed and 54 damaged on industrial sites, and repeated raids on Wiener Neustadt brought manufacture of the He 219 high-altitude night fighter almost to a halt, certainly slowed down the production of fighters and other aircraft;533 but they could not prevent it from constantly rising. 534 A further heavy blow to the Luftwaffe's activity as a whole was the drastic fall in aviation fuel output with the start of raids on the German synthetic fuel plants.535 Although the heart of the hydration and mineral oil works producing aviation fuel could not be knocked out, and the supply of motor fuel and heating oil to the Wehrmacht was for the time being little affected, German production of aviation fuel in May fell, from the 180,000-t April figure, to 120,000 t, and in June to only 53,000 t. By September 1944 a mere 10,000 t were leaving the works. Given the Luftwaffe's average monthly consumption of 150,000 t (in May 1944 it was even 195,000 t), the OKW's reserve stock- amounting on I May to just under 580,000 t-had to be drawn on. Total fuel production, which in May 1944 still stood at 316,000 t, shrank in June to 107,000 t. It was foreseeable that if the air raids on Germany's hydration plants pards at Hamm on 22 April 1944 see also USSBS, iv.
