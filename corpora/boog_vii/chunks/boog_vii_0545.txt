At the same time the fighters of 3rd Division on the Dutch coast, which was now exposed, had to be pulled back becaus the forward units had for a long time been moving eastwards as they climbed to engage the enemy, so as not to be taken by surprise by the American fighters and drawn into combat too early. JG I was from now on stationed in the Rheine-Twente-Mönchengladbach area.537 Organizational problems still, however, made optimum use of what fighter forces were available hard to achieve. For the enemy, the area covered by Germany together with Austria and Hur Hungary formed a single strategic whole; but in the early months of 1944 the command of the Reich's defence was still split up, into northern and central Germany defended by I Fighter Corps with Fighter Divisions I to 3, and the area covered by 7th Division stretching from the Frankfurt basin across southern Germany to Austria. In Hungary air defence was managed by Air Fleet 4, to which the Luftwaffe general in Hungary was answerable. The day-fighter forces available in the Reich's two defence zones were, each on their own, too weak to cope with a large-scale American raid against their territory. Releasing their fighters to help others required a decision from Air Fleet Reich, and sometimes from Göring. This many times came when it was already too late. This disadvantage was not overcome until 7th Fighter Division was placed under I Fighter Corps on I April 1944.538 Though ZG 26 and 76 had earlier, when they came by chance on formations of American four-engined bombers without an escort, still been able to achieve great results without any appreciable losses of their own, this was no longer possible with the increasingly omnipresent American fighters (which by early 536 See pp. 144-9, 179-80. 537 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 690-1. 538 Ibid. 692.
