The American fighter escorts, now ranging freely almost everywhere, made it hard for the German ground controllers both to keep their own fighter formations out of sight and to vector them onto the bomber formations by the shortest route (necessary since their range was too limited to allow evasive manoeuvres). There were not enough planes and pilots available to have some of them keeping the American fighters engaged and thus leaving others unhindered to attack the bombers. While the Americans were perfecting the art of using their bombers and fighters in combination, the German fighter force was from April 1944 onwards finding it to a great extent impossible to make concentrated, mass attacks on the raiders. 541 Besides the creation of Air Fleet Reich and centralization of the aircraft warning system that had become necessary as the Allied attacks penetrated ever deeper into Germany,542 the situation in the day-fighter sector demanded other organizational changes.
