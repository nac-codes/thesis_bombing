in the supply depot being prepared for squadron service.546 It was still impossible to carry out the plans made in 1943 to enlarge fighter Staffeln to 16 aircraft, and the Gruppe to 68 aircraft by adding a fourth Staffel-measures designed to boost thei- effectiveness against the four-engined bomber formations by meeting maso with mass, and to economize in officer numbers, given the shortage commanders. On average, the 19 fighter Gruppen defending Reich airspace consisted of only 31 aircraft each, so that they still did not even reach what had so far been the normal complement.547 At the meeting to discuss the fighter situation held at GÃ¶ring's office on Te and 16 May 1944 General Galland set out the situation with regard to fighter pilot numbers.548 April had seen the loss of 489 pilots, 100 of them officer with replacements numbering only 396, including 62 officers. In Air Fleet Reich the drain had reached 38 per cent, in Air Fleets 3, 2, and 5 it had be 24, 18, and 12 per cent respectively, while Air Fleets 4, 6, and I had together lost II per cent. To offset this, Galland suggested, all fighter pilots still capable of flying should be moved from staff desk jobs into squadron service, ground support and night-fighter pilots should be converted to day fighters, two more fighter Gruppen should be transferred from the eastern front to homeland defence, and units should be amalgamated to save on the number of uni commanders needed. The general in charge of flying training had, he reported already made 100 of his instructors available. This meant that training resources were once again being plundered to meet the needs of the front line. though this situation was now to be improved by pulling out one Gruppe per division at a time for one- to four-week periods. The Luftwaffe was living off its reserves, and still scarcely able to increase its own strength. All this demonstrates how hard the fighting was, and how severe the attrition being suffered by the fighter force i
