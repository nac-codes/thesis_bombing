e was living off its reserves, and still scarcely able to increase its own strength. All this demonstrates how hard the fighting was, and how severe the attrition being suffered by the fighter force in defending the Reich skies. Between January and May 1944 the Americans flew around 92,00 sorties by mainly heavy bombers, and as many by fighters. With 6,367 heavy bomber sorties over Germany in January and 19,825 in May, the American loss rate fell from 4.2 to 2.I per cent; among their fighters, flying 7,167 sorties in January and 36,210 in May, it dropped from 1.5 to 1 per cent. Total American losses over the period thus shrank from 2.8 to 1.4 per cent.549 German fighter losses, meanwhile, moved from 122 (5.3 per cent) in January to 299 (10.3 per cent) in February, 240 (10.9 per cent) in March, to 384 (10.7 per cent) in May. The number of German fighter sorties flown each month rose from about 2,500 to only 3,600, 546 Koller, daily log, 25 June 1944, 133, BA-MA RL 2 I/24. 547 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 683-8. 548 File note on the meetings on fighters at the Reich marshal's office on 15/16 May 1944, Ia/Flieg No. 4041/44 g.Kdos., 19 May 1944, BA-MA RL 2 II/112. 549 Davis, Spaatz, Apps. 11, 13, 15. in no way matching the increase in the numbers the Americans were investing the battle. The losses inflicted on the enemy were having no deterrent effect whatsoever, while the Luftwaffe's own losses would very soon be impossible to sustain.550 Resides defending the skies above Germany, the fighter units were also aring a sizeable task on the land fronts, and the airspaces in question were inked like the physicist's communicating chambers. The fighters in the west more taxed far beyond their numbers fighting off the Allied bombing of the vonsport network, aircraft and aero-engine factories, V-I sites, bridges, rolling cock, airfields, radar sites, and finally coastal defences.
