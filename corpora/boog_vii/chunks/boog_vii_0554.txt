aft and aero-engine factories, V-I sites, bridges, rolling cock, airfields, radar sites, and finally coastal defences. Allied air activity in the a covered by Air Fleet 3 rose from 24,300 flights attacking or passing through in January to 87,400 in May. Against this, the number of serviceable craft in units stationed in the west-JG 2 and 26, NJG 4 and 5, and ZG I was in January only 155 day fighters, 21 night fighters, and 34 destroyers, and by late May 96 day fighters, 48 night fighters, and 37 destroyers. These figures represented 52, 50, and 65 per cent of the actual strength. These cumbers did not even begin to suffice to protect French airspace from Calais 10 Marseille (and on top of that for the destroyers to carry out convoy- protection missions in the Bay of Biscay). Because two fighter Gruppen were busy looking after merchantmen along the Atlantic coast, there were on D-Day in fact only some 50 fighters on call to oppose the landings. The multiplicity of tasks, for which there were clearly not the resources available, was due to the command structure in the west; this shows, under the II Fighter Corps general commander, two division staffs and four fighter controller staffs. Most of the destroyers were placed under X Air Corps. Seen against the number of incoming enemy aircraft, the tally of those shot down by the fighters was a mere drop in the ocean. In April there were 2,078 fighters dispatched to meet 51,300 attacking aircraft; 102 of these sorties resulted in 109 kills, while own losses totalled 52. In May 139 of the attackers were shot down for Tto German losses, from a total of 2,769 defending sorties. As a deterrent factor during the days of the invasion, the Luftwaffe's fighter force in the west had practically ceased to exist. 551 On the southern front in Italy, the fighter force that had from the summer of 1943 been greatly depleted for the sake of homeland defence but then strengthened again at the cost of the eastern front, had the task of guar
