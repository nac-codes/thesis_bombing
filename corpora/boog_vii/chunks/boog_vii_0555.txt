t in Italy, the fighter force that had from the summer of 1943 been greatly depleted for the sake of homeland defence but then strengthened again at the cost of the eastern front, had the task of guarding the supply lines, beating off enemy attacks in the army's area of operations, and providing fighter cover for the Luftwaffe's own attack units. In April 1944 the 120 serviceable fighters of I and II/JG 53, I/JG 4, and II/JG 77, together with I and II Italian fighter wings, really had only symbolic value in performing this wide range of duties. In late June 1944 there were only 83 fighters fit for action-51 per cent of nominal strength. Aircraft deliveries were inadequate, such that each of the six fighter Gruppen had only 26 instead of 68 machines. 550 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 688-9. 551 Ibid. 824-40.  302 I.II.
