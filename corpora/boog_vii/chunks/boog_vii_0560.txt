lable on the Italian front and on the western front when the invasion started. In early August the flak batteries had even risen to 113 heavies and 80 medium and lights. The use of smokescreens soon became ineffective when the bombing raids went on for so long that the stocks of chlorosulphonic acid needed to generate the smoke ran out. Despite all the defence's efforts, it was impossible to prevent the Allied air forces from halting the extraction and processing of mineral oil and its transport to Germany, even before the Red Army occupied Romania. 3INS NOISIA HOS ?*** (b) Night-Fighter Operations The picture looked very much better with the night fighters in their battle against the British bombers, of which a total of 'only' 40,798 invaded German airspace between January and May. In January 1944 Bomber Command made 6.278 sorties and in May 11,353, losing 314 and 274 aircraft respectively (5 per cent and approx. 2.4 per cent).556 Of these the night fighters shot down 268 in 554 Ibid. 846-54. 55 Saunders, Royal Air Force, iii. 225-7; Davis, Spaatz, 389, 400; Koller, daily log, 25 June 1944, 127, BA-MA RL 2 I/24; Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 846-9.

January for 59 losses of their own (4.1 per cent), and 163 in May with 41 I (3.1 per cent) losses.557 Over this period Luftwaffe sorties decreased in number from 1,436 in January to 1,266 in May. On top of its losses the RAF suffered during the first five months of 1944, a further 1,865 aircraft (4.5 per cent) damaged, half of them by flak. This net result, while considerably better than that of the day fighters, shows that things were going steadily worse for German defenders by night as well. Nonetheless there were individual gre successes, such as on the night of 19/20 February during the raid on Leipzig when 9.5 per cent of th
