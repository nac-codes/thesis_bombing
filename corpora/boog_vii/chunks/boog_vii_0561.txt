e going steadily worse for German defenders by night as well. Nonetheless there were individual gre successes, such as on the night of 19/20 February during the raid on Leipzig when 9.5 per cent of the 823 enemy bombers were downed, 74 of them b night fighters with only 17 losses of their own; on 24/5 March over Berlin when 8.9 per cent of the 811 bombers were brought down, 80 by night fighters by for only 14 losses; and the attack already mentioned on Nuremberg of the night of 30/31 March.558 This was the greatest success by the German night- fighter force during the war, and in particular that of the pursuit method. Loss rates around the 10 per-cent mark would for the RAF-as, indeed, for any air force-have been unsustainable in the long run. But results like these were only exceptions; against them, the German night fighters lost, betwee December 1943 and May 1944, 407 aircraft and 556 aircrew while bringing 1,100 enemy aircraft down.559 The crews were highly skilled and their repla- cements-through lacking flying hours and training-were no longer up to the same standard. The shift in the weight of the Allied large-scale raids from night to day, due in part to the nights getting shorter with the coming summer, took some of the load off the night fighters. While the British heavy bombers favoured dark nights, the increasingly numerous Mosquitoes flew their nuisance raids, in small numbers, even on bright moonlit nights. Over 22 nights in March more than 1,400 of these aircraft were counted, some of them coming from Italy; there was talk of 'the plague of Mos- quitoes'. They often, together with long-range night fighters, made attacks- timed to coincide with major bomber raids-on the forward night-fighter airfields in Holland and Belgium, harassing the German fighters as they took off and landed. After the RAF's setback over Nuremberg, large-scale, 1,100- bomber + operations against German cities did not start again until 22/3 April against DÃ¼sseldorf and 24/5 April
