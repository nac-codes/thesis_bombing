During the following night 300 bombers destroyed some 67 per cent of the town of Friedrichshafen, including in particular its industry producing tank-engine gears. 565 The Mosquito nuisance raids, conducted with as many as 100 aircraft 562 PÃ¶hlmann, Augsburg, 98 ff .; Middlebrook and Everitt, Bomber Command War Diaries, 476. 563 See pp. 97 ff. 564 Middlebrook and Everitt, Bomber Command War Diaries, 477-8, 484-5; Grabmann, Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 700-I. 565 See p. 140; USSBS, Report No. 86: Maybach Motor Works, Friedrichshafen, Germany, NA RG 243.

The 30 Fighter Division staff, which had been rendered superfluous when the single-engined night fighters were placed under the fighter divisions of I Fighter Corps in the middle of February,568 was dissolved on 16 March. This ended the life of the 'Wild Boar' units as a separate entity; since the middle of February these had repeatedly been misapplied after Luftgau commands had made their own faulty assessment of the situation. Most of the 'Wild Boar' pilots were in any case unsuited by their training to the demands of operating over wide areas in poor weather conditions; as a result they suffered high losses which, since they were sometimes flying at night the same aircraft that other fighter pilots were using during the day, severely reduced the lev
