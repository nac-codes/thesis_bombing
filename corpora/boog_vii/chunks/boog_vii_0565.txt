ather conditions; as a result they suffered high losses which, since they were sometimes flying at night the same aircraft that other fighter pilots were using during the day, severely reduced the level of serviceability of the day-fighter units. This division of labour between day- and night-fighter operations had proved not to be cost-effective, successful though 'Wild Boar' had been during the summer and autumn of 1943 (up to March 1944 its pilots had brought down around 330 enemy aircraft). It was hoped, by bringing the single- and twin-engined night fighters together in the fighter divisions with their much better view of the situation in the air, to make night fighting focused on the list of bombers' targets more effective. The staff of Fighter Sector Control Centre, set up on 8 March, was linked to eight night-fighter stations between Frankfurt am Main and Karlsruhe, and to two 'Y' ground control sites. Allocating this area to 3 Fighter Division at Deelen simplified air situation assessment and night-fighter control there as it did with the day-fighter opera- tion, the more so as RAF Bomber Command was now frequently approaching from France, crossing into German territory over the Upper Rhine.569 From the end of September 1943 the number of night fighters defending Reich airspace dropped by around 25 per cent to 242 twin-engined and 50 single-engined machines on 13 February 1944. This was due not to the with- drawal of units to be sent to other fronts, but to the lack of fresh supplies of aircraft due to installing the new LICHTENSTEIN SN2 AI radars in the supply depots that equipped new machines for squadron service.570 Night Fighter 566 See also Ch.
