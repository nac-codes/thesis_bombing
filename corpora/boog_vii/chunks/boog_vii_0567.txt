4 respectively (i.e. 64 per cent for the twin-engined and 63 per cent for the single- ongined aircraft). The actual strengths of the twin-engine units reached only 59 per cent, and single-engine units 55 per cent, of their nominal level, while only 28 and 34 per cent were serviceable.571 The average actual strength and serviceability level in May 1944 were 644 and 434 aircraft for the night-fighter force, and 533 and 311 for Air Fleet Reich: not a lot seen against the number of attacking British bombers, which had doubled or even trebled. The tactics and techniques of the air war at night developed further in the spring of 1944. In poor visibility and when there were strong winds, 'blind marking' aircraft using H2S navigation repeatedly set sky markers; more and more Allied bombers were equipped with H2S radar so that they could do their own navigation. If a target did not have the characteristics to provide a good HOS image, a conspicuous point further away was made a leading mark from which the target could be reached by flying on a precisely predetermined heading for a given time. Pathfinders measured the wind speeds on their approach to the target and passed them back to their base, which broadcast them to the bomber crews. To counter the German night fighters attacking from below with their Schr√§ge Musik cannons, the FISHPOND device was developed; this detected only aircraft flying at the same height or lower and displayed them on a CRT, with a range of 8 km. It could not, however, distinguish between friend or foe, and was thus of only limited value.572 From January 1944 I Fighter Corps noted the RAF's night bombers routing far out over the North Sea and Jutland in order to avoid the night fighters' areas of operation and leave the German defences unsure of the actual intended target 571 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 705 ff., 710 ff .; average serviceability of units, May 1944, ibid., RL 2 III/738. 572 Harris, Despatch, 122.  310 I.11.5.
