te changes ream of course that the bombers had not in fact made. This kind of masking of the itoes course of the main bomber force could be detected by combining fixes on their H2S signals; yet on many occasions the main target was identified too late to bring the single-engined fighters to above the bombers' destination in ti With an increasing number of bombers, the RAF could soon afford to time. several main forces to different targets at the same time. The H2S radaro increasingly fitted in the Mosquito formations flying diversionary missio sen which numbered up to 100 machines, made it more and more difficult for the German ground controllers to tell main and subsidiary raids apart. The radio ions, intercept service had to build up new expertise so as to discover, by taking bearings on the British heavy bombers' radar signals, where they were massing for their approach to a target. Meanwhile the night bombers were able, in April, to operate without suffering any great losses. Since the formations of Mosquitoes making subsidiary raids were, in terms of their flare-marking and concentration as well as their numbers, hardly different from those of the four-engined aircraft, the chances of telling one from the other also dwindled The only remaining clue lay in fixing their altitude, as the Mosquitoes flex much higher than the four-engined bombers, at more than 8,000 m. But since this height could be reached only by climbing as soon as they crossed the coast the slower speed this entailed was close to that of the heavy bombers flying straight and level, and still made it hard to identify the Mosquitoes.573 One of the German night fighters' main countermeasures was to speed up installation of the new LICHTENSTEIN SN2 wide-angle AI radar-in May the thousandth of these was delivered, where only 200 had been in use in early February-which made it possible to switch from target-area-focused fighter operation (which was already almost outdated) to pursuit tactics.
