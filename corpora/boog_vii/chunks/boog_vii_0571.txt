delivered, where only 200 had been in use in early February-which made it possible to switch from target-area-focused fighter operation (which was already almost outdated) to pursuit tactics. While the fighters usually infiltrated the bomber stream as it passed through the belt of HIMMELBETT fighter-control stations, when the situation in the air was unclear they were assembled at high altitude near suitably located radio beacons, as happened during the raid on Nuremberg on 30/1 March. To light up the target area there was one illuminator Gruppe for the twin-engined fighters and two auxiliary illuminator Staffeln for the single-engined ones, which improved the chances of success against the bombers over the target area.

A better prospect of detecting the enemy's course and target Mentions was also offered by the greater numbers of night fighters in the air Aservation Staffeln being fitted with NAXOS-Z and FLENSBURG radars, homing the bombers' H2S signals with their ranges of 50 and 100 km, and with her devices detecting the RAF's MONICA tail-warning radar. Combating the Mosquitoes was the special concern of Test Unit 410 at Venlo, which was nipped with Me 410s, He 219s, and Ju 88 R2s with GM-I booster kits (for urgen injection). It does not, however, seem to have had any success-up to Le end of June 1944 the whole of the night-fighter force shot down only 14 Mosquitoes. 574 The chances of success in pursuit were
