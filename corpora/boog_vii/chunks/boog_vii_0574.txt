d a great deal of damage on the Allied bombers England would they were taking off and landing; but there were not the fighters available had Hitler been able to raise any enthusiasm for this style of fighter defene as There was obviously no great willingness, either, to lose aircraft fitted with nor latest electronic gear over enemy territory.577 nce. the This was, however, exactly what happened with the Luftwaffe's important radar weapon for combating the British bombers, the LICHTENS ENST most SN2.578 This happening was a decisive factor in the decline of the homeland air defence that began in the summer, after the temporary upsurge enjoyed by night-fighters during the spring as a result of Schr√§ge Musik, the LICHTEN y the SN2 active AI gear, and the NAXOS-Z and FLENSBURG passive homing rada On top of this there was the enemy's sheer numerical advantage, plus h technical innovations in the 3-cm band which German radar technology was unable to catch up with all that quickly. It could not be said, therefore, that the night-fighter squadrons-equipped with up-to-date weapons quite capable of dealing with the bombers-were worn down or that their control structure broke down. The night-fighter defence was dealt the decisive blow by a chance event that had an immediate effect, and that gave a sudden spurt to the British technical lead that, in the spring of 1944, had been shrinking. On the morning of 13 July 1944 a Ju 88-GI of 7/NJG 2 stationed in Holland. and fitted with both LICHTENSTEIN SN2 and FLENSBURG, landed by mistake on the airfield at RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk. The British had been awar through ULTRA intelligence, of the existence of the new LICHTENSTEIN gear, and in March had more or less correctly estimated its wavelength as 2-3 metres; but the matter was not taken seriously enough when Bomber Command's opera- tions over Germany were in any case being scaled down to give priority to bombing invasion targets in the west.579 This was not the first LICHTENSTEIN
