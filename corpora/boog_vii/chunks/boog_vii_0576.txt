e, for a payment of 6 million curiss francs, into possession of 12 Me 109Gs: though these were fitted with ogines almost ready for the scrapheap, something for which Daimler-Benz had to pay compensation six years after the war was over. The Me 110 was blown up on 19 May by the Swiss, in the presence of German observers.581 The British, on the other hand, tested the wide-angle SN2 radar that had fallen into their hands, found that it worked on a frequency of 85 MHz, and within a few days began using longer aluminium strips that at a stroke brought to an end the immunity from interference that the German night fighters' LICHTENSTEIN SN2 had enjoyed for the previous eight months. It was, besides, ceglized that it could also locate a switched-on H2S radar. Similarly it was discovered from the FLENSBURG equipment that this could home on the RAF's MONICA tail-warning radar from as far away as 200 km. And finally the British found out how the NAXOS-Z gear worked. They stripped out most of the tail- warning radars that had been giving their bombers away, so that the night fighters could virtually no longer home on them.582 The Luftwaffe command had not foreseen the sudden technical defeat of this very important homing device, and right up to the start of invasion moved most of its night-fighter units to the periphery, on the assumption that from there it would be possible to infiltrate and attack each incoming raid from early on, and then set the single- engined fighters onto the already-mauled attackers above their brightly lit target. However much work was put into developing new AI and homing radars, the German night-fighter defence never recovered from this mortal blow.583 580 File note by Lt .- Col.
