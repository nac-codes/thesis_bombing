Air Defence, First Half of 1944 317 BINIS NOISIA HO> 2 **** (c) Flak Defences The flak artillery defending the skies of the Reich was still suffering from the effects of WINDOW on its WÜRZBURG tracking and gun-laying radars. In March 1944 the general of flak troops, Walther von Axthelm, was expressing 'deen concern' that not enough effort seemed to be being put into ridding his radars of the interference from the aluminium strips.584 A further problem wast of shifting concentrations of flak artillery, as rapidly as possible, to counter that the changing points of focus of the enemy attacks. The growing numbers of bombers making up the Allied formations, and their increasing concentration necessitated a closer amalgamation of flak batteries to form more powerful units of firepower working under central control-the 'big batteries' that the Americans feared. The introduction of the ZUG 44 control equipment was to provide up to 32 flak batteries simultaneously with the gun-laying data they needed, and by networking a number of radars the jamming of one of the could be circumvented. Since there was a lack of high-altitude fighters tackle the Mosquitoes flying at heights of around 10 km, the task was to to b taken on by the flak using the very latest weapons. The 88-mm Flak 105-mm, and 128-mm guns, together with the big 200-cm searchlights and electronic tracking devices, were ther
