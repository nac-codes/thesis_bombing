m, the task was to to b taken on by the flak using the very latest weapons. The 88-mm Flak 105-mm, and 128-mm guns, together with the big 200-cm searchlights and electronic tracking devices, were therefore concentrated to meet the danger ₹ 41 from the Mosquitoes making precision raids with OBOE within their operating range, especially in the Ruhr. The trouble was that the American daylight raids also called for the use of this more effective weaponry. The Allies' shift to bad- weather bombing coupled with jamming of the gun-laying radars was limiting how much the flak could do. Since the start of the Allied fighter-bomber and long-range fighter raids on airfields and railway trains and installations in the spring of 1944, there was a greater need for light and medium flak artillery to protect these.585 The reinforcement of the flak defences, which in 1944 as compared to 1943 saw an increased production of 8,402 (as against 6,864) heavy guns, 50,917 (as against 35,580) light guns, and Ind 5,757 (against 3,180) 150-cm and 200-cm searchlights, had, however, to be set against appreciable losses and a shortage of both munitions and personnel. At the same time the flak forces-like the fighter arm-was having to give up men from homeland defence to serve the needs of the invasion front. And finally, the heavy flak shells needed to pack more punch if they were to deal with the improvement in sturdiness of the Allied heavy bombers.586 584 GLM conference, 24 Mar. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/28, 8840. 585 Westermann, Ground-based Defenses, 45-6; 'Sonderkontrolle Fliegerhorste', LwFüSt Ia No. 4118/44 g.Kdos.
