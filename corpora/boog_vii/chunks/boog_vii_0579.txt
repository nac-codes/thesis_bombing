Over the months April to June 1944 the flak force lost 7 128-mm, 25 105-mm, 173 37-mm, 150 20-mm four-barrel, and 1,260 20-mm guns, together with around 170 each of directors and range-finders (Flakverluste II. Quartal 1944, BA-MA RL 2 III/628). To build up centres of flak defence, especially after the Allied raids in debruary on the aircraft industry, the homeland defence was between January early March given an extra 55 heavy mobile and 13 heavy fixed batteries, ansitioned mainly in the Luftgaue-VII (Munich), XI (Hamburg), and XVII buenna)-that had so far had inadequate anti-aircraft defences. This brought total of heavy batteries in the Reich to 1,368, of which 192 were fixed. By the beginning of May a further 124 heavy batteries were added. After the Alied bombing offensive on fuel supplies began, flak units protecting the Miration works and other important industrial sites and transport centres were given authority to fire at will at all heights, by day and night. On 21 June of orders were given for the main hydration plants to have the following minimum numbers of flak guns for their protection: Pölitz 200, Auschwitz 100, Hamburg 200, Brüx 170, Gelsenkirchen 140, Scholven 140, Wesseling 150, Heydebreck 130, Leuna 120, Blechhammer 100, Moosbierbaum 100, and påhlen 70. Until war's end, protecting fuel production was the flak force's main occupation. Additional safety was lent to the hydration works by the mass of smokescreen units and by the construction of decoy sites; during she seven raids on Leuna, for instance, the latter were hit more heavily than the Leuna plant itself. At the points where flak forces were concentrated there was a core of three big batteries each consisting of three standard batteries equipped with the modern types of artillery already mentioned.587 The Allied bomber crews feared the concentrated effect of these flak
