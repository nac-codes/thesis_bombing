three big batteries each consisting of three standard batteries equipped with the modern types of artillery already mentioned.587 The Allied bomber crews feared the concentrated effect of these flak cen- tres, as they caused a great deal of damage and wounding, even if not, initially, all that many total losses. When the 8th Air Force attacked hydration works in northern and eastern Germany on 20 June with around 1,400 heavy bombers, 40 aircraft in all were lost. More than 850 machines suffered damage, and dead and wounded crew members. The damage brought home a great many dea was attributed primarily to the flak;588 between January and April 1944 8,847 American bombers were damaged by flak, and only 948 by fighters, while two-thirds of the total losses (amounting to some 1,120) fell to the fighters. In the first three months of 1944 the British lost 179 bombers to flak and 321 to the fighters, while the corresponding figures for damaged aircraft were 462 and 245.589 Since 1942, on average, around 25 per cent of US bombers were damaged by flak, and about a third of their total losses were due to it.590 In May and June 1944 the flak victories outstripped those of the fighters, because the latter had become too few compared to the numbers of the Americans. 587 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 881-4; USSBS, Report No. 110: Oil Division, Final Report, appendix, 34, NA RG 243. 588 Freeman, Mighty Eighth War Diary, 272. 589 Westermann, Ground-based Defenses, 445; Renz, Flug-Abwehr, 193. According to Davis, Spaata, App. 1I, the Americans between January and April 1944 lost 1,376 heavy bombers flying against Germany; if the Mediterranean theatre is included, the figure is as high as 1,891. 590 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 894. According to Westermann, Ground-based Defenses, 525-6, between December 1942 and April 1945 54,539 or approx. 20% of the 8th US Air Force's aircraft and 11,954 or 8.5% of the 15th's suffered damage from flak, and of th
