I.II. Defending German Skies 318 I.11.5. Air Defence, First Half of 1944 Mosquito aircraft on OBOE raids could be effectively countered destructive fire from the 88-mm Flak 4Is, once the principle of the OBOR system had been understood;591 this demanded nine minutes of straight and by level flight from north to south (or vice versa) on the approach to the target at constant speed and altitude. Even in September 1944, however, Air Fleet Reich possessed only 41 guns of this type, and in February 1945 the flak artillery could muster no more than 287 of them.592 The roughly WÜRZBURG-D, 1,000 GIANT WÜRZBURGS, and 250 MANNHEIM plotting and e en tire gun-laying radars, with ranges of 30, 70, and 35 km respectively,593 were all y 2,500 wholly dependent for their operation on the WÜRZLAUS anti-jamming device In May 1944 this could not, however, be incorporated in the MANNHEIM gun laying radar; and so far, in any case, only 25 per cent of radar sets had been fitted with it. As has already been mentioned, WÜRZLAUS worked only against an average dispensing of WINDOW and with a 50 per-cer -cent drop in bearing accuracy, but was ineffective when large quantities of the foil strips w dropped. It was, basically, just as hard to overcome the interference the flak radars from American jamming transmitters, by switching to wider were frequency ranges (spot and island frequencies), as it was to beat WINDOW to Efforts were also made in collaboration with the navy to push ahead with centimetre-wave development.594 In the summer of 1944 Air Fleet Reich had eight railborne flak batteries to combat the deep-penetration raids on transport targets. The number of medium and light flak batteries rose from 612 to 644 from early May until the beginning of July, only to
