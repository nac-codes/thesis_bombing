ilborne flak batteries to combat the deep-penetration raids on transport targets. The number of medium and light flak batteries rose from 612 to 644 from early May until the beginning of July, only to dron back to 549 by the end of the year because of transfers to the eastern and western fronts.595 The imperviousness of the Allied heavy bombers to shell-bursts caused a change in the received opinion that a bomber could be brought down by a shell from an 88-mm exploding at a distance of up to 10 metres; it was now thought that this needed to be no more than 7 metres. Since, however, the enemy's jamming of the flak radars plus the increasing height and speed of the flying targets made accurate shooting impossible, the effectiveness of the heavy flak shells had to be improved. The Americans had already developed a proximity fuse, which was used first in the Pacific, then in summer 1944 in England against the V-Is, and from December 1944 also on the western front.596 To the same end the Germans produced the 'twin fuse', a combined time and impact fuse; but it could not be put to the test until April 1945, in a large-scale trial carried out during a raid in the Munich area. On that occasion the heavy flak, using the twin fuse, brought down 13 bombers for the expenditure of 370 rounds each; up to then 3,500-4,000 heavy rounds or 5,000-6,500 light 591 On this see Dahl, Bumerang, and diagram I.I.I. 592 Müller, Schwere Flak, 72; Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 884-5. 593 Müller, Schwere Flak, 211-12, 218-21. 594 See p. 197, and report on the meeting on radar, II Feb. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/42, 6139-42. 595 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 886-7. 596 Davis, Spaatz, 513. 319 - sounds had been needed for a single kill.597 The electronic proximity fuses sought out at the end of the war by Rheinmetall were not in time to have any 00 598 The flak defences were thus unable to bring about any reversal of ortune in the bombing war shortly before the war ended.
