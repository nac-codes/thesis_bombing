An American post- for study showed that, flying at an average height of 25,000 ft at 250 miles/h, wwerican bomber losses would have been 3.4 times as high as they actually Aure had the Germans had a proximity fuse for their AA shells. 599 Instead of waircraft per thousand, they would have lost 37; though even that would, of nurse, have meant no change in the outcome for the homeland air defence. Another road to greater effectiveness against the bombers lay in the development of anti-aircraft rockets; but the first test firings of the 7.8-m Long WASSERFALL during the first half of 1944 were a failure. There were also problems from shortage of fuel and labour. The SCHMETTERLING rockets development of which had been interrupted from 1941 to 1944) likewise got further than test firings. Trials with the RHEINTOCHTER initially went according to plan, but suffered a setback in March 1944. Work on the ENZIAN sent on in spring 1944. The very accurate GIANT MANNHEIM radar was Jo be used for pinpointing the rockets' airborne targets, and although its mlnerability to jamming had still not been overcome, 60 sets were put on order. Right up to the ENZIAN, wire-guiding of the missiles had not proved feasible; the problem of radar guidance had still not been solved, nor had that of a proximity fuse for the rockets. Nonetheless Milch saw flak rocket development, and tackling centimetre-wave technology, as urgent priorities, since flak was 'at the limit of its possibilities using powder munitions'. Even ifonly one in ten of the highly expensive rockets found its target, the outlay would be minimal compared to what conventional heavy flak was costing at the time. Lt .- Colonel Friedrich Halder, one of the main champions of flak rocket development, tried to make his project attractive by p
