inimal compared to what conventional heavy flak was costing at the time. Lt .- Colonel Friedrich Halder, one of the main champions of flak rocket development, tried to make his project attractive by pointing out that the firing of one WASSERFALL rocket consumed 1.5t of nitric acid, whereas bringing down one aircraft by firing 3,000 heavy 88-mm AA shells needed 16 t ofit, and in the case of the 88-mm Flak 41 as much as 18 t. Although with the lack of development work that had been done it was impossible to be at all sure that one or two WASSERFALL rockets would be enough to bring a bomber down, the straw of rocket development was clutched at, in spite of the knowledge of the horrendous amount setting up the firing sites would cost. For safety's sake Milch urged at the same time the development of the Kramer K4 and Henschel Hs 298 air-to-air missiles-small guided rockets akin to a 597 Renz, Flug-Abwehr, 193. According to Koch, Flak, 655, the Luftwaffe quartermaster-general reported in 1944, for each aircraft shot down, the consumption of as many as 16,000 rounds from the 88-mm Flak 36/37, 8,500 from an 88-mm Flak 41, 6,000 from the 105-mm flak gun, and 3,000 from the 128-mm gun. 598 Koch, Flak, 357. 599 Estimate of Effect on Eighth Air Force Operations if German Antiaircraft Defenses Had Used Proximity-Fuzed (VT) Ammunition, Report No. I, Operations Analysis, AC/AS-3, HQ Army Air Forces, Washington, 15 February 1947, Air Force Historical Research Agency 143.504-1.
