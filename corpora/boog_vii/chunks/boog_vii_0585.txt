six new project went ahead, even though it was known that the development capacity could cope with at most 50 per cent of the rocket motors and electronic steering devices. 600 There were nine rocket-motor projects alone, for fighter, flak, and other air-to-air missiles, for dealing with which there were only two firme Walter and BMW. The Luftwaffe command could not make up its mindon reducing the number of these projects, and now carried over its old problemo resource-sapping parallel developments and multiple types into the develo ment of the new rocket weapons. Solemn warnings about the impossibility the task, like those sounded by Oberstabingenieur Brée, 601 were brushed of of aside. This was probably due to the psychological atmosphere at the time brought about by the critical situation in the air over Germany. No one could tell exactly, at this juncture, which of the many developments offered the quickest path to success. In reality, given the circumstances of the final week of the war, the answer lay in the entirely inexpensive R4M rocket.602 As the day fighters were having hardly any effect, the flak artillery took on more and more importance; this was evident in an increase in the numberof heavy batteries from 1,368 on 9 March 1944 to 1,535 by 9 July, and in the expansion of the control organization particularly in areas around the hydra- tion plants, through increasing flak staffs and raising new ones. During period, in addition to the takeover of Luftgau XII (Wiesbaden) by Luftgau (Munich) on 1 January already mentioned, the HQ of 16 Flak Brigade in Vienna was reformed as that of 24 Flak Division. In June the HQ of 17 Flak Brigade was set up in Budapest, and the flak forces of the general of the Luftwaffe in Hungary placed under Air Fleet Reich. New HQs were formed for 2 Flak Brigade in Dessau, 7 Flak Brigade in Linz, and II Flak Brigade in Königsberg/East Prussia. In Munich 4 Flak Brigade became 26 Flak Division In all, the changes in the number of flak
