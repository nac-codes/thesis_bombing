formed for 2 Flak Brigade in Dessau, 7 Flak Brigade in Linz, and II Flak Brigade in KÃ¶nigsberg/East Prussia. In Munich 4 Flak Brigade became 26 Flak Division In all, the changes in the number of flak batteries defending Reich airspace were as follows (figures for 9 March and 9 July 1944): heavy batteries from 1,368 to 1,535, medium and light batteries from 5822/3 to 8442/3, searchlight batteries from 3251% to 3761/3, barrage-balloon batteries from 51 to 57, barrage batteries from 34 to 5, and smokescreen companies from 451/2 to 35. The further drop in the number of barrage batteries came about through the increasing equipping of these units with German flak guns and modern plotting devices and fire directors, which made them into fully fledged flak units. 603 600 GLM meetings, 24 Mar. and I May 1944, BA-MA RL 3/28, 8809-16, 8819, 8826 ff., 8833: Neufeld, Braun, 278-86. 601 See p. 233-4.

The personnel of construction units were also drafted in from the Reich Labour Service (RAD), and their former duties taken over by foreign workers. And the latter, too, could apply to serve in the Heimatflak. The situation worsened in July through 31,000 men havin
