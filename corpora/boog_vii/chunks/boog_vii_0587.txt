Reich Labour Service (RAD), and their former duties taken over by foreign workers. And the latter, too, could apply to serve in the Heimatflak. The situation worsened in July through 31,000 men having to be relinquished to the army. In August 1944 the anti-aircraft force as a whole had 662,000 troops and 448,700 auxiliaries, whose numbers included 221,890 RAD-Flak, Luftwaffe auxiliaries, and men and youths of the Heimatflak, and 128,710 female flak auxiliaries and RAD 'Maidens', together with 92,000 foreign personnel including 51,000 Russian prisoners of war. In all, its personnel numbered 1,110,700, making up more than a third of the Luftwaffe's total strength of around 2,890,000.604 In the west the flak had the task of preparing to deal with a possible Allied invasion and fighting off the bombing raids this would involve. It fell mainly on III Flak Corps under Gen. Wolfgang Pickert, previously commander of 9 Flak Division at Stalingrad. Between January and 24 June 1944 the flak forces of Air Fleet 3 increased from 245 to 414 heavy batteries, 326 to 444 medium/light batteries, and 35 to 36 searchlight batteries. On top of this were 12 barrage batteries and 24 railborne batteries, whose strength remained at about the same level. These increases were matched by an expansion in the command organization: spread over the Luftgau commands of Belgium/northern France and western France there were two flak divisions and five flak brigade HQs, and in July a further flak brigade was brought in from the Stuttgart area. The high proportion of fighters and light bombers among the aircraft shot down by fak fire are evidence of the predominantly deep-penetration activities of the Allied air forces; the successes of flak in the west, at 0.9 per cent of attacking aircraft, however, remained very modest. In the south the anti-aircraft artillery was used to protect lines of communication through northern Italy and, because the fighters had been withdrawn to defend the Reich, increasi
