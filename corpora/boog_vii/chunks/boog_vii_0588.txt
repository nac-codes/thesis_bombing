ained very modest. In the south the anti-aircraft artillery was used to protect lines of communication through northern Italy and, because the fighters had been withdrawn to defend the Reich, increasingly to give cover on the land front. Air Fleet 2, under the general of Flak Artillery South and the command of Luftgau XXXVIII (Milan), had at its disposal in early January 1944 155 heavy and 48 medium/light batteries and 14 searchlight batteries. By 24 July it had 178 German and five Italian heavy batteries, 89 medium and light batteries, 14 searchlight batteries, and seven smokescreen companies. Given the relatively modest flak forces in the south it is understandable that the kill rate 604 Koch, Flak, 298-323, 603; Boog, Luftwaffenf√ºhrung, 335. According to Westermann, Ground-based Defenses, 439, 14th Flak Division responsible for protecting Leuna had at that time 28,000 troops, 18,000 RAD personnel, 6,000 male and 3,050 female auxiliaries, 900 Hungarian and Italian 'volunteers', 3,600 Russian Hiwis, and 3,000 others, thus making up a total of 62,550 persons.

In the east the flak batteries formed the backbone of both anti-aircraft defence and of the battle on the ground against tanks. On that front there were more than nine flak divisions, in the southern sector, mostly under I Flak Corps, and in the centre under II Flak Corps; in sprin
