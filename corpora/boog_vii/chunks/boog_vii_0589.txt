nd of the battle on the ground against tanks. On that front there were more than nine flak divisions, in the southern sector, mostly under I Flak Corps, and in the centre under II Flak Corps; in spring 1944 this remained almost unchanged. Their kill rate was only insignificantly higher than on the southern front, and 80 per cent of the victories were against single-engined Russian aircraft. On 24 July 1944, when the anti-aircraft artillery was at strongest, the batteries were distributed over the various fronts as shown Table I.II.5. in Since the western front formed the main forward area for the defence of Germany's home airspace, the two fronts taken together saw the concent tion of 73.8 per cent of all heavy flak artillery, 68 per cent of all medium and light guns, and 87 per cent of the searchlights. In the skies over the Reich in spring 1944 the flak was for a while, thanks to more guns and a number of technical innovations, and despite the continuing vulnerability of its radars to jamming, somewhat more successful and had in practice become the main means of defence. Hitler, as he had before, held the flak in very high regard. especially since the number of kills it was achieving was, after the over- whelming of the German day fighters and the ever increasing numbers of bombers concentrated in the enemy formations, even in absolute terms higher than those by the flyers. With this upward trend, the flak defending the Reich in the first four months of 1944 shot down 314 American aircraft and damaged 19,563.605 The further expansion of the anti-aircraft defences went ahead against Göring's ideas on the subject. Hitler and Goebbels, however, over- emphasized the effect on public morale (of the unrewarding barrage firing in particular), which they considered to be very high.606 On 20 June 1944 Hitler 605 Westermann, Ground-based Defenses, 453-6; Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 898-914 606 Goebbels, Tagebücher, Pt. 2, xi. 164 (25 Jan. 1944), 201 (30 J
