Anti-aircraft guns were quicker to produce, and could be expected to bring about an improvement in the parlous situation in Germany's skies more quickly than fighter aircraft, which took longer to build. But flak would never be able to sweep the skies clear of the enemy, or to make any decisive change in the air war over the Reich. (d) The Luftwaffe and Invasion: The Fighter Defences Misused Hitler's political and military strategy (insofar as one could talk of such a thing) was in the spring of 1944 based on the hope-one might also say allusion-that the new weapons being developed, such as the V-I flying bomb, the V-2 rocket, the He 177 long-range heavy bomber, the Me 262 and Ar 234 jet aircraft, the anti-aircraft rockets, and in particular the new electric U-boats with their higher underwater speed, were going to change the course of the war in Germany's favour. In view of the expected Allied invasion in the west, he concentrated all available forces there so as to repel a landing at once: there was not enough operational depth in the western theatre to allow of any trading-off of space to gain time. This meant that in the east and south the fronts must at all costs be kept as far away from Germany's borders as possible so as to lessen the threat from the air, especially in the south. If the Allies were beaten in the west, so it was assumed, they would not risk any fu
