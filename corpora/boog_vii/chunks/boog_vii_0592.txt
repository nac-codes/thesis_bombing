as to protect them better from enemy attack. The Luftwaffe had already taken preparatory measures, codenamed 'Drohende Gefahr West' (imminent danger in the west), 'Dr.G.West', on 27 July 1943, that is, shortly after the Allied landing in Sicily, on the instruc- tions of its commander-in-chief. These orders were replaced by those of 27 February 1944, and amended many times between then and April to meet the changing situation.610 The uncertainty as to where an invasion would come led to defence plans being made for the entire western, southern, and south-eastern coasts of Europe, taking in southern Norway, Denmark. northern Germany, the Netherlands, the Channel coast, Brittany, the Bay of Biscay, the French Mediterranean seaboard, the Adriatic, Greece, and Bulgaria. Provisions were also made against Allied landings in Portugal and Spain A landing on the Channel coast was obviously seen as the most likely and presenting the greatest danger. Special attention was paid to the Pas-de-Calais area, since this offered the shortest path to the enormously important indus- trial centre in the Ruhr, and was where the Channel was at its narrowest. The terrain was also suitable for tanks, and the area was where the V-I and V-2 launch sites (which the enemy would probably want to knock out first) were concentrated. 611 These fears were heightened by the Allies feeding appropriate false information to the German secret services as part of the FORTITUDE SOUTH deception operation. 612 Hitler, and the Wehrmacht high command in particular, remained convinced right up to the end of July that the main landing was going to come in the Calais-Dunkirk region. The Luftwaffe operations staff, too, still believed this in the middle of June. The Allies suc- ceeded in spoofing the German signals intelligence with their fake radio traffic. and in preventing the Germans from carrying out photo reconnaissance in depth over their troop concentration area. Thus it was that the 'First US Army Group',
