ong-range reconnaissance aircraft; their range and meagre numbers were far from enough for waging an air war over the Atlantic. IX Air Corps, under Maj .- General Peltz (the erstwhile (leader of the attack against England'), was at Le Coudray, utterly exhausted. In the south of France, 2nd Air Division was equipped mainly with torpedo- bombers for attacking shipping in the western Mediterranean, and in late May had 72 aircraft operational. Maj .- General Junck's II Fighter Corps at Chantilly had command of all day- and night-fighter units in France.

The day-fighter force in northern France was weak, with only three Gruppen available; the heavy (twin-engined) fighters stationed in Brittany had to operate without a single-engined fighter escort. Some units were moved further south, since the constant strafing of their airfields by fighters accompanying the bomber streams was forcing them to take ake off too soon, with the result that later on their fuel reserves were insufficient for attacking the bombers. Finally, there was II Air Corps at Compiègne under Gen. Alfred Bülowius which, as mentioned earlier, was busy reorganizing the ground organization for later army-support operations and, consisting only of a HO staff possessing no fighter-bomber units, was thus unable to do more than plan ground support but not actually p
