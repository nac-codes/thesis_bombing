the ground organization for later army-support operations and, consisting only of a HO staff possessing no fighter-bomber units, was thus unable to do more than plan ground support but not actually practise it. Matters were much the same with III Flak Corps, which had had scarcely any opportunity to train for operating against tanks. 625 Ten days before the invasion Air Fleet 3 had an actual strength of 919 aircraft of all types, of which 510 were serviceable. This total was made up of 240 fighters, 360 bombers, 40 ground-support aircraft, 86 night fighters, 136 reconnaissance aircraft, and 57 destroyers or heavy fighters; of these respectively, 125, 198, 27, 51, 72, and 37 were fit for action. 626 This feeble force could offer no serious resistance to what Germany knew to be the overwhelming strength of the Allied air forces. General Junck had consequently been calling, from the end of April, for the planned reinforce- ment with fighters from the Reich air defence, in order to oppose the bombing of the bridges and railways. But the Luftwaffe high command needed them for defending the Reich against the raids on the German hydration works that had begun on 12 May. The planned transfer of 16 to 18 fighter Gruppen therefore had to be put off until the last possible moment. Being able to strip the Reich of its air defence in this way rested on the assumption that in an invasion the enemy would use all of its forces to support the crucial landing operations, and would not fly sorties over Germany. German air-war doctrine, too, demanded that all bomber forces be used to support the troops during decisive land battles. 627 The Allies, however, had so many aircraft that they could afford to mount a wide variety of operations, and thus give the German homeland no rest even while the battles around the bridgehead were going on. Without the planned reinforcements, the Luftwaffe in the west had on the day of the landings, 6 June 1944, only 319 serviceable aircraft, around 100
