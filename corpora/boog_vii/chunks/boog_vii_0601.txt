e the battles around the bridgehead were going on. Without the planned reinforcements, the Luftwaffe in the west had on the day of the landings, 6 June 1944, only 319 serviceable aircraft, around 100 of them fighters. Facing them were around 12,800 Allied aircraft of all types, of which 6,000-7,000 were fully serviceable; they were thus outnumbered 20 to I.

On the night of the landings a single FW 190 reconnaissance aircraft of KG 51 did manage to fly over the invasion fleet along the coast. 629 Another aircraft succeeded in dropping a bomb on the ship from which the Allied air operations were being controlled. The uncertainty as to the site of the main landing, , bad weather, and the Allies' absolute mastery of the air, together with the bomb-shattered German communications network, slowed down the planned reinforcing of the air defences. The move of fighter units from the Reich to France which finally began on 7 June took three days, and developed into a drama. Air Fleet Reich's failure to make it possible for a number of pilots to familiarize themselves beforehand with the position of the airfields and landing grounds allotted to them, and the courses to fly to reach them, proved a grave error. Many of the airfields had in the meantime b
