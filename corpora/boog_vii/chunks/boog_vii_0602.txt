e themselves beforehand with the position of the airfields and landing grounds allotted to them, and the courses to fly to reach them, proved a grave error. Many of the airfields had in the meantime been bombed into unusability, and the alternative landing grounds could not be found or were not known. The day-fighter pilots had in Germany been stationed on well- maintained and well-equipped airfields, so they experienced difficulties with navigating on their own: back at home they had had radio and radar to Head them by the hand'. During their flight to France, however, they had to keep radio silence. On top of that, a large part of the radio communications system in France was out of action; Air Fleet 3's landline telephone and telex network had been largely destroyed by saboteurs from the moment the invasion began. At times, senior commanders were out of contact with their units. The air defence of the homeland was now looked after only by the four fighter Gruppen that had stayed behind, and by a few smaller training units and factory squadrons-in all, around 180 single-engined and 150 twin- engined fighters, some of them with inexperienced crews; while the units that had flown to France had been so scattered, and had suffered such losses during the move, that they too no longer represented the fighting force they had been back in Germany. So as not to be detected by the enemy radar and attacked by Allied fighters they had flown low, often lost their way, and failed to find their landing places. In the search for their airfields many ran out of fuel, so that the pilots had to take to their parachutes. Others crashed on landing on a bomb-damaged runway, while some were shot down by their own anti- aircraft defences. 630 Out of 57 fighters who left Wiesbaden for Evreux, only 628 Gundelach, 'Drohende Gefahr West', 317-18; Galland, The First and the Last, 284-302; Priller, J.G. 26, 224-6; Davis, Spaatz, App. 9, puts the USAAF strength in Europe in July 1944 at 10,343
