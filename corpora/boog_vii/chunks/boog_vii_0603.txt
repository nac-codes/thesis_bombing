Air Defence, First Half of 1944 three got there; 47 landed elsewhere, some of them crashing, while seven disappeared without trace. Twenty-two FW 190s were meant to fly from Cologne to Villacoublay, but only two arrived. 631 The whole operation was a disaster, not least because the high losses suffered during the transfer later appreciably weakened the air defence of Germany itself. It is thus not surprising that the reinforcement of Air Fleet 3 with 18 fighter Gruppen, and some 800 aircraft, allowed an increase in the number of sorties flown in a day only from 156 to 378 on the day after the landings, and 420 on 8 June. The number then fell to 34 on 19 June, to rise again by the 30th to 645 fighter sorties out of an air fleet total of 709. The daily average tally of fighter sorties was 366 in June and 346 in July, with the foe-to-friend ratio remaining constant at around 20 or 25 to 1. The hopeless situation showed no change. 632 On an average day the fighters were losing 38 of their number; up to 2 July the total lost was 1,040.633 Over this period only roughly the same number of new fighter aircraft were delivered, which makes the continued weakness of the fighter defence in the west easy to unders
