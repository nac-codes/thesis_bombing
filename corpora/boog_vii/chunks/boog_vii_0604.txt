the total lost was 1,040.633 Over this period only roughly the same number of new fighter aircraft were delivered, which makes the continued weakness of the fighter defence in the west easy to understand. Not a single one of Hitler's high-speed jet bombers ever roared across the Normandy beaches; it was not until late in July that a few of them carried out fighter-bomber sorties in France. 634 As the commander of Jagdgeschwader 26, Col. Josef Priller, was to write after the war, the German fighters instead of being the hunters became the hunted: in his words, the Jagdwaffe became a Gejagtwaffe. 635 Very soon Air Fleet Reich, to whose area battle-weary fighter units were pulled back to recuperate, simply took them back, as they were now needed to strengthen its own numbers. The 'massive blow' planned for the first hours of an invasion had remained a pipe-dream. In July Hitler inflicted a fresh haemorrhage on the fighter force by ordering the dispatch to the west of a further 800 aircraft from the home defence's reserve, clearly against the better judgement of Gen Koller, who had already spoken out against any further weakening of the Reich's air defences. The fighters moved red forward straight into a German retreat; for the 25 of the enemy's aircraft they managed to shoot down, more than 400 of them crashed on landing, blew up, or fell to the enemy-a fiasco all over again.636 III Flak Corps found itself facing different major difficulties when, not until the afternoon of 6 June, it received orders to move from the Somme-Scheldt area east of the Seine to Caen to the west of it.
