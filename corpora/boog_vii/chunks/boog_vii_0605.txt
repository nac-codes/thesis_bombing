Virtually unhindered by the German fighters, the Allied air operations to seal off the region where the land battle was being waged, by severing the approach routes by rail and road, were highly effective, as were the raids deep behind the front on German marching columns and transport movements during the daylight hours. They critically curtailed the mobility of armoured units, slowing down their transport to the front from deep inside France and preventing their being used in force. The summer nights were too short to make up the time lost by day. W
