ility of armoured units, slowing down their transport to the front from deep inside France and preventing their being used in force. The summer nights were too short to make up the time lost by day. When air combat units are all but absent, this does still have an effect on their own land forces-a very adverse one. In its efforts to break through the enemy air screen and attack the Allied troops and their landing craft, II Air Corps (the only large close-support group in the west) relied entirely on the fighters of II Fighter Corps; and the latter's weakness soon made it impossible to mount such attacks. Moreover, the fighter-bomber pilots, who just before in Germany had been fighter pilots, were having great difficulty with their new role because they had had no training to get them used to it. The loss rate among German fighters more or less matched that of the Allied air forces. Since for the incomparably weaker German side this was far more serious than it was for the numerically much superior Allies, the decision was taken to avoid air battles. From 13 June, therefore, the main task of the fighters was to protect German supply lines and ground troops from Allied attack. On I July II Air Corps was finally disbanded and was absorbed into II Fighter Corps, whose earlier commander, Gen. Junck, was replaced by Gen. BÃ¼lowius. In the meantime 350 German aircraft had been destroyed on the ground by the bombing of 117 of their airfields alone. The bombing of radar sites meant that the German HQs had less and less of an overview of what was happening in the air. And the Luftwaffe's situation in the west was worsened still further by the Allies quickly setting up airfields inside their bridgehead. 638 The Luftwaffe's attack arm in the west, its bombers, played hardly any role, for they could operate only at night and the radio-guidance system for the new glider bombs was being jammed.639 Their own flak had long been unused to there being German aircraft in the night sky,
