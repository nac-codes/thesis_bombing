range He 177 bombers, only 30-40 per cent were serviceable; they were not a great deal of use, since with a full bomb-load their range was restricted, but nonetheless London was hit twelve times during the days of the invasion, and Southampton three times. These, however. amounted simply to nuisance raids. By 26 June the total number of bombers in the west had fallen by 27 per cent to 338, of which only 200 were serviceable The number of German aircraft in action each day averaged only 142, and on 29 June was, at 88, as low as on the first day of the landings. The bulk of the German bombers were being employed in Russia, where the Soviets had launched their big offensive on 22 June.640 The resumption of air raids on the German hydration works by the RAB on 12/13 June and the Americans on the 28th forced the Luftwaffe to shuttle its day fighters back and forth between France and the Reich.

On the day before Do 217 bombers with remote- controlled glider bombs had tried to halt the American advance by destroying bridges, after a flight by the new Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance aircraft had revealed the full extent of the breakthrough.641 Such reconnaissance flights had 640 Price, Last Year of the Luftwaffe, fig. between pp. 96 and 97, and 60-I; Gundelach, 'Drohende Gefahr West', 322, 324-8; Gaul, 'Luftwaffe während der Invasion', 143-4; Report 74, BA-MA, RI 8/65; Alfred Bülowius, 'Das II.
