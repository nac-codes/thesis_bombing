ecious as this was for the night fighters. The German war industry's supplies of chromium and wolfram from Spain were also now at an end, and the U-boat war had henceforth to be run from new bases set up in a far less advantageous position in Norway. Worst of all for the Luftwaffe in the immediate, however, was that the Allied raids on the hydration works producing fuel for its aircraft could now become more and more intense and more and more effective.643 This forced it to reduce its consumption of aviation fuel, between June and September, by two-thirds. While the burden fell first on the bombers and pilot training, the cutbacks soon affected the fighter arm as well, and with it the defence of Germany herself. On 5 September 1944 limitations had to be imposed on the flying activities of II Fighter Corps.644 What Speer, the armaments minister, had been warning Hitler about in his second memorandum on hydration on 28 July 1944-that 'making a systematic use of the Luftwaffe could become a total impossibility'645-now began to happen. from the figures given in Balke, KG 2, ii. 361-2, of the low numbers of sorties flown and bombs dropped by KG 2.
