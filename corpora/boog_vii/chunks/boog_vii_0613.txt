11 May 1944 that for the following acts downed enemy flyers were to be shot without trial: 'I. shooting at German aircrew hanging from a parachute; 2. low-level strafing of aircraft that had made an emergency landing when members of its crew were in the immediate vicinity; 3. making attacks on public-transport railway trains; 4. low-level strafing of individual civilians.'650 Points 2 and 3 were undoubtedly open to question, since an emergency landing could be made in the midst of a battle, and it was not a simple matter for a fighter pilot to know whether a passenger train was not also carrying troops.

Valuable hints were gained of planned enemy bombing operations and shifts of target emphasis; and the interrogators learned of new bombing techniques, aircraft types, and equipment that were of use for their own air defence, enabling it to improve its performance and save men and materials. It would be counter to the purpose of the war if the treatment of enemy airmen who have baled out were to lead to friction between the Wehrmacht an
