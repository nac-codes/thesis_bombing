ers guilty or suspected of 'attacks contrary to international law' should be handed to the SD for 'judgement by a court-martial and carrying out of the sentence' since 'it is then a matter of prosecuting for murder, something the enemy themselves have forbidden to their aircrew'.653 Such were the Luftwaffe command's attitude and requirements on the matter in late 1944. In the meantime, however, the Luftwaffe's activities in respect of PoWs had been passed over to the Reich leader SS and commander of the Replacement Army. Himmler, after Göring had felt he could no longer take responsibility for them because, on Himmler's and Hitler's orders and bypassing Göring, 58 of the British airmen who had broken out of Stalag Luft III at Sagan had been shot 'for resisting'.

She felt it honourable for healthy young men to go knowingly to their death in order to save the lives of thousands of soldiers and civilians.
