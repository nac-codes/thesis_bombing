n electricity works than against the invasion fleet; this Speer passed on to Hitler on 28 July. Reitsch and Skorzeny did, however, pursue the kamikaze plan further for a while. Galland's view was that there was no need to sacrifice oneself ramming an enemy aircraft-if you could get that close, you were close enough to shoot at it and had a chance of getting back down alive.655 In I Fighter Corps this idea was already being put into practice. Already in late 1943 the pilots had suggested to Galland the ramming of enemy planes, with losing one's life as a consequence. When he turned this down, as appealing perhaps to the Japanese mind but not to the German, the idea (argued particularly by Maj. Hans-GÃ¼nter von Kornatzki) nonetheless led to the formation of an elite fighter unit. It was given FW 190s fitted with four 20-mm (later, two 20-mm and two 30-mm) cannons and armour-plating round the cockpit. The first unit was IV(Sturm)/JG 3, the 'Udet'. The 'Storm Gruppe' designation was derived from the 'storming' concept from the First World War; there, the enemy lines bogged down in trench warfare were suddenly attacked at their weakest point by storm troops, thrown into disarray, and torn apart. In May 1944 this first German day-fighter Sturm Gruppe, drawn from volunteers, was solemnly tasked 'in every sortie that resulted in contact with enemy four-engined bombers, to attack them from the closest possible range, and if one's fire did not succeed in bringing them down to destroy the enemy by ramming'. The pilots of the Sturm Gruppe were called to the special duty of defending the people of their homeland with life and limb, and to the very end. A further two Sturm Gruppen were formed in the summer of 1944.656 Such desperate measures did not of course bring any decisive change to the situation in the skies over Germany, as matters were simply too far gone. Those in command, too, recognized the fact. Overall, between January and May 1944, the fighter arm lost 2,262 pilots,
