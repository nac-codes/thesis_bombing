erienced leaders In almost no instance had it been possible to prevent the mass of attacking bombers from reaching their target or dropping their bombs on it. Twenty days later he was again stressing the numerical superiority of Germany's enemies on all fronts, plus the technical superiority of those i e in the west. As well as combating the bombers, there were now their fighter escorts to contend with. He spoke again of the mastery of the air the enemy enjoyed in both time and space. Only at night, because of the short summer nights, were things still in the Germans' favour. 659 To overcome the ominous state of affairs in the skies by day he believed that 'an enormous amount could be done with a small number of technically much superior aircraft such as the Me 262 or Me 162' He would sooner have one Me 262 than five Me 109s.660 This was echoing what had been said by the Luftwaffe general staff back in September 1941: 'If at all, the German Luftwaffe can triumph over its British American opponent in the air only by means of superiority in the excellence of its armament', for instance, by the rapid further development of jet pro- pulsion; in short, qualitative superiority.661 A similar thought was voiced by Hitler on 9 Feb. 1942: 'If today I were to get a bomber that can fly 750-800 kilometres, then I would have the upper hand ... It would have to be a lean forward far exceeding what we have at the moment.'662 Both of them, Galland and Hitler, together with many others of those in charge, were at that time grasping for technical advantage through a new kind of aircraft, one that would provide a sheet anchor. 663 Galland had flown the Me 262 jet fighter for the first time on 22 May 1943, was greatly taken by it, and believed in it.
