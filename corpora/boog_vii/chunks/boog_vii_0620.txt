As the general of fighters, Galland was naturally thinking only of the fighter version; Capt. Wolfgang Späte from Test Unit 16, on the other hand, who had flown the aircraft a month earlier and was similarly enthusiastic, could see it both as a very much better fighter and as a fighter-bomber. Galland and Milch, however, set things in motion; Col. Petersen was made commissar for the Me 262, which was now to be built as a fighter under a 'crash programme'. Prof. Messerschmitt, on the other hand, wanted to keep his conventional Me 209, at least as a high-altitude fighter, and from fear of having to plunge into the new technology with all its imponderables (which would undoubtedly have a financial downside) argued against his new creation, the Me 262. It would, he said, use too much fuel. It had not yet been shown that jet engines were suited to high altitudes. He further explained to Hitler on 27 June 1943 that the aircraft could later be used as a bomber. Milch, in his concern always to be 100 per-cent safe from criticism from above, gave way to Hitler, who had been rendered somewhat uncertain by Messerschmitt's assertion. Though Milch felt that when in a defensive posture one must give priority to the
