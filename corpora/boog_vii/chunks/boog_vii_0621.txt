e from criticism from above, gave way to Hitler, who had been rendered somewhat uncertain by Messerschmitt's assertion. Though Milch felt that when in a defensive posture one must give priority to the defence side of things-that is, the fighter version-he shared the aversion to the new technology. Since Hitler too was looking at jet engines more from the bomber aspect, the technical general staff officers Loßberg and Diesing, for their part, advocated the fast bomber version. According to the former this should have been worked on very much earlier, while Diesing claimed it would have a decisive effect. Messerschmitt quietly let work continue on the piston- engined Me 209. It was not until July 1943 that, in terms of the designers and draughtsmen allocated to it, the Me 262 clearly had the upper hand over the 209.665 Now Peltz too, quoting Hitler's earlier demand for speed in February 1943, was calling for the jet bomber based on the Me 262 for his attacks on England, for which conventional bombers were too slow. Koller confirmed that, in agreement with Göring, the carrying of bombs by the Me 262 was still planned, and that the amount of work needed for such a bomb-carrying aircraft would be less than with earlier models.666 He too was looking forward to substantial success from its use as a bomber; this of course matched his attack-oriented approach to air warfare. At the same time he was not 664 Letter from Galland to Milch, 25 May 1943, BA-MA RL 3/54, 2620 (photocopy in Irving, Tragödie, pl. following p. 336 [not in Rise and Fall]); GLM conference, 25 Feb. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/ 20, 5430 ff.
