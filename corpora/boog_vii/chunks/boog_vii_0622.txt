He gave the design less chance as a ground-support aircraft, not least because of its high fuel consumption at low altitudes. I In his proposal for the Me 262 he steered a carefully chosen middle path: speed up series production as a fighter capable of carrying a bomb-load. Finally Milch too had told Goring and Korten on 3 November 1943 that 'the use of the Me 262 as a fighter-bomber [was being] demanded from the outset'.667 The Me 262 project's not having so far proceeded further was due quite generally to the technical difficulties inherent in all new developments of this kind, and probably also to the fact that until well into 1943 the performance of the conventional Me 109 and FW 190 fighters seemed good enough. Galland also notes that, before the longer-range American escort fighters appeared on the scene, Hitler was unwilling to push the construction of the Me 262 too fast too soon because of the teething troubles usually encountered with new projects. 668 The first hundred Me 262s of the pre-production series were now to be ready by May 1944, with full production due to start at Regensburg and Augsburg in November, although the labour force was still as much 1,000 under strength. When Göring told Hitler this on 27 October 1943 the as latter 'nearly had a stroke'. Hitler wanted to use the jet aircraft to fight off the invasion, and already had a
