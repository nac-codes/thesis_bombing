l as much 1,000 under strength. When Göring told Hitler this on 27 October 1943 the as latter 'nearly had a stroke'. Hitler wanted to use the jet aircraft to fight off the invasion, and already had a clear picture in his mind of how this would be done. While there was still confusion as the enemy landed and unloaded their heavy weapons on the beach, these fast aircraft-and there need be only a few of them-would break through the expected strong fighter cover and dron their bombs into the middle of the chaos. Accuracy of bomb-aiming and the size of the bombs would not be crucial. To begin with Milch did not pay special attention to the fact that the Me 262, generally seen in the Luftwaffe as a fighter, was to carry bombs; after all, conventional fighters did that, when operating as fighter-bombers. Prof. Messerschmitt had in any y case assured Göring that the attaching of bomb-racks had already been provided for, and 'could be easily done' within a couple of weeks. 669 At the demonstration of the Me 262 at Insterburg on 26 November 1943, Hitler asked for the new jet first of all as a high-speed or Blitzbomber, and only secondarily as a fighter; he was once again assured, without contradiction from the Luftwaffe top brass present, that the machine could carry bombs, even though no start at all had been made on the technical modifications needed for this. The desire for a Me 262 high-speed bomber was, however, shared within the Luftwaffe as well, bv Col. Peltz and Col. Herrmann. Hitler's demand that the machine be able to carry bombs had no effect at all on production at this stage, as the aircraft had not even been fully developed.670 667 GenStdLw No. 1587/43 g.Kdos., BA-MA RL 37/2697. 668 Schabel, Wunderwaffen, 200; Galland, The First and the Last, 349-62; Toliver and onstable Galland, 216. 669 Reich marshal's conference, 2 Nov. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/61, 5962 ff 670 Schabel, Wunderwaffen, 177-92, 200; Boehme, JG 7, 186-7.
