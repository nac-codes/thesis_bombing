stable Galland, 216. 669 Reich marshal's conference, 2 Nov. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/61, 5962 ff 670 Schabel, Wunderwaffen, 177-92, 200; Boehme, JG 7, 186-7. GÃ¶ring now ordered on 6 I 16 December 1943 that, using the Luftwaffe's own 341 resources to overcome the problems of materials and manpower, manufacture of the Me 262 as a bomber was to be pressed ahead with so that some of them could already be deployed at the front as jet fighter-bombers in the spring of 1944.671 Hitler had, he said, described any delaying of the jet aircraft pro- gramme as 'irresponsible misjudgement of the facts'. In the spring of 1944 producing armaments for the Luftwaffe was still separate from that for the rest of the Wehrmacht; management of manpower was divorced from it and in the hands of the Gauleiter Fritz Sauckel, and 60,000 men were taken from the aircraft industry to serve in the Wehrmacht. In short, as Schabel says, there were competing bodies getting in each other's way, and this caused further delays. Production of the other jet bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, the Arado Ar 234, was for instance held up because the firm was still having to build the four-engined version of the He 177 long-range bomber and thus had hardly any workers to spare for the jet bomber.672 Meanwhile the Me 262 continued in the industrial planning to be a fighter, though it seemed able to fill both roles. In the spring of 1944 the problems with this machine were not to do with arguments about how it was later to be employed, but with all kinds of obstacles to series production. Since the Speer decree of 17 Jan. 1944 it enjoyed priority ranking, together with the Ar 234, even ahead of the manufacture of self-propelled assault guns and the V-I and V-2. In the Luftwaffe itself the Me 262, Ar 234, Me 163B rocket-propelled fighters, and the Do 335 as a twin-engined fighter/destroyer/high-speed bomber, had first priority, followed by the Fi 103 (the V-1).673 The Me 262, Milch told representatives from the armament
