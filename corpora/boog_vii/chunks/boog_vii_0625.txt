The other things can be an enormous help, but they can't do the same for us.'674 There were still difficulties with the turbine rotor blades of the Tumo 004; the engineers had been too hasty in trying to use a new technology in large-scale production. The air raids on the aircraft factories brought further delays, even though the Fighter Staff classed speeding up jet aircraft pro- duction as one of its most important tasks, for it was calculated that from the autumn of 1944 the British and Americans, too, would be using jet aircraft. 675 At the beginning of May it was clear that instead of the 20 Me 262s planned for that month it was going to be possible to deliver perhaps only ten of 12.676 Göring accordingly called the heads of the Luftwaffe together on the 671 Telex to Milch, BA-MA RL 3/51, 725. 673 Ibid. 219. 672 Schabel, Wunderwaffen, 213, 216. 674 Secretary of state/GLM//RuK meeting, 19 Jan. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/32, 1153. 675 RLM and C-in-C of the Luftwaffe, Technical Office, GL/C No. 100545/44 geh.
