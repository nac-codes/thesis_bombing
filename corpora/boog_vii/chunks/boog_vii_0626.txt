first time the role of co-ordinator between the tactical and technical sides, areas of command that. since Milch's temporary loss of power in the summer of 1937, had in the Luftwaffe led a separate existence.678 Designated as principal aircraft types on the first day were the Ar 234 as a jet reconnaissance plane, the Me 262 as a jet fighter, and the Ju 287 as a four-engined jet bomber. Despite Hitler's call for the Me 262 to be built as a high-speed bomber, it continued as a fighter. This led to a major altercation when Hitler asked Milch how many bombs the Me 262 could carry, and the latter replied, 'None, mein Führer, the Me 262 is . . . being built exclusively as a fighter'.679 Hitler flew into a rage, furious that his order of six months before for a Blitzbomber had been ignored. During the heated exchange Milch answered with 'Mein Führer, the smallest infant can see that this is a fighter, not a bomber aircraft!'680 This, and Milch's subsequent arguing- back, was to cost him his post as Generalluftzeugmeister.681 Milch, on the other hand, claimed later that he had 'organized himself out of the job, and deliber- ately'. 682 There is probably truth in both of these versions. Milch had long been able to see where things were going, even though he often sought to fill his staff with false optimism, and his relationship with Göring, whose lifestyle and way of working he frequently criticized harshly, was not good.683 The Me 262 had become the virtual centre of the longstanding fighter- versus-bomber controversy. Göring, in his slavish servility to Hitler who had condemned having 'too few' bombers as 'totally unacceptable', now forced the dictator's will on the Luftwaffe command even though it was found, for instance, that the aircraft could not be converted to the fighter-bomber role without strengthening of the undercarriage. Up to then the move had simply been to carry on with the machine, as it were surreptitiously, as a fighter, while letting Göring and Hitler
