Up to then the move had simply been to carry on with the machine, as it were surreptitiously, as a fighter, while letting Göring and Hitler believe it would be a high-speed bomber. Göring now accused the Luftwaffe high command of being a 'military midden', and ordered once again that the main emphasis should been on the rapid series- manufacture of jet aircraft and engines, as this would make it possible 'to bring about a quite decisive change in the air war in our favour'.
