s surrounding Göring tended to look on jet propulsion as to be used in an offensive, bomber role rather than defensively as a fighter. And as development of the Me 262 was also much further advanced than that of the real jet bomber and reconnais- sance aircraft, the Arado Ar 234, the role fell-given the worsening situation in the air-primarily on the Me 262. Galland naturally still focused his thoughts on the fighter. Thus there were from the start two attitudes to the Me 262 in the Luftwaffe, which Göring himself sometimes got badly muddled-as when at one of his meetings he said: 'At all events the Führer urgently wants jet fighters . .. er ... fighter-bombers.'688 All Hitler was basically doing was to 684 Schabel, Wunderwaffen, 230-1.

His instruction that the Me 262 should at first be produced only as a jet bomber surprised no one, and actually caused no delay in the aircraft being introduced as a fighter.689 On 22 June 1944 the Me 262 programme was given a very emphatic special status; Hitler called on the entire German arms industry to support it. It must no longer 'depend on conditions', but 'be dictated by the needs'.690 These words bring inevitably to mind what was the Achilles' heel of the German conduct of the war and the arms effort-the failure to match military and political aims with the economic feasibilities, the disregard for the relationshi
