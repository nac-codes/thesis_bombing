r had to lose out to the other 'customers' in the fight for materials and labour. Yet in June 1944 development of the Me 262 was still not far enough advanced for it to be described as ready to go into service. The turbine rotors, with their guide vanes made from a brittle Tinidur alloy, were still not right. Blade fractures were common. During casting, up to 90 per cent of the blades produced were at first 689 Both Schabel, Wunderwaffen, 160-92, and Boehme, JG 7, 249, have demonstrated this convincingly. Galland, The First and the Last, 335-6, takes a different view. 690 Fighter Staff meeting, 22 June 1944, BA-MA RL 3/8, 4174-5, 4186; Deutschlands Rüstung 388; GLM conference, 30 June 1944, BA-MA RL 3/29, 9185-93; Schabel, Wunderwaffen, 234. 691 Osterkamp, Durch Höhen und Tiefen, 281. 692 KTB OKW, i. 1090-2; Boog, Luftwaffenführung, 21-2.

No more than 25-30 hours of working life could be guaranteed for the rotors. New hollow blades, made from cold-drawn sheet, could not be expected before the autumn of 1944. These difficulties stemmed to a large extent from the Reich's shortage of raw materials. A delivery target of 60 Me 262s was finally planned for July 1944, rising to 500 by December. While this superior jet aircraft could thus not be delivered in any appreciable numbers until the end of the year, the trials of the machine by the Me 262 test unit of Capt. Werner Thierfelder, too, could not begin until May of that year, and then with only a handful of aircraft.693 In the meantime the Allied air raids on the hydration works were already ushering in a fresh problem: a shortage of fuel. The fact that under all these adverse circumstances production of the Me 262 nevertheless slowly began in May 1944 with eight aircraft, with 124 built in December and 564 over the whole year, was a great achievement by the industry
