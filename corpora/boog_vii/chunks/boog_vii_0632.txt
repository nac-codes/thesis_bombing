dverse circumstances production of the Me 262 nevertheless slowly began in May 1944 with eight aircraft, with 124 built in December and 564 over the whole year, was a great achievement by the industry and Luftwaffe, even though because of various shortcomings only 75 per cent of them passed the quartermaster-general's acceptance inspec- tions. 694 Even these aircraft still had their teething problems. It is surprising that the myth is still widespread-though not among professional historians- that the Me 262 could have been introduced earlier in huge numbers if Hitler had not wanted to have it built as a high-speed bomber. From the production- engineering viewpoint this order could at that time have played no part at all, since the main problem was still with the turbines. Galland, for example, expressed the view that the machine could have been built years before. Baumbach, previously the general of fighters, writes that it would have been possible to bring a halt to the Allied bomber offensive if production of the jet fighter had started six months sooner. Koller, too, said after the war that the Me 262, had it been ready in time, could have saved the air war. Even Kesselring shared this view. Speer spoke about a lack of interest in the jet fighter among the top leadership, which according to Galland delayed bringing it into service by a year-and-a-half. Johannes Steinhoff and Below, too, mis- judged matters. Hitler gets the blame for the Me 262 'coming too late', when it could have altered history in the skies over Germany. But as Boehme695 and Schabel696 have shown, the 'miracle aircraft' could not have been built earlier in large numbers even without Hitler's interference, and with the small numbers available to frontline units right up to the end of the war it could not have brought any change to the bombing offensive over Germany. One need only remember that the British and Americans too were developing jet aircraft and could produce them unhindered and with
