ld not have brought any change to the bombing offensive over Germany. One need only remember that the British and Americans too were developing jet aircraft and could produce them unhindered and with no raw-materials or labour problems, and if the war had lasted longer would have brought them into action in far greater numbers; yet even their projects, though they had started 693 Schabel, Wunderwaffen, 233-7; Boehme, JG 7, 45-6, 47-50. 694 Survey by Gen.Qu., 6.

That the legend of the Me 262 was believed by those at the top of the Luftwaffe too shows that even they, from whom one might expect matter-of-fact judgement were, under the severe mental pressure of what was happening in the war fascinated beyond what was reasonable by the jet plane as a cure for all their ills. This was probably because, with the strict secrecy and compartmental; zation that reigned in the Wehrmacht, they simply did not have enough information and thus no overview of the situation as a whole. The whole leadership seemed, towards the end of the war, to have fallen prey to its own propaganda, divorced as this was from reality, and to a faith born of despair When it comes down to it the discussion about the Me 262, rather played because of the superior qualities of the aircraft and the revolutiona r over- opportunities these offered, forms only a small part of the fighter-ver bomber controversy that was still raging in 1944. Both viewpoints had a lot to justify them. Germany, with its geo-strategic position at the centre of the European continent, and with its fronts on land and in the air, needed both fighters as well as bombers: given the increasingly critical situation in her skies the question could only be how many of each.
