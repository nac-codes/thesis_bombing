n continent, and with its fronts on land and in the air, needed both fighters as well as bombers: given the increasingly critical situation in her skies the question could only be how many of each. After 'Big Week', and in view of the high German losses of fighter aircraft in particular in the early months 1944, it was self-evident that priority needed to be given to stepping up fighter of production, in order to regain strength at least over the Reich itself and prever- the destruction of its armaments factories. This was exactly how Speer, the arms minister, saw it; and Milch and Göring (who at first made a fuss about the curtailing of his powers over air armaments as C-in-C of the Luftwaffe) were well aware that without Speer's support they could not carry on running arms production on their own. It was not the Generalluftzeugmeister, but Speer, who could provide the transport and construction capacity, and the extra rations and bonuses for the workers that helped substantially to boo fighter production. Among the leaders of the Third Reich there had long been the view that armaments for the Luftwaffe were 'one big mess', and belonged in Speer's hands. 697 But Hitler still believed that he must not hurt Göring In any case, both sides, the Luftwaffe and Speer, felt they had to rely on each other, so at the end of February the 'Fighter Staff (Jägerstab) was set up, t overcome the breakdowns in production caused during 'Big Week'. Hitler gave this his blessing on 5 March, after voicing initial objections on account of the name possibly being misunderstood; for one thing, it seemed to emphasize its actual task too forcefully for his liking, and for another, it might be confused in a way quite inappropriate for the times with the sport of hunting (the German word Jäger covers both 'fighter aircraft' and 'hunter'), which was now really in no need of help.
