oof works (that is to say, those not located in caves or bunkers) would in the final stage of the dispersal exercise manu- facture no more than a limited number of aircraft components, and that during final assembly and fitting-out (which should preferably be done on an airfield) no more than 100 aircraft should be concentrated at any one site. 699 Hitler had meanwhile ordered the construction of two underground factories, with workshop floor-space of 600,000 and 800,000 square metres.700 In order to maintain and boost fighter production the Fighter Staff was given wide-ranging powers over labour and transport, and travelled by train from one damaged site to another so as to assess and initiate the necessary emergency action on the spot. It was composed mainly of staff from the armaments ministry. Leading managers from the works being visited were invited to the discussions. It dealt mostly with local problems of detail, with no major overall planning; the overriding concern was to raise the output of fighter aircraft. The fighter-production figures achieved by September- output of the Me 109 and FW 190 alone rose from 1,016 in February 1944 to 2,615 in July-show the effectiveness of the emergency measures it took. 701 698 Accounts of Fighter Staff meetings are in BA-MA RL 3/1 to 3/11; on the setting-up of the Fighter Staff see also Irving, Rise and Fall, 270-3; Speer, Third Reich, 332-3; Grabmann, Luftverteidigung', BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 860 ff .; Boog, Luftwaffenführung, 296-9; Budraß, Luftrüstung, 868-71.
