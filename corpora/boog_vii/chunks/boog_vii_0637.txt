Luftwaffe and Air Defence, mid-1944 To achieve an increase in production, the 72-hour week eek was laid down on 23 March 1944 for all aircraft factories coming under the Fighter Staff's programme. 702 Higher fighter output could not be achieved without rationalization.703 This meant on the one hand reducing the number of series and variants of the individual aircraft types, and on the other, cutting down the number of types itself. In 1941 there were 143 variants of frontline aircraft types, and in 1942 as many as 272. On top of those came in 1943 the numerous variants of 134 aircraft under development. Milch had already reduced the number of aircraft types from 51 to 34; now he set himself the target of slashing this figure by the end of 1945 to 16, with the emphasis on the main fighter models. 704 As early as 4 March Göring approved a thinning-out of the programme by deleting a number of series of aircraft such as the Ju 88, Me 110, and Me 410.705 The He 177 four-engined long-range bomber, in place of which several fighters could have been built for the same outlay, stayed in the programme, as did the Ju 88 and 188 as bombers. The production of liaison, communications, and training aircraft was drastically curtailed. Production of the Henschel Hs 129 ground- attack aircraft, short-range reconnaissance aircraft, troop- and cargo-carrying gliders, and seaplanes was earmarked for coming to an end. According to the plans, production of the Me 109 was to end in May, and the FW 190 would be replaced with the Ta 152, a further development by Kurt Tank with a fuselage 3 m longer, a 2,000 hp engine, and several 30-mm cannons. The Me 162 rocket-propelled fighter was to be built in small numbers, the jet-engined Me 262 in large numbers. The Me 110, 210, and 410 conventional fighters and destroyers were also to be discontinued, while the Do 335-which w
