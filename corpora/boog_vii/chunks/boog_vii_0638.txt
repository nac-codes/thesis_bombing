fighter was to be built in small numbers, the jet-engined Me 262 in large numbers. The Me 110, 210, and 410 conventional fighters and destroyers were also to be discontinued, while the Do 335-which with two piston engines in the fuselage, one pulling, one pushing, could fly at 750 km/h- was to go into all-out production as a destroyer, bomber, night fighter. and reconnaissance aircraft, together with the new Ar 234 jet bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. The Do 335 demonstrates clearly the move towards rationalization, trying to build one aircraft type suitable for multiple roles. The Ar 234 had paired jet engines side-by-side under each wing, a crew of three. and flew at 850 km/h. In late May Milch was also still thinking in terms of the He 177 long-range bomber fitted with four jet engines, and of an Arado heavy-lift transporter.706 These plans underwent further modification. The fact that in spite of the desperate need for fighters the bombers remained in the production schedule for so long was due not only to the general view that they were still needed, but in a large measure to resistance from the Luftwaffe general staff, especially Koller. Together with his superior Korten, the head of the Luftwaffe general staff, he was, under the pressure of the Allied superiority in the air over the Reich, initially of the opinion 702 Fighter Staff meeting, 23 Mar. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/2, 544 ff. 703 Budraß, Luftrüstung, 869-70. 704 Boog, Luftwaffenführung, 55. 705 GL/C-B 2 No. 14869/44 (II) g.Kdos., 10 Mar. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/93 IWM. 706 Fighter Staff meeting, 26 May 1944, BA-MA RL 3/7, 3660 ff. 349 that air armament deserved 'first place in the whole armaments effort'. The aircraft, he said, will be the weapon that decides the end of the war, not the tank and not the U-boat. If that is contested today, I can only say that history will prove me right. The only one of the armed forces that in the endless to-and-fro between attack and defence is the strongest in attack is the Lu
