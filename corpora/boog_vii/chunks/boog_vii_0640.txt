/188s; large numbers of the modern high-performance aircraft were planned for-could be planned for-only from the end of 1944. Special effort was given to the Me 109 with the high-altitude DB 605 AS engine, since this did represent a significant improvement. In general in the spring of 1944, however, quantity still had to matter more than quality. The hope of Milch and the Luftwaffe general staff for priority for air armaments was not shared by Saur, the head of the Fighter Staff. He saw the activity of the Fighter Staff as a 'secondary task', that of 'keeping the enemy at bay until such time as we have built enough tanks to win the war with armour. You don't win the war with aircraft; aircraft are for us the do-it-now job that will give us the opportunity to produce the tanks. We can bring an end to the war in the east only with tanks'.708 This only partly matches the view of the Luftwaffe general staff, since it sees air armaments as needed only temporarily, for protecting the production of weapons for the army. So when Koller, hoping to obtain priority, proposed to 707 Development meeting, 2 Mar. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/41, 5673-4, 5687 ff. 708 Fighter Staff meeting, 8 Apr. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/5, 2390.  I.II.

Already in March 1944 he had said: 'The war canne be won with defence alone, but only if we can attack as well.' He ruled out an weakening of the bombe
