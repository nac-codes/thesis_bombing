called for at least a trebling of the frontline strength, from 5,233 to 14,383 aircraft, with a monthly delivery of a further 6,034 once that level had been reached. Henceforth there should be only the three basic types. a small aircraft to undertake the fighter, ground-attack, and close reconnais- sance roles; a twin-engined medium aircraft serving as a bomber, night fighter. and bomber/cargo-carrier; and a large multi-engined machine as a long-range 709 Letter LwFüSt Ia/Flieg No. 9591/44 g.Kdos.

Numerical inferiority was to be offset with sup superior performance, in techno- logy and training. Coupled with this was the demand for the provision of the aircrew and ground staff needed, an increase in the supply of bomb and air-weapon munitions, higher aviation fuel output, more ground and air radars, and the expansion of airfields and ground services.
