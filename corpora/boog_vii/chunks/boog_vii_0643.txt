still stressed time and again the current import- ance of fighter defence, and wanted to post the crews from disbanded bomber units into the fighter sector. Nonetheless he insisted-fully aware though he was that the materials and personnel situation probably made his proposals unachievable-on their being 'basically achieved', which made necessary a 'balance within the overall armaments effort in favour of the Luftwaffe'. In other words he was insisting, despite the present overwhelming urgency of fighter defence, on a 'balanced' approach to air armament. For him the Me 262 jet did not fall into the bomber sector, only the Ar 234. In fact, the Luftwaffe general staff were afraid that the pressing need to strengthen the fighters would bring about the death of the bomber arm, and the Luftwaffe quartermaster-general saw the preference being given to the manufacture of fighters as a result of only part of aircraft production being in the hands of the armaments ministry.715 Where bombers were concerned the Luftwaffe operations staff, in practice and for the time being, followed the line set by Hitler and GÃ¶ring.716 The worse the air situation over Germany became, the more Hitler became persuaded of the value of having superiority in the air and with it the value of the fighter arm, and the more often he spoke disparagingly about the He 177 heavy bomber that still featured in the production programme. He did not believe that this technically still immature aircraft would be ready for opera- tion before 1946, and cancelled it when he was told that the cost of building 200 He 177s would pay for 1,000 fighters;717 he would sooner have fighters, to stem the enemy superiority in the air. On 26 June 1944, after the invasion and the Russian summer offensive had begun, he suddenly-and partly under pressure from Speer-saw the light: 'In our position all that matters is to build fighters and still more fighters', with high-speed bombers as well.
