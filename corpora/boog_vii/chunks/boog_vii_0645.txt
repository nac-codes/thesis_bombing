ife'.719 More and more often Hitler held forth at length about the delay in regaining superiority in the air; the situation would be 'massivel- changed if we had that'. This would, however, take time, and before then no ground could be given up. Aware of the importance of air superiority and of events in the Pacific, he gave a formation of battleships without or with too few aircraft-carriers no chance at all compared to a formation made up simply of aircraft-carriers. 720 On 28 June Göring ordered his staff to halt the production of bombers, as well as bomber-crew training. This brought the Luftwaffe programme in line with that of the Fighter Staff; which, after the transfer of the whole of air armaments production to Speer, already under way, was only natural. In earl July Göring trimmed the air armaments programme down to two fighters, the Ta 152 and Me 262; the Do 335 and Ju 388 as fast, high-altitude bombers cum night fighters; and the multi-role Ar 234. The large aircraft that most made demands on materials and fuel-the He 177, Ju 290, Do 24, and so on-wer dropped. The He 11I was to reach the end of its life in December 1944. The focus of the 'Göring Programme' ordered by Hitler on 8 July was on fighter and jet fighters.721 For the rest there seems, to judge by the many differing aircraft programmes from the summer months, to have been considerable muddle reigning in the Luftwaffe's planning and production. There was certainly no immediate concentration on building more fighters. In August the Luftwaffe quartermaster-general's Dept. 6 was still basing itself on there being a constant strength of 64 day-fighter and 26 night-fighter Gruppen until January 1945, with the bomber strength of 33 Gruppen reduced by only three Only for December 1945 was it envisaged to increase the day fighters by 12 Gruppen, with the number of night-fighter and attack (bomber and ground-support) Gruppen remaining unchanged.
