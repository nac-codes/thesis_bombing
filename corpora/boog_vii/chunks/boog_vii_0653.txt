to vital industrial centres.739 To sum up: with the decision to build only fighters and the like, the bomber-fighter controversy was solved in favour of the defensive effort only so far as aircraft production was concerned, because the bomber's role was transferred to the V-weapons that replaced them.

REASONS (a) Prologue: The Luftwaffe and Terror-Bombing1 EVER since his experiences in the men's hostel and on the Vienna building site before the First World War, and in the street battles against the Communists during the Weimar period, Hitler had regarded terrorizing a political opponent as an ever-reliable way of fighting him.2 But this does not mean that during the war he resorted to this from the outset.
