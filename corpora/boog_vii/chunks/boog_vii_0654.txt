an that during the war he resorted to this from the outset. He was enough of a tactician to judge whether any resulting disadvantages-of whatever kind-would be greater than the advantages to be gained; so he held back from using this means until it seemed to him to be the only way of achieving any effect at all. Within the Luftwaffe, too, among officers in charge of operations as well as those writing on the subject, terror-bombing was time and again considered, both before the war and during the first few years of it.3 Other air forces, too, were dis- cussing it at the time. For the Luftwaffe it did not mean that it was employed as a strategic terror weapon right from the beginning of the conflict-an accusation often levelled at it on the basis of the reputation it had gained since Guernica, as well as on the basis of both German and enemy propaganda;4 probably, according to Geoffrey Best,5 to the dismay of many of its officers. In fact, as the latest research reveals,6 even the air strike against Guernica on 26 April 1937 was not a deliberate terror raid (though it became that in effect), but an air strike as part of what is nowadays called 'interdiction' or the sealing- off of a battlefield. Experts have always been aware of this, but the effect of propaganda and of Picasso's eponymous painting have always been more powerful. What actually happened there? A small bridge in a suburb and the buildings at a nearby road junction were to have been destroyed to prevent the Republicans from withdrawing. Smoke from an earlier Italian raid, and hence poor visibility, prevented accurate bombing and resulted in the destruction of 1 In greater detail in Boog, 'Unterschiedsloser Bombenkrieg'; id., 'Indiscriminate Bombing'; id., 'Bombenkrieg, Völkerrecht und Menschlichkeit'. 2 Fest, Hitler, 53, Speer's statement on 18 Dec. 1980 in Hölskens, V-Waffen, 85, 239, n. 16.
