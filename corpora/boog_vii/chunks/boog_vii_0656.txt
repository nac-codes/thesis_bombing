with ground forces, that is tactically rather than strategically. On the other hand, towards the end of the 1920s and at the beginning of the 1930s the views of the Italian general and air-war theoretician Douhet were gaining some influence: he was the most radical champion of an all-out strategic bombing war against civilians and national power centres, believing that wars could be won by heavy bombers alone, and that the entire armaments industry should therefore concentrate on their production.9 The Wehrmacht, however, rejected such a concept, as proposed in a secre memorandum on the 'risk air fleet'10 in May 1933 by Dr Robert Knauss. The need, the Wehrmacht believed, was mainly for fighters for defending Reich ter- ritory and supporting the army. At the beginning of May 1936, a month before his death in an accident, Walter Wever, the first chief of the Luftwaffe general staff. switched the emphasis from the production of four-engined heavy bombers to fast twin-engined medium bombers, 11 thought to be adequate for operations against the potential targets at the time as well as for army support; moreover, they could be produced in larger numbers more economically. Because of the strategic need in the event of conflict to keep the air war away from a Germany threatened on all sides, by switching military operations to enemy territory in co-operation with the army, the tactical bomber eventually stood at the centre of the Luftwaffe build-up: this was what would be needed as a predominantly offensive aircraft. So the idea of a strategic bomber for operations against targets far in the enemy's rear or against intercontinental targets did not completely die; the time had just not yet come for it. Only when he had established his continental empire would Hitler be needing long-range heavy bombers. 7 Harris, Bomber Offensive, 40-1, 209; Corum, 'Luftwaffe and the Coalition Air War', 71-2. 8 Corum, Roots, 144-68. 9 Boog, 'Douhet'. 10 Heimann and Schunke, 'Geheime Denkschr
