tion. It was certainly also from humanitarian considerations, even though mainly from those of economy (which, along with 'military' or 'war needs', played the predominant part in all military and air forces), that only the Luftwaffe extended the more accurate dive-bombing or pinpoint-bombing technique to heavy bombers; in the United States this was developed only for the war at sea. The Luftwaffe, moreover, developed radio navigation to enable its bombers to find their target with greater accuracy, a method embarked upon in the RAF only on the basis of operational experience and not introduced until some three years after the outbreak of the war. As their crews had been trained on a peacetime basis, the German bombers at the beginning of the war were, as is now confirmed even by the British,15 capable of a relatively high accuracy, such as would certainly not be required for indiscriminate terror-bombing. Thus the Luftwaffe general staff during the last few months preceding the war once more rejected terror-bombing as the rule, 16 as it also did the development 12 Völker, Luftwaffe, 198-202; Boog, 'Luftwaffenführung', 164-72; Germany and the Second World War, ii. 35-7. 13 Contained in Luftwaffe manual L.Dv.64/II: 'Kriegsvölkerrecht' [International laws of war] of I Oct. 1939; see Boog, 'Unterschiedsloser Bombenkrieg', 439-40. 14 Crook, 'Science and War', 71; Corum, 'Luftwaffe and the Coalition Air War', 127-30; Luftwaffe service manual L.Dv.16: 'Luftkriegführung' [Conduct of air war], point 9. 15 ACM Sir Michael Armitage, RAF Staff College, Bracknell, 1992, to the author. 16 See L.Dv.16, point 186; 'Operational aims for the Luftwaffe in the event of a war against England im 1939', GenStLw, I.
