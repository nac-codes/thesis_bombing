e observed-which, admittedly, was never quite achieved in practice,47 Thus, on the morning following the Coventry raid, the lord president of the Council declared in the British war cabinet that this raid had been the heaviest yet experienced on a 'munition centre'.48 The minister for aircraft production Lord Beaverbrook, said: 'The roots of the Royal Air Force are in Coventry. If Coventry's production is destroyed, the tree will die.' Even 55 years after this raid the canon and director of International Ministry of Coventry Cathedral stated: 'Given that war was war, Coventry was a legitimate target: it was the heart of the British armaments industry.'49 The Swiss historian Theo Weber described the bombing of Coventry as legitimate,50 the British historia Norman Longmate called it a 'legitimate act of war', which, as he goes ont point out, was skilfully presented by British propaganda as a terror raid. The destruction of the cathedral had favoured this presentation, and had 'dra- matically' and lastingly affected world opinion. In fact, the operation had been extraordinarily successful, as the Germans had very accurately aimed a the factories and effectively hit all the important ones.51 All this is emphasized by Longmate, even though, as he himself points out, some 50 land mine of 1,000 kg each were dropped by parachute. The raid was made by 440 bombers: 503 t of HE bombs and 881 magazines of incendiaries were dropped; 554 civilians were killed and 865 wounded. The reports of parti- cipating German bomber crews still reveal surprise and horror at the effect on the city, in which residential quarters and factories were situated cheekh jowl.52 Even though this may now be a macabre observation, if one remember the British doctrine of aerial warfare, especially the dominant Trenchard tendency,53 then Coventry, even from this point of view, was an ideal target for bombing. By the end of 1940, regardless of some emotional remarks and hopes, neither Hitler nor the Luftwaf
