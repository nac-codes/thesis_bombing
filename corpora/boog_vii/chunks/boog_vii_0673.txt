er, once a British government declaration of 8 April 194168 had made it clear that the British were not conducting reprisal raids and that German cities would continue to be bombed even if the Luftwaffe no longer attacked Britain, reference to the instrument of reprisals had lost its meaning. If they had accepted the reprisal concept, the British would have deprived themselves of their only chance of directly hitting back at Germany. It therefore made little sense for the Germans to continue to refer to this on 19/ 20 April69 and later. In view of the imminent campaign in Russia, for which the Luftwaffe had been preparing since the summer, or at the latest since September 1940, there was some point, in a different sense, in describing the last major raid on London, on 10/11 May 1941, as a reprisal or retribution raid, since it was realized that the Luftwaffe would be tied down in the east for some time and it would be desirable to leave things quiet in the rear. So it had scarcely anything to do with humanitarian considerations when in March 1942 Hitler forbade a terror raid on London. He did not want to provoke a British air attack on German cities 'while we ... are unable to deal annihilating blows in the west'.70 A large part of his Luftwaffe was still tied down in the east and in the Mediterranean. This, too, makes it seem plausible that already in the winter of 1940/1 Hitler, with his coming involvement in the east in mind, did not want to provoke Britain by terror raids. The change to terror-bombing as the rule rather than the exception came with the British incendiary attacks on the old inner cities of LÃ¼beck and Rostock, at the end of March and April 1942 respectively; these held abso- lutely no interest in military or armaments-industry terms.71 They were totally destroyed without any perceptible military or economic gain for the attacker. The British intention to terrorize the civilian population, first expressed in the Air Staff directive of 4 February 19
