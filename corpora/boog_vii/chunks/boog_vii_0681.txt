they would hold out. In the early summer of 1943 Goebbels observed that the irritation of a 'population with jangled nerves' was spreading to servicemen home on leave, resulting in a bad mood among the troops.93 There was a growing impatience among t the public, from not knowing how the bombing war was going to continue.94 'Defeatism' was spreading.95 The air-war situation was giving rise to doubts of victory.96 The people were also indignant at the shortage of materials for building air-raid shelters.97 For Goebbels personally the air war over Germany and above 'Fortress Europe', whose 'roof he saw as 'unprotected',98 gave the gravest concern.99 Not only was it the most important and decisive 'problem of problems' in domestic policy, 100 the cardinal problem, but it was also the subject that overshadowed 'all other topics of conversation',101 'This is where the real weakness of our conduct of the war lies,' he correctly diagnosed, 'a weakness that causes a kind of intellectual and psychological paralysis among the German leadership.'102 'If there were no air war we could actually view coming events with absolute calm.'103 But the war in the air was to him 'one of the most important mani- festations of the war as a whole', and should therefore be waged and treated independently of, for instance, the eastern front.104 The public was particularly annoyed that, up to mid-1943, neither Hitler nor Göring had visited any of the bombed cities, something Goebbels, by 92 Goebbels, Tagebücher, Pt. 2, ix. 234 (7 Aug. 1943), 228 (6 Aug. 1943); vii. 646 (26 Mar. 1943), 492 (7 Mar. 1943); viii. 54 (5 Apr. 1943), 86 (10 Apr. 1943), 359 (25 May 1943), 379 (28 May 1943), 423 (5 June 1943). 94 Ibid. 344 (22 May 1943). 93 Ibid. viii. 491 (9 June 1943), 344 (22 May 1943). 96 Ibid. ix. 399(1 Sept. 1943). 98 Ibid. viii. 47 (13 June 1943). 95 Ibid. 423 (5 June 1943). 97 Ibid. 36-7 (3 July 1943). 99 Ibid. vii. 539 and 543 (13 Mar. 1943) and 554 (15 Mar. 1943); viii. 334 (20 May 1943). 102
