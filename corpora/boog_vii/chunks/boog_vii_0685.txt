t in the west works of art are being destroyed that we cannot ever replace. But even that is not of crucial importance compared to the possibility that by yielding we would lose the war. The fact that churches are destroyed is not not really so terrible. If they were of cultural or historical value, they can be rebuilt. ... That the heart of the towns themselves are hit is not all that bad, considered from a higher point of view. From the aesthetic viewpoint, the towns do not present all that good a picture. Most industrial cities are badly laid out, fusty, and abominably built. Here, the British air raids will give us space. The rebuilding plans drawn up for the Ruhr would have clashed with existing conditions anyway. Future transport, too, would not have been manageable at all so long as the old Ruhr region stood. Here Hitler was already dreaming of the 15 million Volkswagens that would be on the road within a short time after the war. For the rest, he was placing his hopes in the successes of a bigger and better equipped night-fighter force, one that the Allies might match in terms of material but not of personnel. He was trusting, too, in the flak artillery, whose flak belts were performing a 'negative selection' among the bomber crews: the courageous ones who penetrated them were often shot down, while the cowardly ones dropped their bombs and turned away before reaching their targets. Next, Hitler's fantasies turned to reprisal and attack weapons for bombing the British homeland, and London in particular. Besides, if the German people, faced with the bombing war, were to prove too weak, then it deserved to perish.119 Such ideas still cause outrage 115 Ibid. x. 340 (23 Nov. 1943). 116 Ibid. vii. 594 (20 Mar. 1943). 118 Ibid. x. 512 (20 Dec. 1943); similarly also Below, 'Hitler und die Luftwaffe', 75 ff., BA-MA, 117 Ibid.
