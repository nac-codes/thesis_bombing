tacks can be broken only with counter-terror. There is no 375 point at all in attacking British industrial towns or ports; the British have to be hit where they are most inclined towards defeatism, i.e. in the residential areas and where the plutocrats live.'127 Hitler, especially after the first heavy bombing raid on Hamburg on 25 July 1943, kept urging that, instead of mining shipping routes around Britain or bombing airfields and runways, the Luftwaffe should drop bombs on towns. 'Gradually,' he observed, 'the German people are getting furious', indeed 'raving mad', losing all confidence in the Luftwaffe. The public now expected counter-blows. 'But the decisive thing is this: the British will stop only if their cities are destroyed, nothing else ... I can win the war only if I destroy more on the enemy's side than the enemy destroys on ours-only if I myself make him feel the horrors of war. This has always been so, and it is the same in the air.' 'Terror is broken by terror', he repeated several times at the midday situation conference on 25 July . 'We must go over to counterattacks, everything else is nonsense.' Hitler 1943. was referring here to the mining of sea lanes and bombing of airfield runways by the Luftwaffe. 'Over there, that has no effect on the people. Nor has it over here. Or does it really have a psychological effect on the German people if there are enemy losses from mines?'128 For Hitler, 'the supreme principle of German command' was 'keeping the war away from the German home- land.'129 This was in line not only with German air-war doctrine, but also with the prevalent mental attitude that 'being on the defensive ... is not only a disgrace, but to us Germans something intolerable.'130 On the other hand, the Luftwaffe was not yet in a position to make any appreciable reprisal strikes. The Luftwaffe's chief intelligence officer (Ic), Col. Rudolf Wodarg, and armaments minister Speer, pointed this out repeatedly and put these off for later.131 This
