made this 'absolutel on essential'. Only railway lines, oil pipelines, and sea links were to be inter- rupted. The Luftwaffe was still subservient to the army, or, as Gen. Koller put it at the beginning of 1943: 'We have now gradually got to the point of running the Luftwaffe the way the army commander wants it.'162 Many Luftwaffe commanders also resented not being treated as equals by the corresponding army authorities. This was a complaint made by Hoffmann von Waldau, as chief of the operations staff of the Luftwaffe general staff, a the beginning of 1942. Later, as Fliegerführer Afrika, he criticized Field Marshal Rommel for regarding 'the air forces as little more than a supporting tool for tactical operations on the ground'.163 In mid-1943 Jeschonnek was in despair over the Luftwaffe's dependence on the army, and about the disrespect the latter showed it despite what it was doing for the ground troops. 164 As early as the spring of 1942 he had realized the need for the air war to strike deep into the enemy's heartland, and the error of merely providing support for ground troops, 165 a support that was costing losses as high as 60 to 80 per cent.166 Demands for operations 'close and very close to the front' were increasing all the time, so that 'the bomber units have to be involved more than is desirable in operations in the immediate battlefield, though their equipment makes them scarcely suitable for these'. 167 The general of bombers, towards the end of 1942, criticized the fact that 'a major part of our medium-bomber units have 160 Germany and the Second World War, iv. 335-6, 356. 161 War Directives, 116, 131. 162 Minute, probably 15-17 Feb. 1943, of a conference with Göring, quoted from Boog, Luft- waffenführung, 98. 163 Boog, Luftwaffenführung, 198, n. 1094. 164 See Ch.
