tion, which were likewise out of range.194 It is significant that Air Fleet 6, on orders from the Luftwaffe C-in-C, attacked not the aero-engine industry primarily favoured by Luftwaffe operations staff Ic, but mainly the two armoured vehicles factories in Gorkiy, as well as the rubber combine in Yaroslavl. Earlier, on 2 June, it had made a concentrated raid on the railway station at Kursk, identified by reconnaissance as a centre for rail movements for an evidently planned deployment. Other transport targets in the wider area of Kursk were also bombed; moreover, 80 million leaflets were dropped, designed to encourage Red Army men to desert to the Germans. It was obvious that the army's wishes had prevailed, especially as, despite various attempts, the Luftwaffe had been unable to oppose them with an integrated concept of a strategic bombing war against the Soviet armaments industry.195 Interrogation of prisoners by the army In connection with its preparations for CITADEL, Air Fleet 6 was reinforced from Air Fleet 4 by the transfer of nine Gruppen from bomber Geschwader 3, 4, 27, 55, and 100, and from Air Fleet I by two Gruppen from KG 53. Gorkiy was attacked seven times in all, chiefly between 5 and 8 June, by a total of 681 bombers; the rubber combine in Yaroslavl was attacked twice by a total of 192 bombers. These were night raids. For all these semi-strategic attacks, which incurred very slight German losses, 1,553 bomber aircraft were employed; they dropped 2,690 t of bombs, 1,015t on targets in Gorkiy and 324 t on Yaroslavl. 'Exceedingly heavy damage was caused in the factory installations' of the 'Molotov' armoured vehicle plant in Gorkiy and in the rubber works at Yaroslavl. However, the 'Molotov' plant was only a motor vehicle works manufacturing light armoured vehicles, as well as parts for the T 34; the "Krasnoe Sormovo' plant which produced 10-15 percent of the Soviet output of T 34s was not hit at all. Finally, 181t of bombs were dropped on the oil refi
