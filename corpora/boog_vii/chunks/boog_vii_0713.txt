The date when the He 177 would be ready for operations was not yet known, nor was it known whether it would first be employed for U-boat reconnaissance or against industry in the Urals. 'Systematic terror raids against medium-sized Russian towns deep in the hinterland' were also considered, but then rejected because of insufficient overall strength; admittedly these were to depend on political and domestic conditions inside Russia. Preparations were to be made for operations against the Russian grain harvest using incendiary bombs. On 23 June Speer invited a few industrial experts to join the so-called 'Carl Committee', the working party on the 'Dr Carl economic objectives for ai attacks'. This was chaired by Dr. Ing. Rudolf Carl, head of energy planning, and included Walther Schieber, a chemist and departmental head in Speer's min- istry, Paul Pleiger, the Reich commissioner for coal, and Walter Rohland, an industrialist and head of the Ruhr Staff.
