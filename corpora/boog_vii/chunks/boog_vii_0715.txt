Meanwhile, however, the situation in the east again resembled that of the spring: the Luftwaffe was having to fight fires, and it was the Red Army that was dictating where it had to do so. True enough, close-combat tactics were being technically refined and became increasingly successful-but then they were also becoming increasingly necessary, and no longer held out any prospect of a strategic decision. 216 In situations when, through lack of attacking strength in the ground troops, operations had become bogged down, the Luftwaffe, according to L.Dv. 16, would be 'the only means of avoiding a fatal bloodletting of the German forces 209 Points discussed, 1 July 1943, BA-MA RL 7/521. 210 Plocher, 'Feldzug im Osten', 383 ff., BA-MA Lw 47/21. 211 Ibid. 436, 445, 481-2, 492; Muller, German Air War, 137. 212 Muller, German Air War, 139, 277, n. 144. 213 Ibid. 139-40. 214 Ibid. 142. 215 Ibid. 143-6; Hardesty, Red Phoenix, 159-76; Air Ministry, 233-6. 216 Muller, German Air War, 122-35; Herhudt von Rohden, 'Luftwaffe gegen Ru√üland', 181 ff.
