Luftwaffe operations staff Ic had cut down Steinmann' extensive target lists to eleven major power stations, but was not sure whether there was not, in addition, a need to attack the armaments works themselves. after all, their machinery might be relocated elsewhere, and carry on pro- duction. 221 He therefore proposed other targets as well, such as the previousl envisaged aero-engine and airframe works, as well as transport targets. Con- sidering the small number of bomber units available (seven Gruppen) this would have resulted in a dissipation of forces and in ineffective attacks. 222 The Carl Committee described the 11 large power stations as the only group of targets whose elimination would produce the desired results. In his argumen Dr Carl proceeded from the German energy network, two-thirds of which could be paralysed by knocking out 56 generator stations. The Russian enero system, he contended, was far more vulnerable, as it lacked depth and 217 Luftwaffe service manual L.Dv. 16: 'Luftkriegführung', point 31. 219 Ibid. 166-7, n. 63, 181. 218 Muller, German Air War, 149-53. 220 Telex ObdL FüSt Ia Nr. 9080/44 g.Kdos., 13 Jan. 1944 to Lfl.Kdo. 6, Chef des General stabes Oberst i.G.
