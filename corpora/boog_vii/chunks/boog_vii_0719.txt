s of the Russian masses. Would the German Luftwaffe not make a greater contribution to victory in the east by letting its bombers ... operate against the root of the Russian offensive strength, by hitting the Russian armaments industry, instead of acting as artillery and dropping bombs in front of the infantry?' In the meantime the technical facilities for pinpoint target bombing had so greatly improved owing to new weapons, such as the 'Fritz X' glider bomb, that a major effect could be achieved even with quite modest forces. It was merely necessary to withdraw the bomber units and new weapons from army support, at least temporarily. The main thing was to make the new aircraft types, the He 177 and Ju 290, ready for use soon and in sufficient numbers, to 'achieve even quite major successes'. On the strength of the target data from Luftwaffe operations staff Ic, reworked by Prof. Steinmann and Dr Carl, Koller pointed out that, primarily in the industrial region of Moscow and the Upper Volga, systematic operations against Soviet arma- ments were feasible even with the bombers already available. In spite of his calculation that 47,000 Soviet aircraft had so far been destroyed, he estimated 223 Muller, German Air War, 168-9. 224 Short study, 'Operations against the Russian armaments industry', app. to LwFÃ¼St Ia op No. 8865/43 g.Kdos.

To what extent these figures were accurate it is still difficult to establish 22 Compared to the strength of the German Luftwaffe in the east- -2,312 frontline machines in October 1943 and 2,726 in January 1944-these figur were certainly alarming and justified the conclusion that 'the strugg
