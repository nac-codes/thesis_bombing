the strength of the German Luftwaffe in the east- -2,312 frontline machines in October 1943 and 2,726 in January 1944-these figur were certainly alarming and justified the conclusion that 'the struggle again inst the numerical superiority of Russian aerial armaments cannot be successful accomplished by shooting down aircraft at the front'. If the Soviet t air forces were to be 'fought only over the front line', then we must expect by next spring a total of [Soviet] frontline aircraft higher than at the outbreak of the war' 226 Ultimately the 'expected loss of production would justify even weakening for short time the forces on the eastern or any other air fronts'.227 Here the Luftwaffe was in agreement with the army general staff, which had stated: 'One reason for the Russian successes is their increased fire power and mobility, through being equipped with a large number o of automati weapons, artillery pieces, tanks, and motor vehicles that was and is still being made possible by an efficient munitions industry. Systematic and intensive operations against the munitions industry could therefore bring substantial relief to the fighting front from the material pressure of the Red Army.'228 detail it was found that even within bomber range not all desirable targets could be bombed, but only key points and individual, specially important plants. The most vulnerable sector of the Russian armaments industry, as the various supply regions were not linked with one another, was its power supply- an energy loss of 50 per cent in the Moscow-Upper Volga region alone would paralyse 80 per cent of the production of armoured vehicle engines, 50 per cent of that of electronic and optical instruments and multiple artillery pieces. , as well as 60 per cent of light armoured vehicle and motor vehicle production Eleven hydroelectric and steam-powered plants-five in the Moscow region and three each in the Yaroslavl and Gorkiy regions-generating altogether 1.5 million kW, were selected.
