motor vehicle production Eleven hydroelectric and steam-powered plants-five in the Moscow region and three each in the Yaroslavl and Gorkiy regions-generating altogether 1.5 million kW, were selected. Their destruction would have 'a very long- lasting effect'. The study, however, also selected 19 airframe works and the seven aero-engine works in Kuybyshev, Kazan, Ufa, Gorkiy, Moscow Molotov, and Omsk, which accounted for 78 per cent of production; a 50-60 per-cent paralysis of the first three alone would be equivalent to five to si months' loss of production. However, because of the lack of sufficiently long- range bombers these attacks, with the exception of that on Gorkiy, could not 225 Muller, German Air War, 157-8. 26 Talk by Koller at Robinson on 21 Dec. 1943, 5, 6.

It was believed that the II power stations could be paralysed by a total of five night raids at Staffel strength and nine at Gruppe strength, in practice, therefore, by some 320 aircraft which could not carry more than I to 1.5 tonnes of bombs because they would be operating at the limit of their range. In the case of the two hydroelectric stations, the authorities were evidently thinking of the British dam-busting raid on 17 May 1943, but they overlooked the fact that this had been carried out by a few hand-picked crews after prolonged training-for which there was little time in the east. Here they had to content the
