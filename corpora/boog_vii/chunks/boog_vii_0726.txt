tly encountered in the Second World War. These probably stemmed from a perverted idealistic tradition of thinking in 100 per-cent categories that embraced all desirable objectives, instead of a pragmatic worst- case calculation allowing, above all, for the wear and tear on the bombers and their crews. In this way, a lot of time was lost. On the other hand, this stub- bornness in pursuing an absolute 'strategic vision' might also be explained by the Luftwaffe's struggle to recover its status and prestige as an independent Wehrmacht service: in short, as a kind of public-relations exercise. 2. THE RESUMPTION OF THE STRATEGIC BOMBING WAR IN 1944 (a) Deployment and Efforts in the East In spite of the demands made on it by the fighter defence of the Reich and the requirements of the ground forces, the Luftwaffe had succeeded by about the turn of 1943/4 in restoring its bomber force, which early in 1943 had dwindled to an actual strength of 1,302 and a combat strength of only 653, to a new strength of 1,604 and 1,078 bombers respectively.238 This was largely due to the efforts of the young general of bombers Col. Peltz, who as far back as the beginning of 1943 had drawn attention to the decline of the bomber force through it being used too often on direct support for the army, and-though without much effect at the time- had called for vigorous measures to halt this trend. 239 Knowledge and skills acquired by the crews during their prolonged and costly training, skills in the navigational preparation and execution of long-range operational tasks, are 236 LwFüSt Ic, FrLwO No. 318/44 g.Kdos.
