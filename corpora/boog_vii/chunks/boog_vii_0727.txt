Not only are the practical skill and experience of precise long-range navigation being wasted in these operations, which call for almost exclusively terrestrial navigation (after all, the crews know their sector of the front, and that does away both with inherent need and often also the time taken in a more thorough navigational preparation), but also their basic attitude towards the strategic air war. This was the judgement of Dept. 8 of the Luftwaffe general staff.240 Any systematic rebuilding of the bomber force was impossible because of its heav losses.241 Few bomber units were granted longish breaks to recover (as was the case, for instance, for Gruppe I of KG 4, which was converting to the He 177). In April Gruppe III began to practise with the new Lotfe 7D tachometric bombsight for straight-and-level bombing from greater altitudes and to test new methods of target marking. 242 Had it not been for the fact that attempts were being made to conserve it for a final great offensive operation in the east, the German bomber force, if it had continued giving constant support to the army there, would have been totally eroded during the autumn and winter of 1943/4. On 26 November 1943 Göring announced his intention to concentrate the bulk of the heavy bomber units employed in the east, reinforced by special units achieving particular bombing accuracy, under the command of IV Air Corps headquarters, to carry out
