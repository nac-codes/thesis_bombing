to concentrate the bulk of the heavy bomber units employed in the east, reinforced by special units achieving particular bombing accuracy, under the command of IV Air Corps headquarters, to carry out systematic operations against the Soviet armamento industry'. Lt .- General Meister, appointed by Jeschonnek only a few months previously as chief of the Luftwaffe operations staff, assumed command of that corps at the beginning of September; it was to be later often referred to as the 'Meister Corps'. Its remit was 'annihilation attacks against the Russian arma- ments industry in order to deprive the Russian hordes of the large quantities of matériel-tanks, artillery pieces, and aircraft-before these can reach the front. so as to give greater relief to the sorely pressed eastern army than could be achieved by operations on the battlefield alone.' The corps was to operate within the area of Air Fleet 6, but directly subordinated to Luftwaffe high command. To begin with, it was assigned eight bomber Gruppen from Air Fleets 3 in the west and 4 and 6 in the east; these were, however, to be withdrawn only following a separate order from the Luftwaffe commander-in- chief. It was intended, during a four-to-six weeks' replenishment and training period at airfields in the rear of Air Fleet 6 and later, to bar it from any other operations. 243 Further reinforcements were to be provided as and when required. At first these units had only a far too small total of just over 300 bombers. It was difficult, however, to bring even these relatively meagre forces together-the defensive battles on the eastern front made it hardly possible.
