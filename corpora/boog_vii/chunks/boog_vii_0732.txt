On the He 177 see also p. 404. 399 east until June, by which time the strategic bomber offensive against industrial targets had become pie in the sky. Meanwhile the target-finding tasks were performed by II and III Gruppe of KG 4, though no longer against the targets originally envisaged.251 Ultimately IV Air Corps had to operate with the same-albeit improved-aircraft types as in 1941, the He 111 H-6, H-12, and H-16, plus a few more modern H-20s and H-22s, but mainly with the outdated Ju 88.

But the Finns did not wish to give the Soviets any pretext for further annexations of Finnish territory in the event of an unfavourable outcome of the war, especially as the Russians, in the Moscow peace negotiations in 1940, had claimed that they were being threatened from Finnish territory.
