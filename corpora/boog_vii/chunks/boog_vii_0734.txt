especially against the bridges at Kiev, should have priority; and (3) premature discovery of the existence of strong German forces with novel Pathfinder methods might certainly occur as a result' 252 air Points (1) and (2) in particular reveal how desperate the situation was. It seem. scarcely credible that ten days later Greim was still having hopes of success and calling for an early opening of the bomber offensive.254 In his 'Reflections on the opening of strategic air warfare against the Soviet defence economy'255 he admitted, on 11 February 1944, that following the l of the airfields east of Lake Peipus, Gorkiy was no longer a target; only under special conditions could it still be reached, but these were not yet sufficiently present. The Moscow region, on the other hand, was fully accessible. This now became his preferred target, even though the experts, Dr Carl and Prof Steinmann, regarded the whole operation as pointless if the power stations in the Gorkiy region could no longer be attacked. Greim, however, did consider the industrial sector in Moscow as so 'highly developed as to warrant d not major air attack'. What was important was Moscow's central position for routing supplies of war material to the various points of main effort. Alongside destruction of the (not particularly worthwhile) industrial targets Greim regarded as promising the destruction of residential areas in order to demoralize the civilian population, as well as to paralyse the machine of government. However, he was not sure whether this would increase the Russians' war-weariness or their fanaticism for the fight. He believed the attacks should be repeated between 12 and 15 times, with 300 aircraft on average, 'in order to make large numbers of people homeless in the more densely populated districts of the city and thereby greatly reduce their capacit for work'. Firefighting difficulties during the continuous freezing weather until the end of April would enhance the effect of the raids.
