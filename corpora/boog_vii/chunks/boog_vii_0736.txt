ed 25 per cent of the energy.256 The chief of the Luftwaffe operations staff, Koller, in his reply to Greim pointed out that Finnish airfields could not be relied on, and that Gorkiy had to be abandoned as being beyond range. Instead, he designated new targets- power stations at Tula, Aleksin, Ivanov, and Elektroperedachka. In addition, the high-voltage lines between Gorkiy and the Moscow area were to be severed with Seilbomben. Industrial targets in Moscow were not regarded as worthwhile by Koller, but the power plants outside the city were. He did not think there was any point in terror attacks on the city. 'Given the proven frugality and roughness of the Russian population, no enduring effects having an impact on the war as a whole are to be expected from such raids against residential quarters. If anything, they might provide fresh nourishment for the Russian people's will to resist and diminish their slowly growing war-weariness.' As for the employment of the He 177 in the east, neither airfields nor aircraft were available at that time.257 The chief of Air Fleet 6 passed all this on to Replenishment Staff East, along with the new targets and directives for preparing the attacks. 258 After the war Koller tried to blame Hitler for calling off the offensive against industry and switching the Luftwaffe to operations against railways. However, the records show that he himself, just like Dr Carl and Prof. Steinmann, no longer saw any prospect for 'Action Russia' once the northern jump-off bases were lost, and that Luftwaffe operations staff Ic itself recommended the attacks on rail communications.259 As the new targets first had to be processed by intelligence quarters, Replenishment Staff East was in March virtually 'out of a job'. On the other hand, there was a tactical need for severing Russian rail communications. Road and rail reconnaissance pointed to preparations for a Soviet offensive in the Kovel area. This was the area for which Air Fleet 6 and Korten had
