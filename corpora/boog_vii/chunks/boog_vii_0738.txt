oceeded to attack just such large-scale installations, abandoning the earlier raids to sever rail lin made at no more than Staffel strength because now an entire air corps available. Replenishment Staff East reverted to its former name of IV was Air Corps command on 31 March 1944.261 Its aircrews were well trained in target location and mass attacks, and could therefore be employed with a prospect of success, as they had been before in June 1943, against the rail installations of Kursk. The original concept of operations against rail communications, drawn up by the Luftwaffe operations staff from the strategic aspect of blocking communication bottlenecks within the industrial system, was thus once more turned into a 'strategic' concept of indirect support for the army to prevent the enemy's deployment. In addition, some Gruppen of KG 53 and 55 were temporarily employed in dropping supplies at Kovel.262 The rail offensive by IV Air Corps began on 27 March 1944 and lasted over three months. Taking part in it were some 350 bombers (mainly He IIIs. with a few Ju 88s) of KG 4 (target finders and illuminators), 27, 53, 55, and 3. Their serviceability level was probably not more than 60 per cent.263 Losses were slight, as Soviet defences at night were very weak owing to the lack of any highly developed night-fighter system. German war propaganda was therefore only too pleased to report these operations under headlines such as 'Flaming Finale: Rovno and Sarny' or 'Systematic Wrecking of Soviet Supply Lines', and most of all because of highlighting the moral difference between these attacks and the 'British and American raids against old people and children'.264 There is no doubt that these attacks were individually successful. but they came nowhere near their objective of paralysing all Russian rail communications. One point of main effort was the disruption of the Soviet deployment against Army Group Northern Ukraine.265 In fact, however, the main Soviet 260 Luftwaffe serv
