The Germans, as David Glantz has shown, 266 had fallen for the Soviet maskirovka deception measures. Despite their obvious successes the long-range bombers thus con- tributed to the loss of their own air bases. Evidently a further loss of territory was expected in mid-April, as revealed by a secret order of Air Fleet 6 con- cerning evacuation measures;267 its contents were not allowed to be passed on in writing and, once taken note of, had to be destroyed.
