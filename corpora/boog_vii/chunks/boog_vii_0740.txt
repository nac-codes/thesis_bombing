a single stroke. The American shuttle raid project-that was to make it possible to attack targets in Germany not only from the west and the south, but also from bases in Russia-was suc- cessfully nipped in the bud. Part of this success, of course, was also due to Soviet reserve, almost to the point of hostility, about cooperation with the Americans.268 As early as October 1943 Luftwaffe operations staff Ic had pointed to the danger that a reinforcement of Soviet tactical air forces by US strategic bombers would present to armaments plants in the east of the Reich, including Skoda in Pilsen (Plze≈à).269 For this reason, too, Greim in his 'Reflections' demanded a strengthening of German air defences in the East. 270 The first appearance of P-51 Mustang fighters and B-17 bombers at the airfields of Poltava, Mirgorod, and Piryatin, following the attack on the marshalling yards at Debrecen from bases in Italy on 2 June 1944, had been overshadowed by the invasion of Normandy a short time later.271 However, the attack by the 8th US Air Force on the Ruhland hydrogenation plant on 21 June 1944 and the flight of the bomber and fighter formations to the east were tracked by the aircraft warning service of Fighter Controller Upper Silesia and by the fighter control centre of Air Fleet 6. Evaluation of the aerial photographs of the three Russian airfields taken by a pursuing He 177 of 2/ (F)100, together with documents found in a shot-down B-17, led Greim to order attacks on the airfields at Poltava and Mirgorod. At the former, 114 B-17 bombers were found to be lined up in peacetime, parade-ground order; on the latter there were 56 P-51 escort fighters. Both airfields were to be attacked 266 Glantz, 'Red Mask', 213-31, and id., Soviet Military Deception, 348-58. 267 Chef der Lfl. 6 No. 664/44 g.Kdos.
