nger yielded any advantage at time when the western front was moving ever closer to the Reich.272 The German bomber crews were ecstatic about this success, and felt as they had in the 'old days' and at the beginning of BARBAROSSA.273 The success, how- ever, was also the German bombers' swan song. Because of a fuel shortage and the switch to fighter production, it was no longer feasible to maintain any major bomber units. By 5 May 1944 Gen. Koller was having to concede that it had not been possible 'on any front to come anywhere near fulfilling' the tasks of the bomber forces, and that 'any effective employment at one or two places' was 'now possible only by complete denudation of all other theatres'.274 The Luftwaffe in the east was unable to prevent the advancing Red Army from depriving it of one airfield after another. The He 177s of KG I, finally arriving in East Prussia, had to cease their operations by the end of July, after just a few long-range bombing raids. The unit was disbanded, and from August its pilots were retrained on fighters. The units of IV Air Corps, with few exceptions, shared the same fate. Following the disbandment of his corps command, Gen. Meister assumed the management of the Luftwaffe personnel department. Only one Gruppe of KG 53 was retrained for launching V-I flying bombs; III/KG 55 was transferred to the west to fly supplies to whatever Atlantic and Channel strongpoints were still in German 272 On Poltava and the shuttle-bombing of Operation FRANTIC to and from Soviet bases see Army Air Forces, iii. 308-19; Rust, 'Poltava'; Gundelach, KG 4, 283-93; Infield, Poltava, 63; Infield and Bowman, 'Shuttle Raiders'; Conversino, 'Frantic'; Groehler, Bombenkrieg, 323-5; Hicks, 'Soviet Sojourn'; Herhudt von Rohden, 'Luftwaffe gegen Rußland', 203-10; file note, General- nachrichtenführer (1.
