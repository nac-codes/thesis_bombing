confidence in the Luftwaffe. Once more it was proposed to operate against the Russian energy industry in the Moscow-Gorkiy area, to destroy the principal rail bridges in order to paralyse Soviet deployment by 'water balloon' drifting mines (yet to be developed), to operate against rail traffic by strafing locomotives, to support anti-Soviet underground groups, and, if necessary, to mount terror raids against Moscow. These were comprehensive objectives, to be achieved with ever fewer means. Reading these plans and demands today one cannot help feeling that someone at the time was anxious to prove that he had thought of everything and not left out a single theoretical possibility, so as to salve his conscience as the Luftwaffe commander in charge when con- fronted with a different reality. It was now intended to destroy the power plants in the wider area of Moscow and the Upper Volga by means of 'Mistel' (Mistletoe) composites.279 These were piggyback rigs consisting of a fighter (usually a FW 190) as the controlling aircraft, mounted on top of a crewless Ju 88 or He 177 bomber carrying the explosive and released at the target; they had a tactical range 1,300 or 1,450 km. At least 65 composites with He 177s- correspondingly more with Ju 88s-were needed to take out 13 power stations in a simultaneous strike. If at all possible this was to be accomplished during 275 Ibid., and Muller, German Air War, 215-18. 276 Muller, German Air War, 217; Speer, Third Reich, 546, n. 10. 277 Muller, German Air War, 217-18. 278 Lfl.Kdo. 6 No. 780/44 g.Kdos.
