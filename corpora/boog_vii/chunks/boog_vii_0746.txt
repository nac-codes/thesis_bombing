under the hail of Allied bombs: did this perhaps inspire the Luftwaffe strategists to attempt to do the same in the east at the last minute, in the face of seemingly much less dangerous Russian air defences? There is no doubt that wishful thinking was increasingly replacing the kind of sober calculation one would expect of general staffs. If all Luftwaffe bomber forces had been concentrated in the east in time, some success against the Russian armaments industry would certainly have been more attainable than against Britain with its incomparably stronger air defences; and certainly in both Hitler and the Luftwaffe leadership the urge to retaliate outweighed rational considerations. Yet even then the Luftwaffe would have been nowhere near strong enough to bring any lasting change to the way the war was going. The Luftwaffe, and especially its bomber force, had long been hopelessly overstretched-and not only in the east. (b) The 'Baby Blitz' Against Britain Tied up as it was in the east and in the Mediterranean, and equipped only with the bomber types available since 1939/40 (albeit since improved), the Luft- waffe was for the time being in no position to resume a strategic bomber offensive worthy of the name. It had no four-engined bombers like the British Lancaster or the American B-17, no light high-altitude bombers like the 280 Lfl.Kdo. 6, Führungsabteilung I No. 785/44 g.Kdos.

The He 177 heavy bomber, first developed in 1937 and produced in large series since 1942, was still not operational in view of the Luftwaffe general staff's demand that it must be suitable for dive-bombing.282 Göring was furious about the state of his Luftwaffe; on 18 March 1943 he summoned his generals and aviation indus- trialists to Karinhall and berated them in a harangue lasting several hours and abounding in affronts and acc
