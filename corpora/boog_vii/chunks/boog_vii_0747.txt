the state of his Luftwaffe; on 18 March 1943 he summoned his generals and aviation indus- trialists to Karinhall and berated them in a harangue lasting several hours and abounding in affronts and accusations which also, as he sheepishly admitted, applied not least to his own leadership. He felt let down by them, and hemoaned the lack of modern aircraft like those the British and Americans had, with their four-engined bombers and their wooden Mosquitoes. Although as recently as October 1942 he had still believed that there 'was not much to all those American machines',283 he now accused the industrialists of having sneered at the 'slow four-engined junk' instead of simply copying them: Then I'd at least have a machine one can do something with!' He demanded the same for the Mosquito. He could 'go berserk' faced with that aircraft, and 'green and yellow with envy'.284 Even Peltz had still, on 23 February 1943, held the view that thanks to Germany's favourable position for air warfare there was 'no real need for four-engined bombers ... if we want to get at the British; we can do that with our twin-engined machines. Then we have the great advantage of no need for the overheads of such four-engined machines and no need to escort them.' GÃ¶ring had agreed with him then, even though at the same time he was urgently calling for a four-engined machine for the war in the Atlantic. 285 Both of them, despite the failure of the Battle of Britain and the penetration of Reich airspace by the British and Americans, had evidently still not digested the strategic dimensions of bomber offensives and were still thinking in terms of indirect support to ground troops. Perhaps the youthful Peltz had also felt a duty to discharge a task that was considered necessary, if needs be with the means at his disposal. A year later, views had changed. The success achieved up to then with twin-engined bombers in ground- support operations had clearly stood in the way of foresight, and had also resu
