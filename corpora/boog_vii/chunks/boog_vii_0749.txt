scharge his duties as general of bombers, as well as additional tasks in the Mediterranean crisis region in bi capacity as long-range bomber commander South.288 Moreover, IX Ai Corps, on whose units Peltz depended, was meanwhile mainly engaged organizational tasks connected with preparations for 'Imminent Danger l on West', that is, the Allied invasion, and flew air attacks on Britain on only modest scale. Not until the late summer of 1943, when Peltz succeeded Gen y a Stefan Fr√∂hlich and assumed command of IX Air Corps, did systema preparations begin for the offensive against Britain.289 In 1943, therefore, apart from isolated major raids on London in Januar March, and October, only minor ones were made on Britain, mostly against the nearer and easily identifiable ports; the targets there were industria installations and residential areas.290 These operations were necessary also in order to recover the now-forgotten experience of the 1940/1 air offensive against Britain and bring it up to date. The raids were no more than pinpricks and scarcely produced the results hoped for by Hitler of enervating the British or paralysing their daily life. Altogether only 2,298 t of bombs were dropped on England during the whole of 1943-as much as a German town experienced on a single day, or one-hundredth of the bombs dropped that year by the British, or one-hundred-and-fiftieth of the bombs dropped by the Allies jointlu on Germany and German-occupied Europe.291 This was not surprising, as on 30 April 1943 Attack Leader England had at his disposal only 135 twin- engined Ju 88 and Do 217 bombers; this included the I/KG 6 Pathfinder unit, which was equipped with Ju 88s, as well as with 123 FW 190 fighter- bombers. 292 This was but a fraction of the bomber forces that the Allies could muster against Germany. While German losses of 5.6 per cent were just about tolerable-though not in the long run-only some 20 per cent of the bombs fell within the target areas. 288 Collier, Defence,
