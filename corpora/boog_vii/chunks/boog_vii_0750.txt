muster against Germany. While German losses of 5.6 per cent were just about tolerable-though not in the long run-only some 20 per cent of the bombs fell within the target areas. 288 Collier, Defence, 315; Gundelach, Luftwaffe im Mittelmeer, 560-2. 289 Report 74 on IX Air Corps, BA-MA RL 8/65. 290 See also the extant activity reports of Air Fleet 3 for April, June, and July, and the statistics for November 1943, BA-MA RL 7/110 to 113, also ibid., RL 2 II/313 and 2 II/342, which mention even minor bomb drops in April on blocks of houses and other dwellings in Broadstairs, Newport. Folkestone, and Chelmsford.

According to Balke, KG 2, ii. 286, Air Fleet 3 dropped 3,576 t of bombs on Britain in 1943. Its daily operations. especially those of KG 2, against Britain in 1943 are listed there in detail on pp. 185-290. On the 'negligible' effect of these German bombing raids see also Eaker and Arnold, 26 Oct. 43 (LOC. Eaker Papers, Box 16), who describes them as sporadic 'hit-and-run nuisance raids' avoiding the defended zones. The German crews were showing a 'lack of courage and poor navigation', and no new tactics of any sort. 292 Collier, Defence, 518. Improved British night-fighter and anti-aircraft defences forced the 409 Luftwaffe to zigzag and change course, with the result that the pilots and navigators-no longer to be compared to the 1940 crews-frequently failed to find their targets despite ample use of marker bombs. Crews survived an average of only 13 to 18 missions, and only after one-third of those had they acquired any measure of experience. The daytime raids by fighter-bombers were relatively more successful than the night raids by bombers because, flying low, they often took the defences by surprise. Occa
