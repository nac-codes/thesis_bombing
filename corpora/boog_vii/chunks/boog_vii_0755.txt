or some time for the planned large-scale bomber offensive against Britain. As far back as August 1942 KG 6 had been set up with a view to integrating the earlier raid experience gained in 1940/1 with the new lessons learned from the Allied bomber offensive and to providing suitable training for the young aircrews, seeing that the old units were by then either dispersed to other fronts or had long been eroded Ways also needed to be found to overcome the British defences, which had meanwhile been strengthened and refined. Following some target-finder and illuminator operations against England in the spring of 1943, however, the Geschwader was transferred to southern France in May 1943 and later to southern Italy.298 In May 1943, therefore, I/KG 66 was set up in Chartres with essentially the same tasks: target finding, target marking, and radio navigation for pinpoint and area targets. The unit was given the name of 'Target Finder Group West'. There was a pressing need for such a unit, as major bomber operations largely with inadequately trained crews were, in view of the more efficient British fighter and anti-aircraft defences, possible now only on dark nights and under the guidance of special units. Towards the end of 1943 the Gruppe consisted of three Staffeln, each of them specialized on one radio navigation method. The 'Egon' method made do with dead-reckoning navigation until just short of the target. Only in the final phase were detailed target instructions given using W/T. This means that the aircraft did no have to ride a directional beam, which it would have been easy to detect and interfere with. A second Gruppe used both the 'X' method, operating with two radio beams, and the 'Y' method, which managed with one beam and was therefore able, if this was interfered with, to switch to the other one. The 'Truhe' method used the British hyperbolic network system, which had the advantage that the Pathfinder aircraft remained passive, with no kind of radio traffic
