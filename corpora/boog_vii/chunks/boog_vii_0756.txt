d with, to switch to the other one. The 'Truhe' method used the British hyperbolic network system, which had the advantage that the Pathfinder aircraft remained passive, with no kind of radio traffic from outside being necessary for its target finding. The 'Truhe' Staffel was equipped with Do 217s and Ju 188s, the 'X +Y' Staffel with Ju 188s, and the 'Egon' Staffel with Ju 88S machines. 299 The most important problem with all these preparations for the new bomber offensive was the speed of the bombers. In the opinion of the Generalluftzeugmeister, the old aircraft types were still suitable for use in the east; in the west, however, he was thinking of a bomber that would fly faster 296 Parry, Intruders, 187, 192-3; development meetings, 28 May 1943, BA-MA RL 3/37, 4142 and 29 Oct. 1943, ibid., RL 3/39, 5131. 297 Collier, Defence, 318. 298 Maj.

However, as late as in spring 1943 he was told that machines of that type were still at the design stage.302 Dive brakes, with which all German bombers were fitted because they were expected to be a
