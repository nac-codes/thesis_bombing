. However, as late as in spring 1943 he was told that machines of that type were still at the design stage.302 Dive brakes, with which all German bombers were fitted because they were expected to be able to dive-bomb, had to be removed for the sake of higher speed, and paint had to be dispensed with as it caused loss of speed. Milch was also considering making the He III suitable for high altitude, so that a few hundred of them might carry out terror raids on England from 9 to 10 km up. Hitler, too, occasionally inquired about a high-altitude machine for night raids.303 Since the Luftwaffe general staff, for economic reasons, favoured multi-purpose rather than specialized aircraft, increasing speed by stripping out equipment presented a problem. In fact, the opposite applied: the FW 190 fighter, to be used against Britain as a fighter-bomber, had to be fitted with an autopilot. The bombers, for their protection, needed warning devices of the LICHTENSTEIN R and NEPTUN R type against enemy fighters attacking from the rear, but the radar industry was unable to keep up with the manufacture of the latter. They also needed the FuG 101 ground-proximity radar for making low-level attacks below the enemy's radar.304 These devices, needless to say, reduced their speed. The Ju 288, which, thanks to its greater speed and bomb- load and its better armament, was intended as a twin-engined 'Flying Fortress' to replace the Ju 88 and Ju 188 against Britain, was not expected in any numbers until the end of 1944, but had to be abandoned mainly because of power-unit problems.305 The Me 410, really intended as a heavy fighter, needed the LOTFE 7 D bomb-sight in its role as a light bomber; installing it proved difficult. There were, moreover, few of these fitted in the planes used for training bomb- aimers306 (a sector that was besides poorly provided with training aircraft). Yet 'wastage' of bomber crews was exceeding replacements by one-half.307 Particularly scarce in 1943 were spare D
