nnected with operations again Britain. He was to get as many aircraft as possible ready by day and by night f bombing raids on Britain, and see to it that as many British machines as possible were shot down by long-range night fighters.311 Even though the nearly modern bombers demanded by Peltz at the end of September were still at the 700 trial or development stage, and even though the required figures were incapable of being achieved with older models, Göring ten days later actually promised him 900 bombers.312 But he expressed himself already happy with Peltz's unit having 'recently' started with only 70 machines, so long as they managed inflict some damage on the British.313 When Peltz complained to him about to inadequate bomber production, he bad-temperedly demanded a speedier reinforcement of the bomber units employed against Britain. But for these intentions, described as a 'retaliation programme', there simply were not enough men, spare parts, or machine-tools.314 The serviceability of KG 100 was also impaired by a lack of replacement wings. Of 42 Ju 188 bombers built It in September, only four had airscrews.315 315 In total disregard of this, Göring, at conference with the Generalluftzeugmeister and the industry council on October 1943,316 worked himself into a progressively unrealistic euphoria. He 1 14 barked at Peltz because, instead of demanding three light bomber Geschwader of Me 410s, predominantly employed as night fighters, he had asked the general of fighters for only one. The latter should receive only three Gruppen Göring overlooked the fact that production of the Me 410 could not simply be 'turned back' from a destroyer/night fighter to a fast bomber.317 As for those 'four-engined dung-heaps' like the He 177, he recommended 'scrapping the lot' 308 GLM meeting, 25 May 1943, BA-MA RL 3/20, 5454 ff. 309 GLM meeting, 21 Sept. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/25, 7601 ff. 310 Development meetings, 28 May 1943, BA-MA RL 3/37, 4088, 4099, 4103-23 and II June 1943, ib
