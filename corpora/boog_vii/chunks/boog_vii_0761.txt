At the beginning of 1944 British air supremacy over their own country was therefore to be challenged once more-though not seriously. After lengthy preparations the Reich marshal had 'decided, as a retaliation for the enemy's increasing terror raids, to intensify the air war against the British Isles by concentrated strikes against towns (especially industrial centres and ports) ..
