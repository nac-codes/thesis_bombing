Most of these were older models, that is, 270 Ju 88s and 121 Do 217s, plus 25 FW 190 fighter-bombers. The only modern aircraft available were 35 Ju 188s, 46 He 177s, and 27 Me 410s. These were shared out among KGs 2, 6, 30, 40, 54, 66, 76, and 100, as well as SKG 10.330 Peltz was aware of the insufficient training of his bomber crews and therefore placed great hopes in the Pathfinders of KG 66 which of course increased the risk of massive bombing errors in the event of mistakes by the Pathfinder crews or by ground control operating the X', 'Y', or 'Egon' systems. Although the British expected improved target-finding and bombing methods, modelled on their own Path- finders, they did not, after the pitiful attacks of 1943, expect any major air offensive, even though they credited the young Gen. Peltz with great ability.331 The bomber offensive proper-nicknamed and ridiculed by the British as the "Baby Blitz', after and in comparison to the German air offensive of 1940/1- was opened during the night of 21/2 January 1944 with a large-scale attack on London in two waves. With a time lapse of five to six hours, some 220 bombers in each wave were to drop a total of about 475 t of bombs (just under 60 per cent of them incendiaries) from altitudes of between 1,000 and 3,200 m. This high ratio of incendiary bombs testifies to the
