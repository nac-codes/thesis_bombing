each wave were to drop a total of about 475 t of bombs (just under 60 per cent of them incendiaries) from altitudes of between 1,000 and 3,200 m. This high ratio of incendiary bombs testifies to the retaliatory character332 of the raid, although a few armaments works also suffered insignificant damage.333 The result for the Luftwaffe was shattering: only about half the bombs hit the British mainland and only just over 30 t fell on the British capital. The bombing raid carried out on London a week later, again in bad weather, was every bit as much of a failure. In the two nights 57 aircraft or nearly 8 per cent of the employed strength were lost; 10I crews had aborted the attack, mostly because of technical trouble. Hitler was beside himself when he was informed of the outcome.334 He was particularly furious over the failure of the still not operationally reliable He 177 heavy bombers, of which 12 were destroyed during the first week of the air offensive alone, with another four being lost through fire in their power units.335 That was about one-half of the He 177s employed. Hitler called it a 'a crap machine ... the worst rubbish that was probably ever produced . .. the crawling Heinkel'. He was even more enraged by the British report that only some 30 German bombers had penetrated as far as the London urban area. Once more the bulk of the formations had failed to find the gigantic city of London. 329 Derzeitiger Einsatzstand der Verbände IX. Fliegerkorps, teletype, ObdL, FüSt Ia (Robinson) No. 9008/43 g.Kdos.
