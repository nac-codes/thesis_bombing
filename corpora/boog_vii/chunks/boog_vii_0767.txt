zen Pathfinder aircraft on each mission, the Luftwaffe unavoidably employed for each system just two to four aircraft, which were more easily prone to interference than ten times that number. Often compelled by the heavy British defences to fly a meandering course, they easily lost their way. There were also not enough radio reconnaissance flights over England to discover the British frequencies; altogether, aerial reconnaissance over the British Isles was no longer working.339 In February London was bombed seven more times, with significantly smaller German losses and often with relatively greater success, even though the numbers employed-between 160 and 240 aircraft-were unable to reach the figures of the preceding month. There could no longer be any question of significant effect, apart perhaps from making the population nervous. Using flares when there was cloud cover proved more successful than ground marke bombs, as shown by the raids on 18 and 20 February. In March German losses increased, while results declined with a smaller number of aircraft employed For the Londoners the 'Baby Blitz' ended on 18 April with a raid by 125 bombers. Only a little over 50 t of bombs fell on Greater London. From then on the Luftwaffe confined itself to more easily accessible ports, but the trend towards heavier losses and smaller attacking forces continued until the offensive was halted altogether on 29 May. Average strength per raid had been about 200 aircraft. The final three attacks, on Weymouth, Torquay, and Falmouth, were mounted with only 50 to 60 bombers each. At the end of the offensive the entire force was down to 107 bombers and fighter-bombers Night of London 419 Jan. 21 447 268 Feb. 3 13 " 200 18 " 200 20 18 22 16I 23 170 I65 24 March I " 14 Hull 19 144 London 2I 143 24 I39 Bristol 27 I25 London April 18 Hull 130 20 23 Shipping at 25 Portsmouth 26 27 60 28 IOI Plymouth 2 n/a 29 91 Bristol 3 4 May 14 15 Portsmouth 106 22 Torquay 28 .. 29 Falmouth, ..
