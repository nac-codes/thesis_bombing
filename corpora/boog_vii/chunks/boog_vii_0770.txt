The annihilation of the city centre of Lübeck by a British incendiary raid on 28/9 March 1942 resulted in a serious, albeit somewhat reluctant, conversion of Hitler towards both the Luftwaffe's flying bomb347 and the army's long-range rocket; these, as Dornberger assured him in order to justify the costly programme, would, along with the bombers, wreak retaliation against Britain. Off the cuff Hitler demanded an annual production of 50,000 rockets and a surprise opening salvo of 5,000 of them. Needless to say, the army experimental institute at Peenemünde was unable to meet such extravagant demands immediately, and as a result Hitler soon again lost interest in this weapon. Evidently he totally misunderstood the need for continuity of research and d
