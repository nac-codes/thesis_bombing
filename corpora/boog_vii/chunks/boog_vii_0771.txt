de was unable to meet such extravagant demands immediately, and as a result Hitler soon again lost interest in this weapon. Evidently he totally misunderstood the need for continuity of research and development of such complicated and novel devices, and for this reason had earlier refused to assign money for this pur- pose to the commander-in-chief of the army, Walther von Brauchitsch. As late as 5 May 1942 he observed that the Peenem체nde people should stop inventing all kinds of things and instead concentrate on building rocket weapons.348 In spite of the first successful flight of an A-4 rocket on 3 October 1942, it took some urging by armaments minister Speer for Hitler to become hopeful again that 'Britain might be very greatly impressed by this weapon',349 and for him to sign the order for its serial production, on 22 December 1942. Yet four days previously he had expressed scepticism about these 'games', and regarded fighter planes and tanks as more important than rockets which did not hit their targets accurately.350 His vacillation in this important matter, which affected the manufacture of other weapons as well, is here particularly evident. The Luftwaffe, with its Kirschkern (Cherry Stone), 'Fi 103', FZG (Flakzielger채t = AA target device) 76, and with the Maik채fer (May Bug) flying bomb eventually called the named 'V-I', was making an all-out effort to prevent the army (with whom they competing in developing guidance and control systems, and who now appeared to be getting into flying as well), from possibly getting to London first, and on its own.351 On 26 May 1943 a com- parative test firing-instigated by Milch in the hope of promoting the devel- opment of the flying bomb at the expense of the rockets-took place at Peenem체nde. While both flying-bomb launches failed, one of two rocket launches was successful. The outcome was that both projects were to be further pursued, but only the rocket was given top priority by Speer.352 A presentation by Dornberger an
