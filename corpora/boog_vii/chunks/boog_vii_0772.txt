The outcome was that both projects were to be further pursued, but only the rocket was given top priority by Speer.352 A presentation by Dornberger and Wernher von Braun for Hitler on 7 July 1943, along with the showing of a film of the successful rocket launch on 3 October 347 Letter from Rudolf Brée, 22 May 1987, to the author. 348 Hölsken, V-Waffen, 88-90; Picker, Hitlers Tischgespräche, 476. 350 Hölsken, V-Waffen, 89. 349 KTB OKW, ii. 1312-13; Hölsken, V-Waffen, 89.

He gave orders for 'whatever is needed in man power and material' to be made available for this 'war-deciding' rocket pro Ject.353 At the age of only 28, Braun was appointed a professor. Speer, wh supported Hitler in his decision in favour of the rocket, after the war came to se this as one of his 'grave mistakes in the managing of German munitions' .. single bad investment', because the Allied air offensive against Germany could , as have been more readily stopped by smaller anti-aircraft missiles in conjunction with the new jet fighters (which, admittedly, were still far from being oper tional).
