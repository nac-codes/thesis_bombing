ter the devastating air raid on Hamburg on 24/5 July 1943 Hitler, as mentioned earlier, demanded the earliest possible maximum output of A- missiles. 354 And Milch believed that by constructing the launching rampe for the Fi 103 on the Channel coast he would be preparing there 'the grave for the RAF', which would undoubtedly attack the launch sites. This, it was hoped, would result in relief for the fighter defence of Germany. 'The men and machines eliminated there won't then get to Germany.'355 The British nich raid on Peenemünde on 17/18 August 1943, where the army and Luftwaffe were developing and testing their V-missiles, made it clear that the secret of these weapons was now betrayed. Hitler's reaction was to turn towards Hochdruckpumpe (High-pressure Pump) or Tausenfüßler (Millipede), the long- range artillery piece for use against Britain. He believed that he understood more about this than about modern weapons, even though no test reports were yet available. He no longer had any great hopes of the flying bomb, which had been shown to have a low target accuracy, but he still believed in retaliation with rockets. When Milch, in January 1944, reported to Hitler that because of development problems use of the flying bomb could still not be expected in mid-February, his wishful thinking once more turned to pessimism, rage, and disappointment. 356 When he was also told of difficulties with series production of the A-4 rocket he actually, on 5 March 1944, considered scrapping the whole programme in favour of fighter planes.357 Meanwhile, however, the German bomber force had proved its incompetence and weakness-in 14 raids only an average of 64 t of bombs hit London, while the average bomb-load dropped by the British was around 1,500t per German city attacked. The Luftwaffe's offensive strength was exhausted. All that was left now were the long-range weapons. When even the postponed launch of the flying bombs on 12/13 June was a failure and Hitler was about to halt
