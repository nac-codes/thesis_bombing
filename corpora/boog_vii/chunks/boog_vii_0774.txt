affe's offensive strength was exhausted. All that was left now were the long-range weapons. When even the postponed launch of the flying bombs on 12/13 June was a failure and Hitler was about to halt their production, no alternative was left. Subsequent successful series of launches actually induced 353 Speer, Third Reich, 365-8; Neufeld, Rocket and the Reich, 206; Weber, 'SS', 12 ff.

After the loss of the flying-bomb launch sites in northern France at the beginning of September 1944 and the foreseeable failure of the V-IS, another sobering-up took place; with the start of the rocket operations on 8 September Hitler switched fully to this weapon, the more co as, because of its supersonic speed, there was no defence against it. Disappointed by the three principal retaliation weapons, the Fi 103, A-4, and Tausendfüßler (a total flop), Hitler on 3 April 1945 ordered the filling of the V-weapons with explosives to be stopped. The ups and downs in his attitude to the V-weapons is a perfect illustration of Hitler's lack of understanding of modern technology, and of his 'romantic' conduct of the war.359 Even more astonishing was the unscrupulous way he participated in the V-weapon propaganda. Even before the defeat at Stalingrad, Goebbels and Speer had felt propaganda references to all-powerful new weapons to be necessary in order to dispel widespread anxiety over the massive material superiority of the Americans, who were taking a more and more active part in the bombing war over Europe.360 On 30 January 1943
