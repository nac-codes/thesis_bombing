cessary in order to dispel widespread anxiety over the massive material superiority of the Americans, who were taking a more and more active part in the bombing war over Europe.360 On 30 January 1943 Goebbels, with deliberate vagueness, spoke of 'new weapons' in order to dampen the shock of Stalingrad, and Hitler on 19 February told servicemen of Army Group South and Air Fleet 4: 'Hitherto unknown, unique weapons are on their way to your front lines.'361 To console the civilian population suffering the terror of being bombed, the connection between the new weapons and retaliation was then skilfully created; in this Goebbels's ministry, with its 'Bureau Schwarz van Berk', played the central role with its propaganda whispering campaigns (Hans Schwarz van Berk was a leading journalist on the weekly Das Reich). The vaguer the idea of the new weapons, the greater was the appeal of this retaliation policy among the public. Needless to say, this continuous talk of retaliation without any evidence of it happening gave rise to growing scepticism. Hitler played his part by declaring on the radio, on 10 September, that the technical and organizational pre- requisites not only for stopping the terror from the air but also for retaliation were being developed.362 The public believed him more than Goebbels. Speer, who was aware of the development problems and privately counselled reticence, publicly joined in this propaganda.363 Before long the concept of retaliation was joined by hopes of a decisive turn in the war,364 although even 358 Speer, Third Reich, 356; Neufeld, Braun, 277; Irving, Geheimwaffen, 268-9 [condensed in Mares Nest, 268-9]; Weber, Militärischer Einsatz [Military operation], report, 25 June 1944 (unpubl.
