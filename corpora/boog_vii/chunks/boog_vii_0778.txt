Only the first two abbreviations were to become 'widely accepted'. Hitler and Goebbels immediately accepted this solution. Not long after, however, scepticism was again spreading about the effect the V-I flying bomb was having. It was being described as 'Versager Nr. r' (Flop No. 1) or 'Volksverdummer Nr. 1' (Public pacifier No. 1). Attempts were being made to dispel disenchant- ment by rousing propaganda reports (some of them invented) about its effect on I London. Hitler contributed to this with ceaseless promises of 'miracle weapons'.370 Sobered by the paltry effects of the V-I, German propagandists treated the V-2 with greater caution. Although the first had been fired on 7 September 1044, it was not mentioned in a Wehrmacht communiqué until 8 November, because in the absence of aerial reconnaissance there was no clear idea of the extent of the destruction caused. The V-weapon and miracle-weapon propaganda, based on hatred and horror stories and deliberately leaving free rein to the individual's imagination, was intended to turn 'faint-heartedness into resistance, doubt into faith',371 and therefore, as Hölsken correctly observes, had 'a domestic stabilizing effect by helping the leadership to save face and sparing it, until the total collapse, the admission of helplessness ... To dispense with it would have been a confession of defeat'.372 While the propaganda machine was running at full throttle, responsible circles were viewing the effectiveness of the new weapons sceptically even a year before they were used. Their poor level of accuracy was already making Speer uncertain in 1943,373 and the Wehrmacht operations staff was certain by the beginning of December 1943 that the A-4 rocket would never have the effect of heavy daytime attacks by conventional bombers. However, because there could be no
