summer of 1943 suitable launch sites for the V-I flying bomb (also called the Fi 103 from the manufacturing firm, Gerhard Fieseler) had been reconnoitred in northern France. In mid-August the headquarters of Flal Regiment 155(W), assigned to its firing under Col. Max Wachtel, were set at Zempin on the Baltic island of Usedom; this was shortly afterwards followed by the regiment's four battalion headquarters.377 Each battalion had 6 d fou batteries, each with four alternative positions. This meant that, i , including the alternative positions, a total of 96 field locations had to be set up. In addition Hitler had authorized four launch ramps in bunkers, undert the codename WASSERWERK, in the Atlantic Wall on the Cotentin peninsula and on the Straits of Dover. The field positions extended in a belt from Calais to Rouen at a distance of 25 km from the coast, for greater safety from enemy naval guns and from commando operations. Camouflaging them was often made difficult by certain tactical and tech nical requirements. As the flying bombs 'pancaked' after launch in the firing direction, the ramps-all pointing towards London-had to have the ground sloping away in front of them, free from obstacles of any height. Each site consisted, apart from its concrete ramp, of ten concrete buildings, linked bv metalled roads, for the storage, assembly, and maintenance of the flying bombs. The long storage sheds were each upturned at the end, like skis, which subsequently helped British aerial reconnaissance to locate the V-I launch sites. Because of the shortage of German manpower French civilian con- struction workers had to be employed-which jeopardized secrecy.The gen- eral commanding LXV Army Corps, charged from I December 1943 with the introduction of the special weapons, in December made an inspection tour of the launch sites in northern France. He found that the complexes were far too elaborate to be concealed from enemy aerial reconnaissance, and that they positively invite
