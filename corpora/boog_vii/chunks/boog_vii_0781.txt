ber made an inspection tour of the launch sites in northern France. He found that the complexes were far too elaborate to be concealed from enemy aerial reconnaissance, and that they positively invited the French workers to conduct espionage. This was to be confirmed soon by the counter-intelligence office in Arras.378 After occasion 376 Hölsken, V-Waffen, 206.
