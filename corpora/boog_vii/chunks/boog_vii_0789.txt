By midday on 16 June 244 flying bombs had been fired at 'Target 42' (London), 45 of which crashed shortly after leaving the catapults. 391 On 17 June Hitler expressed his thanks to Gen. Heinemann and Col. Wachtel at the 'Wehrwolf II' operations HQ at Margival near Soissons and promised full support. He also thanked Milch by telephone. When a V- ran wild and exploded close by, Hitler left again. Shortly afterwards count- martial officials turned up at Col. Wachtel's HQ to discover if this had been just a steering fault or an attempt on Hitler's life.

The two regiments would form a brigade under the com- mand of Air Fleet 3, since the army's rocket was still not ready and LXV Army Corps was, in consequence, superfluous.393 His request for reinforcements soon proved premature. After 9 July flying bombs were also launched from the air by Heinkel twin- engined bombers specially adapted for the purpose, the He 11IH-22. The bombs
