aids on their supply lines. Whereas 820 V-Is were fired during the first week of July, there was a marked, though short-lived, drop towards the end of the month for this very reason. After that it was no longer possible, for supply reasons, to utilize the full capacity of the launch ramps. Another factor in this was a shortage of personnel. Nevertheless, an all-out effort was made; inspired by the belief that this might contribute to a turn in the war, 5,000 flying bombs were launched by 22 July.395 The advance of the Allied invasion forces compelled LXV Army Corps on 12 August to order the regiment to relocate in the direction of northern France and Belgium.
