of the Allied-occupied Belgian-French industrial region. The C-in-C West demanded two launch zones to the right and left of the Rhine at the latitude of the Eifel. LXV Army Corps intended to establish operation zones in the western Sauerland and Eifel-Moselle area in order to bombard the areas of Maastricht-Liège and Brussels and troop movement east of Rotterdam, as well as Verdun and Antwerp and other ports.402 A terror weapon was now suddenly to turn into artillery for shelling military targets. For safety reasons it was eventually decided to move the launch sites east of the Rhine closer to the river between Bonn and Cologne, to reduce the flight path 397 Hölsken, V-Waffen, 137. 400 Hölsken, V-Waffen, 144. 402 Ibid. 403 ff. 398 Ibid. 136. 399 Collier, Defence, 389-90. 401 KTB Flakrgt. 155(W), 396-7, BA-MA RL 12/76. over German territory because of the frequent premature crashes of flying 435 bombs.

On 20 October Flak Regiment 155(W) reported its sites left of the Rhine, in the Mayen area, to be operational. They were better camouflaged than all the earlier ones. On 21 October came the first launch of the second V-I campaign.403 On 24 October the two staffs of LXV Army Corps, with head- quarters at Meschede, were once more combined; the corps was now renamed XXX Army Corps. At the same time came the first launches against Brussels from the Eifel. The regiment's two remaining battalions were reduced to allow a third battalion to be formed, after which, on 26 October, the final disposition pattern of the flak regiment was laid down-I/155 with three batteries remained in the Sauerland a
