unches had to be suspended for correcting a manufacturing fault in their elevators. After t the Ardennes offensive opened on 16 December Antwerp was bombarded from sites Holland as well; of 274 flying bombs launched over five days, 54 crashed prematurely. The pointless aiming at military targets again led to conflict between Luftwaffe Col. Wachtel and the divisional commander Walter because Wachtel believed using terror against London and tying down sub stantial British defence forces made more sense than giving useless support the army. Frustration was further increased by the lack of aerial photographs t to and agents' reports which might make it possible to gauge the hits in the Belgian region. The proportion of flying bombs crashing prematurely con- tinued to be around 20 per cent; 50 per cent of these were due to faults in the steering mechanism, 32 per cent to airframe and equipment faults, 10 per cent to the catapults, 5 per cent to ground equipment, and 3 per cent to the power unit. The V-I, as noted in the war diary of Flak Regiment 155(W) on 2 January, was still more of a political and terror weapon-even against the German population-rather than long-range artillery.408 On German soil alone 22 people had been killed and 228 wounded; 24 houses had been destroyed and 101 damaged. Moreover, as the United States was known to be developing a similar flying bomb, a lot remained to be done to preserve a least qualitative superiority in this field. 409 In spite of all the difficulties, 13,714 flying bombs had been launched by 31 December 1944. As from 5 January 1945 the regiment's monthly quota of diesel and petrol was cut back by more than one-half, to 65,000 t each, and the 407 Hölsken, V-Waffen, 151-2. 408 KTB Flakrgt. 155(W), 487 ff., 496-7, 502-3, BA-MA RL 12/76. 409 Hellmold, V 1, 236-40, 268-72; Hölsken, V-Waffen, 154-6, 159, 253, n. 302. monthly allocation of flying bombs reduced from 160 to 100.
