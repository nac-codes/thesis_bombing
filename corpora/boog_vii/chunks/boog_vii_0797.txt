Nevertheless, it was required to fire at Antwerp from new positions near Rotterdam because 437 it was hoped that, with greater proximity, accuracy would be higher and the enemy's air defences would be split up. After February Antwerp was the Hak regiment's only continental target. However, the poor level of accuracy continued, and the flying bombs kept coming down on the German troops' own territory. While up to 100 V-Is a day were still being launched against Antwerp in February, this number diminished to 75 in March. On 30 March the last flying bombs fell on that city.410 On 26 January 1945 the 5th Flak Division 155(W) was subordinated to the Army Corps z. V. ( = zur Vergeltung, for retaliation) and to Kammler, who was shortly afterwards promoted to SS-Obergruppenführer and who answered directly to OKW and hence to Hitler. Kammler now commanded all V-I and V-2 operations from the ground. At the last minute centralized operational control of the V-weapons was thus achieved by the SS, which was busy seizing control of the most up-to-date and futuristic weapons such as rockets and jet fighters.411 This new arrangement was intended to go hand in hand with the takeover of the Luftwaffe division by the SS, but this eventually remained with the Luftwaffe and was subordinated to Kammler only operationally. On II February 1945 Col. Wachtel assumed command of it.412 Back in June 1944 Hitler had called for a long-range version of the V-I SO that he could, if necessary, pull back the launch sites.413 With the development of this new version of the flying bomb, with a bigger tank capacity and a range of some 375 km, London moved back again into the flak regiment's range, the more so as reports by 'reliable' agents suggested that London might still be susceptible to pressure through the terror effect of the flying bombs. On 3 March 1945, th
