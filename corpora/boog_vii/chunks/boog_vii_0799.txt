caused by the V-I were 6,860 killed and 17,981 438 seriously wounded, as well as numerous pilots killed and several hundred aircraft lost D August 1944 some 1,450,000 persons had left London. In Belgium t 2 there were 3,470 civilians killed, as well as 682 Allied soldiers.415 During the first phase from northern France 8,617 flying bombs were launched, during the e second from Germany and Holland 12,167, as well as some 1,600 air-launched b Heinkel bombers. The total of 22,384 V-Is broken down for individual target was as follows:416 10,332 Belgium: Antwerp 8,696 Li√®ge 3,141 Brussels London England: Southampton 90 Gloucester 20 55 Manchester 50 10,492 II,892 These impressive figures look somewhat different when one considers that the flak regiment itself was aware of 12 per cent of the flying bombs crashing prematurely, and that only one-third of the 10,500 flying bombs launched against Britain actually came down there. A further 3,957 V-IS were destroyed by fighters, anti-aircraft fire, and barrage balloons. The V-2 The A-4, later called the V-2, was a ballistic surface-to-surface rocket with a high-explosive warhead of 976 kg, with an impact detonator in its nose. liquid-fuelled rocket motor which, fuelled by around 3,500 kg of an ethyl- alcohol mixture and 5,250 kg of liquid oxygen, developed a thrust of just under 27,500 kp, giving a maximum speed of 5,470 km/h. After a burn time of about 70 seconds the rocket continued to rise from an altitude of 35 km to its apogee of 97 km, reaching a range of initially 320 and later 380 km. Its impact velocity was about 3,500 km/h, releasing an energy equivalent to the simultaneous collision of 50 railway engines of 100t each. As it had no proximity fuse, a hole about 7 metres deep was created by its impact; this, however, directed the pressure wave upwards and not sideways as with the slower-impact V-I. thereby causing less damage than the flying bomb. On the other hand, its supersonic speed meant there was no defence agai
