cted the pressure wave upwards and not sideways as with the slower-impact V-I. thereby causing less damage than the flying bomb. On the other hand, its supersonic speed meant there was no defence against it, resulting in a major element of surprise. The rocket was launched vertically from a launch pad and was fitted with automatic gyrocompass steering. Its course was therefore 415 KTB Flakrgt. 155(W), II, BA-MA RL 12/76; Hellmold, V I, 294-5, 297; Hölsken. V-Waffen, 193-4. 416 Hölsken, V-Waffen, 163, 254, n. 340-2. I.III.3.

The dispersion error was thus considerable, amounting to about 17 km. Establishing the pattern of hits by radio bearings proved impossible. The rocket had a length of about 14 m, a body diameter of 1.65m, and a launch weight of 13 t. After the Allied bombing of Peenemünde in August 1943 it was tested at the SS Heidelager proving ground at Blizna near Cracow, and from the end of July 1944 at Heidekraut in the Tucheler Heide.417 As far back as 22 November 1942418 Hitler had decided to have bunkers constructed on the Channel coast for the firing of
