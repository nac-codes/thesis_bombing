In the early summer of 1943 construction began at Watten of a bunker 90 m in length, 60 m in width, and 21 m in height, 6 m of which was below ground. It was to serve also as a store for 108 rockets and a fuel stock for three days, and have its own electricity and water supply as well as a production facility for liquid oxygen, in order to be as independent as possible of supply and transport problems. The intention was to fire 36 rockets from it every day. It was thought that 120,000 m3 of concrete would be needed for building this bomb-proof bunker.
