This co struction method, which impaired the mobility of the V-2, w forest paths a even after it had become possible to fire the rocket from simple: timber plank platforms. 419 Hitler just as obstinately gave orders for the con struction of a second bunker at Wizernes, even though work at the Watten bunker, destroyed by Allied bombs, was continued only to deceive the enem and divert him to that target, and even though Dornberger's fears concernin the threat to the bunkers and his idea of mobile batteries had proved cor- rect.420 This new bunker also had to be abandoned in May I 1944 because o continuous bombing.
