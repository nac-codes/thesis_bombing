ruppenführer Kammler as his special representative in matters concerning the A-4. Kammler received full powers so as to bring the rocket to operational readiness 'as fast as possible'. According to the OKW, operations were to be in the hands of LXV Army Corps with Dornberger responsible for the development and testing of the rocket After his confirmation by Hitler, Kammler, a ruthless careerist, also became commander of the Division z.

(special duties) programme (the V-2), had only just, during trial firings, mastered the problem of the rocket's destruction in the air. From there it was a long time before the necessary changes got into serial production. As late as April 1944 only 36 of 70 operational A-4s could be launched from Heidelager; 34 of them lifted-off, but only seven impacts were recorded, of which only four could be linked to the target.
