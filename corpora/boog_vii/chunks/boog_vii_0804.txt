36 of 70 operational A-4s could be launched from Heidelager; 34 of them lifted-off, but only seven impacts were recorded, of which only four could be linked to the target. In other words, 27 blew up in the air and the rest were extremely inaccurate.424 On 3 September 1944 the Allies took Brussels, and Kammler moved his command post to Haaksbergen near Enschede. He directed his Gruppe Nord-consisting of two batteries of Artillery Battalion (mot.) 485 and the independent SS Mortar Battery 500, which had been fully established only at the beginning of October-to take up positions near The Hague, while his Gruppe Süd-with two batteries of Artillery Battalion (mot.) 836 and Experimental Battery 444-was assigned the Euskirchen-Rheinbach area. The northern group was to operate against London and the Thames estuary, the southern group against targets in France and Belgium, including Paris and Lille.425 Altogether there were eight long-range rocket batteries, each with three firing platoons. At the beginning of September 1944 Kammler's force was still not complete; with all ancillary units for supplies, intelligence, survey, and so on, it included only 6,306 servicemen, clerks, and Sonderführer, with 1.592 vehicles. On 6 November 1944 the Division z. V. totalled 8,771 men, of whom 3,849 were supply and intelligence personnel, 2,995 were with Gruppe Nord, and 1,892 with Gruppe Süd.426 The rockets were stored in field depots, where they were also serviced, if need be repaired, and fitted with their warheads. They were taken to their launch location and put into position by so-called Meiller vehicles, which had 423 Irving, Mare's Nest, 212, 230-I; Neufeld, Rocket and the Reich, 190-2; Dornberger, Peenemünde, 230-3, 259-63; Weber, 'SS', 18-19; BA-MA RH 8/v. 1203, 44. 424 Weber, 'Militärischer Einsatz', 10 ff.
