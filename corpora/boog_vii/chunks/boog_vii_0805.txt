Positioning through to connection testing took about 60 minutes, fuelling took another 15 minutes as did target adjustment. From arrival at the site to firing, an average of 90 minutes was thus needed. Contrary to earlier assumptions, the A-4 units were not dependent on fixed launch sites. Metalled roads, sandy ground. stone-paved roads could serve as a base for the launch platform. For both for c camouflag clearings protected from the wind were ideal locations- and for stability during lift-off. The firing platoons were able to abandon these sites again within 30 minutes.
