Because its sites on German soil were less threatened from the air relocations did not have to be carried out as often as by Gruppe Nord. Th Allied air landing at Arnhem forced the rocket groups to relocate furth north-east; this resulted in a major but short-term reduction of rocket launch against England after only ten days of that offensive.429 Gruppe Süd reloca cated to the right bank of the Rhine, to Hachenburg in the Westerwald, and from September once more, in the role of long-range artillery, bombarded milit targets in northern Fance, Belgium, and Holland. By 3 October the two gro had fired only 156 V-2s at a total of 14 targets-a pointless enterprise sidering the rocket's inaccuracy, with its dispersion on average of 18 km, 1, the multiplicity of targets, the relatively modest explosive charge, and a rate of fire of, on average, four but never more than 15 firings per day. As a result of a boundless overestimation of the rocket's destructive effect, a new strategic weapon, about whose range of applications there was clearly still a good deal of doubt, was squandered on tactical bombardment of area targets. 430 , or At the beginning of October Kammler tried to put an end to the spreading of effort across too many targets, and assigned London to Gruppe Nord. 427 Hölsken, V-Waffen, 140. 428 Weber, 'Militärischer Einsatz', 17. 429 Irving, Mare's Nest, 234; Collier, Defence, 408-9; Weber, 'Militärischer Einsatz', 22; BA-MA RH 8/v. 1265. 430 Collier, Defence, 410; Hölsken, V-Waffen, 142-3; BA-MA RH 8/v. 1265; ibid., RH 10 IV/102, 103. 443 stationed in the area of The Hague, as its target, while Training and Trial Batt
