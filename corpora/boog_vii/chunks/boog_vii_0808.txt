l batteries should fire at London and Antwerp; it is clear from this that Hitler had now adopted Dornberger's view that the rockets were best used as terror weapons. To this end the two Gruppen were once more reorganized. Two batteries (444 and 2/485) would fire at London and six (1 and 3/485, 1, 2, and 3/386, and 500) would bombard Antwerp. By the end of 1944 a total of 1,561 V-2s had been fired, averaging 14 a day. Of these, 447 were aimed at London and 924 at Antwerp.431 SS Mortar Battery 500, operating against Antwerp with a guide beam-probably because of its special equipment-launched II rockets against the bridge at Remagen after the beginning of March 1945, all unsuccessfully. On 27 March the last rocket was fired against England from Holland, as well as the last one against Antwerp from the Coesfeld area. By the end of January 1945 the rocket-launching force had grown to 11,270 men, 7,022 with Gruppe Nord, 3,084 with Gruppe Süd, 1,035 with the intelligence units, and 129 on the division staff. A further increase, though planned, was abandoned mainly for logistical reasons.432 Even in late October 1944 two-thirds of the rockets were still self- destructing in flight. Not until the end of November did Kammler order the production of improved rockets. The number blowing up in flight diminished, 431 BA-MA RH 8/v. 1265; ibid., RH 8/v. 1306 (Kammler statistics, 7 Jan. 1945); Hölsken, V-Waffen, 144-5; Collier, Defence, 410-II. 432 Hölsken, V-Waffen, 161, 252, n. 283, 253, n. 319.

Whereas 444 the start of the V-2 offensive some 57 per cent of the rockets delivered had be returned as not ready for use, and 6 per cent crashed shortly after launch by the beginning of November only 6.5 per cent were unusable, while the rest functioned perfectly. On the other hand, quality remained uneve even In December Gruppe Sud was able to fire
