oused in each of ten battery shafts, that is, a total of 50 barrels s each 130 m long, sunk into the ground at an angle to a depth of up to 120 m, n, and designed to lob a 140-kg missile with a 15-kg HE warhead at London every minutes. The storerooms, ammunition magazines, hoisting and ventilatio equipment, power plant, and crew rooms for a servicing staff of 1,000 men were located within the same complex at a depth of 30 m. They were all linked by a network of underground tunnels and rails. Concrete slabs 5.5m thick shielded the battery shafts, and the muzzles of the barrels were additional protected by steel plates 20 cm thick. Construction of the site in a chalk escarpment at Mimoyecques, 8 km from the coast near Calais, began in 433 Irving, Mare's Nest, 229-30; Dornberger, Peenemünde, 243; BA-MA RH 8/v. 1307, 161. 434 Weber, 'Militärischer Einsatz', 25-32, Ordway and Sharpe, Rocket Team, 294-309. 435 Irving, Mare's Nest, 249; Collier, Defence, 527; Hölsken, V-Waffen, 163. 436 Ludwig, 'Hochdruckpumpe'. August 1943 with a workforce of 5,000 working below ground, so the British failed to realize its true significance, even though they were aware of the unusual construction site. It was accordingly only lightly bombed by the 2nd Tactical Air Force at the beginning of November 1943, though this was enough to make the Germans abandon half the installation. Only 25 HDP barrels were eventually completed for operations against London. The internal equipment and the gun barrels were to be installed from March 1944, each barrel consisting of a large number of short barrels fitted end-to-end with powder charges in side-chambers successively detonated electrically, so as to lend the fin-stabilized arrow-like missile ever greater acceleration; but then problems emerged with the projectiles. They were still aerodynamically unstable, and tumbled at speeds over 1,100 m/sec. By the time this was discovered some 20,000 had, however, already been manu- factured. Moreover, the neces
