rojectiles. They were still aerodynamically unstable, and tumbled at speeds over 1,100 m/sec. By the time this was discovered some 20,000 had, however, already been manu- factured. Moreover, the necessary range to London had not yet been achieved. Enemy bombing and the temporary withdrawal of manpower further delayed the project. On 6 July 1944 a 6-t bomb destroyed one of the battery shafts; at the end of August the fortified position was overrun by Allied forces without ever having gone into action. Had HDP ever become fully operational, it would probably-as Churchill later observed-have caused the heaviest devastation ever in London.437 were 445 Hitler, however, as he said to Speer in May 1944,438 wanted to use the (Millipede' for other purposes as well. From November Kammler prepared to use two of these guns on the front, to support the impending Ardennes offensive. They were set up in bunkers south of Trier, with barrels shortened to som and mounted on steel platforms. They were aimed at Luxembourg city. The decision on the eventual type of missile was slow in coming. On 13 December a mere 25 projectiles were available, weighing 90 kg with an explosive charge of 7 to 9 kg. Their dispersion error was up to 5 km. Only after the conclusion of trials did this weapon go into action, from after 30 December; by then the Ardennes offensive had failed. By 22 February 1945 both barrels together had fired 183 projectiles, whose effect did not match the outlay on firing them. Plans for further guns of this type were overtaken by the way ground operations had developed.439 Rheinbote Finally, there was the four-stage, solid-fuel, surface-to-surface Rheinbote (Rhine Messenger) missile. This had a diameter of 53.5 cm and a length of over IIm; it weighed 1,715 kg, attained almost six times the speed of sound, and had a range of 220 km, rising 78 km into the air. It was fired at an angle from 437 Irving, Mare's Nest 199-200; Army Air Forces, iii. 91; Jones, Most Secret War, 462-4
