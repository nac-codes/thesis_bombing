Its significance was not 447 realized until the new developments mentioned in it began to emerge-such as radar and remote-controlled glider bombs. Meanwhile, however, the British were still entirely focused on defence against the German bombers, against invasion, and against the U-boats. Only after mid-1942 was the attention of British intelligence aroused by (admittedly contradictory and imprecise) agents' reports, statements by prisoners of war, intercepted radio messages especially from the Japanese diplomatic offices in Germany and the rest of Europe-as well as by aerial photographs of Peenemünde, even though there - were no definite indications of rocket development.446 The first evidence of the existence of long-range rockets was provided by the German generals Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma and Ludwig Crüwell, who had been taken prisoner in North Africa and who had been bugged during a conversation about rockets. Churchill thereupon charged his son-in-law, Duncan Sandys, with an exam- ination of all indications suggesting the existence of a German rocket. Prof. Tones, the chief of the RAF's secret scientific intelligence, was likewise working on this. He assumed that the Germans were carrying out rocket tests which were probably monitored by their best Luftwaffe signals units using radar. The location of these units, the 14th and 15th companies of the signals test regiment, therefore had to be pinpointed. The first aerial photographs of Peenemünde-Ost were available on 29 April 1943. Peenemünde-West, however, the Luftwaffe proving ground, continued to be unnoticed, because the British were looking only for a rocket of whose shape or size they had no accurate idea. Having no experience of liquid-fuel rocket motors, the British firmly believed that
