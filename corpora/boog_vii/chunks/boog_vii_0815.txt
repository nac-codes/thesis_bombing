be unnoticed, because the British were looking only for a rocket of whose shape or size they had no accurate idea. Having no experience of liquid-fuel rocket motors, the British firmly believed that the Germans missile must be solid-fuelled. This would weigh some 60 t, have a length of 12 m and a diameter of about 2 m if it was to deliver a 5-10 t warhead to its target. It was expected that each strike would result in 600 killed, and in 1,200 seriously and 2,400 lightly wounded.447 Lord Cherwell, Churchill's scientific advisor, denied the existence of a German military rocket. Duncan Sandys's efforts resulted in May 1943 in the formation of a committee given the cover name CROSSBOW. It was to clarify whether a German rocket with an assumed range of 100 km existed, establish its state of development, and propose countermeasures. By mid-June 1943 the British had new aerial photographs of Peenemünde, taken by fast Mosquito aircraft. On these Jones discovered rockets, though Cherwell believed them to be barrage balloons. Sandys thereupon requested Churchill to order the bombing of Peenemünde. At the beginning of June British intelligence also had a report on an 'aerial mine with wings', a kind of remote-controlled aircraft. In May 1943 a British WAAF aerial photograph interpreter discovered a T-shaped object on what looked like a ramp, resembling a small aircraft without a cockpit. It was a V-I flying bomb. Hurriedly, evacuation plans were prepared 446 Hinsley, British Intelligence, iii/1, 294-8. 447 Ibid. 373-5.  I.III. Attack the Best Form of Defence 448 I.III.3. The V-Weapon Offensive for London and air-raid shelters extended by some 10,000 places. A capturea German army officer on 12 August mentioned d an unmanned aircraft named 'Phi 7' and a rocket 'A4'. With both of these an offensive was to be opened against London on 20 October 1943. The British thereupon bombe Peenemünde on 17 and 18 August. On 22 August a flying bomb crashed Bornholm, providing the British, v
