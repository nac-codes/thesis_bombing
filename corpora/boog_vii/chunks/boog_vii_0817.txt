f the buildings earned them the name 'ski sites'. The launching platforms of all the sites pointed in the direction of London, which, together with the door opening of the storage sheds, suggested the smaller flying bomb One of these had already been identified from an aerial photograph of Peenemünde. 'Ski sites' were also discovered after a reconnaissance flight at Zempin on the island of Usedom; this had been known, ever since the trajectory calculations, as a starting point for trial firings. Even though the flying bomb was still thought to be rocket-powered, like the Hs 293 glide bomb, sufficient information was held about the V-I-if not on its exact manner of functioning-six months before its first operational employment 450 448 Ibid. 393.

In the first few days of December systematic bombing attacks by the Allied Expeditionary Air Force (AEAF) began, under the cover name CROSSBOW, on the 'ski sites' meanwhile identified with the help of agents and construction workers in northern France. An attack by flying bombs, however, was not then being expected, as evaluation of the test-firing data from Peenemünde and Zempin had shown that only one of every six fying bombs would hit the built-up area of London-a conclusion confirmed by Prof. Jones by entering the strike pattern on a plan of the British capital.
