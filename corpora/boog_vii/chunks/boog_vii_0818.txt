d Zempin had shown that only one of every six fying bombs would hit the built-up area of London-a conclusion confirmed by Prof. Jones by entering the strike pattern on a plan of the British capital. In the spring of 1944, however, the V-I's accuracy improved. More and more new and well-camouflaged launch sites were also being discovered, and a messsage announcing the operational readiness of Flak Regiment 155(W) was decoded. All this induced Churchill to press for an early invasion. Once the invasion had begun the flying bomb, despite some alarming information, tended to be forgotten because it was thought that the sites were not yet ready.451 In the course of the Allied air offensive against V-I sites, mounted by the US 8th and 9th Air Forces, British Bomber Command, and the British 2nd Tactical Air Force, 107 locations were totally destroyed between December 1943 and the beginning of May 1944, putting them out of action for several months. Of this total, 35 were destroyed by the 8th and 39 by the 9th Air Force, and 33 by Leigh-Mallory's units. For each success the Mosquitos needed only 40 t of bombs, as against 195t needed by the B-17s. By the beginning of the invasion the Allies had dropped 36,200 t of bombs-as much as had been dropped on Germany over six weeks at the beginning of 1944-in the course of 25,150 missions against V-weapon sites. In these they lost 771 aircrew and 154 aircraft. American losses were 610 men and 79 aircraft, mostly among the heavy bomber units. On 10 July the Allies believed they had eliminated 83 out of 96 V-I launch sites. Certainly these CROSSBOW attacks delayed the use of the V-weapons only insignificantly. The slow-down was due mainly to the effects of the strategic bombing of the German armaments industry, to attacks on railways, and to the problems inherent in developing a new weapon. Leigh-Mallory's insistence on high-level attacks by heavy bombers and the continued bombardment of ski sites abandoned since January almost caused
