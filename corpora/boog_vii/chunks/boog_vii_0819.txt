to the problems inherent in developing a new weapon. Leigh-Mallory's insistence on high-level attacks by heavy bombers and the continued bombardment of ski sites abandoned since January almost caused the anti-flying-bomb offensive to fail. Success is, of course, hard to gauge accurately; but the Allies, unaware of the missiles' lack of accuracy, and therefore vastly overrating the danger the V-weapons presented to the preparations for and execution of their invasion, by 12 June believed they had banished that danger (just as Eisenhower later rather exaggerated it).452 There was great shock and the fury among the British, who 451 Hinsley, British Intelligence, iii/1. 418; Jones, Most Secret War, 367, 413-14; Army Air Forces, iii. 93; Collier, Defence, 367-70; Saunders, Royal Air Force, iii/1. 146-7; HÃ¶lsken, V-Waffen, 175-6. 452 Army Air Forces, iii. 84-106; Levine, Strategic Bombing, 136-9; Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, iii. 181, 285; Irving, Mare's Nest, 100-2, 103-10, 121-44, 154-5, 164-5, 183;  I.III.

The V-Weapon Offensive had not been exposed to German bombing raids for a long time, when V. s a su bombardment started that day, causing civilian casualties. There was. gestion of retaliation using gas bombs against the launch sites and againe German cities. On 16 June Eisenhower once more gave top priority to air operations against the V-weapon sites, along with the necessary air support for the ground forces in France. They now ranked above raids on railway supply depots, and airfields. The US 8th Air Force and RAF Bomber C. mand now mounted heavy attacks against launch sites and V-weapon depot ots. Remote-controlled old B-17 bombers filled with around 10 t of high explosive were used against major V-weapon targets, and sporadically also some of the few available 5.5 t 'earthquake' bombs. In July the British-American 'Crossbow the Committee' was set up to direct operations against the V-weapons. Betwe
