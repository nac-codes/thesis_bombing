Be that as it may, there was a good knowledge of the two major retaliation weapons in Britain before they were actually used. 454 t was USSBS, Report 2a: Statistical Appendix to Over-All Report, 71-2., NA RG 243; Harris, Bomber Offensive, 216-17; Tedder, With Prejudice, 580 ff.

Because of the mistaken assumption that the German rockets were remote- 451 controlled, it was thought that they would be vulnerable, as the German bombers had been, to electronic countermeasures. Against the flying bombs it was believed that the defence system practised since the First World War, that is, anti-aircraft artillery, searchlights, and fighter aircraft, together with balloon barrages, would prove effective. The balloon barrages south of London were thus backed up, further to the south-east, by an AA belt, and finally by the fighter zone along the coast. Fighter and AA areas overlapped, though they were staggered in altitude. In February and June 1944, however, the Allies reduced the strength of this defensive belt in favour of invasion preparations; to help in this, the heavy AA units were gradually supplied with American proximity fuses. This type of fuse was tinkered with on the German side, unsuccessfully, right up to the end of the war, and in consequence the accuracy of Allied anti-aircraft fire was considerably greater than that of the Germans. 455 During the day, the fighters were flying continuous patrols.
