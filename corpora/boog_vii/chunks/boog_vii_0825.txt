The Germans therefore saw no reason to correct the range. 462 For about 73 per cent of the air-launched flying bombs the British radio intercept service was able to alert its fighter defences, in most cases by up to 70 minutes in advance. However, additional AA, searchlight, and fighter belts had to be established to deal with flying bombs coming from a more east- north-easterly direction. The raid on Manchester mounted on 24 December 1944 by KG 53 resulted in a further northward shift of these belts. When a long-range version of the flying bomb belly-landed near Antwerp the Allies correctly concluded that Flak Regiment 155(W), which had pulled back a long way, was planning to bombard London again. Once more the defences had to be strengthened. However, the new version of the flying bomb, with a speed of more than 770 km/h, was as we have seen too fast for piston-engined fighters, and the offensive itself was too weak and too short-lived to warrant a major defence effort. Antwerp, which had become extremely important as a supply base for the front (most other ports in north-western France were still in German hands), was protected against flying bombs by three anti-aircraft brigades under American command, with over 600 guns and 22,000 men. The number of V-Is coming down on the city rose from 25 a day at the beginning of 1945 to 100 on 15 February. Nearly 98 per cent of them were, however, shot down by AA fire during their final approach.463 (d) Assessment of the V-weapon Offensive Between 12 June 1944 and the end of the V-weapon offensive in late March 1945 a total of 2,419 V-IS and 517 V-2s exploded in London, as well as 3,404 and 537, respectively, outside London; in all, therefore, 5,823 V-Is and 1,054 V-2s struck England. Only some 71 per cent of V-Is fired at
