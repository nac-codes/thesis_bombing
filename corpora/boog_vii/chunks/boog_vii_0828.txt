industry the V-weapons fragmented the development of resources, because the different armed services and their departments spent most of their time, insulated from one another, working on the same or similar projects, thereby diverting far too much material and specialized manpower from other programmes; the development of rocket motors alone was pursued by seven firms, that of missiles by eight. In point of fact, the A-4 at the beginning of 1944 tied up workforce of some 200,000, about one-tenth of the total employed in aerial armaments, as well as 1,000t of aluminium a month-about 5 per cent of the monthly quota allocated to the Luftwaffe, and 10 per cent of the sheet 464 Collier, Defence, 523, 526-8; Irving, Mare's Nest, 242; Hölsken, V-Waffen, 200-2; USSBS,i Report No. I: Summary Report, 15. 465 Irving, Mare's Nest, 191, 238, 241, 242; Hölsken, V-Waffen, 202. 466 Eisenhower, Crusade, 284; Churchill, Second World War, v. 191. 455 aluminium, enough to build around 2,000 FW 190 fighters.467 According to calculations by the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, the effort invested in the V-weapons during 1944/5 was roughly the equivalent of building 24,000 fighter planes. And this in a defensive situation when, as Milch put it, 'the fighters ... are more important than the A-4 and Kirschkern' .468 In addition, the A-4 programme, even more than the Fi 103 programme, meant a significant interference with the electrical aircraft equipment and guidance programme.469 Milch was furious: 'Everything to do with the A-4 seems to me to have gone completely crazy today. These people should be put into a lunatic asylum or hit over the head . .. The A-4 people are like savages. They burst into everything and act as if they were the first people in creation and had the whole earth to share out . . .
