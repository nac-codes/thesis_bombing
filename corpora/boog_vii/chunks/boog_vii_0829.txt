'470 Together with the chief of the Luftwaffe general staff, Korten, he even called for cancelling the A-4, but Hitler rejected that in April 1944.471 This move was also con- nected with the fact that the A-4 was, in terms of priority, 'forcing the Fi 103 up against the wall',472 even though 'the rocket programme has been running for more than 13 years and ours [the Fi 103] only a year and a quarter'. Army and Luftwaffe were locked in rivalry: while the increasingly disappointing Luftwaffe with its V-I was trying to regain prestige with Hitler, the army was fighting for its rocket monopoly.473 Both used the same argument while fighting for their projects-finding a manpower-saving replacement for the burnt-out bomber force. Yet because of its heat generation on re-entry into the atmosphere, the V-2 delivered only the normal, not a greater, quantity of explosives to the target; and did so with a lesser effect than the V-I, which was a hundred times cheaper and often filled with highly explosive Trialen, thus producing greater destruction. Moreover the V-I (unlike the V-2, against which there was no defence) tied down strong defensive forces. Altogether it was far more cost-effective; its manufacturing costs were only about RMI,500, about one-hundredth those of the V-2;474 and this was also true, in terms of material and manpower, when compared with the bomber.475 The V-I needed 467 Reich marshal conference, note No. 1311/43, 23 Nov. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/62, 6677; GLM meeting, 15 Feb. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/28, 9052 ff .; Irving, Rise and Fall, 220; Raw Materials Plan 223, 'Raw materials allocations made: aluminium', GL/A-Luftwaffen-Rohstoffzuteilung (LROZ) No. 16 429/43 geh., Aug. 1943, BA-MA RL 3/57 IWM. 468 Murray, 'Reflections', 90-1; GLM/sec. of state/RuK meetings, 19 Jan. 1944, BA-MA RL 3/32, 1115-16, 25 Aug. 1943, ibid., RL 3/30, 476. 469 GLM meetings, 18 June and 22 June 1943, BA-MA RL 3/21, 5886, 5803, GLM meeting, 13 July 1943, ibid., RL 3/22, 6382;
