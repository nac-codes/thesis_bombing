period on 1944/5 dropped 1,018,000t on Germany.476 So while the V-weapons of no particular military value (leaving aside tying-down of enemy defen and 'attracting' some 120,000 t of Allied bombs),477 the V-2 programme particular placed a comparatively much greater stress on the less efficie German war economy than the MANHATTAN project did on the American V-weapons did not bring about the hoped-for turn in the war nor the end of the bombing terror. Most of all, they disappointed the high hopes Hitler, Goebbels, Milch, Himmler, Göring, and Gen. von Axthelm as to the of psychological effect,478 a hope that, in view of the fact that the much more their persistent Allied bombing was proving unable to break the morale of + German civilian population, no doubt sprang from despair at Germany's f the inevitable defeat. One has to agree with Hölsken, the historian of fl V-weapons, when he says that there could be no question of a proportionate retaliation and that, in retrospect, the propagandist abbreviation 'V', chosen match the English 'V for Victory', might rather have stood not for Vergelt (retaliation) but for Verzweiflung (despair).479 The history of the retaliation weapons does not, however, end with their failure. Imperfect as they were found to be, they were entirely novel in their concept, pointing to the future for which further programmes were already being considered at Peenemünde. In the case of the V-I, developments wera aimed at increasing their range and accuracy, as well as their piggyback launching from the Arado Ar 234C four-engined jet bomber. Launching them medium bomber, and the extremely low manpower requirements relative to those the A-4 BA-MA RL 3/69. Instead of 200,000 workers for the A-4, it needed only about 15,000 (GLM meeting, 29 June 1943, BA-MA RL 3/21, 5683-4).
