The best-known was the 'Reichenberg' project, a suicide mission planned by Hanna Reitsch; but this was not taken up.481 In the case of the V-2 rocket there was a project for launching it from railway flatbeds, but this would probably have been impracticable in view of Allied air supremacy. There was a plan for increasing the range of the V-2 by means of a submerged container towed by a U-boat, to be used as a launch platform. The new Model XXI electro-U-boats were even to tow three such submerged containers.482 To increase its range and effectiveness, models A-5 to A-1I were being planned, of which the A-9/10, the 'America rocket', was most advanced and was due to be developed in a cave near Traunstein. This was a two-stage projectile with a length of 34 m, a diameter of 4.15m, an initial weight of 100t, a range of 5,000 km, an apogee of 350 km, a maximum velocity of 11,000 km/h, and a HE charge of only 975 kg. Hitler was against this project so long as the A-4/V-2 was not really usable. 483 .483 Rheinbote, too, was being further developed for tactical and semi-strategic ground operat
