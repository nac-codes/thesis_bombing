charge of only 975 kg. Hitler was against this project so long as the A-4/V-2 was not really usable. 483 .483 Rheinbote, too, was being further developed for tactical and semi-strategic ground operations.484 The idea that this might be employed against the enemy's deeply staggered deployment areas and thus cut off sub- sequent waves anticipated some 'air-land battle' ideas of the 1980s. In view of all this, it is not surprising that the V-weapons and the scientists at work on developing them were the most sought-after booty of the victorious powers. This is proved by the subsequent employment of leading figures such as Braun, Dornberger, and many others, and their naturalization in the United States, as well as by the carrying-off of many of the remaining rocket researchers for compulsory work in the Soviet Union.485 The significance of the V-weapons resides in the fact that they inaugurated a new age of weapon technology and research, starting with the 'cruise missiles' as continuations of the V-I and the space rockets as continuations of the V-2. The British historian Martin Middlebrook accordingly passed this judgement on the German rocket scientists: They need not be too concerned about their image. Their original work was undoubtedly purely scientific [which, if one disregards the Reichswehr's efforts already to circumvent the provisions of the Versailles treaty, is true] and the wartime interlude was forced upon them by events well beyond their control ... If international tensions could one day be relaxed sufficiently to allow a memorial to be erected [in Peenem√ºnde] ... as a place of pilgrimage for devotees of such human endeavours.486 480 Heads of department meeting, 29 June 1943, BA-MA RL 3/45, 74II. 481 See pp. 336-7; Reitsch, The Sky My Kingdom, 188-99; Stahl, KG 200, 151-167; Green, Warplanes, 170; Hellmold, VI, 101-16. 482 BA-MA RH 8/v. 1942, 8 ff .; ibid., RH 8/1276; Kens and Nowarra, Die deutschen Flugzeuge, 553-4. 483 Speer, Slave State, 210; Kens
