I.III. Attack the Best Form of Defence 458 However, it must not be forgotten that the rockets that heralded the beginning of space travel also came into being from the blood of thousands of concer tration-camp inmates and slave workers. One-third of them, some 20,000 died in the underground production centres from their brutal treatment by so guards, who cruelly punished any even supposed misdemeanour, or from sickness. We know today that even prominent rocket pioneers proposed the concentration-camp inmates and slave workers be employed on building thei- rockets, and that Braun was aware of these people's working conditions and of the horrendous conditions in the caves.487 But were they therefore alse responsible for these conditions, or for the manpower shortage that led these people being employed on building rockets underground? Can they be accused of lack of courage because, in a totalitarian system that could prove to lethal to them as well, and under the constraints of war, they did not tur against it? Can one dismiss those people simply as ruthless careeriste opportunists, and egocentrics, centred solely on putting their ideas into effect? The problem of the technocrats is much too complex for painting them in black and white. Their undoubtedly controversial characters need to be assessed against the conditions of the time. 488 PART II German and Allied Conduct of the War in the West DETLEF VOGEL 487 Eisfeld, Mondsüchtig, 130 ff .; Neufeld, Rocket and the Reich, 314-17.
