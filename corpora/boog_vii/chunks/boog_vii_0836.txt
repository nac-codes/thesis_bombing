In mid-September 1940 the decision to attempt a landing was postponed temporarily, and a month later it was called off till the following year. From then on, SEA LION served only as a ploy in the struggle with Britain.1 Given the nature of these invasion plans, based on the use of all three services and a Channel crossing at the narrowest point, it is reasonable to suppose German military staffs referred to them later when trying to predict where and how the Allies would attempt a landing in northern France.

Once Stalin had been defeated and Germany had gained Lebensraum; the east, and the armament effort had been shifted to the Luftwaffe and the navy, it would be easier to bring London to its knees and attempt a landing In the FÃ¼hrer's opinion, a decisive attack on Britain from 1 occupied western Europe would have every chance of success once the rear had been secur in the east and the huge resources of eastern Europe were available.3 So Hitler's thoughts in November 1940 of working closely y together with
