have every chance of success once the rear had been secur in the east and the huge resources of eastern Europe were available.3 So Hitler's thoughts in November 1940 of working closely y together with Vichy France 'in the manner most effective for future military a y action against Britain' should be seen only as an intention to secure the forward area of the main western battle-line. France's role was to help contain the influenceof Britain and De Gaulle in North Africa.4 If, however, Vichy's position North Africa were to deteriorate, then, according to Hitler in early December in 1940, the rest of France would have to be occupied by German troo (Operation ATTILA).5 When the first weeks of the campaign against the Soviet Union proved com- pletely successful, the German leadership began to shift armament and arr production towards the Luftwaffe and the navy. In mid-1941 plans were aga put forward for an attack on Britain once Operation BARBAROSSA had I bee successfully concluded. This time they ranged from air raids and the severance ce of Britain's vital sea communications to a full-scale invasion. But in late autumn that year, when developments in the east ran counter to German expectations In of the armament effort had once again to be concentrated on the needs of the army6 An OKW order of mid-December 1941 made it clear that in view of the unexpectedly long duration of the fighting in the Soviet Union, and the United States' entry into the war, the task now was to secure the western occupied territories against enemy attacks and landings rather than launch an offensive from them. The Wehrmacht top brass started planning the construction of 'new western wall' along the coast from Norway to the Bay of Biscay Nevertheless, Hitler and his generals did not lose sight of their original intention to resume operations in the west once victory over the Soviet Union-which remained the FÃ¼hrer's primary war aim-had been achieved 3 Germany and the Second World War, iii. 45,
