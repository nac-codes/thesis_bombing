Everywhere the increasingly harsh repressive measures to which the occupying power resorted began to isolate those sections of the population that were prepared to collaborate.

In these countries too, the per- sistent silence of senior representatives of the Nazi regime about the future of the occupied territories, and the military setbacks of the Wehrmacht, aroused resentment, rebelliousness, and finally resistance.35 Nowhere in the west, not even in France, was the situation up to mid-1943 so threatening that a regular war had to be waged-as it had, for example, 31 See Steinberg, Les Allemands, 99; Das Dritte Reich, ii. doc. 92, 184-5, and Umbreit, Militärbefehlshaber, 135 ff., 140. 32 On unification under Jean Moulin see Duclos, Mémoiren, ii. 36, and Foot, Resistance, 239-40.
