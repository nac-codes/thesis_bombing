ooner or later be obliged to open a second front for political reasons, even if the military situation was not particularly favourable. 42 Speculation was also fuelled by reports from intelligence agents about enemy landing intentions. In October 1942 they warned the OKW of an imminent attack on the important port of Cherbourg, and in February 1943 Hitler's suspicion that the Allies were intending to land in Spain gave rise to OKW plans for Operation GISELA.43 The general confusion about enemy intentions was clearly visible in GOC West's basic order to his troops in February 1943. As so often before, it referred to 'increasing indications that we shall soon be facing the long-expected major Anglo-American offensive'. The main landing would 'definitely' take place on the coast from Holland to Nantes (a distance of some 1,500 km!), followed by a landing in the Bay of Biscay, and a 'secondary' 40 See ADAP, E, iii. doc. 46, 29 June 1942, 75 (RAM); PA, BÃ¼ro d.St.S., files on 'Second Front', 1942 to 1944, i-iii, and KTB OKW, iii/I. 160 (25 Feb. 1943). 41 GenStdH, Foreign Armies West, enemy situation report No. 6/43, 15 Mar. 1943, BA-MA RH 2/v. 1481. 42 See I/Skl, Ib, n.

It is possible that the main purpose of the order was to incite troops in all areas to greater vigilance, since none of the intelligence reports of the time ce definitely predicted an imminent large-scale landing.
