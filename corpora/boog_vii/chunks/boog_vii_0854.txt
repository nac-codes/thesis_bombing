00 to 300,000 cubic metres of concrete were used, and as late as June 1044 some 160,000 labourers, mostly French, were still working on the unfinished fortifications.50 To speed up construction of the Atlantic Wall, Rundstedt even proposed to the OKW in October 1942 that Russian prisoners of war be used as building workers. They would have many advantages, he argued, since they were (content with little' and 'simple-minded', and therefore only marginally sus- ceptible to enemy propaganda. Disciplinary problems were also easier to deal with than in the case of western European workers, since 'if [Soviet prisoners] didn't jump to it, they could simply be shot'.51 Despite the huge input of manpower and material for the coastal fortifica- tions, doubts soon arose as to whether the whole enterprise was worthwhile. The defensive value of the fortifications was limited by their lack of depth, and the need to deploy large numbers of troops to man the weapons vitiated the aim of economizing on personnel. Worse still, it proved impossible to keep to schedule. By February 1943 only 6,000 of the 15,000 installations originally planned had been completed.52 It seems clear that, underlying the doubts about the usefulness of the coastal fortifications, there was concern about the implications of the huge construc- tion project for future defence strategy. A FÃ¼hrer directive of 23 March 1942 still talked about assigning major tasks in the defence of the coastal forward area to the navy and the Luftwaffe, and in May 1943 Hitler stated: 'The Atlantic is my forward area in the west, and even if I have to fight on the defensive there, it will be better than leaving defence until the coast of Europe.'53 But that was exactly what was implied by the concept of the Atlantic Wall. In the terminology of the times, 'forward area' was understood only as a huge tank barrier. Hitler and the OKW hoped a defensive wall would effectively counter Allied sea and air superiority, leaving the decisive
