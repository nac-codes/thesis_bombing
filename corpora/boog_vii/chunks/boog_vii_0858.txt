dt and his staff had built up a concentration of troops along the Channel coast in the operational zone of the Fifteenth Army. That was where they thought the Allies were most likely to attempt a landing. 62 This assumption was based less on information from the secret services than on their own tactical reasoning, which gave particular weight to geographical factors. GOC West thought the Allies' best chance of a successful troop crossing was from Dover to Calais, where the Channel was at its narrowest. A bridgehead at this point could be effectively defended by the Allied air forces because of its proximity to British air bases. The frontiers of the Reich and the crucially important Ruhr district would both be within striking distance, and a thrust from Calais towards the south east would permanently endanger the supply lines between Germany and France.63 The concentration of divisions at the narrowest part of the Channel did not mean that GOC West could afford to neglect the rest of the coastline; Allied landings were possible in other areas too. After the combined British and Canadian attack on Dieppe in August 1942, the Germans felt obliged to fortify the major ports and station troops in the area. All this made it impossible to ensure the presence of German troops throughout the occupied territories, which Rundstedt considered necessary for security reasons. Given the limited human and material resources available, large-scale deployment of combat forces inland was now possible only in the large cities. 64 but Rundstedt was further handicapped by the complicated command structure in the west. The Luftwaffe and the navy had not been placed directly under his command, and were simply under instructions to cooperate with him.65 There was consequently no lack of friction. The disruptive effect was espe- cially noticeable in key areas like the planning and organization of coastal 61 See Diagram II.II.I, 'Deployment of forces in the area of Army Group D (GOC West)';
