the Reich was significantly reduced. Churchill reacted positively to this proposal (codenamed SLEDGEHAMMER), but in early April 1942 the com- bined staff planners in Washington expressed considerable doubts as to its fea- sibility, arguing that it would scarcely be possible to assemble the necessary ground, sea, and air forces in Britain by the target date of 15 September 1942. On the other hand, they thought an initial landing with a first wave of five brigades would be entirely realistic in early 1943, always provided the Soviet Union con- tinued to pin down the majority of German troops in the east.9 To reconcile these views and establish unambiguous objectives, the Chief of the US Army general staff, Gen. George C. Marshall, and Roosevelt's advisor, Harry Hopkins, travelled to London for negotiations in early April. There it soon became clear that the British had little taste for large-scale landings in France in 1942. Instead, Churchill and Sir Alan Francis Brooke, Chief of the imperial general staff, proposed limited operations in Norway or a landing in North Africa. 8 Germany and the Second World War, vi. 54.
