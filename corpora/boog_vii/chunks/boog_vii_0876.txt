operations (ETOUSA), that the preparations for an invasion were slowing down. Since the Allied decision to land in North Africa, two major operations were overlapping. Many officers originally assigned to ROUNDUP were now working on TORCH. In addition, Eisenhower and his staff soon realized that the technical problems of a landing in north-west France were greater than initially anticipated. All this finally convinced him that the invasion of western Europe could not start in early 1943 but would have to wait until the autumn.15 Evaluation of the abortive attack on Dieppe in August 1942 (Operation JUBILEE) confirmed Eisenhower and his staff in their view that a large-scale landing should not be rushed. JUBILEE not only revealed serious training and organizational deficiencies, but also showed that absolute sea and air superiority in the invasion zone was essential before the landing could begin. 16 That September, when Churchill informed the US president of his views on future operations in the Mediterranean, a landing in western Europe in autumn 1943 also seemed doubtful. The British prime minister proposed to Roosevelt that once German troops had been driven out of North Africa, the Allies should land in Italy or begin operations in Norway. They should schedule the much smaller Operation SLEDGEHAMMER for 1943, but not ROUNDUP. Roosevelt agreed to this proposal in principle, whereas the US War Department was reluctant to accept any further delay. Many American officers, notably Admiral Ernest Joseph King, C-in-C of the US fleet, who were getting tired of London's objections, at times even advocated switching the centre of gravity of US involvement to the Pacific.17 The shift of strategic priorities to the Mediterranean changed the arrange- ments for planning the invasion and affected the transport of fighting forces needed for the operation. The planned build-up of airforce and army units in Britain was cut back drastically. At the end of 1942 the Allied staff off
