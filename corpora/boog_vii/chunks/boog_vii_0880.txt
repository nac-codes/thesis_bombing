temporary respite.25 Two events, in particular, incited the Allies to reconsider their future intentions in the first half of 1943. The surrender of German and Italian troops in North Africa, followed shortly afterwards by the failure of the U-boat war in the North Atlantic, opened up practical possibilities for planning an invasion. Although the long-standing differences of opinion were still apparent at the TRIDENT conference in Washington on 12-15 May, the Allies decided-in addition to boosting defence against U-boats and stepping up air attacks on the territory of the Reich-to push forward with preparations for an invasion and begin the landing on I May 1944. A firm date, on which the Americans were so keen, had at last been agreed.24 Before the conference ended, Morgan and his staff were instructed to draw up an outline plan for the invasion by I August 1943. The whole operation, shortly afterwards codenamed OVERLORD, was to be based on the deployment of a total of 29 divisions, seven of which (four American and three British) had vet to be transferred to Britain from the Mediterranean.25 In the opinion of Morgan and his staff officers, a full-scale landing was feasible only if the enemy's military potential had previously been undermined by heavy bombardment and a strict sea blockade, and if the landing was accompanied 22 See Harrison, Cross-Channel Attack, 44; the Canadian prime minister, William L.
