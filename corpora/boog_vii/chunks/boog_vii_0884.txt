ent the Germans strengthening their forces in the intended landing area. They accordingly proposed that the enemy's attention be diverted to the Pas-de-Calais, that reconnaissance missions be flown over the whole coastal area of western Europe rather than just over Normandy, and that the bombing of German fortifications be in no event restricted to the landing area.32 Taking all these requirements into account, the Allied planners proceeded to calculate the strength and composition of the invasion force. On the basis of the TRIDENT conference, Morgan could assume that by May 1944 enough landing craft would be available to carry five divisions (three in the first wave and two as follow-up). As we have seen, the combined chiefs of staff had planned the deployment of 29 divisions for OVERLORD, and the air force staffs had proposed that airborne units and approximately 12,000 aircraft (7,300 from the United States and 4,600 from the British Empire) should be provided for their support.33 There were still considerable differences of opinion in the Allied camp as to when the necessary number of divisions could be assembled.
