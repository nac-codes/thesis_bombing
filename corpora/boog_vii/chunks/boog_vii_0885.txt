Theo conflicting estimates arose because the British officers did not include anyet the newly formed US divisions in the contingent of 29 divisions planned for OVERLORD. They adopted a stricter criterion than the US planners, namel- that only battle-tried divisions-mainly from the Mediterranean area-shoul. be used in the Normandy invasion.34 Despite these grey areas, Morgan's plan of mid-July 1943 contained detailed proposals for the initial attack phase, the flow of troops into the lodgemen area, and subsequent military objectives in France. The first wave, comprisin one British, one American, and one Canadian division, was to establish a bridgehead between Grandcamp, Bayeux, and Caen. The main objective cas by Morgan's staff was the capture of Cherbourg by D + 14 (14 days after D-Day). Brittany should be liberated within six to eight weeks of the landing, so that its ports could be used.
