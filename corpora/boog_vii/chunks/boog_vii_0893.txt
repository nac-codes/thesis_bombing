7 With regard to the conduct of war on the continent, Hitler and his generals 497 in the OKW decided to defend 'Fortress Europe' at its outer limits, on the grounds that yielding any territory would adversely effect the armament economy.4 In late October and early November 1943, doubtless under the influence of growing Allied strength, the view prevailed that 'extensive loss of territory" could in fact be tolerated in the east, since it would not affect Germany's 'vital nerve centre', whereas a successful Allied landing in the west could endanger the continued existence of the Reich. At the same time, Hitler considered the Allied invasion itself a great opportunity for Germany. If it won the 'decisive battle in the west', the Allies would have little chance of repeating a major landing. Rather, Germany would again be in a position to shift its main war effort to the east and finally conquer the Soviet Union. Accordingly, German forces in western and northern Europe had to be provided with all possible means of defeating the impending invasion.5 This sounded plausible enough. In reality, however, by far the greater part of the German units available remained tied down on the eastern front right up to the end of the war, preventing the build-up of a heavy concentration of forces in the west.6 It was probably this state of affairs that induced German military leaders to look for other strategies. In mid-1943 Dönitz proposed to Hitler that the navy resume its war on Allied shipping, following a strenuous armament effort. The consequent disruption of the Allied supply system would prevent the British and Americans from proceeding with their planned invasion. Hitler agreed, but told the Kriegsmarine's C-in-C to wait until overall strategic conditions had changed.7 Despite Hitler's reservations, Dönitz tried once again to seize the initiative in the conduct of operations outside Europe, but the resumption of attacks on Allied convoys in autumn 1943, begun with insufficient
