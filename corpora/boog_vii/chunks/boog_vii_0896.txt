Britain, with sufficient sea transport for eight to ten divisions. In the view of the German naval leadership, a powerful armada of Allied warships could be deployed to defend the landing craft, 11 At the end of December 1943 Foreign Armies West produced a study in which it concluded that in Britain alone there were 56 divisions and 18 " Jodl, briefing, 7 Nov. 1943, 83 ff., BA-MA N 69/17; Messerschmidt, 'Realit√§tsverlust', 225 10 See Cubbage, 'Anticipating Overlord', 62, 137, app. B, 151; Paine, Intelligence, 9 ff .; on friction between the intelligence services see Naval Group West Command, KTB, II Sept. 1943, BA-MA RM 35 II/61. 11 The following vessels were available for that purpose in November 1943: 6 battleships. aircraft carriers, 8 monitors, and 20 cruisers; see Jodl, briefing, 7 Nov. 1943, 56, ibid., N 69/17; on divisions in England see Foreign Armies West, III, May to Dec. 1943, ibid., RH 2/v. 1614; this source gives 43 divisions and 9 brigades in England in May 1943. 499 brigades, most of them (32 to 34) stationed south of a line running from the Wash to the Bristol Channel. Further north, in the Midlands, there were eight large units, and in Scotland another seven or eight. 12 The Germans thus assumed the presence of much stronger forces in the British Isles by the end of 1043 than the enemy actually had available even shortly before the invasion.13 The resultant analysis of enemy intentions showed that northern France was the most likely place for a landing, but that Norway was also a possibility. At the same time, Foreign Armies West reported the existence of a threat to southern France, on the grounds that 16 to 19 of the enemy's estimated 55 divisions in the Mediterranean area could still be made available for a landing on the south coast of France. A concentration of Allied shipping in the western Mediterranean was also gradually discernible, 14 and the formation of new French divisions in North Africa was further indication of Allied plans to land
