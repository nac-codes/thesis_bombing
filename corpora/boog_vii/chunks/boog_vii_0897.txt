In September 1943 Naval Group West considered that the temporary weakness of German military forces in the region was an added inducement to the Allies to attempt a landing on France's Mediterranean coast.15 However, when the German intelligence services received reports that the Allies would be continuing to transfer landing craft from North Africa to Britain via Gibraltar, attention turned once again to north-west Europe. The south of France was not again considered a possible landing area until the end of 1943, when the British 8th Army launched a major offensive in Italy.16 Estimates of the concentration of Allied forces in the south of England were a major factor in persuading the Germans to consider Allied plans for landings outside the wider Channel area as secondary or diversionary tactics, but Hitler and the Wehrmacht operations staff still took such possibilities seriously in late December 1943. They thought the Allies might well attempt to divert attention from the main invasion across the English Channel by carrying out smaller landing operations on the periphery and thus hinder the build-up of German forces in the coastal regions of Belgium and northern France.17 On strategic grounds, they continued to reason that the Allies' real objective after the 12 See Foreign Armies West, map, 31 Dec. 1943, ibid., RH 2/v. 1514; this source gives the US component as 5-6 infantry divisions, 1-2 armoured divisions, and I airborne division; assumed air strength: 6,500 aircraft; see OB West, 30 Nov. 1943, app. to KTB, ibid., RH 19 IV/20. 13 See below, Ch.
