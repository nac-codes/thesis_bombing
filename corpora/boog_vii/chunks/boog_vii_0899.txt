its in the area of the Cotentin peninsula. 20 Despite these indications, the German remained unsure e of enemy inten- tions. How unsure can be seen from some of the reactions to the reports of troop movements in England. While Foreign Armies West concluded at the end of the year that an immediate threat to Norway could almost certainly be ruled out, Hitler stuck to his view that it remained an Allied target, 21 Apart from the question of where the invasion would take place, the various intelligence services and command authorities were concerned to discover her the Allies intended to carry out the landing itself. Reports on successful amphibious operations in Italy were available in the second half of 1943, and to some extent formed the basis for the German model of the major landing expected on the Channel coast. It was assumed that the attack would begin with heavy bombing, that the landing would then begin on a broad front under cover of artillery fire from accompanying warships, and that the Allies would make early use of tanks, not least in order to seize control of major ports.22 All this was generally uncontroversial. On the other hand, t there were differences of opinion about the effects of air attacks on the mobility of the German forces. While Foreign Armies West assumed it would be very difficult to get reserve forces to the landing area quickly, officers on the Wehrmacht operations staff pointed out that the mobility of German forces had not been reduced decisively during the landing at Salerno, despite Allied air supremacy Although the two departments did not go into the matter any further in late 1943, their difference of opinion sparked a controversy that significantlu affected plans for moving German troops to the Channel coast in the following months. 23 18 See conference of commanding officers, 11 Nov. 1943, I/SKI, ibid., RM 7/98, and Umbreit 'La Stratégie défensive', 126. 19 See Naval Group West Command, KTB, situation overview for September, 30
