rthermore, in view of the enormous Allied build-up, landings on the western part of the Channel coast, from Normandy to Brittany, and even in the Bay of Biscay, were also possible. From time to time, especially in February and March 1944, Foreign Armies West and the Wehrmacht operations staff, as well as OB West himself, suspected that the main landing on the Channel coast would be preceded by a smaller landing in the south of France-a possibility suggested by reports of concentrations of troops and warships in the western Mediterranean that were obviously not required for the fighting in Italy.29 No clear conclusions about the timing of landings in the north and south were reached, however, and these suspicions again faded into the background. German planning was dominated by the scenario, drawn up by Hitler at the end of December 1943, of a large-scale Allied landing in the area of the Fifteenth Army. The top military leadership had practically no doubts about it. Only subordinate bodies, like Naval Group West Command and Air Fleet 3, worked on alternative scenarios, while their command authorities, the Navy and Luftwaffe operations staff, followed the official line. In February 1944 Naval Group West's enemy-situation analysts already suspected that the enemy was hardly likely to attack in the area in which Germany's own defence forces were concentrated. They took it for granted that the Allies were well informed about German defence preparations. Countless non-Germans were working on the fortifications and in German administrative bodies and supply organizations, so it was difficult to prevent information being passed on to Allied agents.30 28 See Foreign Armies West, 26 May 1944, BA-MA RH 2/v. 89; according to this source the 2Ist Army Group consisted of the British 5th and 2nd Armies, and the Canadian Ist Army; the US Ist Army Group (FUSAG) consisted of the US 9th and Ist Armies; and there were a suspected 40 divisions of operational reserves in the USA. 29 Sit
