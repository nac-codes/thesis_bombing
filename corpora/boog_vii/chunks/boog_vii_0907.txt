Was all this not sufficient indication, the Naval Group West Command officers wondered in late April and early May 1944, that the landing area would be further west than had been assumed so far-possibly between the Somme estuary and the Cotentin peninsula?31 Only a few days later the intelligence officers of Air Fleet 3 concluded, as on several previous occasions, that the continued bombing of Seine crossing points between the estuary and Mantes could only mean that the Allies were planning to land between Le Havre and Cherbourg. They must have felt their analysis had been confirmed when, shortly afterwards, the Allies also destroyed the bridges across the Loire at Angers, Tours, and Orleans, and it seemed obvious they were trying to cut off large parts of Normandy. Foreign Armies West, however, interpreted this-admittedly against the background suspected an attack further to the north-east; see OB West, app. to KTB, OB West to OKW/ WFSt, 20 Jan. 1944, ibid., RH 19 IV/26, 37. 31 Naval Group West Command, KTB, 26 Apr. and 2 May 1944, ibid., RM 35 II/62.

B. the time being, the latter were inclined to focus very widely. OB West expected that the landing would probably take place from the Scheldt to Normand perhaps also in parts of Brittany.33 For the rest, the Germans s were largely groping in the dark, since-as the OKW reported to Hitler on 18 May 1944-0 relatively meaningless Allied radio signals could be picked up, a , and they had no succeeded in breaking any important
