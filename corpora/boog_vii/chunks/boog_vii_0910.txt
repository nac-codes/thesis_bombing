g the French population what to do in the event of an invasion, the imposition of postal censorship in Britain, or noticeable troop movements from the north to the south of England, gave the impression that a landing was imminent.38 The multitude of assumptions and reports made it difficult for the German intelligence services to give a precise date for the invasion, leaving OB West no alternative but to warn his troops repeatedly of an imminent attack. In addition to the date of the invasion, the Germans tried to determine at what time of day the first landing would begin. Rehearsal operations by the Allies in England, which the German intelligence services had managed to follow in part, pointed to an invasion at dawn, two hours after the lowest water level. Tide tables for all stretches of the Channel coast, drawn up by Naval Group West Command, showed that if the landing was not attempted in May, the only period in June when conditions would be similar to those pertaining during the Allies' trial manoeuvres was the 5th to the 7th. If this period was eliminated, similarly favourable conditions would not occur in Normandy until the 20th of the month.39 As with the discussion about the place of the landing, there was again no serious attempt to compare all the reports and their implications, examine them from various standpoints, and arrive at a valid conclusion. Instead, one gets the impression that each department responsible for gathering and evaluating information drew its own conclusions in the light of its own terms of reference and the specific concerns of each arm of the service. This doubtless encouraged the tendency to accept information that fitted the approach 37 See Naval Group West Command, KTB, 22 May 1944, BA-MA RM 35 II/62, and OB West, IC, app. to KTB, 21 and 29 Feb. 1944, ibid., RH 19 IV/131. 38 OB West, app. to KTB, 17 Jan. 1944 (Russian offensive), ibid., RH 19 IV/26, Naval Group West Command, KTB, 12 May 1944 (offensive in Italy), ibid., RM 35
