to follow the le sar lines, resulting in similar advantages and disadvantages for attacker and defender in the various stages of the invasion. Be that as it may, this experien was drawn on in developing the German defence tactics, although it was cles to many that conditions in Italy could not simply be transposed to north- west France. 41 There was no doubt that the defenders' best chance of repelling an invasion and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy was during the approach phase and the first landing. 'Our forward-area obstacle is the sea,' OB West impressed on his troops once again in February 1944, 'and there is no better anti-tank ditch! This meant that strong forces had to be stationed in the coastal fortifications in deep staggered formation, and kept at a permanent state of readiness Â« oppose a landing and fight off invading troops with the help of local reserves The longer they were able to hold up the Allied advance after the landing, the greater the possibility of bringing in motorized units from a central reserva and of deploying troops from other areas under OB West and even from distant theatres. The overriding principle, therefore, was to hold all coastal positions 'to the last man'. 'In the west,' said Rundstedt, 'there can be n giving way.'42 Allied sea and air supremacy were to be cancelled out bu almost impregnable fortifications and the superior fighting qualities of the German soldier.43 40 See Boog, 'Luftwaffe Role', 41 ff .; Cubbage, 'German Misapprehensions', 114 ff .; Gilbert Second World War, 526. 41 Foreign Armies West, Information on British-American tactics for landing in Sicily, 16 Jul 1943, BA-MA RH 2/v. 502; on defence concepts see Ose, Entscheidung im Westen, 47 ff. 42 OB West, Ia, Basic Order No. 37, 24 Feb. 1944, ibid., RW 4/v. 628; Foreign Armies West VIII Chefs., II Jan. 1944, OB West to subordinate armies, ibid., RH 2/v. 536; on securing the coastal forward area see H.Gr.
