Gaps in other defence sectors should be concealed by spoofing manoeuvres so as to prevent landings-in the words of GÃ¼nther Blumentritt, Rundstedt's chief of the general staff, 'even where we have as scanty a cover as a ballet dancer'.44 In view of the relatively short distances involved, it might be assumed that transfers of troops within 'Fortress Europe' would give the defending side considerable advantages. Yet the reported number and disposition of enemy divisions seemed to nullify the advantage of the 'inner line', since-in Jodl's view, for example-the Allies' strength was such that they could attempt a landing on almost any coast in Europe.45 Hitler and the army officers were more or less in agreement on the defensive approach outlined above. What they squabbled about was, compared with the importance of a precise estimate of enemy strength and intentions, a relatively secondary matter-to wit, where the motorized reserves should be stationed. This issue absorbed a great deal of the German military staffs' energy for a long time. Everything was complicated by the confusion of responsibilities, which persisted even in this period, although only the top military command authorities and army staffs took part in the 'panzer controversy'. This began in autumn 1943, peaked at the end of the year, and continued in somewhat abated form
