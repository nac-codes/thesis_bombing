though only the top military command authorities and army staffs took part in the 'panzer controversy'. This began in autumn 1943, peaked at the end of the year, and continued in somewhat abated form until the Allied landing. The basic issue was whether the mobile divisions should be moved near the coast and spread out in a line, or kept ready at a central location in the interior. Hitler, the Wehrmacht operations staff, and all the command authorities on the Channel coast (Army Group B, Wehrmacht Commander Netherlands, Fifteenth and Seventh Armies) were in favour of the first option; OB West, the other army staffs (First and Nineteenth), and the command authorities of the armoured divisions (Panzer Group West Command and Inspector-General of Panzer Troops) argued for the second. Experience of Allied landings in Italy again had to be taken into account. There-it was argued-the German forces had found themselves in a weaker position because their mobile units were too far away, suffered heavy losses on the way to the Allied bridgeheads, and eventually reached the invasion zone too late. Those who pursued this line of argument, however, were readily accused of underestimating the effect of the enemy's powerful naval artillery and air power. Panzer units stationed on the coast would be decimated before they could even begin be used. Furthermore, if they were spread out in a line it would be almost impossible to move them once the main focus of the attack became apparent.
