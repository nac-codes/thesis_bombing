ebruary 1944 he wrote to commanding officers emphatically rejecting any comparison with Fra to hi Maginot Line, which had failed so miserably in 1940. Stressing the many ance's advantages of the Atlantic Wall under construction, Rundstedt repeated the other the troops in the coastal area must not and would not give way, as the Frene had done. By way of emphasis, less combative souls were even threatened wiel the death sentence if they failed to hold their ground. Such excuses 'we could not hold out any longer because we had no more ammunition s as supplies' would have the 'most serious consequences' for those responsible 6 The top military leadership, however, seemed not entirely the effect of such threats. Otherwise they would not have ordered the con y convinced struction of defensive installations further inland, as they did in November 1943-although they kept it top secret so as not to demoralize the earl troops. Shortly afterwards, a restricted circle of selected officers reconnoitrad defensive positions along the Somme and the Marne-Sa√¥ne canal and the Swiss border.61 None of this, of course, was seen as an alternative to defensive preparation in the coastal region, which continued to be given top priority.
