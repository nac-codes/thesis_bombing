Within the battle zone, army commanders-in-chief had full powers,63 including the right to evacuate the civilian population. This right was exercised to the full, and by mid-February 1944 no fewer than 313,000 people had been forced to leave their homes.64 Nevertheless, no military measures could be taken without considering their impact on the economy, since Germany's war industry remained dependent on the proper functioning of French enterprises even in the 'battle zone'.
