In the discussions on the extent and location of the flooding, con- ficts arose between the army, navy, and Luftwaffe that were exacerbated by the unequal division of powers. As we have seen, OB West and the OKW had given most authority to the army command. When it became clear that AOK (army head quarters staff) 15 intended to undertake widespread flooding operations on its own authority, Air Fleet 3 and Naval Group West Command objected on the grounds that the flooding would put many of their installations at risk. While OB West did not refuse to consider these objections, the commander-in-chief of the Fifteenth Army reacted angrily: "I totally disagree with the position of the navy and Luftwaffe ... with regard to the planned flooding. The navy is interfering in matters that are none of its concern.' He informed OB West, moreover, that Army Group B had 'now ordered the flooding'. Rundstedt and his staff had to act as intermediaries, propose compromises, and even seek a decision of principle from the OKW. After seemingly endless negotiations, a balance was struck between the two positions: bearing in mind 62 OB West, KTB, 14 and 20 Jan. 1944 (special powers, fortress commands), ibid., RH 19 IV/22, and ibid., Ic, app. 87, Conduct of battle by OB West, Feb. 1944, ibid., RH IV/131; War Directives, No. 11, 159 ff. 63 Immediately behind the 'battle zone' was the 'security area'; see OB West, Ia, Basic Order No. 9, 31 Jan. 1944, ibid., RW 4/v. 628, and OKW/WFSt, Op(H) West to OB West, 7 Feb. 1944, ibid .; this source contains the following assertion, subsequently contradicted by the facts: 'For the fortress and battle commander, the place entrusted to him is his fate. Like the sea captain, he goes down with his ship. German military tradition knows no other way.'
