Everything else would remain at the planning preparation stage.66 Even though OB West's original aim of completing the Atla antic Wall by the beginning of March 1944 proved impossible to achieve, the Germans nevertheless managed to build a large number of defence i installations and provide them with effective protection against bombardment, especially in el area in which they expected the landing to be concentrated. The unfinish installations gave continuing cause for concern as they were particularly exposed to attack from the air. The numerous bunkers, obstacles, minefields, and flood areas were one thing; the military effectiveness of the Atlantic Wall quite another. As mo German officers certainly realized, everything would hinge on the fightin quality of the troops defending the fortifications-in the final analysis, on the strength, mobility, and reserves. 67 Pz Group West (Geyr von Schweppenburg) OKW Reserve 1st SS-Pz Div. 12th SS-Pz Div. 17th SS-Pz Div SS Pz Lehr Div Insp .- Gen.
