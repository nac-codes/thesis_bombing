and south of France, separate operations could now be directed by different army group commanders under the overall responsibility of OB West. In addition to Army Groups B and G, Rundstedt was also given respons- ibility for Panzer Group West Command, set up at the turn of 1943-4 as a command authority for the mechanized divisions. This effectively put paid to Rommel's attempts to extend his influence to armies and divisions beyond his area of command.74 It would appear on the surface that the Germans managed to tighten up and clarify their command structure significantly a few weeks before the invasion. In reality, months of an exhausting tug-of-war resulted in more or less the same state of affairs as at the end of 1943. For although the Panzer Group Command was now under OB West, Rundstedt had only indirect control of the mechanized divisions. Four tank units (the 'OKW reserve') were directly answerable to the OKW, and the remaining six were split between Army Groups B and G. As before, Air Fleet 3 and Naval Group West were only under instructions to cooperate with OB West; in general, they took their orders from their commanders-in-chief. Rundstedt's control of Waffen-SS troops and reserve divisions was also subject to certain limitations. His influence on decisions of their military commanders was confined to military matters, otherwise the chain of command led to the quartermaster-general and the army high command.75 'OB West' thus remained a somewhat misleading title. Certainly, the division of responsibilities by region and task was not necessarily bound to have a negative effect. Had the full range of activities been taken into account, such a system would, in theory, have made a lot of sense. In practice, however, the arguments about the division of powers were fuelled less by objective requirements than by considerations of prestige and the desire to safeguard and extend existing areas of authority-not to mention the constant efforts of Hitler and his in
