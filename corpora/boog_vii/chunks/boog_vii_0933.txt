Diagram II.I.I, 'Number of divisions under OB West', can serve only as a rough guide, since the various command authorities applied different criteria in 521 recording the statistics for their units, especially if they were in transit or being restructured. Nevertheless, the general trends are apparent: from October 1943 onwards OB West could always count on around 25 static divisions, mostly deployed near the coast. They were reinforced by 'eastern battalions', that is, units made up of volunteers from various Soviet national groups, which were not to be allowed to fight independently but always under the strict control of German commanders, since they were simply not trusted.80 The graph also shows a decline in the total number of divisions-and in the number of panzer divisions taken separately-up to December 1943, after which both figures begin to rise. One reason for the decrease in the autumn of 1943 was the assumption that there were unlikely to be any attempted landings in the winter. The other reason, however, was that the eastern and southern theatres were claiming more and more troops. In the course of 1943, 24 divisions were transferred from the area of OB West to the Soviet Union, 17 to Italy, and three to south-east Europe, as well as numerous corps and army units. The quality of defensive preparations in the west suffered accordingly. In September 1943 Blumentritt, chie
