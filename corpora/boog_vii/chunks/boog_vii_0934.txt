nion, 17 to Italy, and three to south-east Europe, as well as numerous corps and army units. The quality of defensive preparations in the west suffered accordingly. In September 1943 Blumentritt, chief of the general staff, noted that the combat strength of the divisions in the west was then less than it had been a year earlier.81 The situation appeared to be changing at the end of 1943. In directive No. 51 of 3 November, and again in an order dated 28 December, Hitler forbade any further withdrawal of troops from the west. These orders, however, were lastingly vitiated in the next few months following numerous attacks by the Allies in Italy and the Red Army on the eastern front. Time and again, the precarious situation in other theatres forced the Germans to withdraw troops, especially mobile units, from the west and to undermine, if not demolish, its defensive structure.82 Only a few days before the invasion Hitler and the Wehrmacht operations staff still found it appropriate to withdraw troops from the area of OB West and transport them to Italy and the Soviet Union.83 As a rule, the units sent to the west as replacements were completely worn out and 80 App. to KTB OB West, Blumentritt to ChefdGenSt, 17 Jan. 1944, ibid., RH 19 IV/31; Coudry, Soldats de Vlassov, 8 ff. 81 OB West, app. to KTB, OB West to OKW/WFSt, 16 Dec. 1943, BA-MA RH 19 IV/20; transfers to other theatres from Oct. 1942 to Sept. 1943: 31 infantry and 16 panzer/motorized divisions; see KTB OKW, iii/II. 1091-2 (11 Sept. 1943); transfers to the eastern front from July 1943 to April 1944: one division each from Norway and Denmark, 13 divisions from OB West; see WFSt, strategic overview, 13 Apr. 1944, ibid., RW 4/v. 876, and MÃ¼ller-Hillebrand, Das Heer, ill. 63, 116, 144, 212-13. 82 See War Directives, No. 51, 151; Warlimont, Inside Hitler's Headquarters, 402, 410 ff .; OB West, app. to KTB, OB West to AOK 15, 3 Jan. 1944, BA-MA RH 19 IV/25. 83 OB West to AOK 15, 3 Jan. 1944; OB West to armies, 2 Jun.
