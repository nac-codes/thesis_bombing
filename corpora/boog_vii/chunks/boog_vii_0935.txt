The Germans Await an Invasion 522 II. III.3. Defensive Preparations in the West often needed many weeks to become more or less fit for action. In many case their operational redeployment was not envisaged until the end of May or later.84 The arithmetical increase of around ten divisions to a total of 60 the shown in the graph from mid-1943 up to the invasion cannot, therefo r eve necessarily be equated with an increase in combat strength. Furthermore, the ratio of distribution of all German army, Waffen-ss Luftwaffe field divisions among the various theatres of war had changed marginally over the same period. On I June 1944 there were 156 divisions in , and east (as against 186 in July 1943), 12 in Norway (14), 27 in Italy (7), and 25 in. 1 onl Balkans (15).85 The often striking emphasis that the highest military a placed on the importance of fending off the invasion was thus scarcely reflecte n the authori by a corresponding redeployment of the forces available.86 Even if we consi separately the divisions with the greatest strike power, that is, the panzer divie: and other motorized units, we still get a very similar impression. Of the motorized divisions stationed in the west at the start of the invasion, only were already in France in autumn 1943, another three joined them in the po January-April 1944, while the remaining six did not arrive until May 1944. That naturally affected their combat readiness. A report from Panzer West in January reveals that newly arrived motorized units often possessed onl. quarter of their staff officers and almost no
