ler could not have been very convinced by his suspicions, since on 2 June he ordered panzer units stationed to the north-west of Orleans to be transferred to the southern Ukraine. The first contingent left France only a few hours before the start of the invasion. This, of course, weakened the very forces that, given their high degree of mobility and favourable location, were best placed to take effective action against airborne troops; 5 Paratroop Division, which was stationed near Rennes but still in the process of reconstitution, could scarcely be employed effectively against airborne landings. Despite all this, LXXXIV Army Corps still had six divisions available in the area under its command between Avranches and Caen, supported by numerous panzer, paratroop, artillery, and 'eastern' battalions.92 AOK 7 also particularly under strength; see also Wilt, Atlantic Wall, 127-8; some of the tanks in the west were old P IVs; see Deutschland im zweiten Weltkrieg, v. 114; Gen.Insp.d.Pz.Tr., Panzer situation in the west, I Apr. 1944, BA-MA RH 10/89. 89 The Panzer-Lehr division was not brought back to the west (Le Mans-Dreux area) until early May 1944; see KTB OKW, iv/I. 302; on 3 May 1944 the 12th SS-Panzer Division stationed near Dreux was still 25% short of officers and 50% short of NCOs; see Pz.Gr.
