s worse, navy and Luftwaffe units frequently refused to take part in practice manoeuvres organized by the army thus dooming them to failure in the opinion of AOK 7.94 So although the influx of new forces was more or less complete by the end of May, it had no achieved all that was expected of it. (e) Personnel and Equipment Problems y and In the efforts to organize effective defence in the area of the Seventh Army LXXXIV Army Corps, personnel and equipment proved time and again to b the decisive factors. The same was true, although under somewhat differe conditions, for the whole area under the command of OB West. Comb operations up to mid-1943, particularly in the east, had resulted in heavy los of trained soldiers. The authorities responded to this situation by restructurin in various areas. Germans fit for active service who were working in the war industry were increasingly replaced by foreign labour. The ranks of the replacement army were filled with convalescents and minors. Older men were called up, while at the same time the minimum call-up age was generally lowered. 95 All this was still not enough. In late November the OKW relayed a extremely strict order from Hitler to transfer a million men immediately from desk jobs behind the lines to combat units. Under the terms of the order itself. any officers resisting it, even passively, would face court-martial. Three weeks later OB West, like all other commanders, adopted implementing measures that provided for a strict review of the status of all military personnel. 96 93 AOK 7/senior quartermaster, activity report, 6 May 1944, ibid., RH 20-7/294. 94 AOK 7, KTB, 7 May and 13 May 1944, ibid., RH 20-7/134; OB West to armies, 28 Der 1943, ibid., RH 2/v. 535, and OB West, KTB, 28 Mar. 1944, ibid., RH 19 IV/24. 95 Jodl, briefing, 7 Nov. 1943, 114 ff., ibid., RW 4/v. 38; MÃ¼ller-Hillebrand, Das Heer, iii. 172. 254; Hinsley, British Intelligence, iii/2. 24. 96 OKW/WFSt (order from Hitler) to army groups, 27 Nov. 1943,
