The first snags with the order became apparent in mid-February 1944. According to the OKW, transfers of personnel first required the agreement of 525 the supreme command authorities of all branches of the Wehrmacht. It is hardly surprising that this constraint alone sufficed to ensure that nothing worth mentioning was done, since each branch of the service sought to maintain its own strength at the expense of the others.97 At the end of February, concerned that the combing-out operation was taking so long, OB West set up a taskforce with far-reaching delegated powers. It immediately identified various methods used to evade Hitler's order. Many command authorities had released staff only to transfer them back discreetly to newly created posts or existing command units. At the beginning of April Keitel complained that a mere 6,500 men had been released for combat duty so far. Yet at the same time over 50,000 members of the Wehrmacht were employed in a wide variety of military departments in Paris alone. In the following weeks, however, only a few departments responded to Keitel's demand that at least 15,000 men be released in the west.98 This slow-moving operation shows once again how entrenched the Wehrmacht structures in the west actually were. Over the preceding months and years of occupation many military departments and command authorities had managed to cocoon themselves off and successfully persuade others that they were indispensable. To overcome the prevailing shortage of personnel, particularly in the new units, many command authorities took matters into their own hands and addressed themselves directly to military departments in the Reich without going through hierarc
