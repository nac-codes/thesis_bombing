ersonnel, particularly in the new units, many command authorities took matters into their own hands and addressed themselves directly to military departments in the Reich without going through hierarchical channels. The OKW tried to counter this by arrogating to itself all responsibility for sizeable movements of personnel and equipment. Even so, OB West frequently learnt only by chance of transfers of quite large contingents of men in the area under his command.99 Rundstedt and his staff adopted various deceptive tactics to conceal the true strength of German forces in the west from the Allies. Reinforcements from the Reich were brought in conspicuously during daylight hours, non-existent divisions were simulated by means of false insignia, and information on bogus new postings was planted with agents suspected of being Allied informers. Troop departures from the area of OB West, on the other hand, were cloaked in the greatest secrecy. These tactics, adopted mainly in autumn 1943 and 97 OB West, app. to KTB, OB West to armies, 11 Feb. 1944, ibid., RH 19 IV/27. 98 Ibid., OB West to armies, 22 Feb. 1944, ibid., RH 19 IV/28 (Sonderstab); ibid., 3 Mar. 1944, Sonderstab z.b.V., No. 19/44, ibid., RH 19 IV/29 (Mißstände); OKW/WFSt, Op(H) West, Keitel to OB West, 6 Apr. 1944, ibid., RH 2/v. 537; and app. to KTB OB West, 18 May 1944, ibid., RH 19 IV/39 (demand from OB West to armies for a 20% to 25% reduction in non-combatant per- sonnel); on Wehrmacht departments in Paris see Jäckel, Frankreich, 305. 99 OB West, app. to KTB, OB West to OKW/WFSt, 5 June 1944, BA-MA RH 19 IV/40; ibid., OB West to armies, 28 Oct. 1943, ibid., RH 19 IV/15. Many units also tried to make good their shortage of equipment by uncontrolled requisitioning; see Mil.Cdr.
