Allied air defences not only beat them off, but inflicted ever greater losses on the German units. At the end of December 1943 IX Air Corps still had over 350 operational aircraft; by May 1044 the number had fallen to 107. Few replacements were available, because of Allied air raids on German arms factories. 111 As the other Luftwaffe units in the west were faring not much better, Hitler and the Luftwaffe operations staff resorted to other methods. Once again, spoofing measures, such as setting up more fake airfields and dummy aircraft, were taken in an attempt to conceal the weakness of German air power in the west. These measures were apparently more successful than those of the army, since Allied intelligence consistently overestimated the strength of the Luftwaffe. 112 Nevertheless, dummies would be of little use for defence against an enemy landing. When the invasion came, sufficient numbers of real planes would have to be deployed against the Allied air fleets. As already mentioned, the first few months of 1944 saw a profusion of plans for bringing in as many units from other areas as quickly as possible at the time of a landing. Air Fleet 3 was to be supported by units on loan from the south of France, Italy, Denmark, the western and southern regions of the Reich, and even Greece. To escape Allied air raids on German airfields, the Luftwaffe units were to be widely dispersed, large numbers of anti-aircraft batteries were to be installed, and radio silence was to be maintained as far as possible when bringing in new squadrons.113 With the help of these reinforcements, the Luftwaffe forces in the west were to attack the Allies' troops as they landed, combat their air fleets, and bomb their supply bases on the south coast of England-no easy task, since the reinforcements in question would consist of 1,000 planes at most, and there would therefore be only about 1,650 operational aircraft available for deployment against an Allied invasion. To make matters worse,
