116 It was therefore becoming increasingly difficult to organize convoys for coastal shipping and carry out mining operations. Sea transport of important raw materials from Spain was still relatively successful, but in the English Channel Allied sea and air superiority meant heavy losses for the navy whenever it attempted to leave its harbours, which were defended by large numbers of anti-aircraft batteries.117 German ships were detected by enemy radar as soon as they left port, so that minelaying operations, for example, could soon be carried out only at night. Even in the Atlantic waters of western France, which were much further from Allied bases, German operational possibilities were increasingly restricted by Allied sea power. While metre- thick armoured decks mostly withstood Allied bombing, Naval Group West reported that by the beginning of May 1944 enemy sea and air superiority was so great that the Luftwaffe could do no more than protect U-boats leaving and returning to port. 118 Allied warships, on the other hand, were able to move closer and closer to the French coast, operating almost undisturbed under cover of artificial fog and the Allied air forces. 114 See Deutschland im zweiten Weltkrieg, v. 119; ObdL, Ia, to Air Fleet 3 Command, re Imminent Danger in the West, 6 Dec. 1943, BA-MA RL 2 II/5; OKL to Air Fleet 3, 7 May 1944, ibid .; Boog, 'Luftwaffe Role', 43. 115 On the figures see Jacobsen, Teilung der Welt, 589; Naval Group West Command, KTB, 8 Feb. 1944, BA-MA RM 35 11/61; according to Deutschland im zweiten Weltkrieg, v. 119, the fol- lowing vessels were stationed in the west: 4 destroyers, 4 torpedo boats, 35 E-boats, and 458 smaller craft. 116 Naval Group West Command, KTB, 8 and 13 Sept. 1943 (French/Italian ships), BA-MA RM 35 II/61; on personnel strength, see Mar.Wehr.Tr., Ia, to I/SKI, 29 Jun. 1944, ibid., RM 7/99; according to this source, Admiral Atlantic Coast had 47,900 men available, Admiral Channel Coast 27,749, and Admiral South Coast
