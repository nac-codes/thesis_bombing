In mid-Ma however, when the threat of large-scale enemy landings seem ed to be abating. at least temporarily, Dönitz again released those vessels for deployment in rb Atlantic. 120 the The commander-in-chief of the navy himself occasionally doubted wheth U-boat operations in the Channel made any sense at all. Shallow water, mi barriers, and almost 100 per-cent detection of all German n vessels by All intelligence argued against this. Moreover, trials of true subma rines fitted v snorkels did not begin until May 1944; before that, the only U-boats availaki had to remain on the surface for long periods, when they exposed to enemy intelligence and firepower.121 In any case, there appeared to be no alternative, since the a were particularl available surfa craft also suffered from Allied sea and air superiority. By January 1944 Dön had concluded that the ships he had would be of little use against a large- landing-they would be sunk by Allied aviation during the approach pha The navy general staff's order of 8 May 1944-that, in the event of an enem landing, all destroyers, torpedo boats, and E-boats in the west must attack the landing forces even by daylight-can therefore only be seen as an act of desperation. On the same day Admiral Krancke himself announced that ol available units would be deployed without flinching.
