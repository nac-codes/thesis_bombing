As many officials of the occupying Dowo had themselves forecast, the violent repression spurred the Resistance to evo greater efforts. By the beginning of 1944 the Germans had no other option bu to deploy troops of all kinds with increasing frequency in counter-insurgen operations. More and more, the Resistance succeeded in drawing German Wehrmacht and police units, as well as French Milice units, into regul military confrontations-especially in southern and south-eastern Franco 539 where the situation increasingly resembled that in the occupied territories of eastern Europe. 145 Although OB West was not particularly happy about deploying Wehrmacht units instead of security forces to keep important transport communications open or to reoccupy regions that had been lost to the Resistance, he nevertheless saw something positive in involving the military in counter- insurgency operations.
