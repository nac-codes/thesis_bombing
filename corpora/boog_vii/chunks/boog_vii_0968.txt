98 prisoners, while sustaining losses of only 24 dead and 50 wounded. 147 The Germans had little compunction about using all possible means to eliminate resistance fighters and their actual or suspected accomplices, or about making this publicly known. They were, however, more circumspect when dealing with commandos-units of indigenous and Allied soldiers that carried out sabotage or reconnaissance missions in the occupied countries, n of key transport installations and beach reconnaissance such as the destruction of on the north coast of France in preparation for the invasion. In October 1942 Hitler issued a 'commando order', via the OKW, stipulating that members of commando units, even if unarmed or wearing uniforms, must be 'liquidated down to the last man'. 148 A good many senior officers were even more specific, as, for example, the Wehrmacht commander in Norway: 'If one man is spared for interrogation, he must not survive his comrades by more than 24 hours.'149 145 See Deutschland im zweiten Weltkrieg, v. 442-3; Paxton, Vichy France, 297-8; ADAP, E, vii. doc. 230, 435 ff.
