By the end of 1943 the war against Allied convoys had led to high German losses, and from early 1944 onwards the navy concentrated on the two tasks of trans- porting personnel and equipment for the occupation forces and protecting the coast against enemy surprise attacks. But even these limited tasks were proving more and more difficult to fulfil, given the constant increase in enemy air and submarine attacks on supply convoys and coastal installations.162 The Air Fleet 5 units in Norway could not do much about this.
