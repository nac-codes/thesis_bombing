ut the repercussions on morale in the homeland, since the Wehrmacht operations staff proposed a whole series of restrictive measures designed to rid Wehrmacht troops of the desire for further contact with foreign women.170 All this taken together had gradually led to an obviously widespread view in the ranks of the German armed forces that many members of combat-strength divisions in the west were having a very easy time of it while their comrades were suffering and dying in the east. The OKW felt obliged to react and have it proclaimed, down to division level, that the great majority of operational divisions were fighting in the east and that, in any case, the units in the west were playing an important strategic role by their very presence.171 Extreme manifestations of 'rear-area syndrome' could meanwhile be repressed by smoothly functioning disciplinary procedures, especially zealous courts-martial. At the beginning of February 1944, 2,356 members of the Wehrmacht were serving custodial sentences in France alone. The announcement by the military commander in France that soldiers guilty of lack of vigilance would be court-martialled proved no idle threat. From then on, in any case, everything seems to have been done to strengthen battle- readiness as understood by the military and political leadership.172 What caused more headaches, however, were the emerging expectations about the coming battle with the Allies in the west.
