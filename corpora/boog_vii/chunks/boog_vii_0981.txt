was s attacked from west, they would face a 'fight to the death', 'to the last man'. Shortly be befo the Allied landing, Jodl placed his hopes for German victory in the folle assurance: 'Then we shall see who fights better and who dies easier: German soldier threatened with the destruction of his homeland, or the Americans and British, who no longer know why they are fighting Europe.'176 It is difficult to say with certainty whether all this fell on fertile ground. L, but an incident that occurred in France in late May 1944 suggests it may not h been very effective. A 'terrorist' who had bailed out of his aircraft and land. safely was offered cigarettes by a German NCO. In a subsequent Rundstedt described that gesture as 'wrong-headed sentimentality'. Warni t order that such conduct would be punished in future, he commented that 'any other behaviour towards a terrorist who had been shot down was conceivable anything except that'. The comment was deleted before the order was issued perhaps because somebody pointed out that it was at least an indire incitement to violate the rules of war.177 For a whole series of reasons, the combativeness of the individual units wan also much lower than in the early years of the war. Even now, membership of famous division with a long tradition could generate enthusiasm and fighting spirit, but such units were rare in the west; most divisions stationed there had been formed from disparate remnants of other units. As a result, their troops hod widely varying combat experience, and-if only because of their heterogeneous age structure-it was hard for them to recapture the fighting spirit of earlier years. Transfers to the west of eastern troops of doubtful reliability, and ethnin Germans in category III of the DVL, further reduced the combat value of the 174 Jacobsen, Zweite Weltkrieg in Chronik and Dokumenten, doc.
