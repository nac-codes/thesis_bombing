The Allied chiefs of staff also confirmed the date of I May 1944 for the invasion, as decided at the TRIDENT conference, despite the fact that the US Joint War Plans Committee (JWPC) had already questioned that date at the beginning of August, in a study recommending a 'target date not later than I June 1944'.6 It was nevertheless clear at the Quebec conference that the Americans and British had very different strategic views of the planned landing in Normandy. 2 2Ist.
