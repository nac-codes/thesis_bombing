Above all, information from their intelligence services about a steady increase in the number of German fighter planes induced the CCS to concentrate POINTBLANK on the destruction of Germany's aircraft production plants. The objective they set was that the number of enemy fighters should not exceed 650 by the beginning of the Normandy landing. But it was not until the turn of 1943/4, when they were able to deploy sufficient numbers of long-range fighters to protect their bomber units, that the Allies achieved a significant reduction in German fighter production.21 Strikes against Germany's V-weapon systems (Operation CROSSBOW), which were perhaps the greatest threat to OVERLORD, also went well in the second half of 1943.
