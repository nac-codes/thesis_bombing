ptive structure they had built up with such care would come crashing down around their ears. Yet it hardly seemed feasible to start making plans for a completely different landing zone at this late stage. So the Allies waited with bated breath for any reports of German troop movements in the following days and weeks. When they checked for the last time, on 5 June 1944, they concluded with relief that Rundstedt and his staff officers had taken the Allies' decoy scenario as the basis for their own planning.47 What resistance would the Allies actually encounter during and after their intended landing? This had been a rather theoretical question in 1943, but in the months and weeks leading up to the invasion the Allied intelligence services strove to find practical answers. They began by analysing Germany's overall ability to continue waging war. By April 1944 they had concluded that even if the Germans had to fight on several fronts, and would therefore find it increasingly difficult to supply their forces with sufficient equipment and personnel, a voluntary retreat from western and northern Europe or a collapse of military resistance following the Allied landing were hardly to be expected.48 On the contrary, the news of Albert Speer's appointment as 'dictator of the German economy' in September 1943 led them to expect a renewed maximization of German war production.49 US 3rd Army Cdn 1st Army US XX Armd Corps US VIII Corps US XII Corps Cdn Il Corps US 3 Div.
