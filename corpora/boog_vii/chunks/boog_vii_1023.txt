To that end the provisional French government in Algiers appointed departmental and city prefects, tackled monetary, social, and medical problems, and drew up plans for renewal of the judicial system, reform of the press, the return of deportees, and the treatment of prisoners of war and collaborators. The overriding aim was to prevent, as far as possible, any curtailment of French sovereignty.72 Partial co-operation between the Allies and the French on civil affairs came to an abrupt halt in mid-April 1944. In the run-up to the invasion the British government introduced censorship of all correspondence with persons outside the country; only the official representatives of the United States and Soviet Union were exempted. Although the British adopted a conciliatory attitude towards the French, and senior French diplomats were able to maintain relatively free contact with Algiers, the CFLN took offence at this restriction 70 France Civil Affairs, Overlord Security, Communication to the French, 23 Feb. /2 Mar. / 10 May and 17 May 1944, ibid., PREM 3/177/3; Eisenhower, Papers, iii. 1727n.
