The British were, however, soon forced to admit that their American allies were highly adaptable. The learning process they went through in numerous Allied staffs was of great help, and 'American civilians in uniform' often made good use of their experience in non-military fields. When it came to solving the problems involved in preparations for OVERLORD, which was similar in many ways to the build-up and management of a huge business enterprise, these officers frequently proved more efficient than mere career soldiers. Although there was still a clear predominance of British officers in COSSAC at the end of 1943 (684 British Empire officers to 419 American), the numbers in Eisenhower's SHAEF staff were practically even (750 American and 747 British officers).85 Only the top posts-commanders-in-chief of the naval, air and ground forces-continued to be held by Britons (Ramsay, Leigh-Mallory, and Montgomery). Years of work in Allied staffs had gradually 'de-nationalized' their members, who were more ready to work towards common goals than officers in mono- national staffs like the COS in London and the JCS in Washington. So it is not surprising that the officers who sought compromise on contentious issues also came from their ranks. Eisenhower himself, continuously entrusted with the work of Allied staffs, is a good example. He was more an impartial co-ordinator than a military go-getter, and so
