working under very different conditions. First and foremost, the Germans were operating in occupied territory, while the Allies were preparing their offensive on home ground or in a friendly country. But the conditions for future military operations in western Europe were also very different. The Allies had gradually given OVERLORD priority, whereas Hitler, despite various declarations of intent, never concentrated his military resources in the west. The immense pressure of the Soviet armies prevented any significant with- drawal of German divisions from the eastern front. The difference in priority accorded to the coming battle in the west further increased the Allies' lead in available resources. The longer the war lasted, the more overwhelming their material superiority. Weakened by the air war and the gradual loss of major sources of raw materials, Germany was prone to ever greater shortages. In these circumstances, heavy losses in the east and the consequent assignment of priority to the needs of the army soon led to a reduction in the arming of the navy and Luftwaffe. As a result, the plans and measures for defence against a landing were mainly decided by army staffs and army commanders. Since the weakness of German naval and air forces in the west meant that an Allied invasion could probably no longer be prevented, the army officers banked everything on making the Atlantic Wall into a huge defensive bulwark. If the Allies nevertheless succeeded in gaining a foothold on the continent, they would already have incurred heavy losses, and would then face a land war in which the German military leaders felt themselves to be superior. From the outset, however, the British and Americans had attached great importance to building up their air and sea forces. As a result, two battles had been won before the landing even began: the Allies had achieved both air and sea supremacy. This not only helped them begin the invasion in favour- able conditions, but also hindered t
