cheidung im Westen, 139, and Deutschland im Zweiten Weltkrieg, v. 635, together with Wilt. W. from the Top, 270. Until then, they had to bring in Allied personnel and material through artificial harbours (two MULBERRIES and five GOOSEBERRIES) and quite small fishing villages on the Normandy coast. Although the Germans were hardly in a position to disrupt or even destroy the enemy's supply routes, 33 the Allied build-up was slower than originally planned because most supplies could be brought in via the artificial harbours only in fair weather conditions. During the month of June, however, the weather in the Channel area was the worst in living memory. Shipping came to an almost complete halt between 19 and 23 June while a violent storm raged in the Channel. About 800 ships were stranded and the MULBERRY installations in the US sector were damaged beyond repair.34 As the British war ministry noted on 7 July, the backlog of OVERLORD troops 20 days after the landing came to about 250,000 men and nearly 58,000 vehicles. This shortage could, however, be offset to some extent by the fact that the losses and casualties had proved less dramatic than first expected. At this point the Allies still had 27 divisions they could use (including five armoured divisions and seven armoured brigades).35 32 Deutschland im Zweiten Weltkrieg, v. 639; OB West, app. to KTB, OB West to OKW/WFSt, 26 June 1944, BA-MA RH 19 IV/48, and 25 June 1944, ibid., RH 19 IV/43; US navy to SHAEF, 33 Especially after the devastating air attack on Le Havre on 14/15 June 1944, when German E-boats suffered particularly heavy losses; cf.
