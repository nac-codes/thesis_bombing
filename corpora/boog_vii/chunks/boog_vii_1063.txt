s' real objectives in Normandy. Their attacks on all fronts of the bridgehead sug- rested the Allies might be intending to break through at many points. OB West continued to believe that the greatest risk was an Allied success at Caen, because these troops would then be able to join forces at a later stage with the semies of the (fictitious) American Ist Army Group once it had landed and could then conquer the whole of northern France. So Rundstedt kept bringing new motorized divisions into the area between Balleroy and Caen, yet without being able entirely to neglect the remaining sections of the front.4 In late June/early July Rundstedt had more than 21 divisions in Normandy, of which nine were motorized; but their strength had been weakened considerably by the enormous battle casualties. As a result the panzer divisions had only just over 5,000 men left on average, while the total casualties of Army Group B had now risen to some 65,000 men. The Germans were finding it more and more difficult to find enough replacements, especially after the Red Army began its major offensive in Belorussia on 22 June and managed to crush the centre of the German eastern front within the space of a few days. Although their losses were similarly high (about 61,000 men), the Allies did manage to bring in adequate replacements rapidly.42 The German commanders in the west were well aware that a mere three weeks after the start of the invasion they had fallen behind purely in terms of numbers. Accordingly, their tactics were now increasingly determined by defensive rather than offensive considerations. This also became apparent at a meeting of Rundstedt, Rommel, and Hitler with Alfred Jodl, OKW chief of operations staff, on 29 June in Berchtesgaden. They now saw it as their most important task to resist British advances east of the Orne. Rundstedt had managed to dissuade Hitler from ordering an attack on the US Ist Army on the Cotentin peninsula on 24 June; he wanted the German defence
