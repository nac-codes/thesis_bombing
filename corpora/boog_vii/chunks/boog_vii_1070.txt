nerve-racking.56 Not surprisingly, they also felt increasingly impatien at the slow pace of OVERLORD, having hoped to see an end to the V-weanos bombardment with the rapid capture of the launch sites in western Europe (f) The Military Situation Before the Allied Breakout in Normandy The situation in the second half of July was not really quite as bad as it seemed to some in the Allied camp, for the Germans had suffered enormous lo 603 during the Allied attacks. Immediately after Operation GOODWOOD was halted, gherbach's staff informed Panzer Division West that the losses were so high chat the substance of their divisions is bound to be used up very soon'.57 By 24 July OB West had already suffered the loss of a total of 116,863 men, including cen generals and 158 commanders. Yet so far it had managed to bring in only 10,078 troops as reinforcements.58 The most senior officers described the state of the troops to Kluge fairly frankly on 20 July. In their view, the high losses were due largely to the enemy's superiority in terms of artillery and aircraft. Indeed, Air Fleet 3 was not in good chape: while 631 aircraft had been serviceable shortly before the invasion, this number had increased by only another 278 aircraft at the end of June. Even in good weather they could not manage more than 300-350 sorties a day to support the army troops; the Allies were flying about 4,000 and by the end of June had managed to expand 12 airfields in France, which considerably boosted the efficiency of their air attacks.59 In his position assessments Rommel had written as early as 15 July that the situation was nearing a 'serious crisis', and that Hitler must therefore draw the appropriate conclusions. Kluge, who also took over command of Army Group B when Rommel was injured two days later, agreed with this summing-up of the situation. On 21 July he wrote a letter to Hitler that ended with the rather pessimistic words: 'We are holding on, and if no aid is forthcoming to radically impr
