r, agreed with this summing-up of the situation. On 21 July he wrote a letter to Hitler that ended with the rather pessimistic words: 'We are holding on, and if no aid is forthcoming to radically improve our situation we shall have to die decently.'60 He too had come to the conclusion that the front would not hold out much longer in the face of the enemy's superiority. That is how Kluge assessed the situation the day after the attempt on Hitler's life. Contrary to Allied expectations, however, this assassination attempt did not affect events on the front. When it soon became known that the dictator had survived the attack, Kluge and his chief of staff Gen. Blumentritt rescinded all the measures taken by the conspirators surrounding the military commander in France, Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel-this in spite of the fact that in summer 1943, after the failure of Operation CITADEL on the eastern front, Kluge already believed that only removing Hitler could now save Germany. Now that the dictator had survived, however, he strongly rejected the intention of the former army chief of staff, Gen. Ludwig Beck, and of Stülpnagel to continue the rebellion that had begun in the west.
