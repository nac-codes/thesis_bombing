Many German Seventh Army units were literally blown into the air by the hail of bombs. 77 Collins's divisions had reached Coutances by 28 July, thereby cutting off the retreat of all German units deployed there. Only a few of these units managed to break through to the south and the south-east in the days that followed. Patton's US 3rd Army now moved into the breach created by the US VII Corps, with a total of eight infantry and four armoured divisions. They had taken Avranches by 31 July, surrounded St-Malo a day later, and then thrust towards Rennes.78 74 For the German side see Fremde Heere West, 'Gedanken zur Lage', 27 July 1944, BA-MA RH 2/v. 89; for the Allied deception plan: SHAEF, 'Operations, Plan Fortitude South II', 19 July 1944, PRO, WO 171/33; for Allied reconnaissance: 'German Combat Divisions, Distribution Tables and Maps', 19 July 1944, ibid., WO 208/3122; Summaries Northwest France, 20 July 1944, ibid., WO 106/4382; M.I. 14, Location List of Identified German Formations, 25 July 1944, ibid., WO 208/3126. 75 Deutschland im Zweiten Weltkrieg, v. 653; according to this source the losses were III dead and 496 injured; see Blumenson, Breakout, 228 ff .; Brown, Bodyguard of Lies, 773 ff .; see also Op in Northwest Europe, Freiburg UL, RJCS (US), E.Th., 7, MF 83/71-3, 1084-5; Pogue, Supreme Command, 199. 76 CIGS, Summaries NW Europe of 26. and 27 July 1944, PRO, WO 106/4382; Op in Northwest Europe, Freiburg UL, RJCS (US), E.Th., 7, MF 83/71-3, 1085; AOK 7, KTB, 25. and 26 July. 1944, BA-MA RH 20-7; Hinsley, British Intelligence, iii/2. 229; Lee, Breakout, 172 ff. 77 OB West, KTB, 26 July 1944, BA-MA RH 19 IV/9a, and app. to KTB OB West, evening report, 25 July 1944, ibid., RH 19 IV/51, together with KTB OKW, iv/I. 327. 78 Ibid .; OB West, situation maps, 27 and 31 July 1944, BA-MA, RH 19 IV/65; Marinegruppe West
