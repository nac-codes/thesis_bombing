He also insisted once again on the importance of Operation LÜTTICH, which his This is a significant example of the way Wehrmacht officers of the highest rank accepted Hitler's purely speculative assumptions, in spite of their comprehensive knowledge of the general war situation, and manifestly passed them on unadulterated to the commanders on the front. Yet the dictator himself does not seem to have been entirely convinced that LÜTTICH would be a success, for only a day later, in the midst of the preparations for the attack, he ordered the rapid consolidation of a defensive line along the rivers Somme, Marne, and Saône towards the Jura. 84 So perhaps there was, after all, a chance of defending 'further to the rear'-contrary to Warlimont's assertions. At any rate, the preparations for LÜTTICH continued. Yet it proved difficult to move motorized units into the deployment area around Mortain, as the Allied air force were making it virtually impossible for them to be transported in daylight.
