Kluge was relieved of his post that same day and replaced by Field Marshal Walter Model, who had been leading an army group on the eastern front. Thereupon, two days later, Kluge committed suicide while driving back to Germany. In a farewell letter, he urged Hitler to put an end to a 'struggle that has become hopeless'. He concluded his letter as follows: 'I am leaving you, mein Führer, to whom I was closer in my heart than you have perhaps guessed, in the knowledge that I have done my duty to the utmost.
