s a result the German troops between Elbeuf and the Seine estuary risked being driven back to the river and wiped out, given that Allied bombers had already destroyed the bridges prior to the Normandy landing. The commanders of the German Normandy armies now tried to move as many troops as possible to the right bank of the Seine, using ferries and pontoon bridges, and up until 30 August also managed to transport the bulk of the armies driven back to the Seine across the river northwards. Yet again, however, the German soldiers had to abandon many of their vehicles and heavy equipment. The Allies counted 304 armoured and 3,178 other motorized vehicles, together with 166 artillery guns.101 Presumably, the reason why once again the Allies did not manage utterly to destroy the German Normandy armies is because, as during the encirclement of Falaise, the US divisions adhered to their planned goals of securing Elbeuf and Louviers without advancing further along the Seine as far as its estuary. Yet it took the 21st Army Group longer than expected to complete the encirclement of Falaise, and it then came up against fairly strong German resistance when it tried to advance to the Seine.
