Transport lanes proved useful only sporadically, for instance in the US 3rd Army area. The Americans organized a priority route on parallel one-way highways (the Â«Red Ball Express') in order to make truck transport as efficient as possible. By the end of August 1944, 6,000 trucks were operating round the clock to bring in supplies. 132 Yet they still did not manage to make up for the shortage of rail transport, since more and more trucks were soon out of action through quer-use. The Allies therefore found it difficult to equip depots and airfields near the front. The difficulty of bringing in supplies from the ports and the shortage of storage capacity there also meant that at the end of August 1944 more than 160 ships could not be unloaded in north-western Europe, and huge quantities of supplies piled up on the beach. 133 It is not at all surprising, therefore, that Eisenhower considered it most important to seize large-capacity ports on the Channel coast, which presum- ably explains why he decided to give top priority to the operations of the 21st Army Group towards the north-west, as Montgomery had wanted. 134 Yet there were some on the Allied side who were beginning to hope that German resistance would crumble before the Allied logistics suffered a collapse.135 During those first days of September Gen.
