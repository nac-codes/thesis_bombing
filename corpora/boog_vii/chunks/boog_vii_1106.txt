beginning to hope that German resistance would crumble before the Allied logistics suffered a collapse.135 During those first days of September Gen. Lee, who was in charge of the communication zone, decided unbeknown to Eisenhower to move to Paris with his numerous offices. This did not fit at all into the picture of an overstretched supply situation, since the move would require considerable transport resources. Although Eisenhower wanted to have accommodation in the capital reserved mainly for Allied military personnel on leave, Lee's staff now, according to a communication from Gen. Koenig to the supreme commander, occupied nearly all the city's hotels, guest-houses, and schools. The Allied troop commanders were angry at this misuse of transport resources. When Eisenhower found out that on top of this the supply troops in Paris were very busy on the black market, he sent a sharply worded letter to Lee. Basically, however, little changed, because if the supply troops had been moved again-as SHAEF for a while considered doing-this too would have used up transport resources. This incident shows once again the enormous attraction of Paris for Allied soldiers and officers. In the event, they were quite happy to disregard logistical needs. 136 All in all, there is little doubt that the emerging supply crisis was not caused by too low a production of war material in Britain and the United States, and 132 See Ludewig, RÃ¼ckzug, 120 and 182; Weinberg, World at Arms, 699; and Eisenhower, Report, 50-60 ('Red Ball Express'); Joint Staff Mission, Washington, telephone call by Gen.
