Although the port installations fell unscathed into Allied hands thanks to the assistance of the Belgian resistance movement, German Fifteenth Army units still controlled the accesses to the sea at this point. 143 Now it was obviously necessary to free the Scheldt estuary if there was to be any hope of using the deep-water ports. As early as 3 September Admiral Sir Bertram H. Ramsay, the Allied naval commander-in-chief, had pointed out that this was an urgent objective. Naturally, after the seizure of Antwerp, Eisenhower very much hoped that the port could be opened, because so far the Allies had not managed to capture any major deep-water port in the Pas-de-Calais area. In the following days the Allied supreme commander decided there was no chance of strong units advancing rapidly without a radical improvement in logistics. The 12th Army Group would therefore need immediately to clear the accesses to Antwerp or Rotterdam.
