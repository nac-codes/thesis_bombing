US Ist Army (a total of 40 divisions) was to advance via Arnhem and Wesel north of the Ruhr area. He did not think there were adequate supplies for offensives further to the south. In the event of only one deep-water port being available in the Pas-de-Calais area, and if the troops of the 21st Army Group and US Ist Army were also assisted by the air fleets and provided with enough trucks, he could rapidly advance as far as Münster and Osnabrück with these troops. Eisenhower did give Montgomery's plans priority again, but not at the cost of all the other-that is, American-units coming to a complete standstill. He thought it would be too risky to advance in a kind of 'pencil' line without adequate flank cover. Nor could he accept the idea that a British commander, of all people, should launch what would presumably be the decisive attack against the Reich, while the American units, now far superior in numbers to the Imperial troops, remained somewhere in eastern France. Eisenhower therefore gave the order that not only Montgomery's but also Bradley's armies were to be supplied with urgently needed fuel. At the same time he reduced the number of US divisions supporting the 21st Army Group. In future, only three US Ist Army divisions were to cover the flanks of Montgomery's offensive, while all the others were to advance towards Cologne and Bonn. Patton's divisions-which had become quasi-immobilized in the first days of September by the lack of fuel-were ordered to take the Saar area, after replenishing their fuel stores, and then to look to Frankfurt as their next objective. Bradley's 12th Army Group was also instructed to occupy Brest and block German troops who were trying to escape from the south-west in the direction of the Upper Rhine.149 All this once again proves Eisenhower's talent for broadly satisfying every need, whether military or political, during this phase of the war as well.
