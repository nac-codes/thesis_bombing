These were already fighting 637 alongside the Allies in Italy or stationed in Corsica (which German troops had abandoned in October 1943) and North Africa. Their deployment in the south of France would also mobilize the many Resistance groups in that area to fight alongside the Allies.3 At the same time, a landing operation in the south of France would mean that hardly any troops or military equipment would be nailable for other operations in the Mediterranean. Yet this was very much in che interest of the Americans, since on no account did they want to support the operations in the Adriatic or the eastern Mediterranean favoured by the British.4 Since the Allied advance in Italy was making slow progress, in April 1944 the launch of ANVIL had to be delayed again. After taking Rome in early June, however, the Allies decided upon 15 August as the definitive landing date. Gen. Sir Henry M.
