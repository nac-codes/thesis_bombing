oject-for instance, by proposing to launch a second landing in the Bay of Biscay or in Brittany-but Roosevelt and the US chiefs of staff were not very taken with that idea. In the end, the British prime minister went to the Mediterranean himself, to observe the landing he had never wanted.6 As for the military planning of ANVIL, in late 1943 Eisenhower had already proposed a first wave of landings with three American divisions. French units were to follow the US troops. The plan was to use a total of ten units (including seven French) for the operation. In mid-December US 7th Army headquarters in Palermo was ordered to make suitable preparations, with the participation of French officers. The forces this would require were to be taken from the Italian front or put on standby in North Africa and Corsica.7 Although there were some hiccups in terms of planning during early spring 1944, it was soon determined which officers were to lead the operations.
