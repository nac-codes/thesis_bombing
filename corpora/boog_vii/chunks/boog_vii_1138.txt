e Allied landing in Normandy, OB West had Army Group G (headquartered in Toulouse) with a total of two armies deployed in the south of France. While the First Army (six divisions) was deployed on the Atlantic coast, the Nineteenth Army (with its HQ in Avignon) was positioned all along the French Mediterranean coast. Under it were three army corps: IV Luftwaffe Field Corps, Kniess Group (LXXXV Army Corps), and LXII Reserve Army Corps, with a total of seven divisions. Three motorized divisions were in the army group area: 9th Panzer Division at Nîmes, 11th Panzer Division at Bordeaux, and 2nd SS-Panzer Division between Montauban and Cahors; together with two reserve infantry divisions: 157th at Aix-les-Bains and 189th at Clermont-Ferrand.19 Because so many units had been defeated during the Normandy battles, however, OB West was forced to thin out the Nineteenth Army divisions in the south of France or even move whole divisions to the north. In this way, infantry and armoured divisions, together with a large number of artillery, assault (self-propelled) guns, and anti-tank units, were fed into Army Group B. On 7 August 1944, following the advance of the US forces, Kluge (OB West) found himself forced to withdraw the right flank of Army Group B-a few First Army units-from the Atlantic coast to protect the Loire crossings. 18 See Intelligence Report to AFHQ 4.8.1944, Dragoon, General Policy, PRO, WO 106/4273; French Ist Army, 3º Bureau, Ordres d'Opération of 6th CAUS (Corps d'Armée US), 23 July 1944,H., 10 P 181, and Débarquement de Provence, Enemy Strength, 25 July 1944, ibid., 10 P 166. 19 See A.Gr.
