s less at risk. Wiese drew attention to this situation, but it proved too late to make any fundamental changes before the landing came.27 In principle the Germans found themselves forced to make the same kind of defensive preparations in the Mediterranean area as they had in the Channel area. However, the Nineteenth Army had meanwhile obtained a great many reports based on experience in the field, which detailed the weaknesses of the defence plan and the defensive battles in the north; it therefore warned urgently against using too static a form of defence. The authors of these reports believed that, given in particular the long range of Allied naval artillery (up to 35 km) and the Allies' massive deployment of the air force and airborne landing troops, Germany must now turn to a more flexible type of warfare.28 There were several reasons why Wiese and his commanders took such small account of these findings. Given that so few units were available, and given the shortage of motor vehicles, it was impossible to deploy fairly large, mobile reserves deep inside the defensive area. Moreover, the most senior officers had here too taken on board Hitler's instructions not voluntarily to give up a single metre of ground. This is clear from Wiese's order of 2 August: the commander-in-chief of Nineteenth Army said that 'the main line of battle is and remains the beach. Every commander ... is ordered to hold his position to the last man and the last bullet.'29 Once again, therefore, the Germans used much of their material and manpower resources to strengthen gun-sites, dugouts, and houses along the coast, lay countless mines (1,502,000 up to 10 August), build obstacles off the beach, and finally evacuate many of the inhabitants from the coastal d√©partements (116,000 persons by the end of June). While arrangements were being made for the major port installations of Marseilles and Toulon to be blown up, OKW also ordered the destruction of a 27 In all AOK 19 had 628 artillery pie
