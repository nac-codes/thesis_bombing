th was also weakened by the Allied air raids and frequent alarms. The equipment and motorization of these divisions also left much to be desired. They had little in the way of engineering equipment or heavy infantry weapons, and often had to make do with horses and bicycles instead of motor transport.31 While it was constantly impressed on the troops how vital it was to hold the main battle line on the coast, the German high command was evidently feeling increasingly doubtful as to whether its orders were feasible or had any point; in early August Blaskowitz passed on an order from Hitler to the effect that a defensive position on the Somme was to be extended over the Marne and the Saône to the Jura (the Kitzinger Line). But this was to be done in secret, and only the army commanders-in-chief and general staff were to know about it. Not even the commanders of the army corps deployed on the coast, whose men would obviously bear the brunt of future operations, were let into the secret. This meant that even before the landing, Hitler and his senior generals were deceiving these troops as to their real plans.32 Increasingly, the defensive and protective measures taken by the Nineteenth Army also fell victim to resistance activity. While the first half of 1944 had for the most part witnessed little more than attacks on fairly weak Wehrmacht installations and isolated acts of sabotage, now, starting in July 1944, resistance groups also attacked strongly guarded transport convoys, and resistance fighters penetrated ever closer to the main supply lines and increasingly endangered arms factories important to the war effort. Meanwhile, officers of the Free French forces had managed to bring together resistance groups that had been acting in isolation, to create organized military units that controlled entire regions, mainly around Grenoble and in the départements of Ain, Jura, and Var.33 30 On the evacuation see military commanders in France, situation report June 1944, ibid.
