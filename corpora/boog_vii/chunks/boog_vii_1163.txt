danger on their left flank, they aid their utmost to withdraw as many combat-worthy units as possible corthwards in order to build up a new defensive position in the Dijon area, using the troops flooding back from the Atlantic region. They wanted to occupy a line reaching from the Yonne to Dôle and up to the Swiss border. Because of their high mobility, 11th Panzer Division and a few infantry units muere mainly used as protection against attacks on the roads along which the troops were retreating. The combat troops took countless Wehrmacht mem- bers from a whole range of branches with them in the wake of their withdrawal operations. In all, some 138,000 men from the Nineteenth Army area departed northwards on or around 20 August. The soldiers remaining behind in the Geld hospitals, however, were left to the French and Americans.54 Although IIth Panzer Division managed again and again to prevent the Allies from advancing as far as the Rhône, most of the retreat roads were still exposed to the fire of resistance groups and the Allied artillery and aircraft. According to American estimates, the Germans lost around 11,000 men and 2 500 motor vehicles during the Montélimar breakthrough battles alone. Scenes of panic broke out, with vehicles, dead horses, and destroyed weapons littering the roads. In early September, as AOK 19 learned, some infantry regiments had fewer than 200 men left. Similarly, there was soon also a shortage of heavy weapons. Eleventh Panzer Division did manage to block a few enemy thrusts and knock out many tanks, yet the number of their own armoured vehicles soon dwindled; by 28 August the division had just a third of its original total of more than 100 tanks. The situation was even worse in terms of artillery batteries: Army Group G (Heeresgruppe G, known as Armeegruppe G until 8 September) had only 165 guns left on 15 September (compared with 1,481 on 1 August). Meanwhile the Allies had landed nearly 200,000 soldiers and 33,115 motor vehicles by
