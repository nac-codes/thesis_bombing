to evade responsibility for their decisions.66 To sum up, it is found that in the battles during their retreat Army Group G managed to save 130,000 troops behind its own lines out of a total of about 200,000 men who had marched out of the occupied parts of the south of France or had retreated while fighting. Blaskowitz and his successor Hermann Balck, general of panzer troops (OB as from 21 September 1944), thus man- aged to build up a fairly stable front in the southern section of the 'German western fortress'. While the remnants of the Nineteenth Army were now facing the US 6th Army Group from the Swiss border to Épinal, parts of the German First Army and Fifth Panzer Army were trying to prevent the US 3rd Army from advancing further between Luxembourg, Metz, and south of Nancy.67 Despite its relatively successful retreat, Army Group G had lost 141,000 men by mid-September (dead, wounded, missing, and left behind in the fortified areas because of illness). It is revealing that, according to reports from Army Group G dating from August and September, the losses among the lowest- ranking officers were significantly high. While in August 116 of the 123 officers counted as lost held ranks ranging from Oberfähnrich (officer cadet) to captain, this number rose to 1,041 in September, out of a total of 1,070 officer casualties. This shows once again that, even during this rapid retreat, lower-ranking officers had to bear the brunt of the battle, alongside the men and NCOs. Allied losses in the first fortnight after the landing came to 2,700 Americans and 4,000 from De Lattre de Tassigny's troops. US 7th Army losses between 17 and 22 September came to 3,176 dead and missing, and 4,661 wounded.68 66 Extract from KTB AOK 19, report on activity of army judges, 1 July-31 October 1944, ibid., RH 20-19/258; according to this there were, during the period from August to October 1944, 22 death sentences and 213 other sentences, out of a total of 451 cases. 67 See Map II.v.5, 'Deve
