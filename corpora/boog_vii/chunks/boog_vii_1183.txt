At this point it seemed impossible to wvisage any real end to the war before the onset of winter. The reasons why MARKET-GARDEN failed were the poor terrain and bad weather conditions, nogether with the fact that the Allied commanders, and Montgomery in par- "cular, had assessed the enemy situation wrongly.
