sistance would be so weak that they would be able to drop the airborne troops comfortably over a period of three successive days. The sol- diers who flew in later were thus up against an opposing force that was already alerted and prepared to defend itself. Added to this, Montgomery's style of leadership was not conducive to the rapid mastery of a critical situation. Because the field marshal did not really cooperate with his HQ personnel and senior officers, each commander did what seemed right to him at the time. Also, the Allies had seen no need to establish contact with the Dutch resist- once, which would certainly have been able to provide them with valuable information on the German strength in the battle zones and to support them during the critical early stage of the landings. It is also worth noting that not much time was spent on preparing for MARKET-GARDEN. Presumably Montgomery wanted to exploit the weakness the Germans had shown so far, as quickly as he could. Clearly he also wanted rapidly to create faits accomplis; if the operation proved successful, it would make it almost impossible for Eisenhower to stop him from carrying out his plan for a separate assault to the north of the front. Similarly, the Germans succeeded only in part with their plans to counter MARKET-GARDEN. Model was trying to hem in the Allied troops south of the Lower Rhine and to destroy them there.
