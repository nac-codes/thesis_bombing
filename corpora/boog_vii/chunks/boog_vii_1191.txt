Only a few days earlier, on 25 October, Allied troops had begun a pincer 673 The battle for the Scheldt had cost Canadian Ist Army, which was sup- sorted by British but also American and Polish units, a total of 12,873 dead, wounded, and missing. On the other hand, over the period from I October to November the Allied troops had managed to capture a total of 41,043 German soldiers. 20 As soon as the Westerscheldt had been freed, the British navy began to clear the sea route of mines. On 28 November, that is, nearly three months after the liberation of Antwerp, the first Allied convoy of ships reached the port. The Allies estimated that from then on they would be able to unload up to 80,000 t of supplies a day. This led to a substantial improvement in their supply situ- ation, as it meant far fewer goods needed to be carried overland. Since the German troops could now no longer control access to Antwerp directly, they attempted to make the port unusable by launching V-weapons, beginning as early as 13 October. By the end of the year Allied military losses in and around Antwerp amounted to 734 dead and 1,078 wounded. In military terms, however, the use of V-I and V-2 weapons proved far less successful than the Germans had expected. Because these weapons were far from accurate, they destroyed only a few port installations.21 20 See Stacey, Victory Campaign, 424.
