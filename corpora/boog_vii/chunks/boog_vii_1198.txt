se of the high water level; see Ambrose, Supreme Commander, 551; on other forecasts se When it became generally apparent to the Allies in late November that they 677 would not even be able to break through at Aachen in the near future, this led to che bitterest quarrel of all between Eisenhower and Montgomery. The latter, certain that he would be protected from the rear by Field Marshal Brooke, the British chief of staff, once again urged that the command be divided between one commander north of the Ardennes and one to the south. He felt that the strategy oursued by SHAEF and Eisenhower to date, namely to attack on every front, had failed because there had been no main thrust.

In view of SHAEF's future projects, he thought that limited operations should be con- ducted on all sections of the front for the time being, while at the same time preparing for a major assault.

At this conference, Montgomery found himself faced with a combined front of both American and British officers (Tedder, Bradley, and Smith), all of whom supported Eisen- hower's position. So he seemed to have very little
