Montgomery found himself faced with a combined front of both American and British officers (Tedder, Bradley, and Smith), all of whom supported Eisen- hower's position. So he seemed to have very little prospect of pushing his views through. In the event, Montgomery did not achieve much more than what had already been decided: priority for 21st Army Group, although without making the Ardennes the boundary between the 21st and 12th Army Groups as he had wanted.
