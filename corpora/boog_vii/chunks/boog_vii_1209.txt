When the soldiers occupied their standby positions, the measures to ensure secrecy the Germans had imposed upon memselves proved to be another disruptive factor. Many units were not allowed to move into their deployment areas until the night before the attack, which meant they had almost no chance of reconnoitring the terrain ahead of them. Notwithstanding these problems, the German side still counted on success, because the Wehrmacht felt it was far superior to the Allied officers and headquarters staff in terms of the tactical and operational leadership of units.
