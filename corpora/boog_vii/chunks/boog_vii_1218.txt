forces had to be supplied by air, Mcauliffe did not give up and rejected all German calls for his surrender. St-Vith, however, was lost on 21 December, after Montgomery ordered a local withdrawal in order to straighten up the front.34 Skorzeny's Operation GREIF proved less successful for the Germans in military terms. Most of the commandos dressed in American uniforms and driving American vehicles were soon captured by the Allies. Since they could not claim combatant status, some of them were sentenced by court-martial and shot as irregulars. The operation, however, achieved its greatest success in psychological terms, because many Allied soldiers were unsettled by the sudden appearance of Wehrmacht troops dressed in American uniforms, and chis led to distrust among themselves. There were even rumours that these commandos intended to kill Eisenhower and other senior officers.35 Since the main thrust of the German assault, led by Sixth SS-Panzer Army, had not led to a breakthrough in spite of repeated attempts, and part of Peiper's combat group was in fact encircled by Hodges's troops, OB West changed tactics. He now tried to exploit Fifth Panzer Army's relative success, and therefore moved reserves and units of Sixth SS-Panzer Army (II SS- Panzer Corps) into Manteuffel's combat area. However, when II SS-Panzer Corps began its attack on the 23rd of that month, it came up against a solidly established Allied front.56 In fact the Allies had managed to take effective countermeasures more quickly than the German staffs had thought possible, thereby preventing a deep German thrust from the outset.
