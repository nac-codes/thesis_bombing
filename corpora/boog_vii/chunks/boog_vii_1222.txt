ied to seize the important road crossing at Bastogne. On 26 December, however, US 3rd Army armoured units managed to break through the German siege ring from the south and to relieve Mcauliffe and his troops. At the same time, a push from the south drove the Seventh German Army back towards Echternach and Diekirch.59 The time had now come for the Allies to cut off the salient of the German breakthrough area from the north and the south, and thus encircle many of the German panzer units. To that end, on 28 December Eisenhower ordered Patton and Hodges to make a thrust towards Houffalize. Yet when Eisenhower met Montgomery, now also commander-in-chief of the US 9th and Ist Armies, in Hasselt that same day, his hopes were bitterly disappointed. The British Geld marshal felt he was not yet in a position to attack. As he had said a few days earlier, he wanted to form sufficient reserves before using his forces; so he was not prepared to launch the attack before I January, or perhaps even later. 58 See Weinberg, World at Arms, 768; for engagements: OB West, KTB, 23 and 26 Dec. 1944, BA-MA, RH 19 IV/76; situation reports H.Gr.
