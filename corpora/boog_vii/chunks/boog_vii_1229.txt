The picture was much the same for the air forces: up to 16 January US aircraft had flown 63,741 sorties, their British comrades a mere 12,147.67 In the end, therefore, it was thanks to Eisenhower, SHAEF, and American troops in particular that the Germans had not achieved greater successes.

Eisenhower was now urged by the US commanders and the American press to take some action against this biased portrayal of Montgomery. Churchill must have had an inkling of what was afoot, because only a week after the publication of the Daily Telegraph article he made a speech in the House of Commons rectifying this view of American involvement in the fighting. His speech ended with the admission that the battle would be regarded as an ever-famous American victory.68 In mid-January the debate about a separate land commander in the west resumed. Now the British chiefs of staff began to incline in this direction. But once again their plans met with determined opposition on the part of the American chiefs of staff.
