title so close- ly matching that of one of the most important military books of its time, Alfred Thayer Mahan’s Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660- 1783. As the following pages will reveal, it is not my intent directly to compare Mahan’s ideas on sea power with ideas on air power, nor to make obvious every parallel that could be inferred from reading both books.  Instead, the present work is intended to look into the develop- ment of air-power philosophy over its history by examining the the- ory and practice of air power as demonstrated not only in war, but also in politics, diplomacy, technology, and mass culture. To do so necessarily involves recounting the history of air power on a selec- tive basis, choosing as examples historic events that demonstrate the influence of air power—or in some instances, the failure of air power—to influence events.  There is a considerable body of literature on air power, much of which is centered on arguments as to whether air power is or is not decisive in warfare. These arguments will be examined on their merit, but the principal thrust of the book is implicit in its title, that is, the influence of air power on history. From a surprisingly well organized if comparatively small beginning in the early days when balloons defined air power, this influence has grown from being consider- able in World War I to tremendously important in World War II and thereafter. The concept of whether or not air power was or was not decisive in any particular situation will be dealt with as required, but it is important to repeat that the influence of air power extends far beyond war or the threat of war. I believe the reader will find that the influence of air power has in many instances been far more  W    12 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  important than any question of its decisiveness in battle, for it has affected the direction of national policies, the growth of industries, and perhaps most important, the rapid advance of t
