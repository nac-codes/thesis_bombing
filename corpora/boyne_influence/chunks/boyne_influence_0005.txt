HISTORY  important than any question of its decisiveness in battle, for it has affected the direction of national policies, the growth of industries, and perhaps most important, the rapid advance of technology, even in times of peace.  This is fortunate, for questions about both the influence and the decisiveness of air power were never more important than today, when the world is faced with an entirely new kind of terrorist-driven war-making, with new kinds of enemies, shadowy groups of warped individuals who murder in the guise of religion. These new enemies have converted their weakness in numbers and arms into the terror of an especially depraved concept of “asymmetric warfare” in which the killing of innocents of any nation is substituted for meeting the warriors of an enemy state in battle. Neither air power advocates nor naysayers ever anticipated the sheer perversity of the terrorists’ attacks, from bombing kindergartens to crashing highjacked airlin- ers into buildings to the threat of using weapons of mass destruction in cities around the world.  These challenges will be met in the future, just as other new chal- lenges of conventional or unconventional threats were met in the past. As a single example, the British responded to the totally new threat presented by Zeppelins and bomber aircraft during World War I, which, as we will see, brought terror to the populace and changes in force disposition to the military. Then, one war later, the British used many of the ideas developed in that early response to ward off what time and usage had converted to the conventional German bombing attack during World War II. These ideas included the use of early warning systems, a ground observer corps, audio direction finding (that was replaced by radar direction finding), and a centralized command and control of defensive air power.
