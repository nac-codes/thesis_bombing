t face these threats until the advent of the Cold War, and (except for trivial Japanese pinpricks from submarine-borne aircraft and bal- loon-borne bombs) was spared an actual attack until the September 11, 2001, terrorist assaults on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. America’s previous freedom from attack heightened the horror of September 11. It, and subsequent acts of terrorism, impinged on the consciousness of the American public in an unprecedented way.  The measurably greater influence of air power on public opin- ion, as compared to sea power, was in large part the result of the coincidence of new media technologies with the dawn of aviation. The first commercial film projector appeared in England in 1896 at London’s Alhambra Theatre, the start of a burgeoning interest in film as entertainment. This was just four years before the Wright brothers began their aerial experiments, and seven years before their first successful flight on December 17, 1903. By 1909, the two inventions, flight and motion pictures, had coincided at Centocelle, near Rome. There, on April 24, Wilbur Wright carried a Universal newsreel cameraman to make the first motion picture footage ever recorded in flight. There were no such things as “residuals” in those days, a misfortune for the photographer, for the film has been shown thousands of times since, often being represented as the first flight at Kitty Hawk.  For the next several decades, the importance of film to air power— and vice versa—grew rapidly, especially after the introduction of sound newsreels in 1927. The sight and sound of Lindbergh’s Ryan NYP Spirit of St. Louis bumping along the ground in its takeoff from Long Island’s Roosevelt Field electrified the world and helped start an explosive expansion in aviation. The newsreel became the medium by which the horrors of aerial warfare would become universally known as it recorded the tragic effect of bombing upon Guernica, Rotterdam, London, Hamburg, Tokyo, and hundreds
