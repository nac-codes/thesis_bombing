reel became the medium by which the horrors of aerial warfare would become universally known as it recorded the tragic effect of bombing upon Guernica, Rotterdam, London, Hamburg, Tokyo, and hundreds of other cities.  Nor were newsreels the only place in which air power and film were mixed. Their mutual ties were demonstrated artistically in the same year as Lindbergh’s flight in the first motion picture to win an Oscar, William Wellman’s Wings. All over the world, the feature motion picture became a medium for advancing the cause of air power—or warning of its effects. Among these films, the 1935 British    Introduction 15  epic Things to Come, based on the H. G. Wells novel, warned of the effects of air power and of weapons of mass destruction. In contrast, the 1941 American film J Wanted Wings, a rendition of Beirne Lay’s book, was one of the most effective recruiting films of all time.  Newspapers were, for most of the century, of primary importance in forming public opinion. The grip of newspapers on the public imagination was enhanced by the aggressive editorializing typified by the Hearst publications and a combination of technical advances such as halftone photographs and typesetting machines. Flying was still a new and dangerous occupation, and almost any flight—and certainly every crash—received full coverage. Newspapers also adopted flying as a statement, with competing publishers using air- craft to transport reporters or to bring back the first photographs of a major event, such as a heavyweight championship fight.  In a relatively brief time, radio equaled then surpassed the impor- tance of newspapers in the expansion of airpower’s influence. While the existence of electromagnetic radio waves was first known in 1860, it was not until 1904 that voice transmission was demon- strated. By 1925, however, there were six hundred broadcast sta- tions, and a booming industry in radios. Like the newsreel, radio fastened on each new aviation event with unbridled
