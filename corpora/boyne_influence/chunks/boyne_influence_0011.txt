A curious phenomenon of this endless repetition on television is that when people can no longer stand the current rehash, they often turn to documentary channels to review the history of past achievements or past horrors.  This confluence of very diverse technologies—mass newspaper coverage, film, radio, and television—provided individual advocates of air power with the mechanisms needed to reach out to the gen- eral public, and they seized them early on. The new media bestowed a degree of prominence and influence upon these aviation propo- nents that was unavailable to their counterparts in the early days of naval and other military developments. While there were of course many famous military heroes throughout history who received wide- spread fame, the work of the comparatively few military philoso- phers was appreciated almost exclusively by professionals. They had little or no effect upon public opinion, and this may be said to be true of Mahan himself. As influential as he was in the services and even the governments of many nations, and despite the fact that his writings did appear in contemporary magazines and newspapers, he was not widely read or appreciated by the general public. In marked contrast, many of the most influential practitioners of air power had powerful personalities that resonated in the media, none more so than the United States’ famous brigadier general William (“Billy”) Mitchell, of whom much more will be discussed later.  Mahan’s book dealt with a relatively short 123-year period of naval warfare, one that was not characterized by great change in technology or tactics. The ships, as complex and difficult to handle as they were, remained wooden and wind-driven over the period, equipped with muzzle-loading cannons of much the same range and firepower. The tactics used by the Dutch fleet against the French and English at the battle of Southwold Bay on June 7, 1672, were not substantially different from those used by the Spanish against the
