purposes, the begin- ning of air power in 1783, the last year that Mahan covers, is covered in an appendix. That was the year that gave the balloon to the world, and while there is a general awareness that balloons were used in battle as early as 1792, few people realize how well organized and how effective the early balloon services were. In a similar way, the use of balloons in the American Civil War is well known, but the extent of that use, and the systematic way in which it was developed, is often overlooked.  Before examining the history and effect of balloons and other subsequent instruments of air power, it is necessary to define air power, and its modern equivalent “aerospace” power. First of all, air power must be understood to be different from (although a part of) the concepts of air superiority and air supremacy. Air superiority means the ability to deny the enemy the use of its own air space, while allowing the “friendly” force the ability to use that space to accomplish its tasks. If air superiority is absolute, and extends over all of the enemy’s territory at all times, it can be redefined as “air supremacy.” This is the sought-after condition, for with it the mili- tary operations of other vital land and sea forces can proceed with- out impediment from the air.  18 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  In contrast, air power is the ability to conduct military, commer- cial, or humanitarian operations at a chosen place, but not neces- sarily at all places nor at all times. This distinction recognizes that while two nations’ air forces may be vastly different in power, the less powerful nation may still be able to conduct meaningful air operations at certain times and places and thus still possess air power, even if to a limited degree. This was demonstrated on sever- al occasions during World War II, as when Jimmy Doolittle was able to deliver a surprise raid on Tokyo in 1942, or when the battered German Luftwaffe was able to conduct a strong (if
