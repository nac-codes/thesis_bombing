paved the way for the first flying machine. Unlike the dirigible, the heavier-than-air flying machine proved to be an insoluble problem to everyone but the inimitable Wright brothers of Dayton, Ohio. Orville and Wilbur Wright were self-taught engineers who did not approach flying as scientists seeking basic principles, but as practical men intent on solving the problems of flight. The two men, acting almost as if their personalities were fused, systematically went from an interest in the possibility of flight in 1899 to the successful first flight on December 17, 1903. At that moment in time, they were at least ten years ahead of all possible competitors in the world, including some who had been working on the problem for decades.  There were people who would hotly dispute this fact in 1903, and some people today would still dispute the claim. There are societies that in all honest belief carry the banner for many of these individ- uals, claiming that this one or that one flew before the Wright brothers did. As a result, the following straightforward paragraphs will perhaps offend those who wish to believe that others had achieved powered, man-carrying flight, or were very close to doing so, prior to the Wrights’ success on December 17, 1903.  The hard facts are, however, that no one, not Clement Ader, Alexander Graham Bell, Octave Chanute, Captain Ferdinand Ferber, Lawrence Hargrave, Augustus Herring, Samuel Pierpont Langley, Otto Lilienthal, Hiram Maxim, John Montgomery, Gustave Whitehead, or anyone else had a development line going which approached that of the Wrights, or which could have led in a rea- sonable time to a controllable, man-carrying aircraft.  Fledgling Wings 27  This statement seems harsh, but detailed examination of each of these would-be first-flighters reveals just how deficient their approach and their apparatus were. Ader’s machines, which had received more than 500,000 francs ($100,000) in government financing, were immensely complicated and
