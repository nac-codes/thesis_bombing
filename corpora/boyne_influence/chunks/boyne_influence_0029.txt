But time, personality, and events would work against them, and as word of their achievements leaked out to a largely disbelieving public, competitors began to gain on them.  The Wrights were extremely, perhaps obsessively, secretive, but Wilbur had published two articles and given two important lectures on their work. The Wrights had discussed their project extensively with Octave Chanute, who also published articles that included material on the Wrights, and had, with colleagues, visited the Wrights at Kitty Hawk. Their 1904 and 1905 aircraft had been seen in flight at Huffman Prairie, the flying field near Dayton that they used after 1903. A sketch of the 1905 Wright Flyer was published in L’Auto in Paris on December 24, 1905.* The sketch clearly showed the front biplane elevator, the hip cradle in which the pilot lay, the skid undercarriage, the yoke and rail system for launching, the shape and placement of the two pusher propellers, and the double rear rudder.  This body of knowledge allowed European imitators to expand on their own efforts, buoyed by the knowledge that flight was indeed possible, aware of the general configuration of the Wright Flyer, and relieved that pursuing flight could no longer be consid- ered a foolish, impossible endeavor—the Wrights had flown! There were some, of course, who insisted that the Wrights were poseurs who had never really flown at all.  Rivals sprang up both in Europe and in the United States and Canada. France, which had been first with the balloon and the diri- gible, had long demanded that it must be first with a flying machine, and the voluble patriots of the Aéro-Club de France as well as the editor of L’Aérophile cried for action. In response, Henri Deutsch de  32 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  la Meurthe and Ernest Archdeacon established prizes so that the “homeland of Montgolfier” (the father of ballooning, see the appendix) would not be disgraced by having a foreigner be the first to create a flying mach
