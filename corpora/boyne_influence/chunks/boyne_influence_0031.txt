uilding his own brand of motorcycle. His capability with powerful lightweight engines and his manufac- turing experience more than compensated for the fact that he was the only one of the four without a college degree.  It was a powerful group, handicapped only slightly by Bell’s per- sistence in pursuing the tetrahedral kite as a flying machine. With some chutzpah, members of the AEA wrote to the Wright brothers for information on their flying experience. The Wrights replied with general information on their patents and the papers they had pub- lished. The Wrights did not consider the AEA a commercial threat, believing it to be a research agency, as it was under the auspices of    Fledgling Wings 33  Alexander Graham Bell. Nothing could have been further from the truth.  By early 1908, the AEA had developed its first aircraft, the Red Wing, which closely followed Wright practice in that it was a pusher (propeller facing the rear) biplane with a “horizontal rudder” in front and a vertical rudder in the rear. The Red Wing had no means of roll control and crashed on its first flight, which covered almost 320 feet. The White Wing that followed (the name deriving from the color of the cloth with which the wings were covered) was almost identical to the Red Wing, but had two small ailerons mounted on the upper wings, the first attempt made to sidestep the Wright patent for three-axes control. The White Wing flew on May 17, and while not up to the Wright standard of design or construction, was flyable, nonetheless, and the AEA was “in the air.”  Glenn Hammond Curtiss altered the picture forever on June 21, 1908, at his namesake hometown in Hammondsport, New York, with three successful flights in his June Bug. (The name was whimsi- cally selected to acknowledge the myriad “June bugs” that infested Hammondsport and its vineyards that year.) His aircraft still echoed the Wright formula but was powered by an engine of his own design, directly driving the pusher propeller. It
