September 23, when AEA members Bell, McCurdy, and Baldwin came to serve as Selfridge’s pallbearers, and paid a courtesy call on Orville, in the Fort Myer hospital. They were turned away, but then took the time to pay another courtesy call, this one on the balloon hangar where the wrecked Military Flyer was awaiting shipment back  Fledgling Wings 35  to Dayton. There they persuaded the sergeant on guard to admit them, and Bell was seen to make a measurement of the wings.  While Orville was meeting first success and then disaster at Fort Myer, Wilbur was dazzling Europe with his remarkable, record-set- ting flights in France. The aviation world was now well aware of the general outline of the Wright design, and could infer from obser- vation how the controls operated. Some, as with Louis Blériot, sim- ply adopted the Wright method of control without a by-your-leave. Others, including Curtiss, sought alternate means of lateral control, such as ailerons, to avoid the Wright patent.  An important by-product of the Wrights’ convincing demonstra- tions that the aircraft had indeed arrived was the establishment of associations that lobbied for air power. In 1908, there sprang up the Air Fleet League in Germany and the National Air League in France, while the Aerial League of the British Empire was formed in 1909.* Similar organizations blossomed in Italy and Russia. These organizations corresponded to very popular institutions which pro- moted the respective interests of their national navies, and which had both political and economic influence. The new organizations were better funded, and far more active, than the typical national “aero clubs.” The formation of such groups, linked to the large numbers of young military officers who were intrigued by flying, would help explain why the governments of those nations should spend so much money on the development of air power before the First World War. Further, it became the common practice for mem- bers of these organization
