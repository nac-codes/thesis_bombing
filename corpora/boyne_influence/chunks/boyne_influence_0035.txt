n why the governments of those nations should spend so much money on the development of air power before the First World War. Further, it became the common practice for mem- bers of these organizations to pledge their services and their aircraft to the military, if war came. In return, they were given a stipend for maintaining their aircraft, and were paid a per diem for every day they served in practice maneuvers.  Orville returned to Fort Myer to complete the tests in 1909, resulting in the sale of the first military aircraft in the world, the Wright Military Flyer to the U.S. government. (The Wright Military Flyer still exists, and may be seen in Washington, D.C., at the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution.)  But it was now obvious that the Wright brothers’ once unassailable lead had begun to evaporate in 1908 when their brilliant perfor- mances served to inspire competitors. By 1909 it was badly eroded, although the Wrights were still sufficiently ahead of all competition to conclude a series of business deals that would make them rich. It  36 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  should be noted that the progress in aviation was so rapid, and gov- ernments were so nationalistic, that had the Wrights waited anoth- er year they probably would not have been able to reach the prof- itable arrangements they had made in Great Britain, France, and Germany.  Unfortunately for the Wrights, many of their competitors would draw on much of what they had done and significantly improve upon it. The great air shows at Rheims, Los Angeles, and elsewhere provided prizes as additional incentive. The Wright brothers’ aero- dynamic lead began to fade, and by 1911 their aircraft were not just obsolete compared to some foreign and domestic products, they were coming (correctly) to be regarded as inherently unsafe because of the large number of fatal accidents in which they were involved.
