in the early days, the promise of a large aviation industry was attractive for the very reason that it is today—profits, jobs, and the assignment of contracts to specific areas of the country.  Yet the eccentrics who wanted to be in aviation had a driving pas- sion that could not be denied, and the industry that aviation was giv- ing birth to was attractive to many businessmen and politicians. And there was the matter of national pride. No government wanted to admit to its people that another nation was making faster progress in a new branch of service than it was. When Germany perceived that France had seized the advantage in heavier-than-air craft, and that there was little chance of matching it in the near future, the Germans decided to move forward in the lighter-than-air field as rapidly as possible. Despite many wise protests, the Germans seized upon dirigibles as a primary weapon, one in which Germany already had clear superiority. This lead in lighter-than-air craft was then used for propaganda purposes to counter the French claims, and to satisfy the amour propre of the military leaders.  The general popular appreciation of the use of air power in Libya and the Balkans exerted influence on both democratic and totali- tarian governments in Europe, and always in the same way. When people with influence and an interest in aviation understood that the general public was aware of the effects of air power, they reached  42 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  out with programs that enlisted the public’s interest and gave it a voice with which to express its opinion to the government.  This created the previously mentioned phenomenon peculiar to Europe—and totally foreign to the United States—the formation of civil associations designed to promote interest in, and more impor- tant, raise money for, the air services.
