reasonable claims were within only a few years of being proven.  The soon-to-be combatant nations were similar in another way. While all wished to see a strong civilian aircraft industry in their homeland, their military services were determined to control that industry, but beset by conflicting ideas. In each country the military services were concerned that the industry would not build aircraft to meet its requirements, that a few large companies might be in a monopoly position, able to dictate price and schedules, and that many smaller companies would not have the skill or productive capacity to meet demand. Each country established centralized controls, which tended to distort, rather than regularize, industry. It was not until the pressures of war forced wholesale changes that a rationalized industry came into being in France, Germany, and Great Britain. In Russia, not even the pressures of war could over- come the intricate bureaucracy, and despite having excellent designers and builders, including Igor Sikorsky, the Russians were unable to establish an aviation industry comparable to the Western European powers.    44 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  One factor was very different among the countries in question, and that was in the capability to produce large numbers of high- quality aircraft engines. It was not yet fully realized that engines were a more difficult engineering challenge than airframes, and developing an engine from concept to production took many years and much investment.  France led the way. Its Gnome, Renault, Clerget, Salmson, and Anzani engines gave it a range of types (rotary, in-line, and radial) and horsepower that no other nation could match. Indeed, France supplied engines, particularly the Gnome, to many nations, includ- ing those with which it would soon be at war. Germany was a poor second, with a capability to produce a limited number of good, if heavy, Daimler in-line, water-cooled engines. England, Italy, and Russia r
