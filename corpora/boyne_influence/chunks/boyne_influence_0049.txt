Aviation and Motor Vehicles to procure aircraft. A Fliegertruppe (Flying Force) was established in October 1912, and its units were completely subservient to the German Army, actually coming under the Railways and Transport Communications Department." Exactly one year later to the day, an Inspectorate of the Flying Force and an Inspectorate of the Airship Service were formed.  When the First World War began on August 3, 1914, the great powers had not yet embraced aviation as an essential part of their armed forces, but nonetheless each had surprising aerial strength.    Chapter Two  Air Power in World War I  The general question of the influence of air power upon history was settled in the first thirty days of World War I. This is a bold state- ment, given the nature of the subject and the relatively inaccurate reporting made of air power during World War I, but nevertheless, the influence of air power was enormous and rapidly demonstrated for both the Allied and the Central Powers.  Unfortunately, only a few people were perceptive enough to be aware of this influence at the time, for by a curious coincidence the initial effects of air powerâ€™s influence were muted when Allied and German successes essentially cancelled each other out. As we will see below, the major Allied success occurred on the Western Front. The Germans had some generally unheralded air-power successes also on the Western Front, but scored a tremendous triumph on the Eastern Front, one directly attributed to air power by the architect of the victory, then-General Paul von Hindenburg.  If these first air-power successes had occurred on only one front or the other, the nature of the war and its final outcome might have been very different, and air power might have been seen in a very different light. The successes alluded to were the result of aerial reconnaissance, and struck directly at the heart of the notorious Schlieffen plan (see below) upon which not only German strategy, but in fact, German
