resources or the organizational skills to do so.  There were in most countries individuals whose outstanding interest and ability were used to overcome all the obstacles of con- ventional thinking to put the most effective air force possible into the field. They would be, for the most part, little known and ill rewarded by their countries and usually highly controversial within their own service, but their efforts were essential.  In Britain, there were several leaders of note. Sheer deference must place Winston Churchill’s name at the top of the list for his early and consistent support of aviation, which exerted the same strange fascination upon him as did the sound of bullets missing him. Captain Henry Robert Moore Brooke-Popham, among his many achievements, foresaw the future of aerial combat, and pro- cured the Hispano Suiza engine for British aircraft, filling a vital gap. A flamboyant, witty Irishman, Mervyn O’Gorman, founded Great Britain’s scientific approach to aeronautics by his brilliant leadership of the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough. His naval counterpart was Captain Murray Sueter, who did for the Royal Naval Air Service what O’Gorman was doing for the Royal Flying Corps. Both men had the great advantage of a small but growing aviation industry in which were to be found such giants as Frank Barnwell, Geoffrey de Havilland, Richard Fairey, Henry Folland, Frederick Handley Page, Frederick W. Lanchester, A. V. Roe, the Short broth- ers, and young T. O. M. Sopwith, to name but a few. The combination of government leadership in research (although it was often castigat- ed for failed designs and its tendency to keep obsolete aircraft in pro- duction) and a vibrant private industry enabled the Royal Flying Corps to grow from its opening strength of some sixty-three aircraft deployed on the continent in August 1914 to become the Royal Air Force with a worldwide strength of 22,650 aircraft by 1918.’ As an index of just how massive the growth had been,
