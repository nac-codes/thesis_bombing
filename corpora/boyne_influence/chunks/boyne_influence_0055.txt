There sim- ply had not been the leadership nor the industrial base to compete with German efforts.'’ However, the IRAS did pioneer strategic bombardment with the first four-engine bombers, all variants of the Igor Sikorsky’s Il’ya Muromets.  The plight of Germany’s ally, the Austro-Hungarian empire, was captured by the brilliant scientist Theodore von Karman, when he said, “Aircraft were not valued as highly as a horse. As a cavalry offi- cer expressed it, an aircraft required too many troops for mainte- nance and one could not use it in poor weather.”"* The Austro- Hungarian aviation industry supplied about 5,200 aircraft and 4,900 engines during World War I, with the remainder of its forces being supplied by Germany."*  To recapitulate, as war broke out in Europe in 1914, the air armies of the contending sides were approximately equal in size and capability. Neither the United States nor Italy were belligerents as yet, so their forces (or lack of them) can be discounted.  The First Major Instances of Air Power’s Significant Influence  In the summer of 1914, the great nations of Europe were pros- perous, enjoying a host of new scientific and engineering discover- ies, and their people, for the most part, were able to enjoy life as never before. The imbecilic manner in which they stumbled from  Air Power in World War I 53  this relative state of grace into the horrible killing of what they termed “the Great War” has been told many times, most notably in Barbara Tuchman’s The Guns of August.  There were tensions, of course. Germany believed itself to be denied the rights of other great nations and feared that it was being surrounded by its enemies. France still suffered from the humilia- tion of 1870 and longed for
