Germany had a huge army, and its navy had been built up in the costly naval arms race with Great Britain. The Austro-Hungarian Army was relatively large, but, like the rest of the empire, lacked cohesion. Its member states were more con- cerned about their own ethnic and religious interests than the wel- fare of the empire. The Austro-Hungarian Army was forced to depend upon two hundred common military words and phrases as the central communication bridge among the many languages in    54 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  use. Its navy, in contrast, was more homogeneous, surprisingly large and relatively well equipped. Imperial Russia had a huge army and a navy humbled by its bitter experience in the war with Japan.  Germanyâ€™s fear of encirclement had led it to what became infa- mous in history, the Schlieffen plan. Created by General Albert von Schlieffen, Chief of the German General Staff from 1891 to 1905, the plan was predicated upon the absolute necessity of avoiding a two-front war by swiftly defeating France, and then turning the German forces eastward against Russia. The key to this swift reversal of fronts lay in the superb German railroad network. Unfortunately, the intricacy of the railroad system, and its susceptibility to gross dis- organization if its schedules were interfered with, meant to the German General Staff that once the order for mobilization was given, the process could not be halted for any reason. They believed that if the mobilization was halted, the resulting sheer chaos in the railroads would render Germany vulnerable to enemy attack.  The Schlieffen plan called for sending no fewer than forty-one German army corps in four lines against France, with ten divisions left in the east as a holding force against the Russians. The princi- pal attack was to sweep through Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg in a wide arc that would break through French lines and sweep to the Swiss frontier, ending the war in six weeks.
