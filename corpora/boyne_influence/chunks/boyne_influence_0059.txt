he reconnaissance reports made by both British and French aviators, and which, almost miraculously, were not only believed but acted upon by Allied commanders. They came about in the following manner.  The first step in the long chain of events leading to the stalemate on the Western Front took place on August 4, 1914, when five of the eight squadrons of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) were mobilized. The other three squadrons existed on paper only.  Of the five mobilized, No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 Squadrons were to go to France with forty aircraft, to be followed by the Aircraft Park. This was a reserve made up of twenty-four aircraft in packing cases and the attendant equipment. The mobilization orders allowed three days to get ready, a fourth day to fly to Dover, and then two more days to fly to France. All the equipment of the squadrons was to fol- low the aircraft by sea. A great deal of planning had been done, so that the date and time that each aircraft, each train, and each ship would depart was already scheduled. The exact equipment to be brought along was specified, from the number of spanners (wrench- es) per squadron to the pilot’s personal equipment, which included a revolver, field glasses, a spare pair of goggles, a water bottle, a small stove, biscuits, cold meat, a piece of chocolate, and soup cubes."®  Tragedy struck immediately, when an aircraft of No. 3 Squadron crashed on takeoff on its way to Dover. On August 13, the remain- der of the force—thirty-nine aircraft—left for France. The aircraft making this cross-Channel journey into combat were broadly repre- sentative of Allied aircraft in the first months of the war. At the time, only the French had begun to recognize the logistical importance of having aircraft of a similar type assigned to one unit. The British mixed their aircraft types freely within a squadron, often at the pref- erence of the pilots, many of whom had paid for their own flight  56 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  training and
