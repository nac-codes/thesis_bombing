after the pilot was forced to land behind enemy lines. The usual case, however, was that a close bond developed between “Franz and Emil,” the comic-strip names adopted for observer and pilot respectively, regardless of rank.  Aircraft were far too primitive to be decisive in battle, but they were extremely influential on both fronts. In both the battles of the Marne and Tannenberg, the High Commands on both sides were aware that a significant new dimension had been added to warfare. Over the next four years, the Germans would become acutely aware    62 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  of the importance of air power, because it was needed to redress the ever-growing overall advantages in Allied strength. Germany, how- ever, would be increasingly short of the resources required and so would never be able to build an air force equal to the combined strength of those of the Allies. The Allied leaders also appreciated air power, and so much did they foster its growth that their air forces spilled over into other theaters of war, including Italy and Mesopotamia.  The leaders of the Allies and the Central Powers had anticipated neither trench warfare nor the size and complexity of the air forces that trench warfare would require. Within a few months of the out- break of the war, the fledgling air arms had demonstrated a wide variety of air-power missions, including air-to-air combat, artillery spotting, close air support, covert special operations, mapmaking, night bombing and reconnaissance, photoreconnaissance, propa- ganda efforts, strategic bombing, tactical bombing, and visual reconnaissance. These efforts were made almost entirely by unspe- cialized aircraft that had been in service as the war began. By 1918, almost every element of modern air power would be demonstrated or experimented with, including cruise missiles but excluding nuclear warfare and true precision-guided munitions. And by 1918, highly specialized aircraft, developed specifically for one or
