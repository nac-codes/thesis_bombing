onstrated or experimented with, including cruise missiles but excluding nuclear warfare and true precision-guided munitions. And by 1918, highly specialized aircraft, developed specifically for one or two dis- tinct missions, would be the rule rather than the exception.  This rapid growth and specialization was necessary to meet and match the developing capabilities of the air forces of each side. Another factor, less obvious, but almost equally important, was that German aircraft had to be even more specialized, to offset the gen- eral German shortage of resources. As a single example of this fac- tor, to be further reported on below, the Germans developed close air support aircraft and tactics to a far greater degree than the Allies, to assist their outnumbered ground forces. Their success with these tactics would have profound effect upon German military equipment, training, tactics, strategy, and even diplomacy before and during World War II. The mental set deriving from the suc- cessful use of these tactics had a tremendously influential effect upon German expansion in the 1930s.  It will be shown later that almost every one of the wide variety of missions which will be examined here would, at some later date, have profound influence on world history.  Air Power in World War I 63 Mission Specialization  The most important function of air power during World War I was the gathering of intelligence by visual and photographic means. Ironically, by 1915, just 132 years after the Montgolfier brothers’ first flight, trench warfare brought balloons back into prominence despite the invention of the aircraft.  The spherical balloon used for many years was difficult to manage in high winds, its constant movement often nauseating observers to the point of helplessness. In 1896, a German dirigible enthusiast, August von Parseval, introduced the so-called kite balloon, which had an elongated sausage shape and inflated vertical surfaces.” The kite balloon was more stable, as
