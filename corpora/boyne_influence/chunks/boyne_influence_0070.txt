, a German dirigible enthusiast, August von Parseval, introduced the so-called kite balloon, which had an elongated sausage shape and inflated vertical surfaces.” The kite balloon was more stable, as it would, like an airborne wind gauge, turn into the wind and remain positioned in that direction.  Initially, the German High Command was so unhappy with the performance of observation balloons that serious consideration was given to discontinuing their use. However, two factors intervened. The first was trench warfare, and the second was the steady growth in the supply of artillery munitions on both sides of the front, which meant that firing became almost constant, especially before an attack. Coincident with these events, the information from the bal- loon observers began going directly to artillery commanders, who appreciated and used it on the spot. Formerly it had gone to the High Command as “balloon intelligence,” and by the time it was transmitted back down to the operators in the field, it was out of date. (The problem has been partially overcome only in recent years with information proceeding from observation platforms to satellites to field commanders in real time. The requirement for security processing still poses delays.)  Balloon strength grew rapidly thereafter from the nine on the Western Front in January 1915 to as many as three hundred on the front by 1918. The Germans continued to improve their balloon designs, using ideas from captured French balloons (see below). The later models were called “Drachens.” With up to 35,000 cubic feet of hydrogen, they were able to ascend to 4,000 feet, an altitude from which the observer could see as far as fifteen miles behind enemy lines.*  The French had abandoned their tradition of balloons in 1911, but quickly reconstituted their balloon corps with the advent of  64 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  trench warfare. By October 1914, they had ten balloon companies fielding thirty balloons in service, and
