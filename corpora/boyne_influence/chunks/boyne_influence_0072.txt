hey could immediately detect a newly dug line of trenches or the shift in the position of a battery. The aircraft moved swiftly over a larger area, but its pilot or observer could not have the same intimate knowledge of the balloon observer. Initially, reports by aircraft were either made verbally at the end of a mission, or written on a message pad and dropped near a headquarters. It was not long, however, until radios became generally available, and then the greater area that the aircraft could cover became important.  The Growth of Aerial Reconnaissance  Airborne radios had been used in limited numbers almost from the start of the war. The sets were primitive in the extreme, and  Air Power in World War I 65  could be used for sending only, as the noise of the aircraft made reception impossible. Communication from the ground was by means of prearranged signals, such as the British Popham panels that used a black cloth as backdrop for white cloths laid out in spec- ified patterns.  On September 24, 1914, at the Battle of the Aisne, Royal Flying Corps crews used wireless telegraphy to direct artillery shoots. Using B.E.2 aircraft, Lieutenants D. S. Lewis and B. T. James directed artillery fire in what became a classic manner. Following is a record of one of their “shoots” on September 24 as recounted in Per Ardua by Hillary St. George Saunders:  4:02 p.m. A very little short. Fire Fire.  4:04 p.m. Fire Again. Fire Again.  4:12 p.m. A little short; line o.k.  4:15 p.m. Short. Over, over and a little left.  4:20 p.m. You were just between two batteries. Search two hundred yards each side of your last Shot. Range O.K.  4:22 p.m. You have them.  4:26 p.m. Hit. Hit. Hit.  4:32 p.m. About 50 yards short and to the right. 4:37 p.m. Your last shot in the middle of three batteries in action; search all round within 300 yards of your last shot and you have them.  4:42 p.m. Iam coming home now.”  Within six months, the RFC had evolved a new system. It placed the target in the
