that began on September 13, 1914, was followed by the “race to the sea” in which trenches were construct- ed on both sides all the way from Switzerland to the coast. During this period, and for several weeks thereafter, the aerial activities on both sides declined sharply because of the heavy losses caused in part by combat, but in the main by accidents and simple wear and tear. Every combatant was forced to realize how few aircraft were available (at one point, the Royal Flying Corps had fewer than ten aircraft ready to fly) and how many more were needed, which began the great industrial buildup of what had been a cottage industry.  As invaluable as the airman’s eyes were, it was obvious that aerial cameras were required. Germany, with its fabled optics industry was the best prepared, the Germans possessing more than a hundred aerial cameras when the war began. In France, success once again depended upon an individual in the field. Major Paul Louis Weiller was an observer in a Maurice Farman, and used his own private cam- era to take pictures. He was immediately distressed when he found that the official French Army maps, prepared by the Army Geographical Service, differed vastly from his photographs.  Weiller created a camera of his own design, with a focal length of 1.3 meters, so, it was said, that his boss, General Charles E. M. (“The Butcher”) Mangin could “see some Boches.” (Mangin earned his nickname because of his indifference to casualties inflicted on his troops.) The camera provided such extraordinary photographic results that Weiller, over time, was able to sell the idea of a special unit of long-range reconnaissance Breguet XIV aircraft which would photograph the entire front to a depth of one hundred kilo- meters behind enemy lines every day.
