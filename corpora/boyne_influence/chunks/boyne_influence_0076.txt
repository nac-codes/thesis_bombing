provided their own equipment until the spring of 1915 when a specially designed camera developed by J. T. C. Moore-Brabazon (later Lord Brabazon of Tara) and Lieutenant C. D. M. Campbell was placed into general use. It was a simple box camera, with a five-inch-by-four-inch glass plate, affixed to the side of the aircraft and operated by the observer."  The provision of these cameras made possible the first great exer- cise in reconnaissance, which took place before the British attack on the German salient at Neuve Chapelle on March 10, 1915.  During the preceding month, Royal Flying Corps crews of No. 2 and No. 3 Squadrons, flying primarily B.E.2s, prepared for the forth- coming attack by photographing the entire German trench system.  68 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  The photos were used to make an amazingly detailed map, of which fifteen hundred copies were made and distributed to the British Army units scheduled to go over the top.  In addition to their value in mapping the intricacies of the German defenses, the photos were also used for another military first, the determination of strategic targets to be bombed in con- junction with the attack. German railroad junctions were identified and targeted on the basis of the February photographs. The object of the bombing was to prevent German reinforcements being brought up.  By the end of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, the capability of observation aircraft had been fully demonstrated. From that point on, there were no radical changes in the exercise of the observation function except that equipment and tactics became increasingly sophisticated.  Both sides began to allocate more and more assets to the recon- naissance function. The Germans began 1915 with a paper strength of 432 observation-type aircraft distributed among seventy-two units. Actual strength was about 215. By March 1918, there were 300 reconnaissance aircraft and 741 artillery observation aircraft in the field, and this despite the extensi
