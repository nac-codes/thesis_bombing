ous ingenuity was required to meet all of the many missions expected of naval aircraft. Initially, of course, there were no aircraft carriers in the modern sense, but vessels were quickly adapted to carry seaplanes, which were raised and lowered from the ship by massive cranes. Seaplanes could land and take off only in the calmest of seas, and the process of loading and unload- ing them was hazardous. Planners realized from the start that an aircraft carrier that could launch and retrieve aircraft with conven- tional landing gear would be preferable.  While the idea of the aircraft carrier was gestating, seaplane car- riers and seaplanes were used in a wide variety of raids, from those on Zeppelin sheds to the first successful use of an aerial torpedo. On August 12, 1915, the seaplane carrier Ben-My-Chree (a converted Isle of Man packet) launched a Short Type 184 seaplane flown by    Air Power in World War I 7  Lieutenant Commander C. H. K. Edmonds, who promptly torpe- doed a Turkish transport ship off Gallipoli. Five days later, he tor- pedoed another ship, setting off a train of weapon development that would reach a peak in World War II.  Seaplanes were widely used throughout the British Empire, but experimentation with the aircraft carrier concept continued, and on August 2, 1917, Squadron Commander E. H. Dunning landed a Sopwith Pup on the forecastle deck of the Furious, becoming the first British pilot to alight on a ship. (Dunning was killed in another attempt captured in unforgettable photographs just five days later.)  The RNAS responded to the German declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare with further growth, including the acquisition of two unique classes of aircraft. The first of these was lovingly called “battle bags.” It was a hybrid craft that consisted of the body of a B.E.2c aircraft slung beneath the bag of a Willows airship, thus creat- ing the S.S. (submarine scout) airship. This was succeeded in service by the larger C airships. The crews
