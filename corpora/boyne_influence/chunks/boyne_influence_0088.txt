operating as a unit. They sought out enemy observation aircraft and dispatched them with a surprising head-on attack. Their scores mounted rapidly. Both men were awarded the coveted Pour le Mérite on January 12, 1916, after they had achieved their eighth victories.  Immelmann was shot down by a British two-seater after his fif- teenth victory, while Boelcke scored forty victories before perishing in a mid-air collision with one of his own men.’ The net effect of the two young aces was to focus attention on the purely imaginary glam- our of air combat, and to hasten in all air forces the formation of specialized units composed entirely of fighters. The term “imagi- nary glamour” is used deliberately, for death in the air was as final and as appalling as death on the ground, and the image of chivalry given by the press was mostly a false one. In the realistic and informed words of the American “Ace of Aces,” Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, air combat was “scientific murder.”  Immelmann and Boelcke also had an effect on the reaction in the press, in the British Parliament, and in the French Chamber of Deputies. One English Parliamentarian, the irrepressible Noel Pemberton-Billing, referred to the gallant British airmen as “Fokker fodder,” while the press painted the E I as being overwhelming in both numbers and performance. The E I actually had at most a mediocre performance with a top speed of only eighty miles per    Fighters and Bombers 79  hour. By December 1915, there were no more than forty on duty on a front that stretched 475 miles from Switzerland to the sea.*  The degree that the press and the politicians distorted the impor- tance of the Fokker E I threat is revealed in a simple statistical com- parison. During the month, January 16, 1916, when the Fokker furor was at its height, the British suffered only ten losses in the air. During 1915, Great Britain and its Commonwealth partners had suf- fered 11,652 casualties in four days of March at Neuve Chapelle, 60,0
