at its height, the British suffered only ten losses in the air. During 1915, Great Britain and its Commonwealth partners had suf- fered 11,652 casualties in four days of March at Neuve Chapelle, 60,000 casualties in thirty-five days at the second Battle of Ypres, and more than 225,000 in the long agonizing campaign at Gallipoli. Later in 1916, they would lose 60,000 in the first day of the Battle of the Somme. “Ordinary Wastage” along the front amounted to as many as 2,500 killed and wounded every day. Yet somehow, ten air casualties in a month caused a near panic. It was a classic example of the effect of air power upon the political and press psyche, one that would be repeated many times in the years to come.*  An antidote to the Fokker was found in the French Nieuport 11, which mounted a forward-firing Hotchkiss machine gun over its top wing, and in the British de Havilland D.H. 2, a pusher mounting a forward-firing gun in its nacelle. This was the second stage of the seesaw race for air superiority that continues to this day. The Germans introduced the Albatros D I in 1916. Equipped with two forward-firing machine guns, it rapidly became the dominant fight- er on the front, and was succeeded by a series of improved models. The Allies would not wrest air superiority back from the Germans until the introduction of the Sopwith Camel and SPAD VII in 1917.  As new aircraft were introduced, new air tactics were developed. These would be extremely influential until the first years of World War II. The lessons learned in World War I would be applied to training, organization, and procurement for the next two decades, albeit almost invariably incorrectly. Their effect was, ironically much more deadly when former aces assumed positions of power in later air forces, and applied their knowledge of World War I tactics to World War II conditions. Two primary examples are Hermann Goering and Ernst Udet. Goering, a twenty-two victory ace (although many of his victory claims ar
