In general, the British pursued a relentless offensive policy that did not take into consideration numbers of aircraft, numbers of trained pilots, or the suitability of aircraft for the mission. Major General (later Marshal of the Royal Air Force) Hugh (“Boom”) Trenchard insisted that his pilots and crews always be on the attack, regardless of casualties and ignoring the fact that RFC/RAF equip- ment was for long periods of time totally inadequate for the task. Trenchard claimed that his policy established a moral ascendancy over the enemy. This was in fact true, and indeed was a factor extending through World War II, but it was obtained at an uncon- scionable cost in the lives of the pilots and crews. At one point in 1917, pilots were arriving with as little as twenty hours flying time; by 1918, a squadron could lose as much as one-fourth of its strength in a day, and a fighter pilot’s lifespan at the front was very short, with some estimates as low as eight days.  The Germans adopted the opposite policy, preferring a basically defensive posture that allowed “the customer to come to the store.” An initial attempt was made to maintain the Luftsperre (barrage patrol), with the intention to prevent any enemy aircraft from cross- ing the front lines. This soon proved to be impossible—there were far too many cubic miles of airspace to defend, and far too few air- craft with which to do it. The Germans then became much more selective. They flew some standard patrols, but for the most part relied on a good early warning system, using observers at the front to relay messages on the nature and presumed intent of enemy activity. Fighters were then dispatched as needed to contest specific missions. It was an economical and sensible way to fight the war, conserving aircraft usage as well as fuel and supplies. It had several great advantages.
