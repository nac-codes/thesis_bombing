the front seat, directly under the wing. The B.E.2 was designed to be inherently stable, and hence was inherently unmaneuverable. The F-E.2 was a two-seater pusher with a single forward-firing machine gun and a top speed of ninety- one miles per hour. Both were cold meat for the 103-miles-per-hour Albatros, which, in comparison to these two “crates” was delightful- ly maneuverable. It would prove to be less maneuverable than the Allied fighter aircraft that opposed it, for its two-machine-gun arma- ment increased its wing loading.  Just as the Eindecker had called forth remedies in the form of the Nieuport and the de Havilland, so the Albatros elicited opposition in the Sopwith Camel, Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a, and French SPAD VII. Such was the rapidly accelerating nature of Allied aircraft engineering and manufacture, and such was the advantage in Allied engines and fuels, that these aircraft remained superior to every German offering until the appearance of the Fokker D VII in May 1918.  The D VII is generally regarded as the best fighter aircraft of World War I, and it presaged the design of the next decade of fight- ers with its thick, near-cantilever biplane wings and steel-tube fuse- lage construction. The Allies continued to introduce improved fighters, such as the Sopwith Dolphin and Snipe and the SPAD XIII. These often had elements of performance superior to that of the D VII, but the latter had two characteristics that earned its “best-fighter” accolades. The first was its generally pleasant flying qualities that were said to make good pilots out of bad ones, and aces out of good ones. The second was its combat capability at high angles of attack, being able to “hang on its propeller” to shoot at an opponent.  The Germans believed that mass served them in the air as on the ground. Sometimes a large formation was able to dominate an area over the front without ever engaging in combat. Asa result, larger orga- nizational units were created to control th
