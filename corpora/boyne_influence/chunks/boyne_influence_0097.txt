the air as on the ground. Sometimes a large formation was able to dominate an area over the front without ever engaging in combat. Asa result, larger orga- nizational units were created to control the larger number of aircraft being employed at a single time. The first of these of a permanent nature was the Royal Prussian Jagdgeschwader Nr. 1, formed on June 26, 1917, and commanded by none other than Rittmeister Manfred von Richthofen, the leading—and most celebrated—ace of World War    Fighters and Bombers 85  I. It was composed of four Jastas, numbers 4, 6, 10, and 11. Four addi- tional Jagdgeschwadern were formed by September 1918.’  The German sense of discipline allowed them to use another method of grouping squadrons together, on a less formal basis, the Jagdgruppe. These were more or less special purpose units, which had various Jastas assigned to them, and which were in existence for fairly limited periods of time. They were often given a designation featuring their commander’s name, as in Jagdgruppe “von Greim” or Jagdgruppe “von Braun,” or their location, as in Jagdgruppe “Lille.”  The new, larger organizations were often supported by trains, for the Germans continued to rely on railroads operating on their internal lines of communication to offset the superior strength of the Allies. The trains provided transport for the pilots and ground crew, and could carry the aircraft, equipment, and armament as well. The use of these trains, and the brightly colored aircraft, gave rise to the term “Flying Circus” to describe, for example, the Jagdgeschwader Nr. 1.  Strangely, the Allies did not respond immediately to the larger German formations. There were a number of reasons for this lack of response, including the difficulty in managing large formations during their assembly, flight to the combat area, and maneuvers in combat. Without any form of communication other than the waggle of wings and hand signals, controlling a large formation was diffi- cult. Eventua
