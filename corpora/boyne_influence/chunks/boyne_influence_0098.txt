assembly, flight to the combat area, and maneuvers in combat. Without any form of communication other than the waggle of wings and hand signals, controlling a large formation was diffi- cult. Eventually, however, it became obvious that the only sane way to bring the German formations to battle was to meet them in some- thing approaching equal numbers. The result was the employment of larger Allied units, two or more squadrons at a time, often flown at the altitudes best suited for the type, Sopwith Camels down low, S.E.5as at the middle levels, and a top cover of Sopwith Dolphins. This change in tactics brought about the relatively few “dogfights” in which large numbers of fighters were involved.  While films and fiction have led to the impression that the Western Front was always a whirling wheel of lead-spitting fighters, in actual practice most combat patrols were barren of action and relatively few large-scale dogfights occurred. When there was combat, it was usually between small numbers of aircraft and took place in an extraordi- narily brief period of time. Post-mission reports from the pilots are filled with comments indicating that the sky was full of aircraft at one moment and empty the next. And it became the practice of the    86 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  leading aces to make their attacks in such a manner that their victim was usually unaware that he was in combat until the bullets began hit- ting his aircraft.  By 1918, the full weight of Allied superiority in resources and industrial capacity was being brought to bear, and the Germans were badly outnumbered. While some individual units, staffed with less able pilots and inadequate equipment, suffered a crisis in morale, the fighting spirit of the German Air Force as a whole was never diminished. There were terrible shortages in fuel and lubri- cating oil, and the Jastas were forced to take such economy mea- sures as rolling their aircraft around on the ground on wooden wheels, sparing
