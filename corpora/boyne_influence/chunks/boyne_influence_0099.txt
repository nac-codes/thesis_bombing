ished. There were terrible shortages in fuel and lubri- cating oil, and the Jastas were forced to take such economy mea- sures as rolling their aircraft around on the ground on wooden wheels, sparing the scarce rubber wheels for actual combat sorties.  The Germans responded to their shortages in a very practical and sensible way by designing aircraft for the most important specialized tasks. One manifestation of this tendency had a significant influ- ence on the course of World War II. This was the creation of a new type of unit, the Schlachstaffeln (Battle Flights) and later the Schlachtgeschwadern (Battle Wings.) These new units did not employ conventional fighters, but specially designed close air sup- port aircraft that could be employed far more offensively than were the more famous fighter squadrons. The latter retained a defensive role until the end of the war.  These new types proved to be among the most successful German aircraft of the war. They included the Halberstadt CL II and CL IV, the Hannover CL III, and the Junkers J-1. The compact and strong- ly built Halberstadts were as fast as the Albatros fighters of the peri- od, but featured a two-man crew placed in a single cockpit. The Hannover was of the same size and speed, and had a distinctive biplane tail that gave its gunner a better field of fire. The Junkers J- 1 was also a biplane, but of all-metal construction, and well armored, with the crew and engine completely enclosed by five-mil- limeter chrome nickel sheet steel.‚Äù Almost twice as heavy as the Halberstadts, it nonetheless had a top speed of ninety-six miles per hour. It carried three machine guns, a radio, and small bombs and grenades, and sometimes was used to reprovision small units that were cut off by the enemy. It was not very maneuverable, but the armor provided welcome protection from small arms fire.  The German Army became very proficient in the employment of these close support aircraft, and a captured German document    Fighters
