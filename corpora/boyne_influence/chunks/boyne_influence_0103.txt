in the next ten years, defense expenditures could be cut.  As a result, the Royal Air Force was hopelessly obsolete by 1938, when it became apparent that war was perhaps only one—and not ten—years away. The fact was recognized by the Royal Air Force and the British military in general. As a result, they intensely lobbied Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain to appease Hitler, to gain time to rearm. This was in accord with Chamberlain’s own thinking, of course, but it was he who forever bore the stigma of the Munich agreement that dismembered Czechoslovakia. In the matchless way that war has of reversing expectations, the British failure to mod- ernize ultimately worked to their advantage. Having survived the Nazi onslaught in 1940, Britain was able to introduce a whole series of new aircraft to combat, while Germany was forced to rely for most of the war on the aircraft types with which it had started in 1939.  For the United States, the experience gained so quickly and at such great expense in World War I became irrelevant after 1918 as military budgets were slashed for the next twenty years. The statis- tics on the budgets for the period are at once amazing, revealing, and depressing as the following table shows:  Year Direct Cash Appropriation 1916 $ 801,000 1917 18,681,666 1918 735,000,000 1919 952,304,758 1920 26,124,300 1921 35,124,300 1922 25,648,333 1923 13,060,000 1924 12,626,000  Source: USAF Statistical Digest, 2000"  Spending did not rise again to the 1918 level until 1941, and of the small budget available, the great majority went for personnel costs. Of the pitifully small amounts of the budget remaining for air- craft, the majority was spent on the purchase of observation types for reconnaissance.
