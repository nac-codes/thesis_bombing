equately  90 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  upon air power in the years after the war was the reason that a Germany prostrate in 1932 could become intimidating by 1935, and brilliantly effective by 1939 in Poland. In the 1930s, however, there was an even more important factor driving world politics, and that was the specter of strategic bombardment. It was initiated in World War I by both Great Britain and Germany, brought to an amazingly sophisticated level by both countries, and became the basis upon which the first air-power philosophers built their theories. It also became the pattern for how Germany and Great Britain would fight in the air during World War II, and in another brilliant example of unintended consequences, we will see that both countries adopted measures opposite to those they had used in the First World War.  Bombing in World War I  Bombing is so morally offensive to those being bombed that it has always been used as a propaganda device. The Turks complained that the Italians had bombed a hospital in the very first bombing raids in Libya in 1911. The Germans wenta step further, introducing the preemptive bombing lie by claiming in their formal (if belated) August 3, 1914, declaration of war on France that French bombers had without provocation bombed Nuremberg the preceding day.  Yet bombing appears not to be morally offensive to those intend- ing to bomb, and each of the nations involved in the Great War developed a strategy for its bombing as it gathered practical experi- ence. It is instructive to look at them nation by nation to see how that experience influenced their subsequent development, and, in particular, how it affected the theory of air power as enunciated by the air-power philosophers of the postwar period.  France  Marshal Joseph Joffre, the “Hero of the Marne,” saw the advantages of aviation early on, being particularly impressed by the military maneuvers of 1912, in which sixty aircraft had participated, the great- est
