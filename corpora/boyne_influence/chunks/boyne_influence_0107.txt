a tail wind of twenty-five miles per hour, they could cover a hundred-mile bombing raid in one hour. On the return flight, however, the ground speed dropped to fifty miles per hour, and the Germans had two hours in which to attack them. On August 9, the Germans took advantage of this ago- nizingly slow egress speed to shoot down nine of the eighteen air- craft attacking Saarburg. By the following year, France confined almost all such raids to the night hours. Geography played a part in this decision, for the German incursion into France and Belgium had enabled it to deploy forces with the range necessary to attack France and England. At the same time, the invaded territories pro- vided a buffer that shielded all but the German border towns from French or British attack.  It was not until late in 1917 that suitable equipment began to arrive in the form of the successful Breguet XIV B 2. The French resumed daylight raids with the Breguets, striking enemy targets beyond the reach of conventional artillery, and concentrating on railroad stations, factories, and airfields; but results here were not entirely successful, and losses were heavy. The French bombing tac- tics foreshadowed World War II, for the Breguet formations dropped their bombs when the leader dropped, in an attempt to secure a greater mass of explosives in a given area. Another taste of World War II came with the Caudron R-11 multi-place escort fight- er, capable of 111 miles per hour, and carrying five machine guns. In 1918, the R-11 would clear the way through opposing enemy for- mations for the Breguets to follow.  The war ended with France focused on the task of day bombing, with strategic bombing relegated to a much lower priority. The post- World War I era saw the French military mired in the past, believing that it would win the next war by fighting it in the same manner.
