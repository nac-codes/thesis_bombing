and as long-range attack aircraft to hit the Austrian naval base at Pola. The Capronis were also pressed into service in France, and a later model was selected for manufacture in the United States. Many consider them to be the best performing Allied bomber of World War II.  The Italians’ attacks were pinpricks to begin with, but subse- quently built up into relatively large raids of as many as fifty air- craft—a huge number for large bomber attacks at the time and more than twice as large as any the Germans would make over England during World War I.  Production increased every year until, by 1918, Caproni built no less than 420 of its giant bombers. Italian aviation production had undergone a revolution, with 6,488 aircraft and 14,840 engines being turned out in 1918."  The success of these attacks seemed to validate Douhet’s claims, and provided the basis for his seminal book Command of the Air. The essence of Italy was embodied in one of the foremost—and perhaps least likely—proponents of air power, the poet Gabriele D’Annunzio, who also had close ties to Caproni. In 1915, at the age of fifty-two, he obtained permission from the Italian prime minister to fight the war as an individual on a personal crusade. Customarily called Il Poeta, and beloved by the Italian people (if not by many Italian husbands), D’Annunzio found in flight the perfect amalgam of romantic love and death that permeated his poetry. He began an  Fighters and Bombers 95  inspirational series of spectacular long-range flights over enemy cities to drop propaganda leaflets of his own creation. Not a pilot himself, he flew as observer and leaflet dropper. His first poetic bombing raid was on Trieste, and his last on August 9, 1918, by lead- ing eight single-engine Ansaldo reconnaissance planes all the way to Vienna to drop his leaflets, which he signed “Gabriele D’Annunzio, in the sky of Vienna.” While the physical damage to the enemy of D’Annunzio’s attacks was minimal, he had a tonic effect upon
