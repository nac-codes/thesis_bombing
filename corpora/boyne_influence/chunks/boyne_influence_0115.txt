with profound effect upon the worldâ€™s politics and weaponry.  The majority of American bombing was largely confined to sup- port of the armies in the field, although a covetous eye was cast on both the British Handley Page 0/400 and three types of Caproni bombers, all of which were ordered into production in the United States. By August 16, 1917, wild-eyed plans to procure as many as nine thousand Capronis were in effect. This enthusiasm was enhanced by reports from Foggia, Italy, where some seventy American airmen of those trained (among them the future mayor of New York, Fiorello H. LaGuardia) went to fly Caproni bombers in Italian squadriglia.  Unfortunately, difficulties with the Italian bureaucracy, including Gianni Caproni himself, made production almost impossible, and only five were ultimately delivered by the Fisher Body Company. The first of these did not reach the Air Service until January 16, 1919, and they served until 1921, with one example participating in a mock attack on New York City on July 29 of that year.  The Handley Page effort was both less ambitious and more suc- cessful. Plans called for building parts for five hundred Handley Page 0/400s and shipping them to Britain for assembly. As things worked out, seven were assembled and flown in the United States, while a hundred sets of parts were sent to Britain. They were not assembled there but were instead returned to the United States, where they became lost to history. One can only hope that some abandoned warehouse still contains a hundred sets of Handley Page parts waiting for some earnest aircraft restorer to discover them.  The wartime aviation production record of the United States is usu- ally dismissed as having been wasteful and inefficient, but this is not the entire story. The United States went from virtually no industry at all to one that produced several thousand aircraft and fourteen thou- sand engines in seventeen months. Moreover, had the war lasted for another year, that same
