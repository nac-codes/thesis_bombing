ates went from virtually no industry at all to one that produced several thousand aircraft and fourteen thou- sand engines in seventeen months. Moreover, had the war lasted for another year, that same industry would have produced thousands of aircraft and engines of indigenous design capable of fighting on the Western Front. Balloon production had soared, and the United States could have supplied all balloon requirements for the Allies in 1919.

Great Britain and Germany  It is both convenient and instructive to tell the story of the bomb- ing and defensive efforts of Great Britain and Germany in a single passage, for they were interactive and reactive for the length of the war. Further, the results of these intertwined efforts influenced the national military policies of both nations over the next thirty years, although in quite the opposite way than might have been expected.  Air crews and commanders on both sides were panting to start bombing, and bombs began to fall soon after the start of the Great War.
