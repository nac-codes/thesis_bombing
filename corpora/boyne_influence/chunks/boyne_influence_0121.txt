, but because they reveal the basic problem that has always confounded advocates of air power. Throughout most of its history the expectation of results from the application of air power has been vastly out of proportion to the resources used to obtain those results. This was because the people who decided the objectives for air power to achieve were in most cases not experienced in aviation, and their expectations were sometimes heightened by unusual achievements such as Marix’s raid on Disseldorf, such achievements being seen as the norm rather than the exception.  Ironically, the people deciding what an aircraft could do were in fact often the very same people who previously had refused to allo- cate a sufficient portion of the budget to the creation of the instru- ments of air power. There are many examples of this fact, from Moltke’s belief in dirigibles to Hitler’s hope that Nazi air power could achieve air superiority over Great Britain to the Japanese Imperial belief that its highly skilled but small air forces could, if not defeat the United States, at least force it to accept a favorable peace agreement. Only in rare instances have the resources necessary to    Fighters and Bombers 103  achieve what has been expected of air power been allocated. The examples are fewer here, but the buildup of United States and Soviet air forces during World War II and the creation of the Strategic Air Command in the post-World War II period are perhaps the best.  Germany was so convinced of the potential of dirigibles as far- ranging ships in the Mahan tradition that it allowed the Army and the Navy to develop their own airship fleets, a very costly duplication of production, construction, and training efforts. Both the Army and the Navy hoped to use the airship to carry the war to Britain, but the Navy also had a genuine scouting requirement, to guard against the approach of the British fleet. This scouting role was probably the best use to which dirigibles could be put,
