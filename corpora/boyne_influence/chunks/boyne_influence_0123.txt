as he knew the officers who commanded the airships. Yet he could be stern if the situation demanded it, and, like all warriors, his personality—and possibly his judgment—  104 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  changed over time under the stress of command in battle. Strasser was himself a protégé of the great airship commander Hugo Eckener, and his businesslike manner imparted discipline and pur- pose both to the few hundred sailors in his unit and, remarkably, also to his superior officers.  The first attack took place on January 19-20, 1915, with two out of three Zeppelins—L 3 and L 4—successfully reaching England. The L 3 was commanded by Kapitanleutnant Hans Fritz, an almost comic-book name for a German Zeppelin commander.
