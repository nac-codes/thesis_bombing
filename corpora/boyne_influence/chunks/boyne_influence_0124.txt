on British morale, a predisposition derived from the pre-war concerns about them. All of the fears seemed to be realized on the night of October 13-14, when five Zeppelins slashed across England, dropping almost two hundred bombs and killing seventy-one people and injuring another 128. Although British news- papers and politicians would have had the public believe that the Germans were deliberately placing the crosshairs of their diabolical bombsights on schools, hospitals, churches, and ladies’ sewing cir- cles, the truth was that in this war, as for most of the next, the bombs were being dropped indiscriminately. The Zeppelin crews hoped to hit military targets, and they tried to drop at least in the general area of those targets, but when time, weather, or emergencies dictated, they dropped them on whatever happened to be below.  The Germans attempted to learn the art of aerial navigation and    Fighters and Bombers 105  bombing from the air, but the wind and the weather made it far more difficult than contemplated. However, Zeppelin crews, like the bomber crews who followed them for the next eight decades, almost always claimed hits on legitimate military targets, and most often truly believed what they claimed.  Despite the difficulties, the expense, and the losses, the Germans persisted, with a total of forty-nine airships embarking on twenty raids in 1915. A more concentrated effort was made in 1916, when 164 air- ships embarked upon twenty-three raids. The term “embarked” is used because weather, wind, and mechanical difficulties sometimes kept air- ships from reaching their targets. On October 8, 1916, Ernst von Hoeppner became Kommandierende General der Luftsreitkrafte (Commanding General of the Air Force). He had already decided that airship attacks were nonproductive, and that the task of carrying the war to England should be given to bombers as soon as possible. Thus the number of airship attacks dropped sharply in 1917, with only seven raids and forty
