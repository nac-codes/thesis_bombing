th its engines on the inbound leg of its mis- sion, but pressed on. After dropping a dozen bombs in open fields near Kirton, Eichler elected to gain the advantage of a tail wind and descended to 11,500 feet—just about the maximum height that Watkins could reach in his B.E.12.  The British Home Defense system had worked perfectly, picking up the L 48 on its way in, and tracking it through its mission. As it passed over England, several aircraft were dispatched to intercept it. Watkins, a Canadian, was among the last of these sent aloft, along    Fighters and Bombers 107  with Captain (later Air Marshal) Robert Saundby and Second Lieutenant Frank Holder. All three attacked the L 48, but Watkins was subsequently given credit for the victory. In his account, he tells of firing three drums of incendiary ammunition into the Zeppelin before it caught fire. The L 48 then exploded and sank stern first to the ground at Theberton, Suffolk. Surprisingly, three of the twenty- two-man crew survived the crash—a rare occurrence, for most crews were burned to death before they hit the ground.  More German Zeppelins fell victim to weather and accidents than to enemy action, and it was soon apparent to the German High Command that Zeppelin warfare cost more than it was worth. Yet the Leader of Airships, Peter Strasser, had lost none of his enthusi- asm, and on August 5, 1918, led five Zeppelins in an attack on England. It was to be the last Zeppelin raid of the war.  Strasser commanded the raid from L 70, a massive dirigible, 693 feet long and with a volume of 2,195,800 cubic feet. It had a lifting capacity of 97,100 pounds and a top speed of eighty-one miles per hour. For some unknown reason, Strasser’s usually excellent judg- ment failed him, and he launched the raid so that it would arrive over Great Britain before nightfall.  The British defense system seized the opportunity, sending thir- ty-five aircraft to intercept the Zeppelins. Major Egbert Cadbury and Captain Robert Leckie
