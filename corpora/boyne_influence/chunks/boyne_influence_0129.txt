There is no question that the Zeppelin raids had an adverse effect upon British morale, although they did not crack, much less break the British spirit. The Zeppelin operations also diverted some British effort from the Western Front, and caused money to be expended on a system of home defense against air raids. The home defense sys- tem was one of the best investments of the time, for it would not only prove itself in the second phase of Germany’s World War I strategic bombing campaign, it would form the basis (with the addition of radar) for Great Britain’s aerial defenses during World War II.  The Second Phase of the First Strategic Bombing Campaign  Germany had committed itself to aerial warfare over England, and, for reasons of prestige, it was unwilling to give up on the idea. The Germans had determined to use aircraft to bomb England from the start of the war, and, just as the Zeppelin force had its Peter Strasser, so did the bomber proponents have an energetic leader, Major Wilhelm Siegert. Age seemed to do nothing to dim a German officer’s belligerence, and, at forty, Siegert was determined to create a bombing unit that reported directly to the German High Command for operations against England. He was given command of this Englandgeschwader (roughly England Wing) unit, which was officially titled Fliegerkorps der Obersten Heeresleitung (Flying Corps of the High Command) but operated under the code name Brieftauben-Abteilung Ostende (BAO), the Carrier Pigeon Section at Ostende.

Siegert gathered about twenty-four aircraft into the BAO, and began assembling pilots into what became first an elite outfit, and    Fighters and Bombers 109  then an incubator for future leaders of German aviation.
