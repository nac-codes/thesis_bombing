aircraft into the BAO, and began assembling pilots into what became first an elite outfit, and    Fighters and Bombers 109  then an incubator for future leaders of German aviation. His plans for bombing England fell through when the German advance through Belgium and France was held up, and the necessary bases were not acquired. Instead, the BAO began bombing operations against targets in Belgium and France, and was later transferred to the Eastern Front, where it operated from a railway train, just as the fighter “Flying Circus” would do later. The BAO was so successful in its operations that it rapidly became overworked. Calls from ground commanders for its services resulted in heavy casualties, and almost 20 percent of its original sixty officers were lost to enemy action. Thirty additional officers were transferred to provide command and leadership in other units, vitiating the BAO for all practical purposes.”  Technical and tactical developments offset the decline of the orig- inal BAO. Two new groups were formed to be deployed at the dis- cretion of the German High Command, Kampfgeschwader der Obersten Heeresleitung Nr. 1 und Nr. 2 (roughly, General Headquarters Battle Groups 1 and 2). They were equipped with a sec- ond generation of bomber aircraft, the so-called Kampflugzeug (Battle Aircraft). The first of these was the A.E.G. series of twin- engine bombers, which in their most produced form, the A.E.G. G II, were powered by two 220-horsepower Mercedes engines, had a top speed of ninety-nine miles per hour, and could carry up to 660 pounds of bombs. (Manfred von Richthofen flew as an observer/gun- ner in an A.E.G. G II early in his career, and suffered his first wound when he accidentally stuck his hand into the propeller.*)  At about the same time that General von Hoeppner had decreed that the Zeppelin offensive was counterproductive, a new aircraft emerged on the scene, the famed Gotha bomber. After consider- able development, the Gotha G. IV. (G for Gros
