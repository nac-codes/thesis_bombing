von Hoeppner had decreed that the Zeppelin offensive was counterproductive, a new aircraft emerged on the scene, the famed Gotha bomber. After consider- able development, the Gotha G. IV. (G for Grossflugzeuge or large aircraft) appeared in the fall of 1916. With a wingspan of almost sev- enty-eight feet, two 260-horsepower Mercedes D IV engines, the Gotha had a top speed of eighty-eight miles per hour and a range of five hundred miles. It carried a crew of three and a bomb load of up to a thousand pounds. This was a remarkable performance, especially when one realizes that this aircraft appeared only thirteen years after the Wrights’ first flight at Kitty Hawk.  The German High Command realized that the Gotha was the instrument that could replace the Zeppelin in the British bombing  110 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  campaign. It also anticipated using even larger aircraft, the Riesenflugzeuge (Giant) bomber, in the near future. Some early types of these R-planes, as they were called, had been introduced on the Eastern Front as early as 1915, as a counter to the Russian II’ya Muromets bombers. They had undergone the long process of devel- opment to be expected in so large and complex an aircraft.  Thirty Gotha aircraft were assigned to Kampfgeschwader 3 at Ghistelles in Belgium, but stationed at a number of flying fields far- ther inland. The new unit was under the command of Hauptmann Ernst Brandenburg, in an operation code-named Turkenkreuz (Turk’s Cross). Many of the members of KG 3 were former members of the original BAO.  Brandenburg might have been played by Erich von Stroheim in a film, for his large, bald head seemed to brim with Prussian vigor and intelligence. Severely wounded in 1914, he did as so many oth- ers did in World War I when they were no longer physically able to fight in the trenches—he turned to flying as an observer. General Hoeppner personally selected the thirty-four-year-old Brandenburg to lead KG 3, giving him a crushing assig
