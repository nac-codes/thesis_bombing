lighter weights as the center of gravity moved aft. A pilot, exhausted by the strain of the long flight and combat, had to deal with a fractious tail- heavy aircraft at the most critical part of the flight, a night landing at home base. Later models of the Gotha had their wings swept back in an effort to cure the instability problem at lighter weights.  In looking at the influence of air power on history, one despairs at noting the many instances when the same general error was repeated. The Germans erred in committing the Gothas to combat over England without sufficient testing. In the next war, they would do exactly the same thing with their largest bomber, the Heinkel He 177. Both aircraft would suffer more losses to accidents than to enemy action.  Eight days later, Brandenburg struck with his Englandgeschwader again, this time against the target dearest to German hearts, London. Eighteen of twenty Gothas succeeded in attacking, killing 162, injuring 432, and inflicting almost $650,000 in damages. Ninety- four British aircraft rose in defense, but none reached the bombers before they had dropped their bombs. A few aircraft harassed the bombers briefly on their return journey, but none was damaged.  Fighters and Bombers 113  The Kaiser was delighted with Brandenburg’s efforts, personally decorating him with the Pour le Mérite, Prussia’s highest decora- tion for valor. Ironically, he was killed on his return flight to the base when the Albatros two-seat aircraft in which he was being carried crashed on takeoff.  He was replaced in late June by Hauptmann Rudolph Kleine, a highly decorated officer who had learned to fly in 1913, and had been wounded twice in air battles. Observers normally commanded German bomber units, just as it was their practice for observers to command the aircraft in which they flew. Kleine’s experience was invaluable for he was an original member of the Ostende Carrier Pigeon group.  He took the Englandgeschwader into action shortly after he
