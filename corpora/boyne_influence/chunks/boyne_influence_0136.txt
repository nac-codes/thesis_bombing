mand the aircraft in which they flew. Kleine’s experience was invaluable for he was an original member of the Ostende Carrier Pigeon group.  He took the Englandgeschwader into action shortly after he arrived, bombing Harwich and Felixstowe on July 4. It was not until July 7 that twenty-one Gothas infuriated all of Great Britain by a “parade march” over London. Parliamentarians and newspaper edi- tors were absolutely outraged by the insolence of the Germans, and the apparent inability of the British defenses to prevent raids. This time the force of twenty-two Gothas killed 57, injured 193, and caused more than $1,025,000 in damage.  Yet despite the furor in the newspapers, British defenses were improving, and 108 sorties were mounted. The Gothas were engaged both on their inbound and outbound routes, and one was shot down, by an Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8 flown by Lieutenants Frederick Grace and George Murray. Gothas shot down two Royal Flying Corps aircraft.  At this point both sides had begun to achieve their goals. The British were forced to recall two squadrons from the Western Front, including the crack No. 56 Squadron, home to many leading British aces. The raids had so unsettled the British public that a subsequent raid on the coastal town of Felixstowe caused a panic in London. Yet the British warning system was falling into place, and both antiair- craft and interceptor aircraft efforts were improving.  This was not enough for the press or the government, and the clamor continued. On the German side, the basic flaw of the Gotha—extreme tail-heaviness at lighter weights—was working against it, for four Gothas crashed on landing. The total of five losses represented a loss rate of 24 percent, which was clearly unsustain- able.    114 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  Just as the Luftwaffe was forced to do in the waning days of the Battle of Britain, in September 1940, the Imperial German Air Force turned (temporarily, it was thought) from day bombing to
