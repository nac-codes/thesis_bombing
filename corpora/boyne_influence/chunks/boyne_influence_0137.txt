HISTORY  Just as the Luftwaffe was forced to do in the waning days of the Battle of Britain, in September 1940, the Imperial German Air Force turned (temporarily, it was thought) from day bombing to night bombing in September 1917.  The reason was simple: British defenses had improved remark- ably, but the performance of a later version of the Gotha, the G.V., had not. Flying at night permitted flight at lower altitudes, saving both time and fuel, and increased the problem of the British defenses by an order of magnitude. Finding a great behemoth of a Zeppelin at night was not easy; finding a much smaller aircraft was almost impossible. Navigation was somewhat more difficult for the Germans, but given that the bombs were to be dropped indiscrimi- nately, there was not much difference in the bombing accuracy.  Four Gothas made the first night raid on September 3, against Chatham, killing 132 naval recruits and injuring another 96, but causing only about $20,000 in damage. This was the most effective use of a Gotha against a military target to date. The next night, nine Gothas raided London, dropping 6,000 pounds of bombs, killing nineteen, injuring seventy-one, and causing about $230,000 in dam- age. One Gotha was lost.  The entrance of the United States into the war on April 6, 1917, had galvanized the German High Command, which realized that it must win the war before millions of American troops arrived to make that goal impossible. The optimistic predictions that the United States would “darken the skies with aircraft” would prove to be totally unfounded, but in 1917 the German High Command took it seriously, and launched the Amerikaprogramm. Undertaken at the request of General Hoeppner, the Amerikaprogramm called for an increase of forty pursuit units and seventeen training units. Aircraft production was to be increased to 2,000 per month, with aircraft engine production set at 2,500 per month. They were to have a priority second only to U-boats, which were nee
