training units. Aircraft production was to be increased to 2,000 per month, with aircraft engine production set at 2,500 per month. They were to have a priority second only to U-boats, which were needed to imple- ment the unrestricted submarine warfare policy upon which Germany now rested its hopes.  Such a program also meant a vast increase in the production of machine guns, instruments, bombs, and all other elements of equip- ment. The massive requirements of the previous production accel- eration, the Hindenburg program, had exhausted stocks of many critical materials, including rubber, aluminum, copper, zinc, gasoline,  Fighters and Bombers 115  and coal. This increase meant that materials for the new aircraft program had somehow to be squeezed out of the supplies previ- ously destined for other industries supplying the Army with can- nons and other munitions, and by wholesale substitutions of one material for another.  Despite the many difficulties, the Amerikaprogramm was gener- ally successful, while, as has been noted, the American production program was not. The net effect of the Amerikaprogramm was to make life much more difficult for English and French units during late 1917 and for most of 1918.”  Among the materials that suddenly came into short supply was seasoned wood. This was before the era of kiln-dried wood, and there was no ready way to accelerate the process. The use of unsea- soned lumber, along with new equipment requirements, adversely affected the weight of both the later model Gothas and the new and formidable Riesenflugzeuge (giant aircraft.)  The Riesenflugzeuge—the “R-planes”’—were large aircraft, with several designs being built by several companies. The most pro- duced and best known was the Staaken R.VI, the largest aircraft to fly in World War I, with a wingspan of 138 feet, five and one-half inches, and loaded weight of 25,269 pounds. Four Mercedes D. IVa engines were installed in tandem pairs, relatively close to the fuse- lage ce
