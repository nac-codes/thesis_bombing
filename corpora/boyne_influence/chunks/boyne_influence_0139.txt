rld War I, with a wingspan of 138 feet, five and one-half inches, and loaded weight of 25,269 pounds. Four Mercedes D. IVa engines were installed in tandem pairs, relatively close to the fuse- lage center line. It might be noted that the Heinkel He 177, the largest German bomber to fly over England in World War II, had a wingspan of only 103 feet.  The Staaken R.VI had a top speed of a little over eighty miles per hour, but it could reach almost ten thousand feet in altitude in a lit- tle less than an hour, and had a flight duration of seven to ten hours, depending upon engine installation.  The R-planes were not just simply a bigger Gotha. Instead they were the product of a well thought out plan to have a versatile air- craft that could carry a reasonable amount of bombs over a long distance, or a large amount of bombs over shorter distances. The German specifications called for the R-plane to have the capability to remain in the air for several hours, with large loads. To assure that it could so, it was to be equipped with multiple engines, navigation and bombing equipment, and guns for defense. Where necessary fuel tanks could be substituted for bombs. Two pilots, with dupli- cate controls, were called for along with a radioman and an engineer  116 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  to attend to the engines. These, in some designs, were to be accessi- ble so that minor in-flight repairs could be conducted. Considerable thought was given to ease of maintenance and the time required for engine changes and loading and unloading bombs.*  In general, had the same degree of thought and planning that went into the design, development, and employment of the R- planes been duplicated by Luftwaffe planners in the 1930s, Germany would undoubtedly have had better bombers with which to fight the Battle of Britain.  The maturity of the R-plane design and the general disposition of its engines and bomb loads made it easier to fly than the Gothas. This fact was evident in
