ategy in World War II by establishing a tradition of courage and proficiency that would be echoed in Bomber Command.  Initially the Independent Force was the VIII Brigade renamed, including a day wing (the Forty-First) with three squadrons and a night wing (the Eighty-Third) with three squadrons. This force    120 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  would grow over time, and less suitable aircraft (such as the very obsolete F.E.2b and the unsatisfactory D.H. 9a) would be replaced with more efficient aircraft.  Trenchard dedicated the force to attack as many industrial centers as he could reach with the equipment at hand. As a part of his plan he intended to gain air superiority by attacking German airfields. He chose railways as the target of first importance, followed by steel mills.  A third decision was made to increase the number of squadrons from 108 to 200, with the majority of the new units being equipped with new bombing aircraft. No less than seven hundred de Havilland D.H. 4s were ordered. The D.H. 4 was a two-seat aircraft with a superb performance. When powered by the 250-horsepower Rolls-Royce Eagle, its 119-miles-per-hour top speed was faster than all German fighters. It had a ceiling of 16,000 feet, a range of 300 miles or better, and could carry up to 460 pounds of bombs. With a fixed forward-firing machine gun and flexibly mounted twin guns in the rear cockpit, the D.H. 4 was formidable. It did have some flaws—the pilot and observer were separated by a fuel tank, making communication difficult and fires easy. Unfortunately, many of the D.H. 4s were cancelled in favor of an “improved” model, the D.H. 9, which had development problems that were not solved until late 1918. With these (and other) aircraft, British bombing efforts would skyrocket in 1918. In Sir Douglas Haig’s triumphant dispatch, “The Advance to Victory,” he notes that the Royal Air Force dropped 5,500 tons of bombs between January 1 and November 11, 1918.”  The initial relatively
