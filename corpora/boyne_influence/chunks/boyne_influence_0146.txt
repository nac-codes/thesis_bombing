8. In Sir Douglas Haig’s triumphant dispatch, “The Advance to Victory,” he notes that the Royal Air Force dropped 5,500 tons of bombs between January 1 and November 11, 1918.”  The initial relatively modest British bombing efforts did not derive from any shortage of combativeness, for as early as 1914, Murray Sueter had gone to the thirty-year-old Frederick Handley Page asking for a “bloody paralyzer” of an aircraft, one that could wreak havoc on German cities. It was not the most specific expres- sion of requirements, but the young aircraft manufacturer had long believed in the inherent advantages of large aircraft and responded with the Handley Page 0/100, a twin-engine biplane that was slight- ly larger than the German Gotha, and had a better performance, thanks to its 250-horsepower Rolls-Royce Eagle II engines. In an event which would reoccur with some frequency during World War IL, the third 0/100 built landed in error behind German lines, pro- viding the enemy with a glimpse of the latest British technology. Approximately fifty-six 0/100s were built for the RNAS. They were    Fighters and Bombers 121  used for night raids, usually one aircraft at a time. More important, however, the 0/100 had been sufficiently developed to serve as a basis for a night bomber that the Royal Flying Corps could use to match the raids by the Gothas and the R-planes.  With a minor redesign and the installation of new, more power- ful Rolls-Royce engines, the 0/400 emerged. This four-place heavy bomber had a wingspan of 100 feet, weighed 13,360 pounds fully loaded, had a top speed of 97.5 miles per hour at sea level, and could carry up to 2,000 pounds of bombs. While quite a handful to fly, it was far more pleasant in the landing regime than the Gotha.  The German night raids of September 7, 1917, convinced the British that night bombing was an effective way to wage war, and the number of 0/400s ordered was increased to four hundred. Production 0/400s did not reach Trenchard’s Inde
