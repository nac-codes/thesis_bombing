ber 7, 1917, convinced the British that night bombing was an effective way to wage war, and the number of 0/400s ordered was increased to four hundred. Production 0/400s did not reach Trenchardâ€™s Independent Force until the spring of 1918. The British were at the same disadvantage as the French in terms of reaching German targets. There was no hope of retaliating by bombing Berlin with the 0/400, but there was in the works an even larger aircraft, the V/1500, intended to do exactly that.  It was possible to bomb German cities, however, and two 0/400s of No. 215 squadron attacked Mannheim on the night of August 25- 26, 1918, with the Badische chemical works as the target. With immense daring, the lead 0/400, piloted by Captain W. B. Lawson, glided through searchlights and antiaircraft fire, dropping down from five thousand feet to only two hundred feet in order to bomb and strafe. The low attack had a unique advantage: the searchlights were so depressed that they illuminated the target area. In the meantime, Lieutenant M. C. Purvis attacked from five hundred feet.* Their daring would be recaptured in such World War II attacks as the Dam Buster raid.  The majority of attacks on Germany took place after the forma- tion of the Independent Force, so the following statistics are rele- vant: in a total of 675 raids, of which 446 were at night, 14,208 bombs were dropped on German targets. There were 746 killed, 1,843 injured, and $6,000,000 damage done.  It is interesting to compare these totals with the combined totals of German airship and bomber raids on Great Britain. Taken together, the Germans made 103 raids, dropped 7,776 bombs, killed 1,414, and injured another 3,416. Property damage amount- ed to $14,675,000.  122 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  Before noting the conclusions that were drawn by the respective sides, there are two situations that must be mentioned. The first is that Germany made its best effort in both the Zeppelin and the air- craft bombing
