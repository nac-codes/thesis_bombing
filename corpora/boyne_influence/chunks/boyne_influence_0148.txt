the conclusions that were drawn by the respective sides, there are two situations that must be mentioned. The first is that Germany made its best effort in both the Zeppelin and the air- craft bombing campaigns, and elected to stop those efforts when losses and costs became prohibitive for the results being obtained. It was also the German assessment that the British air raids did not achieve results commensurate with the effort required for them, and that the fall-off in German production and the effect upon German morale was too slight to be taken seriously.”  In contrast, Great Britain had not yet made its best effort in bombing Germany, and would not have been able to do so until 1919 at the earliest. Thus while it discounted the effects of the German air raids on Great Britain, it had a great, if unfulfilled, belief in the long-term efficacy of British air raids on Germany.  Both nations, of course, were making judgments on far too little evidence, and this fact should have been evident to them. If, on an ordinary “quiet” day on the Western Front, 2,500 could die, and if, on a “busy” day, there could be as many as 80,000 casualties, the combined total of 2,160 killed in almost five years of bombing should have obviously been discounted as militarily insignificant. In terms of material costs, both nations spent every day more than the total damages caused by bombing of both sides, so this fact too should have been seen in its proper light.  Yet it was not. Instead, this situation, in which Germany did not believe in the value of strategic bombing, and Great Britain did, would have profound influence on the political events of the next twenty years, as well as upon the military events of World War II. In Chapter Four we will find perhaps the strangest aspect of this remarkable misunderstanding in which German politicians would use the British perception of the effectiveness of bombing against both Great Britain and France—and French and British politicians would
