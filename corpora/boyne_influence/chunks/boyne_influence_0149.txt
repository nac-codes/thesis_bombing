remarkable misunderstanding in which German politicians would use the British perception of the effectiveness of bombing against both Great Britain and Franceâ€”and French and British politicians would help them do it.  Chapter Four  Growth of Air-Power Theory  As rapid as the buildup of the air forces of the combatant coun- tries had been, and as pervasive and important as their newly creat- ed aviation industries were, the end of the war brought about a rapid demobilization that literally erased air power from the grasp of England, the United States, Russia, and Italy. France did not demobilize quite so rapidly, and remained for many years the pre- mier air power in Europe.

The precipitous demobilization was both a psychological and a budgetary reaction. All nations were sick of the slaughter of the Great War, and all nations, with the exception of the United States, were virtually bankrupt because of the vast expenditures of the pre- vious five years. There were internal factors within the services oper- ating as well. When an army is reduced in size, fewer general officers are needed. Those that remain are naturally jealous of their position and their prerogatives, and stay fiercely loyal to their original branch of service.
