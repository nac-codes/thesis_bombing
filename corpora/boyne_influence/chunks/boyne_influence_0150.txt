efited from the fact that its severely limited armed forces were under the control of a man with exceptional vision, Generaloberst Hans von Seeckt. Though not an airman, he knew that air power might be fallen Germany’s saving grace.  During World War I the combatant nations expanded their air forces from a tentative gathering of nondescript aircraft flown by  124 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  amateur sportsmen to huge numbers of highly specialized aircraft, filled with special equipment and flown by highly skilled airmen. A mirror image of this change occurred in the increasingly sophisti- cated aviation industry, where plants grew by orders of magnitude, became more specialized, and produced highly skilled designers and managers.  From this titanic effort there also emerged several people who became identified as exponents of air power, the thinkers whose experience and insight led them to define separate philosophies of air power. The most famous of these were Guilio Douhet, Hugh Trenchard, and William (“Billy”) Mitchell. Their philosophies would be debated for the rest of the century, and would be influen- tial with those studying and creating air-power doctrine.  Of these three men, Mitchell was the most important in shaping air-power doctrine as it emerged in World War II. In spite of the intense way in which their writings have been analyzed for the past eighty years, those of Douhet and Trenchard for the most part had little real effect upon events. (Only about half of Command of the Air has ever been translated into English, and the first general edition in English did not appear until 1942.) It must be noted that it was not Mitchell himself who effected doctrine so much as a handful of his devoted followers. This was an essential difference. As time pro- gressed, Douhet had no such core of former subordinates who assumed positions of influence, and while Trenchard had many loyal supporters in the RAF, events dictated against their fulfilling his
