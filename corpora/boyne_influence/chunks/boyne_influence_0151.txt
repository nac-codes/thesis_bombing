pro- gressed, Douhet had no such core of former subordinates who assumed positions of influence, and while Trenchard had many loyal supporters in the RAF, events dictated against their fulfilling his not very explicit doctrine as he had conceived it.  Mahan, in his Influence of Sea Power upon History, identifies six con- ditions affecting the sea power of nations. They include the following:  1. Geographical Position. This is far more important as a condition for sea power than for air power, because air refueling now gives intercontinental range.  2. Physical Conformation. Again, this is far more important for sea power than air power. To Mahan, physical conformation included the seaboard of a country, with its harbors and other facilities for naval power. Because air power takes place in the third dimension and cannot be “landlocked,” such things are less important.  3. Extent of Territory. This was much more applicable to air power in its early days; Germany had a much better position in World War I because of the extent of its empire. In more modern times, pre-1967  Growth of Air-Power Theory 125  Israel was a remarkable contradiction. Its tiny amount of territory, surrounded by enemies, was difficult for its ground forces to defend. Curiously, Israel’s small area was an advantage to its air force, which could attack enemy territory in an almost 360-degree sweep, losing no time over its own territory.  4. National Character. While a more sensitive issue in today’s polit- ically correct world, national character plays the same role in air power that it does in sea power.  5. Character of Government. This factor is applicable to air power as it is to sea power.  Mahan was not the only philosopher of sea power, and more recently, the works of Sir Julian Corbett (1854-1923) have been raised as a standard of comparison. In essence, Corbett concurred with Mahan’s views on these points:  —Command of the sea is vital.  —Weaker powers must depend upon commerce raiding.
