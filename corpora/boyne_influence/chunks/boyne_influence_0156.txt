Robert Scott who was Commandant of the Central Flying School, and who suffered so badly from war injuries that he had to be lifted in and out of the cockpit.  There is an immutable saying in the military that what goes around comes around, and it proved true in the case of Sir Frederick Sykes, the man who had eased Trenchard out of his posi- tion as Chief of the Air Staff. It happened that Churchill did not care for Sykes, and when the latter submitted a postwar budget pro- posal calling for 154 squadrons that would cost 75 million pounds annually, he was “promoted” to the position of “Controller of Civil Aviation.” To replace him, Churchill turned to a man of his own fighting stripe whom he had known from his days in India, Major General Hugh Trenchard. He requested Trenchard to prepare a plan showing his vision of the peacetime RAF.  Trenchard did not come willingly. He had been offended when Sykes had displaced him as CAS, effectively demoting him from commanding all of the Royal Flying Corps to commanding only a small percentage of it, the Independent Force. Yet he did not feel it honorable to participate in replacing Sykes in the same manner that Sykes had participated in replacing him. Nonetheless, Churchill liked the short, eight-hundred-word plan that Trenchard presented, and insisted that he take the position.’ In doing so, Churchill saved the Royal Air Force from being reintegrated into the Army and the Navy, which would otherwise almost certainly have been the case if anyone but Trenchard had commanded the truncated RAF.
