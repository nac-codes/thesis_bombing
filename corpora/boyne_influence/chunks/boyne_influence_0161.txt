during the latter part of Trenchard’s term, and in the following five years. While it is difficult to believe in ret- rospect, France was considered to be the prospective enemy for many years after World War I. The feeling was based in part on the absence of Germany as a threat, in part on the many years of warfare between France and England over the previous two centuries, and in part because France had voted to double the size of its air force.  Trenchard and his staff knew just how limited the capability of the French Air Force was for conducting a powerful surprise attack. Yet he did nothing to quiet fears, for those fears were his only hope of  132 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  expanding his budget. This same phenomenon would recur in every country: knowledgeable airmen would encourage reckless claims about an enemy’s potential ability to inflict damage, not because they believed them, but because they knew those claims were necessary to obtain a larger budget. Mitchell did this repeatedly in the United States.  One fortunate result of the misapprehension about the French threat was the establishment of the RAF fighter bases in the south- eastern part of England. These became vital during World War II against another enemy.  By 1934, Germany had replaced France as the prospective enemy, but the world was gripped in a global depression that kept budgets limited in the democracies. Great Britain was hampered by the “Ten Year Rule,” initiated by the Committee of Imperial Defense in 1919, and renewed each of the following years. Churchill advocated the Ten Year Rule, which called for defense spending in any one year to be reviewed on the assumption that there would be no European war for the next ten years.’  No such rule restrained Hitler, who since the Enabling Act of March 24, 1933, had dictatorial powers. Thus it was that while Great Britain fought the depression by cutting back on defense spending, Germany fought the depression by spending billions
