, the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire. These aircraft departed completely from the  134 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  previous World War I biplane standard, being cantilever-wing monoplanes with enclosed cockpits and retractable landing gear.  With these new aircraft the effect of brilliant individuals is best shown. The Hurricane was the design of Sidney Camm, while the Spitfire was the product of the genius of Reginald J. Mitchell. The Merlin engine was the product of a large Rolls-Royce team, but was refined and improved by the ideas and leadership of J. E. Ellor and Stanley G. Hooker. The massive eight-gun armament packages were the result of the advocacy of Wing Commander A. T. Williams and Squadron Leader (and later Air Marshal) Ralph S. Sorley, who rec- ognized that a speeding bomber would present a fleeting target and a large number of hits would have to be made in just a few seconds.  Let us focus on this one development for a moment to see just how difficult it was to sell. First it went against tradition—most air- craft in the past had employed two machine guns, and all the design specifications, not only for airframes, but for synchronizing gear, gunsights, structural load criteria, and so forth, would have to be revised to accommodate to the new concept. In addition it meant quadrupling the number of machine guns ordered, and doing the same for ammunition, machine gun belt-links, and all of the ancil- lary equipment required. Now each of these individual considera- tions represented what today is called a “rice bowl,” that is, each one was monitored by people who had budgets, traditions, perks, etc., that were threatened by the change. To effect such a change was not a matter of mere suggestion; it meant intense politicking to get to the desired goal. And under the severely limited budget, success in getting these goals accomplished could be achieved only at the cost of the goals of another organization.  And so it was with all
