Unlike Trenchard, but like Mitchell, Douhet had no patience with standard military practice, and abused his position as commander of the aviation battalion by ordering his friend Caproni to build several of his three-engine bombers.”  There is no evidence to suggest that there was anything but mili- tary altruism in Douhet’s action, but the incident was perceived as an opportunity to shut him up, and he was reassigned to a mundane position as Chief of Staff to an army division in 1914. The Italian military hierarchy of the time must have been of a forgiving nature, for his misbehavior did not affect his promotion path, and he became a colonel the same year.  For the next two years, Douhet continued to write and to upset military protocol, a not uncommon occurrence with air-power the- orists who had what they believe was a pure glimpse of the future, and had difficulty making their superiors understand it.  In his early writings, Douhet postulated the one belief held by all    138 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  philosophers and practitioners of air power, that command of the air must be secured. He later defined this belief as follows:  To have command of the air means to be in a position to wield offensive power so great it defies human imagination. It means to be able to cut an enemy’s army and navy off from their bases of operation and nullify their chances of winning the war.

This is the meaning of the “command of the air.”"*  This is a remarkably prescient statement, one which was perhaps not completely validated until the Persian Gulf War, but which w
