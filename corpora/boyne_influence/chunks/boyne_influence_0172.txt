be a multi-purpose “battle-plane” able to make long-distance bombing raids carrying a great weight of explosives, and able to defend itself against any enemy fighters that might attack.  In retrospect, it is obvious that much of his thinking was incorrect, as indeed it was proved to be over time. He may have known this himself, and may have taken extreme positions just to garner the  140 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  maximum publicity possible for his basic theories. Further, he used incorrect data upon which to base his theories, having very opti- mistic ideas about the number of bombers that would be available; the number of bombs needed and the distance they could be car- ried; the accuracy of the navigation and bombing; the damage cre- ated by a bomb; the number of fatalities per bomb dropped; and, most of all, the fragility of the will of the people being bombed.  Italy was perhaps the best country to rely entirely upon Douhet’s principles, given that it would possess an army that seemingly was doomed to lose most of its campaigns and a navy that preferred con- voy duties to open battles with the Royal Navy. Italy’s dictator, Benito Mussolini, was an advocate of aggression, if not specifically of Douhet’s theories, and he embraced aviation as representing the best of Fascist Italy. He learned to fly, and was often pictured at the con- trols of a Regia Aeronautica aircraft, very much the modern dictator.  Italy lacked resources, but if it had taken Douhet at his word and reduced its conventional forces, it might well have been able to build up a strong strategic air force in the 1920s and 1930s.  Unfortunately, the Five Factors affected Douhet’s theories even more than they did those of Trenchard’s in Great Britain. Italy was desperately poor, and building a huge air force would have meant that the Italian Army and Navy would have been reduced almost to zero. This was politically impossible, particularly given the royalist backing of those services.
