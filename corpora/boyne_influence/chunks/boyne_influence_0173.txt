ng a huge air force would have meant that the Italian Army and Navy would have been reduced almost to zero. This was politically impossible, particularly given the royalist backing of those services.  Douhet, unlike Trenchard or Mitchell, was further handicapped by not having a strong following of young officers who took his the- ories to heart, and were willing to risk their careers to do so. Instead he began and ended as an outsider, a one-man-band irritant whose arguments became more shrill and repetitive as time went on. General Amedeo Mecozzi, who advocated tactical aviation, with emphasis on the support of Army operations, vehemently opposed Douhet. Mecozzi had great influence on Field Marshal Italo Balbo, the charismatic leader of the Regia Aeronautica.”  In consequence, the Italian Air Force, far from becoming the instrument of Douhet’s philosophy, instead became, essentially, a defensive arm subordinate to both the Army and the Navy. And for Italy, technology was not a spur but an anchor, because Italy was unable to develop a modern engine industry comparable to other major nations, and its aircraft designs suffered accordingly.

National politics was Italy’s greatest disaster. It utterly failed to perceive its real threat, Germany, and instead embraced it, which required Italy to turn on France and Great Britain, and ultimately become involved in war with the Soviet Union and the United States.
