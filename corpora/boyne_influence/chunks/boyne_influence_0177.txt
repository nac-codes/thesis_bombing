embraced Trenchard’s concept of aircraft as offensive weapons, and of the absolute need for air supremacy, ideas he had demonstrated in the Battle of Saint Mihiel.  He began to publish his ideas while in the various command posi- tions he held in France. Like Trenchard and Douhet, he would modify them over time. Unlike them, he was susceptible to the sug- gestions of both his mentor, Trenchard, and to those of his staff, especially of the relatively unsung Major Edgar Gorrell, who was in the invidious position of being friends both of Mitchell and his archrival, Foulois.

A veteran, with Foulois, of the First Aero Squadron during its Mexican expedition against Pancho Villa, Gorrell had a master’s degree in aeronautical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at a time when such degrees were rare indeed. Employed as a member of the Bolling Commission that was tasked to review European aircraft for pro- duction in the United States, he stayed on to run the Technical Section. One of his many achievements there was the formulation of a plan for both tactical and strategic bombardment that con- tained many of the ideas Mitchell later espoused.    144 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  As a young lieutenant colonel, Gorrell worked directly with Trenchard and French General Maurice Duvall, and laid the groundwork for United States cooperation in the Independent Force that Trenchard would command. Gorrell was named Officer in Charge of Strategical (sic) Aviation, a position he held until January 1918."*  Mitchell’s first recorded comments emphasized strategic bom- bardment in mass formations. He then switched to tactical bomb- ing, with the concept of first obtaining air supremacy so that the Army could subsequently be give
