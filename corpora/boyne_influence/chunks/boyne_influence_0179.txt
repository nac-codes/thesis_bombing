Mitchell knew that he could never prevail over the top leadership in either the Army or the Navy, so he laid out a path that led him to his greatest heights—and ultimately to his court-martial. He became a popular figure as a witness at Congressional hearings,    Growth of Air-Power Theory 145  made fiery speeches, and wrote inflammatory articles on his ideas of air power.  By telling an economy-minded congressional committee that “1,000 bombardment airplanes can be built and operated for about the price of one battleship,” he forced the United States Navy into agreeing to the famous bombing tests off the Virginia Capes, upon which Mitchell’s reputation would rest, and which would provide him the platform to speak out on other issues later." The Navy was not averse to bombing tests, having suggested them as early as 1919, but it did not wish to have Mitchell dictate how the tests would be conducted.  Mitchell knew that his theories were being tested by the bombing tests, and he supervised both the preparation and the execution of the tests with his customary intensity. It may well have been that this dedicated effort that won Mitchell the fierce loyalty of his subordi- nates helped insure the execution of his philosophy during World War II.  Mitchell organized a task force of Martin, Handley Page, and Caproni bombers, and assembled and trained the air and ground crews who maintained them.

Mitchell blamed the crash on the general lack of meteorological, radio, and navigational facilities, and was almost court-martialed for doing
