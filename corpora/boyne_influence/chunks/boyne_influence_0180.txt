himself and six men fly- ing with him in a Curtiss Eagle. Mitchell blamed the crash on the general lack of meteorological, radio, and navigational facilities, and was almost court-martialed for doing so.  Mitchell trained his crews in bombing and directed operations from the air at the tests, which began on June 21, 1921, and used obsolete American vessels and captured German ships as targets. It should be noted that like politicians arranging a debate, both the Navy and Mitchell attempted to tilt the rules in their respective favor as much as possible. After a series of successful but unspectac- ular tests on a German submarine and destroyer, Mitchell’s Martin bombers made history on July 18 by sinking a German cruiser, liter- ally lifting the Frankfurt out of the water with their bombs.  The big event came sixty miles off the Virginia Capes with the attacks of July 20 and 21 on the German dreadnought Ostfriesland.  146 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  The Ostfriesland was built in the style of the Imperial German Navy, whose leader, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, demanded “unsinkable gun platforms.” He saw to it that his capital ships had heavy armor and many watertight compartments, and Ostfriesland had survived the British shells and mines at Jutland. A war prize, it was commis- sioned in the United States Navy as the USS Ostfriesland.  Mitchell had a powerful audience, for watching the tests were Secretary of War John W. Weeks, Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby, General of the Army John (“Black Jack”) Pershing, and Major General Charles T. Menoher, who would have been delighted to court-martial Mitchell for any number of reasons. Also watching were the military attachés of many foreign countries; for some of them, the bombing would have deep meaning for the future of their own navies.  The attacks of July 20 did not do much damage, but on July 21, Mitchell sent in his Martin MB-2 bombers with 1,100-pound bombs, two of which struck the battleship. Later in
