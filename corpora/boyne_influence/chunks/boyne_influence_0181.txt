ture of their own navies.  The attacks of July 20 did not do much damage, but on July 21, Mitchell sent in his Martin MB-2 bombers with 1,100-pound bombs, two of which struck the battleship. Later in the day, eight Martins and three Handley Page 0/400s attacked, with the 2,000-pound bombs that Mitchell had personally monitored as they were being built. Mitchell ordered that the bombers try for near-misses, believ- ing this to be the most damaging method of attack. Two bombs were dropped, one striking the side of the Ostfriesland to explode about twenty-five feet away, as near a miss as could be desired.” The ship sank within twenty-one minutes, and Mitchell now had a lifetime platform from which to trumpet his ideas. The tests would also have a profound effect on the development of both land-based and naval aviation, and these in turn would have profound effect upon the histories of nations.  The Joint Army and Navy Board analyzing Mitchell’s success found that aircraft added to the dangers the Navy faced, but did not make battleships obsolete. It noted, almost as an aside, that the test proved the need for aircraft carriers and effective antiaircraft equipment.” This might well have been the most important result of the tests, for the Navy became even more air minded than it had been. It established the Bureau of Aeronautics in 1921 under Admiral William A. Moffett, who would become one of Mitchell’s canniest opponents. The tests also help convince “battleship admi- rals” to accept the conversion of two battle cruiser hulls (both slated for the scrap pile under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty) into the magnificent aircraft carriers Lexington and Saratoga.    Growth of Air-Power Theory 147  (American naval air power would enjoy a similar serendipitous situ- ation with the advent of the intercontinental nuclear bomber, which at first seemed to render aircraft carriers obsolete. It soon developed, however, that many large, nuclear-armed carrier groups were a
