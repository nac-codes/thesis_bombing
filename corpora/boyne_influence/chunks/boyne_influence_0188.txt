of the United States Air Force, General Carl A. (“Tooey”) Spaatz; Medal of Honor-winner Brigadier General Kenneth Walker; and many others.  The remarkable thing about the loyalty of these men is that they did indeed suffer from Mitchell’s court-martial. After he was con- victed, their next assignments induced many to think that their own careers were over. But they persisted, and they kept Mitchell’s ideas alive, the most important of which was the consistent, unwavering pressure for an independent air force. They were able to present his ideas as doctrine at the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS), and in doing so created several generations of leaders who believed that the bomber and not the fighter—as important as it was—was the primary weapon. Unfortunately they did not perceive that this belief was a near-catastrophic error, one that brought the United States Army Air Force perilously close to defeat in 1943.  Offsetting this error, these same ACTS graduates were in the for- tunate position of being leaders at a time when budget, production capacity, and technology all came together in a manner never seen before. The United States was producing about 3,000 aircraft per year in 1939; by 1944, it was producing larger and more complex aircraft at the rate of 100,000 per year. Pilot training increased from a few hundred pilots a year in 1939 to hundreds of thousands by 1944. And the nation that lagged technologically behind almost all major powers in 1939 had, by 1944, leaped to a position where it would secure air supremacy in all theaters of war.  Mitchell was not highly regarded as a pilot by some, even though he established a world’s absolute speed record of 222.93 miles per hour in 1922 in a hot Curtiss R-6 single-seat racer—not a task for an  152 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  amateur. And he was pilot enough to realize that his Martin MB-2 bombers lacked the range, speed, and instruments to be as effective as he claimed they would be. Yet he also kne
