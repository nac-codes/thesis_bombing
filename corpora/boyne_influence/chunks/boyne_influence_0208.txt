ine aircraft were in the works. No coherent policy of long-range strategic bombardment had evolved, but the concept of using aircraft as an essential part of army ground forces was firmly implanted, which would be enough to defeat Germany in the long run.  Japan  The Japanese did not develop a unified theory of air power for a number of reasons, but by far the most important was the intractable division between the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The bitter hostility of these two services, which con- tinued until the very last day of World War II, completely ruled out the thought of an independent Japanese Air Force with a strategic mission. Instead there grew up a Japanese Army Air Force and a  166 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  Japanese Navy Air Force, each one subordinate to the service to which it belonged.  The Five Factors of air-power theory have different applications here. Japan was an impoverished country, and its large military bud- get was an onerous burden for its population to bear. Both the Army and the Navy viewed air power as a supporting arm, and each pro- vided as much of the budget to its air arm as it thought necessary. Japan’s major—or at least, most radical—air theorist, Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue opposed this viewpoint, calling for an indepen- dent air force much in the manner of Billy Mitchell. For a Navy man, this was heresy, for he even advocated a naval air force that did not depend upon aircraft carriers, but depended instead on long- range, land-based bombers and flying boats. An admiral much more familiar to Americans, Isoruku Yamamoto, also believed that the Navy spent far too much on building big battleships. (Note: Japanese usage calls for the family name to be given first, Yamamoto Isoruku, but the English usage will be applied to Japanese names here.) Yamamoto was politically much more influential than Inoue, and was able to see to it that Japan had a powerful carrier force.  Japan was acutely aware
