ed him greatly.  Permitting Lindbergh to fly the 109 was an extraordinary gesture at a time when first-line fighters were veiled in secrecy in all countries. In addition, flying a foreign high-performance aircraft carried with it the possibility of an accident with its consequent diplomatic problems. Yet allowing Lindbergh to fly was a psychological masterstroke, for it con- veyed the message that the Germans were willing to back up their extensive propaganda campaign on the Luftwaffe with proof.  As important as Lindbergh’s intelligence reports were to the United States, the informal reports he made to his many friends in France and England were perhaps even more influential. Intending to spur those nations to a greater effort in building new and better aircraft for defense, he discouraged them when he communicated his beliefs that the German Air Force was greatly superior to the combined British and French air forces. Further, it was his assessment that German bombers had the capability to deliver the proverbial great blow that could  174 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  destroy London, Paris, or Prague. While it is impossible to measure the exact effect of these statements, his expert testimony did much to undermine the already softening Anglo-French resistance to Hitler’s demands.  The great racing and stunt pilot, Al Williams, had a slightly dif- ferent experience. He brought his famous orange Grumman Gulfhawk biplane to Europe, where it was flown by the incompara- ble aerobatic pilot, Ernst Udet. Williams was given excellent treat- ment, although not to the degree provided Lindbergh. He made a very detailed analysis of the German manufacturing process, and also flew the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter, which he proclaimed to be the finest he had ever flown.‘ Williams’s analysis was important primarily to professionals in the aviation business. Politically, he was not much more sophisticated than Lindbergh, maintaining isola- tionist views right up to the
