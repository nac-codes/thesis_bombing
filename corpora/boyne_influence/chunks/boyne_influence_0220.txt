Messerschmitt, Junkers, and Heinkel factories. On one occasion, Milch arranged for every flyable German fighter to be flown to one airfield where Vuillemin was making a routine and quick stop. The visitor was allowed to assume that it was just an ordinary airfield filled with the usual number of aircraft. Other, more elaborate, hoaxes were per- petrated, and the general went back to France convinced that France could not withstand a German assault for as long as a week.’ (Some French historians minimize the effect of Milch’s tricks on Vuillemin, but the essential fact remains that even without any propaganda, Vuillemin could only have concluded that France’s air force was totally inadequate when compared to the Luftwaffe.°)  Hitler was determined to play upon these successes, and, under his guidance, Goering and Goebbels systematically inflated the apparent strength of the Luftwaffe. The German Air Force was blooded in Spain, as we shall see, and had acquired a truly menac- ing reputation by 1938, enabling it to serve as a decisive instrument in the peacetime acquisition of new territories for Germany.  Germany used the threat of air power in three major political events, each one having a unique personal touch by either Hitler or Goering, and which more than any other depict the influence of air power upon history. In March 1938 Hitler delegated the diplo- matic coercion of Austria to Goering, who promptly put the Luftwaffe on war footing. Its first task was implicit: to deliver, if required, “a bolt from the blue” to Vienna, and to threaten the same to London and Paris.

Its sec- ond and much more achievable task was to shower Austria with leaflets calling for its populace to resist its own government, which was headed by Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg. In the event, only the second effort was required, for Goering managed to manipu- late both Austrian le
