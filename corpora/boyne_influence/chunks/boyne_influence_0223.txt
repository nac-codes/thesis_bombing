e Czech for- tifications, manned by a determined Czech army of some thirty-four divisions and backed by a surprisingly strong if obsolescent air force, completely upset the balance of power. Poland was now isolated and was unquestionably Germany’s next target, despite Hitler’s protesta- tions that he had no more territorial demands in Europe.  The threat of air power had been tellingly effective. Let us look now at the actual use of air power in four very different conflicts, where the actual use of air power was as effective as the threat of its use.  Great Britain and Air Control in the Middle East  One of the legacies of the Allied victory in World War I was the addition of entirely new and rarely profitable obligations in con- trolling areas of the former Ottoman Empire that were mandated by the new League of Nations to France and Great Britain. This arti- ficial and unwelcome division of the lands of the Middle East stemmed from the Anglo/French secret 1916 Sykes-Picot Treaty in which the areas of Mesopotamia and Palestine were allocated to Great Britain, and those of Syria and Lebanon to France. These reflected both pre-war spheres of influence and the contemporary desire to protect the routes to existing colonial territories. There were also the first faint whiffs of interest in the potential petroleum resources of the region.  These areas represented a burdensome military expense to both countries, and both sought to find ways to fulfill their responsibili- ties to the League of Nations at a lower cost in money and blood.  The first experience with what became known as “air control” took place in Somaliland, where since 1899 the forces of Sayyid Muhammad Tbn Abdulla Hassan had been carrying on a jihad against British rule. Termed the “Mad Mullah of Somaliland,” Hassan was the contempo- rary equivalent of modern terrorist leaders. A number of conventional land campaigns to rout him were unsuccessful, and the Great War in Europe in 1914 drew British attention
