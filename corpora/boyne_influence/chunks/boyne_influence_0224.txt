Hassan was the contempo- rary equivalent of modern terrorist leaders. A number of conventional land campaigns to rout him were unsuccessful, and the Great War in Europe in 1914 drew British attention from the area. In 1919, however, Great Britain was determined to restore its order and prestige—but did not wish to spend the millions of pounds necessary to do so. Air    178 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  Marshal Hugh Trenchard saw the occasion as a chance to find employment for the RAF, and offered a plan to use aircraft in con- cert with the more typical ground forces mounted on camels.  On January 20, 1920, in a style that would be followed subse- quently by others, Trenchard’s de Havillands dropped leaflets that delivered an ultimatum to the Mullah. He responded by making himself a target, bravely putting on new robes and sitting beneath a white canopy. The British responded to his defiant gesture by drop- ping a bomb that accidentally spared the Mullah, but killed his uncle. The Mullah fled with his troops, and a three-week campaign in which aircraft aided conventional forces ensued. Fortune then intervened, for the Mullah fled to Ethiopia where he very conve- niently died the following year.  The RAF could claim that it had achieved success in a three-week campaign that cost an estimated 77,000 pounds. Contemporary esti- mates showed that a conventional campaign would have cost perhaps 5 million pounds. Not seen as important at the time, but of great importance only a few years later, was the fact that the de Havilland D.H. Yas and Bristol F.2Bs had killed relatively few of the tribesmen, and inflicted little of what today would be called “collateral damage.”  Military jargon is constantly reinventing itself, and in the early 1920s the popular term was “substitution,” meaning the substitution of air power for tasks previously assigned to ground forces. The con- cept was soon expanded. The RAF, still flying obsolescent and ill- maintained aircraft from
