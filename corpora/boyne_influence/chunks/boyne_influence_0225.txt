bstitution,” meaning the substitution of air power for tasks previously assigned to ground forces. The con- cept was soon expanded. The RAF, still flying obsolescent and ill- maintained aircraft from World War I, became a fire brigade, attempting, and sometimes succeeding, in bringing resisting tribes- men to heel in the Middle East and in India. On October 22, 1921, the Air Ministry was given responsibility for Mesopotamia. It was allocated eight squadrons of bombers and a small contingent of mounted troops for the task. The technique was soon extended to Aden, Sudan (where anti-slavery patrols were flown), and Trans- Jordan, and to India’s Northwest Frontier.  According to the RAF War Manual of the period, the object of air control was to interrupt the normal life of the enemy to such an extent that a continuance of the hostilities became impossible. In Sir John Slessor’s words, air control was an “inverted blockade” in which the people were blocked out of their country instead of into it.? The success of the idea rested on the principle of communal responsibility, in which the various tribal communities were held responsible for the    Air Power and Its Influence Between the Wars 179  acts of their individual members. This concept was thoroughly in accord with local custom.  While the actual execution of air control often varied with the sit- uation, under ideal circumstances it would begin with the tribe receiving a clear explanation of what was expected of it, and when it was expected. If the tribal leaders rejected or ignored the terms, they were advised to evacuate their territory by a specific date, and given the understanding that after that date, their territory was subject to being bombed without notice. They were also advised how to submit when they had been sufficiently bombed. Before the bombing began, the tribes were given twenty-four hours notice, and bombing was halted immediately when the tribes signaled submission.  This technique was followed in
