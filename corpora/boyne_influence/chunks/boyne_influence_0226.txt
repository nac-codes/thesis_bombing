sufficiently bombed. Before the bombing began, the tribes were given twenty-four hours notice, and bombing was halted immediately when the tribes signaled submission.  This technique was followed in most but not all instances, and for the most part was an adequate formula. Using aircraft had many obvious advantagesâ€”the British could react more quickly over a larger area and with greater force than before. Yet there was another factor that was almost equally important. The tribesmen, whose lives revolved around fighting, found the aircraft frustrating, for not only could they not fight back, there were no spoils to be won. When conventional ground forces were used, there was always the possibility of an open battle with supply lines to be cut, depots to be raided, and spoils to be gained. In essence, aircraft took the sport out of traditional tribal warfare.  The success of air control varied from one situation to the next. It was extremely practical in large open areas where tribal move- ments could be followed and where RAF observers could obtain intimate knowledge of the personalities, terrain, and resources of the peoples they were trying to control. It was not possible to use air control in Palestine, which was too built up and where convention- al means of control were still required. It has transpired that despite the fact that air control was not attempted in Palestine, it is some- times described as an example of the concept.  It may be that the principal success of the air control idea was in keeping the Royal Air Force in being without any further reductions in size, and in furnishing realistic experience in the employment of air power that no training exercises could have provided.
