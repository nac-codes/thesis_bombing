The Chinese were unable for many years to put up any mean- ingful sustained resistance to the Japanese Army and Navy air forces, even though they invested considerable sums in foreign equipment, and had the assistance of units of the Red Air Force equipped with first-line Polikarpov I-15, I-15bis, and I-16 fighters. In 1938, four squadrons of fighters and two of Tupolev SB-2 bombers were on hand, manned by 350 Russian “volunteers” commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Stepan P. Suprun. The thirty-one-year-old Suprun would score eight victories against the Japanese, and in 1941, four more against the Germans, before being shot down." In addition, the Russians provid- ed about 400 I-15s and I-16s for the Chinese to fly. Most of these were destroyed on the ground or in accidents.  Initially, the Soviets flew in all-Russian units; later, in the practice that they would follow in Spain, there were mixed Russian-Chinese units, and in the case of bombers, even mixed crews. About two hundred Soviet aviators were lost in China, although almost half of these losses were incurred while the aviators were passengers being flown to or from the combat area. The Russians claimed eighty-one aerial victories, although these have never been substantiated.  Things did not always go well between the two allies, for the Chinese resented what they considered meddling by the Russians, and the Russians took a dim view of Chinese stubbornness, poor training, and failure to care for valuable assets. The result was that in the sum- mer of 1938 the Russians temporarily ceased to fight, withdrawing to their tents like Achilles. The same problem reoccurred in 1939, and the Soviet pilots were withdrawn in 1940, although some advisors remained to conduct training. The Soviets continued to deliver air- craft through April 1941, by which time they had supplied
