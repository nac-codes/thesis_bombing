pilots, blooded in the Spanish Civil War (see below), and, over time, the Soviet Air Force seized command of the air and decisively defeated the Japanese Air Force. It also provided effective close air support for the Soviet ground forces. These extended battles were distinguished by the introduction of the RS-82 rockets for air-to-air work. These were used all during World War II, sometimes also for close air support. They prefigured the use of unguided R4M rockets on the Messerschmitt Me 262, and the hailstorm of 2.75-inch Mighty Mouse rockets fired in salvos of twenty-four by the Lockheed F-94 and North American F-86D interceptors. Later and far more sophis- ticated guided rockets owe a debt to the RS-82s as well.  Victory claims, as always, were exaggerated, but the scale of the fight- ing is indicated by the Soviet claim of 589 aircraft destroyed in the air and 87 on the ground, while admitting a loss of 207. The Japanese claimed 1,269 Soviet aircraft, while admitting a loss of 168 of their own.  The basic fact of the matter was that the Japanese were com- pletely outsmarted by Zhukov, who used his intelligence resources to great effect. In the course of a series of battles, the Japanese lost some 25,000 killed.  The results of these Soviet/Japanese encounters were far-reach- ing. The Japanese were delighted to be able to disengage from bat- tle, and their Army commanders came to two decisions. The first was that the Soviet Army would have to be defended against, meaning  184 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  that large numbers of Japanese troops would be tied down in Manchuria. The second, and far more important decision, was that future expansion of the Japanese Empire should be to the southâ€” and not to the north against the formidable Soviet Union. Thus the Japanese Army was reluctantly forced to sanction the course of action that had previously been recommended by its bitter rival, the Japanese Navy. (The same bitter rivalry had also resulted in the
