the Japanese Army was reluctantly forced to sanction the course of action that had previously been recommended by its bitter rival, the Japanese Navy. (The same bitter rivalry had also resulted in the par- allel development of Japanese Army and Navy aircraft, without any of the collaborative effort that would have helped both services in research, production, maintenance, and logistics.)  The full intercontinental political consequences of the Japanese decision to avoid conflict with the Soviet Union and instead move toward the resources of Southeast Asia would not be realized until December 1941. It was then that Stalin learned from the master spy, Richard Sorge, that the Japanese were not going to attack the Soviet Union with their strong Kwantung Army. The Soviet dictator then withdrew ten divisions from Asia, along with a thousand tanks and a thousand aircraft, enabling him to begin the counter-offensive that almost cost Germany the war that very winter.'â€˜ Had the hotheads of the Japanese Kwantung Army won their air and land battles with the Soviet Union, there is almost no doubt that they would have taken advantage of the great German victories of the summer and fall of 1941 by attacking to the north. If they had done so, the Soviet Union would almost certainly have had to conclude peace in 1942, leaving Germany master of Europe and Japan still a threat to Southeast Asia.  Japan drew two vitally incorrect conclusions concerning its air forces from the battles with the Soviet Union. First, it did not rec- ognize that it needed air forces organized on a vastly larger scale, with a tremendous increase in first-line strength, in production, and in training. The second was that with the current strength of its air forces, Japan was going to be able to fight the United States and Great Britain even though it had already decided that it could not fight the Soviet Union.  Part of this error in decision-making stemmed from the inter-service competition that permeated th
