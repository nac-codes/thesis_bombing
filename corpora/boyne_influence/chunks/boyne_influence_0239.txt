n and 350 planes served over the course of the war. Some 298 members of the Kondor Legion were killed, and another 1,000 were wounded by the time the war ended.  Although it took Mussolini longer to make up his mind about committing armed forces to Spain, when he did, he did so dramat- ically, sending three divisions totally 45,000 men, 2,000 artillery pieces, and 750 aircraft. Ultimately, more than 100,000 Italian troops and 6,000 Italian airmen would serve in Spain. More than 3,000 would die in the Spanish Civil War, including 174 airmen."  The German/Italian intervention on behalf of the Nationalist forces was offset in part by the supply of aircraft and materials from France and the Soviet Union. The French government of Premier Leon Blum was sympathetic to the Loyalist cause, and sent a miscella- neous bag of about forty aircraft to Spain, under the nominal and idio- syncratic leadership of writer-philosopher Andr√© Malraux. Malraux was neither a pilot nor a soldier, but he had an international literary reputation and espoused the Loyalist cause. The value of the French equipment was much diminished because it arrived without arma- ment, and supplies of spares were soon cut off when Britain and France were pressured into an arms embargo of the conflict.  It was far different with the Soviet Union, which very much wanted to see the Loyalist government remain in power, and, in exchange for the Spanish gold reserves, sent about eight hundred aircraft to Spain during the course of the war. The aircraft included 155 I-15s, 62 I-15bis,  Air Power and Its Influence Between the Wars 189  287 I-16s, and 96 SB-2 bombers, all first-line aircraft in the Soviet Union. Also sent were some 3,000 people, including 772 pilots, some of whom arrived before their equipment and warmed to the task by fly- ing missions in obsolete French-built Breguet and Potez aircraft of the Spanish Air Force. The Soviet Union also licensed the production of another 229 fighters (I-15s and I-16s) in
