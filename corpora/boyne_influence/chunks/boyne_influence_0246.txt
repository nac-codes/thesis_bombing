absolutely amazing is that the outbreak of World War II did not see a single attempt at what politicians and the public had dreaded for so many years—the all-out surprise aerial assault on the capital cities. Not only did the combatants not launch the proverbial “bolt from the blue,” they assiduously avoided any sign that they might do so.  The reason for this decision is obvious now. Although each of the combatant nations knew that it did not have the capability to launch such a blow, it could not be sure about the enemy. Therefore strate- gic aerial activity was confined to bombing purely military targets— and this on a limited basis—and to dropping propaganda leaflets, all to avoid possible retribution. Some even considered bombing mili- tary targets as “not quite cricket.” A member of the English Parliament objected to attacks on the armament factories in the Ruhr on the sacred Tory grounds that they were private property.  There is a further anomaly, given the pervasive agreement among both the philosophers and the practitioners of air power in all coun- tries that air superiority, that is, command of the air, was the sine qua non of modern warfare. Despite this general understanding, no nation except the United States went to the extraordinary lengths  194 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  necessary (and they were extraordinary in terms of time and money as well as aircraft quality and quantity) to achieve air superiority. Other nations merely balanced air superiority requirements with others for bombing, close air support, reconnaissance, and home defense, with the result that they were unable to sustain more than a temporary, and often just a local, air superiority in individual campaigns.  Germany, as we will see, established air superiority in its early campaigns against weaker opponents, but fell far short of doing so against its first major opponent, Britain. And while it obtained ini- tial air superiority over the Soviet Union and sustained that
