campaigns against weaker opponents, but fell far short of doing so against its first major opponent, Britain. And while it obtained ini- tial air superiority over the Soviet Union and sustained that air superiority for a considerable period of time, it ultimately lost out there as well. Failing to win air superiority over Britain cost Germany its best chance to win the war. Failure to sustain it against the Soviet Union brought Germany down to a catastrophic defeat.  Britain fell short in terms of air superiority throughout the war, including even the Battle of Britain, where it was fortunate to have just sufficient strength to deny air superiority to the Germans. Isolated from the continent, and with a tremendous reluctance to engage in another European land war with the German Army, Britain chose instead to create a huge night-bomber force that inflicted tremendous but indecisive harm while suffering terrible casualties.  The Soviet Union achieved air superiority at long last and only inadvertently, after a war on too many fronts had worn the Luftwaffe to the ground. Japan had maintained air superiority over a hapless China, but was unable to compete with the Soviet Union. It would establish air superiority over Britain and the United States in the Pacific in late 1941 and early 1942, but by 1943 would be in a hope- less position in the air.  Even with brilliant planning and exceptional production efforts, the United States did not achieve decisive air superiority until late in the war. The United States had to endure years of conflict in which it suffered humiliating defeats and suffered severe losses before reaching the state where it could exercise true air superiori- ty. In the following analysis of the first two years of the air war, air power will be seen almost always to be influential, if not decisive, on the outcome of battle, if not necessarily always on history.  It is important to note that air power, as defined by its advocates, was exercised in ever
