t always to be influential, if not decisive, on the outcome of battle, if not necessarily always on history.  It is important to note that air power, as defined by its advocates, was exercised in every theater, but it was not until after 1943 that the bombing campaigns of the RAF and the USAAF combined at last  The Search for Air Power, World War IT, 1939-41 195  to fight the air war on the apocalyptic scale envisioned by Douhet, Trenchard, and Mitchell.  The Early Battles  Historians now generally agree that the one-year reprieve from war provided by the infamous 1938 Munich conference was vital to Britain, enabling her to bring the Royal Air Force to greater strength with more modern aircraft. It is less generally noted that the same year enabled Germany to expand greatly the industrial base of the Luftwaffe, and allowed for the construction of many more airfields for use against possible campaigns in both the East and the West. The Luftwaffe was also able in the one-year interval to remedy some—but far from all—of the training problems that had saddled it with both a high accident rate and a relatively low in-commission rate (the number of aircraft actually available for operations).  Goering had announced on October 14, 1938, a plan for a five- fold increase in the Luftwaffe.’ It is interesting to note the bureau- cratic response in what most people considered a monolithic total- itarian German state, and compare it with the corresponding response to President Roosevelt’s May 16, 1940, call for the produc- tion of 50,000 aircraft annually. In Hitler’s dictatorship, the Technical Office responded that while nice in theory, increasing German aircraft production by a factor of five was too expensive, unfeasible in any case, and would demand far too much aviation fuel to be considered practical. The Technical Office submitted a program that called for the production, in four years time, of about 20,583 combat aircraft. In the democratic United States, not yet at war
