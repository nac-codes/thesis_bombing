o be considered practical. The Technical Office submitted a program that called for the production, in four years time, of about 20,583 combat aircraft. In the democratic United States, not yet at war, the industrial response to Roosevelt’s request was so enthusias- tic that by 1944 aircraft were being produced at the rate of 100,000 per year. There was of course a substantial difference in American and German industrial capacity, but the fact that German produc- tion reached more than 40,000 aircraft annually by 1944, after years of bombing, shows that much more could have been done from 1938 on had Germany possessed a willing bureaucracy.  Contending forces wracked the German aircraft industry. Massive expansion and unprecedented funding were counteracted by a con- tinual shifting of production programs. Worse was the interference from top leaders and, inevitably, shortages in skilled labor, key  196 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  materials, and components. The result was that in August 1939, Germany had a monthly production of 427 combat aircraft—or an annual rate of just over 5,000. This rose slightly to about 700 per month after the war began. Part of this increase came from factories acquired in Czechoslovakia and Austria.*  In terms of first-line strength, Germany had increased its air-crew training and the number of aircraft available for combat in the year after Munich. The totals rose from 2,928 aircraft and 1,432 fully trained crews in October 1938 to 3,750 aircraft and a surplus of trained crews by September 1939. Pilot training had peaked at between 10,000 and 15,000 pilots per year, each of whom received from 200 to 250 hours of excellent flying training before being post- ed to an operational unit for further seasoning.’  In terms of equipment, at the outbreak of the war the Luftwaffe was in superb shape compared to other air forces in the world. It had adopted the Messerschmitt Bf 109 as the standard single-seat fighter and was introducing
