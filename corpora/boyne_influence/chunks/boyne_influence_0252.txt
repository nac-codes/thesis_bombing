lish governments continued to downplay aviation. In the four years before the war, the Polish cavalry received twice as much of the tiny defense budget as did aviation.’  On September 1, 1939, some 1,600 German aircraft struck Poland. Contrary to most accounts, the Polish Air Force was not eliminated at once, for just before the outbreak of war, all Polish combat units were transferred to forty-three operational airfields  198 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  that had been prepared in secret, and were stocked with food, ammunition, and fuel. The main operational bases became, in effect, decoy targets.  Because of the disparity in numbers and in the quality of the air- craft of the two air forces, and especially because of a lack of a com- munications network, Poland offered only a token air defense after the first week of the war. After that time Germany obtained com- plete air supremacy, even though Polish fighters still took a toll of Luftwaffe liaison planes.  The Soviet Union took advantage of the situation on September 17 to advance to the lines of demarcation previously agreed to by Hitler and Stalin in their infamous nonaggression pact of August 1939, depriving the Polish forces of an opportunity to survive longer by a retreat to the east.  On September 25, General Wolfram von Richthofen conducted the first of the terror-bombing attacks of the European war. German bombers dropped six hundred tons of bombs on Warsaw, cruising like tour buses over the prostrate city. Even obsolete Junkers Ju 52/3ms were brought into play, their crews shoveling incendiary bombs through the cargo doors. Some 1,150 sorties were made, reducing the city to rubble,’ while German artillery poured in an avalanche of shells. An infantry attack followed, and two days later the city fell.  The P.A.F. had been wiped out, losing 333 aircraft, 83 percent of its total fleet. Thirty percent of its flying personnel and 22 percent of its ground personnel were lost in the first two weeks
