,000 aircraft per year was adequate. Of the 9,000, only about half were combat types. Either unknown to the Luftwaffe High Command, or ignored for political reasons, British aircraft production had already reached German levels and plans were to increase it significantly in the years to come. A subtler, but perhaps more far-reaching, error came in February 1940, when Field Marshal Goering, confident of victory, stopped all work on aircraft projects that could not be finished in time for use in the war. Among those projects were the new jet engines from Heinkel and Junkers, and new jet fighters from Heinkel and Messerschmitt. Had an adequate number of jet fighters been available in 1943 (as they could have been, given appropriate resources for research and production), the air battles over Europe in 1943 and 1944 would almost certainly have resulted in a decisive German victo- ry. If so, the Allies would not have been able to launch the June 6, 1944, invasion, and the war in Europe might have gone on for several more years. Other “what-if” possibilities from this scenario include a separate peace between the Soviet Union and Germany, and the first use of an atomic bomb on Germany rather than on Japan.  When the German May 10 offensive was launched, the Luftwaffe had 4,050 first-line aircraft, including 1,300 long-range bombers (with some of the new Junkers Ju 88As), 380 dive-bombers, 860 Messerschmitt Bf 109s, 250 Messerschmitt Bf 110s, 640 reconnais- sance planes, 475 transports, and 45 gliders. Of these, about 2,750 participated in the attack.'*  The methods of their use would show the stunning effect of the innovative use of air power. The German parachute troops had a tremendous shock effect that unsettled both the Dutch and Belgian armies, and the brilliant glider assault on Fort Eban Emael amazed the world. The Dutch surrendered in five days, the Belgians in eight. Taken together, the two techniques seemed to confirm the myth of Luftwaffe invincibility, as well
