ssault on Fort Eban Emael amazed the world. The Dutch surrendered in five days, the Belgians in eight. Taken together, the two techniques seemed to confirm the myth of Luftwaffe invincibility, as well as the French predisposition to believe that their air force would not survive a German assault.  In comparison, the French Air Force possessed 5,026 planes, of which 2,176 were positioned to meet the German thrust. Of these 1,368 were considered front-line equipment. Only 637 fighters were available.” In addition, there were now ten squadrons of RAF Hawker Hurricanes, with about 160 aircraft. Ultimately twelve of  206 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  the RAF’s total of forty operational fighter squadrons would be sent to France, and when more were asked for, the head of RAF Fighter Command, Air Chief Marshal Hugh (“Stuffy”) Dowding, would memorably refuse.  A three-to-one ratio is usually preferred for offensive operations, so these numbers show that quantitatively it was not too unequal a contest. As the Bf 110s would not prove to be adequate in fighter-ver- sus-fighter combat, there were 860 German single-seat fighters arrayed against 797 Allied. Unfortunately, there was a pronounced difference in quality. The French Morane-Saulnier M.S. 406 and Curtiss Hawk 75 were substantially inferior to the Bf 109E that now equipped the majority of German single-seat fighter units. The Hurricanes were only marginally inferior to the Bf 109E, and in their combats the decision usually went to the better (or least surprised) pilot. The general introduction of the Bf 109E was extremely impor- tant, for it was greatly improved over the D model and contributed much to the Luftwaffe’s overwhelming success.  The greatest difference came in morale, where the French were deficient. It was generally known that defeatism was extensive in the French Air Force, not least because of the continual problems with fit- ting production aircraft with armament and equipment, but most of all
