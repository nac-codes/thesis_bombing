French troops frequently proved unequal to the strain, breaking and running at the appearance of the Stukas over the battlefield.  The Germans, in just sixteen days, had effectively won the Battle of France. Goering now tasked the Luftwaffe to destroy the Allied forces before they could be evacuated. Exhausted from the cam- paign in France and the Low Countries, and with ill-prepared fields from which to operate, the tired Luftwaffe nonetheless managed to mount almost two thousand bomber sorties over the seven-day peri- od of the evacuation.  It was not enough, and the German Air Force suffered its first defeat over Dunkirk. Spitfires, flying out of Britain, bested the Luftwaffe and provided the air cover that permitted the operation to succeed. The British put up a slightly smaller number of fighter sorties, but inflicted ninety-two losses, while losing ninety-seven of their own aircraft. The victory came not in the relative exchange, but in the fact that the British were able to evacuate 338,000 British, French, and Belgian troops.  The fighter-versus-fighter conflicts had been conducted at high altitudes, and the very troops that the RAF saved were unaware of the great aerial victory. Instead, once safely back in England, they castigated RAF flyers for their “absence” over Dunkirk.  With the bad experience of Dunkirk behind them, the Germans turned to finish off the French, who still had more guns and tanks than the attacking Nazis, but were completely overwhelmed by the Luftwaffe.
