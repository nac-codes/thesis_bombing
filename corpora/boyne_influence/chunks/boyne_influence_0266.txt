lost 90,000 dead, 200,000 wounded, and 1.9 million captured or missing. The Germans had about 195,000 casualties, with 30,000 dead.”  While the losses on the ground were one-sided, the air battle of France had been extremely costly to both sides. The Germans lost an  The Search for Air Power, World War IT, 1939-41 209  estimated 1,279 aircraft between May 10 and June 20, including 500 bombers and 300 fighters. The French lost 757 aircraft in combat, while the RAF lost more than 900, including 453 fighters.

The effect of these losses would not be fully recognized until the Battle of Britain, where a still weary and weakened Luftwaffe was given the task of overcoming a Royal Air Force that was in the process of rebuilding.

Germany might well have won the war against France even if neither side had an air force, but it would not have done so in such a swift, spectacular manner.

Dowding could now turn his attention to building up the RAF fighter force to face what Winston Churchill had already termed the Battle of Britain.  There were a small number of professional German military men who called for an immediate assault on the United Kingdom. Their argument was that as tired as the German armed forces were, the British were in a far worse state, for the equipment of thei
