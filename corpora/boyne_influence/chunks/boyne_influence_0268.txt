production was increasing, and the RAF was becoming more adept at returning damaged aircraft to service.”  The delay was an equal blessing to the Luftwaffe, which had lost 36 percent of its force (counting severely damaged aircraft) since April 9, when the fighting began in Norway. It had expended 30 per- cent of each category of bombers, dive-bombers, and Messerschmitt Bf 110s. The Bf 109 fighters had lost 19 percent of their number. Within these losses was concealed a terrible German characteristic of excessive zeal which was to haunt the Luftwaffe throughout the war, and contribute significantly to its ultimate demise. Some 213 Junkers Ju 52/3m transports had been destroyed out of a total of 531 employed. Many of these had been pulled from training bases, and were flown by instructor pilots, whose loss was impossible to make up in the short run. Over the course of the war, Nazi zealots made the same mistake, time and again, sacrificing instructors to “imperative” operational missions and refusing to realize the vital necessity of keeping a viable training system going. This cannibalization of the instructor pool combined with a growing fuel shortage resulted in the decay and eventual death of German flight training.  Among the many titanic battles of World War II, there were only two upon which the direction of the war hinged and that were decided by air power. The Battle of Britain was the first of these, and the Battle of Midway was the second. There were vast differences in these two bat- tles, for Midway took place over a four-day period in which the most important activity was concentrated in just a few hours.    The Search for Air Power, World War IT, 1939-41 211  In contrast, the Battle of Britain began in July 1940 with pecking attacks against English Channel shipping. It built slowly but with increasing ferocity until it reached a decisive crescendo on September 15—now celebrated as Battle of Britain Day in the United Kingdom—before settling down into a
