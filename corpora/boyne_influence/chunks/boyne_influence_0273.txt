d— they simply worked around them. It was different in the Battle of Britain, in which he personally called off attacks on the radar sta- tions as ineffective, and in which he personally dictated that German fighters fly close escort with the bombers, thus giving away all their advantage in speed and maneuverability. There was no way to deny the results of the daily losses, or the damaged aircraft bringing back  214 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  badly wounded crew members. Most important, there was no way to deny that every day the RAF still rose to fight. (Inexplicably, the USAAF would make the same mistake with its fighters as did Goering until the arrival of Lieutenant General James Doolittle to command the Eighth Air Force.)  The Reichmarshall’s problems were compounded because he was given extremely bad information by Colonel Joseph (“Beppo”) Schmid, the superbly optimistic head of the Luftwaffe intelligence section. Unfailing in overestimating RAF losses, Schmid continually failed to identify profitable targets for Luftwaffe sorties. He predict- ed the demise of the RAF so regularly and so often that it became a joking matter. Despite his failure as an intelligence chief, Schmid went on to other posts in which he served surprisingly well, includ- ing that of commanding the air defense of Germany.  On the British side, Hugh Dowding clung slavishly to his plan to sur- vive by defeating the Luftwaffe in the air, allowing radar to direct his carefully hoarded fighter squadrons to attack German formations at precisely the point of greatest advantage. He watched his declining strength with despair, but knew that he had some advantages. His fight- er production was accelerating and although his pilot pool was declin- ing, those who safely parachuted from their aircraft could be returned to combat. He reluctantly turned to the use of more pilots from Bomber and Coastal Commands, and to the use of Polish and Czech pilots. Dowding was pleasantly surprised by
