aircraft could be returned to combat. He reluctantly turned to the use of more pilots from Bomber and Coastal Commands, and to the use of Polish and Czech pilots. Dowding was pleasantly surprised by how successful they were.  In the end, the piece of drama that saved the RAF and Great Britain came about as a legacy of the two-decade-long fear of the bombing of capital cities. On August 24, German bombers en route to strike Rochester became lost and dropped bombs on London by mistake—the first since the last Gotha raid on May 19, 1918. Churchill had been waiting for just such a faux pas and had placed Bomber Command on standby to bomb Berlin within twelve hours of a strike on London. The RAF sent eighty-one aircraft, twin- engine Hampden, Wellington, and Whitley bombers, to Berlin. As Churchill had hoped, the raid angered Hitler, and he ordered reprisal raids on London, beginning on September 7.  The effect of these raids on London was severe, with many casualties and much property damage. But the effect on Fighter Command was miraculous, for they had been removed as the Luftwaffe’s primary objective, and were now able to concentrate on attacking the German  The Search for Air Power, World War IT, 1939-41 215  bombers. The initiative of battle had been handed gratuitously by Hitler to the RAE, which did its job so well that the Germans were ulti- mately forced to shift to night attacks, with the consequent loss of accuracy. It was the beginning of what the British would call “the Blitz.” RAF Fighter Command had been saved, and within weeks it would be obvious that the Battle of Britain had been won.  Beppo Schmid’s continuous recalculations of the day that the RAF would finally be broken was shifted at last to September 15. But it was the Luftwaffe that had been broken, for on that date it could manage an attack only by 277 bombers, in three separate waves— hardly a saturation effort, and one the British were more than pre- pared to meet. Thirty-five bombers were sh
