for on that date it could manage an attack only by 277 bombers, in three separate waves— hardly a saturation effort, and one the British were more than pre- pared to meet. Thirty-five bombers were shot down, along with twenty fighters.  The effect of this rebuff was startling, and underlines clearly just how influential air power had become. Hitler postponed the inva- sion of Great Britain indefinitely (it was to prove to be a permanent postponement), and the Luftwaffe switched more and more to night attacks, sending only the faster Junkers Ju 88s and Messerschmitt Bf 109s in fewer and fewer day raids.  The Battle Won and the Lessons Learned  The Luftwaffe lost the Battle of Britain, and with it Germany lost its best chance of winning the war. While it is true that Britain would probably not have surrendered even if it had lost the British Isles, the conquest would have left Germany in a much better position in which to deal with the Soviet Union.  The Battle of Britain was costly to both combatants. The German Air Force lost 1,733 aircraft and almost 3,000 air crew members. The RAF Fighter Command lost 1,017 aircraft and 537 pilots. Bomber Command and Coastal Command lost another 248 air- craft, which with their larger crews, cost almost 1,000 lives.”  Yet in truth, the battle turned upon personalities, and it was fortunate for the Allies that where Hitler had Goering as his air commander, Churchill had Dowding. The two men could not have been more different. Goering was a sycophantic toady to Hitler. He suffered from morphine addiction and had been a patient committed to the Langbro lunatic asylum in Sweden. Goering was vain, impa- tient, indifferent to the casualties of his forces, and vindictive in his  216 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  messages to them. The Reichsmarshall still possessed the outlook of a World War I fighter pilot captain, and was unable to understand either the scope of the battle or its many variables. Even after the Germans had be
