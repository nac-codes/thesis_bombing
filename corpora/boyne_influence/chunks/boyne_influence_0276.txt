The Reichsmarshall still possessed the outlook of a World War I fighter pilot captain, and was unable to understand either the scope of the battle or its many variables. Even after the Germans had been engaged in battle for weeks, and despite the fact that Germany possessed its own radar system, they did not fully appreciate just how Fighter Command was using radar against them.
