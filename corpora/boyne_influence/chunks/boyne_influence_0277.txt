in in sharp contrast, Dowding was unceremoniously sacked on November 24, 1940, and replaced by Sholto Douglas. He was given no recognition upon leaving Fighter Command or upon his subsequent retirement. In May 1943, he was made Lord Dowding of Bentley Priory, a small reward for a man who led so brilliantly those few to whom so many owed so much.
