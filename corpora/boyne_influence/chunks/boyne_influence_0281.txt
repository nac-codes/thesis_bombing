rience, better training, and higher morale. After that point, the Voyenno-vozdushnye sily (VVS), the Soviet Air Force, increasingly held air superiority as it grew in numbers, quality, experience, train- ing, and, most important, morale.  The turning point may be said to have occurred during the Battle of the Kuban, the April 17 through June 7, 1943, struggle in the North Caucasus. It was there that the Luftwaffe mode of operation was changed from doing what it wished to do offensively to doing what it had to do to provide support to the German Army.  The Luftwaffe had experienced a remarkable resurgence after the debacle at Stalingrad, where, at the end, it could put up only 350 sorties a day against thousands by the Soviets. By April 1943 it was capable of a thousand sorties a day and more. Total Luftwaffe numbers had reached a peak for the war, with six thousand aircraft, but only twenty-five hundred of them could be allocated to the Eastern Front, and of these, only about six hundred were fighters.  The VVS had also grown in strength, with large numbers of Lend- Lease aircraft available, including Douglas A-20s, Bell P-39s, and Supermarine Spitfires. It had as well its own new Yakovlev fighters, and most important, it was also supplied with the greatest close air support aircraft of the war, the Ilyushin II-2 Shturmovik. Artillery has always been a favorite instrument of Russian policy, and the Red Air Force used the II-2 as a formidable piece of flying artillery. Stalin had    222 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  sent a message to the factories producing it saying that the “II-2 is as needed by the Red Army as air or bread . . . | demand production of more II-2s; this is my last warning!” Stalin’s threats were never ignored, and more than 36,000 Il-2s were built. They were extreme- ly effective in destroying German armor and personnel.  The Soviet and German air forces were, for almost the last time, fairly evenly matched in numbers over the Kuban, but
