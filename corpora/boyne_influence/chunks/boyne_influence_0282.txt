built. They were extreme- ly effective in destroying German armor and personnel.  The Soviet and German air forces were, for almost the last time, fairly evenly matched in numbers over the Kuban, but for the first time the VVS adopted new tactics that demonstrated newfound skills that startled the Luftwaffe.  The huge Kuban ground battle involved hundreds of thousands of troops but eventually ground down to a stalemate. When the ground battle was over, the air war was evaluated, and it was found that the Russians had lost 2,800 aircraft to “only” 800 of the Luftwaffe. Yet the 3.5-to-1 exchange ratio was a Pyrrhic victory for the Luftwaffe, for the VVS could sustain its losses much more read- ily than could the Germans. In 1942, the Germans had produced 15,409 aircraft for use on three fronts (the Soviet Union, North Africa, and the defense of the Reich). In that same year the Soviets had produced 25,240 for one front, and had in addition 3,000 Lend-Lease aircraft provided to them.  It was now apparent that the Soviets had long understood the scale of operations that air power required to be effective, and that, because of their previous successes, the Germans only now became aware of the need. Germany had already begun a massive produc- tion program under the leadership of Albert Speer, Minister of Armaments and War Production, but it would not only be too little and too late, it would be conducted under the disruptive effects of the very aerial bombardment it was supposed to prevent.  The Germans would make one further attempt to regain the ini- tiative on the Eastern Front, at the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. Kursk, a small city some three hundred miles southwest of Moscow, was the site of a huge salient in the German lines. Hitler wished to pinch off this bulge, measuring some 100 miles deep and 150 across, in the hope of spoiling the imminent Soviet summer offensive. The Red Army intelligence immediately became aware of his intention, and an elaborate fortress
