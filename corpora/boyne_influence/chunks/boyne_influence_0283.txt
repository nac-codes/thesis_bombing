suring some 100 miles deep and 150 across, in the hope of spoiling the imminent Soviet summer offensive. The Red Army intelligence immediately became aware of his intention, and an elaborate fortress was prepared at Kursk, with eight concen- tric rings of defense. The Soviets concentrated nine field armies, twenty thousand artillery pieces, thousands of tanks, and millions of mines within those rings. The VVS provided 2,900 aircraft for the theater, 940 of them the inimitable Shturmovik anti-tank aircraft.

The Luftwaffe stripped other fronts to amass two thousand aircraft, yet only six hundred of them were fighters, and fighters decided the outcome of the struggle.  The Battle of Kursk became the biggest tank battle in history until that time, with more than six thousand engaged, but after ini- tial successes, the German Army ground to a halt, largely due to the hordes of Il-2s that circled the German tanks like the Native Americans used to circle the immigrant wagon trains.

From Kursk on, it was fighting a death battle. By April 1945, there were some 7,500 Red Air Force aircraft positioned for the attack on Berlin, with fewer than 400 Luftwaffe fighters remaining to oppose them.  The Germans had attempted too much with too little, depend- ing upon high-quality aircraft and proficient, well-experienced combat crew members to prevail. This was enough to secure air superiority in a surprise attack against a demoralized opponent. Germany
