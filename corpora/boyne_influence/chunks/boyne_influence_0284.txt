ing upon high-quality aircraft and proficient, well-experienced combat crew members to prevail. This was enough to secure air superiority in a surprise attack against a demoralized opponent. Germany eventually realized that it had erred in planning the size of its air force and consequently in the size of its industry, training, logistics base, and so on. It attempted to recover in 1943 and 1944, and made substantial gains despite the bombing. It was far too lit- tle and far too late, for the tide of war had shifted, and it was no longer possible to catch up by any means, including advanced new technologies. In short, the Luftwaffe was initially successful, but was doomed to fail spectacularly in the end because of its leaders’ poor planning.  The Japanese Air Force would make the same mistake and meet the same fate.  A Tough Fight for Six Months  One of the least remarked upon aspects of air power is that an ill-founded confidence in its possession sometimes causes military leaders to make errors on a colossal scale. For example, Hitler might    224 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  not have invaded the Soviet Union if he had not been certain that his Luftwaffe would win and maintain air superiority for him. Evidence for this misconception may be found in his refusal to invade Great Britain for that very reason. This phenomenon, mak- ing fatal errors based on an erring confidence on one’s own air power, characterized the career of the most famous of all Japanese military men of World War II, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (1884- 1943). He would make a number of errors of the greatest magni- tude, including the conduct of the Battle of Midway, which reversed the course of the war. But because of his stature and his death in battle, he would never lose the admiration of the Japanese. Oddly enough, he is usually portrayed in admiring tones even in the his- tories of his wartime enemy, the United States.  As a young officer, Yamamoto had been wounded in the May 26-27
