At the height of the Japanese expan- sion in mid-1942, this ring ran on a line from Manchuria through coastal China to Burma’s frontier, then south along a perimeter that included the former Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. The line then went north to the Gilberts and up to Attu in the Aleutians.  The Japanese government bet its empire on the hope that this defensive perimeter, combined with the stunning defeats adminis- tered at Bataan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, and elsewhere, would convince the United States and Britain that a negotiated peace was in their best interests.  Yamamoto did indeed put up a tough fight for the first six months, seasoning the triumphal march with such remarkable feats    226 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  as the sinking of the Repulse and the Prince of Wales with land-based air power on December 10, 1941. Called Force Z and commanded by Admiral Tom Phillips, the two Royal Navy ships, with an escort of four destroyers, sailed without air cover. Phillips believed that a well-fought capital ship was able to defend itself against air attacks. He learned dif- ferently when attacked by twenty-six Mitsubishi G4M1s and sixty Mitsubishi G3M2s of the Japanese Navy’s First Air Group. Of these, thirty-four G4Ms carried armor-piercing bombs; the remainder car- ried the deadly, long-range, Type 91, twenty-one-inch torpedoes. The two huge capital ships were sunk within two hours, causing general despair in the Allied camp. The Japanese lost four aircraft.’  A flexible thinker, Yamamoto had pioneered the operation of Japanese naval air force aircraft from land bases, not confining them exclusively to carrier operations. This method of operation was to prove invaluable as the Japanese fought their way swiftly down through Southeast Asia. The Japanese invasion forces would operate under the cover of carriers, but as soon as they had cap- tured or made an airfield, naval aircraft
