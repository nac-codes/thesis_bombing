it was that even in death, Yamamoto split his forces.  Under Yamamoto’s leadership, Japan had created a small, profi- cient air force ideally suited for dealing with ill-equipped opponents such as the Chinese. It also operated well against the poorly organized and equipped American, British, and Dutch forces in 1941. Yamamoto lacked the vision and Japan the resources to match the air-power potential of the United States. This fact became increasingly evident in 1943, overwhelmingly so in 1944, and catastrophically so in 1945.  Air Power in the Mediterranean Campaigns  Ironically, as the homeland of the most famous of air-power philosophers, Italy had within its power the ability to use air power to influence history immediately upon its entrance into the war. Had the Italians applied all of their efforts to the capture of Malta in June 1940, rather than engaging in the humiliating struggles with a moribund France, it might have altered the conduct of all of the subsequent Mediterranean campaigns. With strong units of the Regia Aeronautica and the Luftwaffe based in Malta, the Mediterranean would in truth have become what Mussolini referred to as “Mare Nostrum”—our sea. This would have destabi- lized the British position in Africa and probably have convinced Spain to enter the war. It would have precluded the intervention of the British in Greece, and that being so, Germany would not have been compelled to undertake the Balkan campaign that delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union by several critical weeks. But Italy did not have the foresight—or the appetite—to take Malta in 1940, or later in 1941 and 1942 when it might still have been possible.  Instead of becoming a pivotal point in the war, the Mediterranean campaigns, despite their cost in blood and equipment, were mere  232 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  footnotes to the overall conduct of the war. To put the matter in the perspective with which Hitler regarded it, the Germans were engag- ing approxi
