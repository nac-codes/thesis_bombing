To put the matter in the perspective with which Hitler regarded it, the Germans were engag- ing approximately eight enemy divisions in North Africa at a time when they were engaging some 360 enemy divisions in the Soviet Union. There was no comparison in the critical importance of the two theaters.  The campaigns in North Africa came about as a series of whims and preferences on the part of national leaders. It was a whim of Mussolini to extend his African empire. He tried to do so by attacking with vast- ly superior numbers a small but tough British force.

He gladly reinforced the theater, for it was the only place that the British could engage the Nazi and Italian forces on anything like equal terms. It was Franklin D. Roosevelt’s preference that American troops get into battle against the Germans as soon as possi- ble, and North Africa was the most logical place to begin.

The European war was decided mainly on the Eastern Front, with great help from the Allied bombing campaign and the opening of the Western Front with the invasion of France in 1944.
