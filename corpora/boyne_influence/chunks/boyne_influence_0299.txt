ceeding the Air Service Tactical School of 1922, and the Air Service Field Officers School of 1920. The ACTS was the highest educa- tional establishment within the service at that time, and in the rela- tively small air service of the day, attendance was vital for promo- tion. This was especially true, for promotions were extremely slow, and a competent, well-thought-of officer might expect to be a first lieutenant for ten or twelve years in the ordinary course of events.  Asa result, the best and brightest sought to attend the ACTS, and if possible, stay on for a tour as an instructor. A veritable galaxy of stars was created as future general officers such as Orville A. Anderson, Frank M. Andrews, Lewis H. Brereton, Claire L. Chennault, Ira C. Eaker, Harold L. George, George C. Kenney, William E. Kepner, Hugh J. Knerr, Laurence S. Kuter, Joseph T. McNarney, Robert Olds, Carl Spatz (later changed to Spaatz), Kenneth N. Walker, and Oscar Westover attended and often taught at the school.  General Billy Mitchell’s ideas on air superiority were of course well regarded, but within a remarkably short period of time, the school developed its own concepts on carrying the war to the enemy’s capital, commerce, and industrial centers.’ These concepts did not derive from Giulio Douhet, whose influence was minimal, but from the realization that an independent service required a war- winning arm, and that could only be the bombing arm.  By 1926, the faculty at ACTS considered bombardment aviation to be the most important element of air power, replacing pursuit avia- tion. This was the beginning of a two-part fundamental error in think- ing that would dictate United States air-power policy for decades to come. The first part was the conviction that bombers were supreme- ly capable of a performance that could not be equaled by pursuit (fighter) aircraft. The second part was the consignment of pursuits to short-range interceptor duty, for the protection of American cities and coast
