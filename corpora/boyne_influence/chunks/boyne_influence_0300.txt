a performance that could not be equaled by pursuit (fighter) aircraft. The second part was the consignment of pursuits to short-range interceptor duty, for the protection of American cities and coastal defenses. This latter reflected the total lack of considera- tion given to pursuit aviation, for there was at that time no country, much less any enemy, that possessed bombers with the range to strike the United States, and thus required defense against.    The Growth of Air Power, 1941-43 235  The intellectual process moved swiftly, and by 1930 the ACTS position was that the goal of the Air Corps should be entirely strate- gic with a minimum of effort expended on the battlefield or in defensive pursuit operations. It should be noted that this view was the exact opposite of the Army as a whole, which saw to it that a large portion of the Air Corps’ budget was still spent on observation and pursuit aircraft.  In 1933, Major Donald Wilson originated what would today be called asymmetric warfare, postulating that an air campaign could strike at certain vital centers in an enemy’s economy, and thus disrupt whole industries. An intensive study was made of United States industry, with the result that transportation, steel, iron ore, and electric power were identified as the industries most susceptible to such attacks not only here but, by inference, in other industrial nations as well.  Certain technological developments confirmed the ACTS thinkers in their beliefs. The arrival of the all-metal, monoplane bomber in the form first of the Boeing B-9 and then the much more capable Martin B-10 seemed to prove that the pursuit aircraft was no longer important. The B-10 had better performance than the Boeing P-26A, at the time the “hottest” Air Corps fighter, thus con- firming the rather ingenuous view that no pursuit plane could ever be built that would have performance comparable to a bomber.
