ather ingenuous view that no pursuit plane could ever be built that would have performance comparable to a bomber. In 1933, an air umpire of the war game exercises being conducted at Wright Field, Ohio, wrote that “due to increased speeds and limit- less space it is impossible for fighters to intercept bombers, and therefore it is inconsistent with the employment of air force to develop fighters.” This judgment was immensely reinforced with the appearance in 1935 of the Boeing Model 299, the prototype of the B-17 series of bombers.  Pursuit aviation still had its advocates, most notably then-Captain Claire L. Chennault, but his attempts to prove that military maneuver rules and decisions were biased in favor of bombers were rebuffed.  In addition to the remarkable new bombers, much better bomb- sights had been developed, including the Sperry and the Norden. With the latter, it was possible, under ideal conditions, to hit small targets precisely from high altitudes. The operative words here are “under ideal conditions” which would rarely be found in combat.  By now, most of the senior officers in the Air Corps believed (just as their counterparts in the Royal Air Force did) that bomber    236 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  formations were “invincible” and that their massed firepower could beat off any fighter resistance, permitting them to penetrate to the vital centers of the enemy. They were also convinced that they could find the key targets, and from high altitude drop bombs that would destroy them. Left out of the equation were improved enemy fight- ers, adverse weather, antiaircraft artillery, masking devices (such as smoke screens), the effect of winds on the fall of bombs through dif- ferent altitudes, and many other variables, some of which were impossible to forecast. One of these was that radar would be adapt- ed to air defense requirements. Another was the surprising ability of an energetic enemy to repair damaged factories quickly, and to con-
