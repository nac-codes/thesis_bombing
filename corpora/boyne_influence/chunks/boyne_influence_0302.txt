ible to forecast. One of these was that radar would be adapt- ed to air defense requirements. Another was the surprising ability of an energetic enemy to repair damaged factories quickly, and to con- tinue production of war materials under appalling work conditions. (Machine tools, for example, were virtually impossible to destroy, and could function in factories bereft of roofs and walls.)  Curiously enough, during this entire period, none of the bomber aircraft, including the B-17, had anything approaching interconti- nental range, and all would have required nonexistent foreign bases from which to operate. The only countries against which they could have been employed otherwise were Canada and Mexicoâ€”neither of which figured in any war plans.  Thus a phantom doctrine, impossible to fulfill, took control of procurement, training, research, and attitude. The Army Air Corps became a bomber force, despite the fact that the official doctrine of the Army, as presented in Army Air Corps Field Manual FM 1-5, clearly stated that air operations were to be planned and executed in accordance with the overall strategic plan for the surface campaign.  The unofficial doctrine developed by the alumni of ACTS would prevail for the first years of the war, under the genuinely excellent leadership of those same alumni. The USAAF would suffer severely because it was essentially an amateur approach, developed in peace- time conditions and by men who lacked the experience to antici- pate the hard realities of actual warfare. And, somewhat unusually, the greatest harm came from a passive failure: they did not do the research necessary to develop a fighter with adequate range to accompany the bomber.  Some officers, such as Chennault and Major Gerald E. Brower, saw the need for a long-range fighter, and pressed for the funds to develop one. It was admittedly a difficult task and an early attempt, the Bell YFM-1 Airacuda, was a resounding failure. Unfortunately,  The Growth of Air Power,
