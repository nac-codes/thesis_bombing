needed. Unfortunately for the Eighth Air Force, the full import of its effect was not yet known. Stalin was far from satisfied, and the Eighth continued to be heavily criticized by Roosevelt, Marshal, and Arnold for not doing enough.  The Eighth’s air war over Germany was a slugging contest, much less of a technological war than the Royal Air Force’s night-bomb- ing campaign. The errors of the ACTS doctrine and the failure to discover the need for a long-range fighter now came into play, revealing the downside of an advocacy system within the services. Proponents had seen to it that the emphasis in training and pro- curement had gone to the bomber, at the expense of the fighter. As a direct result, there were no fighters available that could escort the bombers to and from targets in the German _ heartland.    The Growth of Air Power, 1941-43 243  Unfortunately, doctrine, pride, and wartime necessity demanded that the bombers attempt to live up to their billing, and on the sheer strength of their numbers and their combined firepower, undertake missions deep within Germany.  On July 24, 1943, the Eighth Air Force made a series of attacks on airfields and aircraft factories, attempting to carry out Douhet’s con- cept of destroying the enemy in his lair. The raids included the longest one to date, a 1,900-mile, round-trip sortie against targets in Norway. Also included were strikes on Kiel, Hannover, Hamburg, Kassel, and Warnemunde. Eighth Air Force Commander Eaker had 330 aircraft on strength, and in that week they flew 1,720 sorties. Of these, 1,080 struck the target, and 97 aircraft were lost, a terrible 8.99 percent of the attacking force. No less than 330 German fighters were claimed shot down. Unfortunately, the number 97 was genuine, while the number 330 was not." It was inevitable in attacks on bomber for- mations that there would be multiple claims for every aircraft shot down, more for probables, and even more for wishful thinking. Actual German losses were r
