omb Wing.  Weather intervened, and the Ist Bomb Wing took off three and a half hours late, which meant that the Luftwaffe had plenty of time to attend to both incursions. German fighters attacked continuous- ly from the point the American escort fighters left, all the way to the targets and all the way back to the point where the second wave of American escort fighters were waiting.  LeMay was in the lead plane, a Boeing B-17F of the 97th Bomb Group, and he saw to it that three hundred tons of bombs were dropped accurately on the Messerschmitt factory at Regensburg. Production was disrupted for five months, and the fuselage jigs for the top-secret Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter were destroyed. LeMay led his group on over the Alps to land in North Africa, after losing twenty-four aircraft—16.4 percent of the force.  The 1st Bomb Wing fared even worse, losing 36 out of the 183 air- craft it put over Schweinfurt, a startling 19.7-percent loss rate. The 1st did inflict significant damage on the plant, but the Germans were resilient, making up the losses with purchases from Sweden, and substituting other types of bearings where possible.  The two battles were an outstanding Luftwaffe victory, but were not interpreted as such by the German High Command. The combination of the recent devastating bombing of Hamburg and the coincidence of a British raid on Peenemiinde on the night of August 17-18 infuri- ated Hitler. He savaged Goering, who responded as usual by berating Jeschonnek. The latter committed suicide rather than continue to be blamed for things over which he no longer had control.  The heavy losses forced the Eighth Air Force temporarily to con- centrate on targets where escorts could be provided. Then on October 14, the Eighth went back to Schweinfurt, again with fight- er escorts for only the route to and from Aachen. From that point on the Eighth’s bombers were escorted only by the Luftwaffe, which shot down 60 out of the 229 aircraft in the attacking force,
