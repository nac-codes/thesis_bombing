ort which stated that with a force of four thousand heavy bombers, Germany could be driven out of the war in six months. This report did not promise an early end to the war, however, for there were currently only 506 heavy bombers at Bomber Command’s disposal—getting to the magic 4,000 number would take years."*  Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris was given command of Bomber Command in February 1942, and quickly determined that the only solution to the attack on Germany was night area bombing, with the intent of destroying the German will to fight not by precisely destroy- ing strategic factories, but by destroying as many houses and killing as many people as possible, civilians as well as military. (There was a per- sistent refusal on all sides to recognize that bombing often had the reverse effect of raising the enemy population’s will to resist.)  246 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  Harris built up Bomber Command, hastening its re-equipment with four-engine heavy bombers and adopting each new element of technology as it appeared. The night-bombing campaign was a bit- ter technical contest with the Luftwaffe. For the most part, British technical expertise was well ahead of the German, as successive types of improved bombing equipment were fielded, including nav- igational aids such as GEE and OBOE and the introduction of H2S (for the code name “Home Sweet Home”) airborne radar. The most impressive improvements came in the form of radar spoofing devices, such as Window (simple foil strips called chaff today) and the use of electronic countermeasures.  Yet the Germans were resilient, and the experience of their night- fighter crews did much to offset British technical superiority. The German crews were also fighting over their homeland, and they could see the devastation that the British bombers were causing on every mission, and this made them fly with a grim determination to halt the stream of enemy aircraft.
