of this tactic was so great that by March 1943 Doenitz believed that he had almost defeated England, as he had promised he would do. In that one month alone, German U-boats sank 105 ships of 590,234 tons, a rate of loss that was unsustainable by Britain. Much of the U-boats’ success stemmed from aerial reconnaissance reports.  248 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  In 1937, Germany had pointed the way to the future of passenger aircraft with the fourengine Focke Wulf Fw 200. Called the Condor, and designed by the famous Kurt Tank, the aircraft made several record flights including an eye-opening Berlin-to-New York flight in 1938. The Condors were quickly modified for military duties and became active in sinking ships, accounting for some eighty-five vessels totaling 363,000 tons between August 1940 and April 1941. Winston Churchill called the Condor the “scourge of the Atlantic.”"”  Yet the Condors performed their greatest service when they detected convoys and reported their presence back to Doenitz’s headquarters. Unfortunately for the Germans, Reichsmarshall Goering resented the use of Luftwaffe assets to help the Navy. As a result, the Condor received a low priority, with only twenty-six air- craft being completed in 1940, and another fifty-eight in 1941.  Production was increased to eighty-four in the following year, but operational losses were so great that there were rarely more than twenty-five Condors available for action at any one time. The last year of production was 1943, when seventy-six were manufactured.  Had the Germans been foresighted enough to accelerate Condor production early in the war, there might have been enough in ser- vice in 1942 and 1943 to have allowed Doenitz to carry out his plan of starving Britain into submission. If, for example, 50 percent of the effort given to the Battle of Britain and the subsequent Blitz had been applied to the Battle of the Atlantic, Germany might well have won the war against Britain before beginning
