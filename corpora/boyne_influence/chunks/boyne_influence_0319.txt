, 50 percent of the effort given to the Battle of Britain and the subsequent Blitz had been applied to the Battle of the Atlantic, Germany might well have won the war against Britain before beginning its war against the Soviet Union.  The Allies were equally shortsighted in their allocation of aircraft to the Battle of the Atlantic. The United States and Great Britain had waged the war against submarines with relatively short-range aircraft such as the Consolidated PBY Catalina, Short Sunderland, and Lockheed Hudson. ”Bomber” Harris had fought against allocating any of his long-range four-engine bombers to the task. As a result, there remained a vast area of ocean south of Greenland where Allied aerial coverage did not reach. The Consolidated B-24 Liberator was ideally suited as an antisubmarine aircraft, for it had a long range and could carry as many as twenty-four depth charges. The alloca- tion of B-24s to antisubmarine work was delayed until the early spring of 1943. They arrived just in time to combine with a number of other antisubmarine warfare devices that included airborne radar,    The Growth of Air Power, 1941-43 249  far more proficient escort groups, and the increased efficiency of radio detection methods. This combination would in March 1943 dash the cup of prospective victory from Doenitz’s lips, and com- pletely reverse the course of the Battle of the Atlantic.  It will be seen that air power while essential in all theaters had not yet been applied at the scale and with the ferocity that would elicit a full measure of its effectiveness. That full measure would come, with terrible implications for the future, in the next two years.    Chapter Eight  True Air Superiority, Then Absolute Air Supremacy, 1944-45  By 1944, the war had lasted long enough for tremendous sums to have been spent upon military aeronautics. Air power had evolved so far beyond the most extreme force that Douhet, Trenchard, Mitchell, and others had prophesied that their most dire
