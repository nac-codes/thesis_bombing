lization that permitted vir- tually every household to become a “shadow factory.” Women were inducted into the work force on a vast scale and were paid at a rate approximately 50 percent that of the comparable male wage. Japan was forced, however, to accept a decreased level of quality in return for higher production, which had adverse effects in the field, where Japanese in-commission rates were typically much lower than those of the United States, adding to the quantitative imbalance.  Germany reached its upper levels of both quality and quantity in air power while enduring the most extensive bombing campaigns in history. It was able to do so by the intense employment of slave  True Air Superiority, Then Absolute Air Supremacy, 1944-45 253  labor from captured nations to extract the most from its previously underutilized industrial capacity. Germany had overbuilt its aircraft industry before the war, not with the conscious knowledge of having the overcapacity in an emergency, but rather to achieve its production goals with a normal one-shift work week. It maintained this one-shift approach long after Britain and the United States had gone to a twen- ty-four-hour-day, seven-day-week schedule, and departed from it only long after it was realized that a much bigger Luftwaffe was required. In April 1942 more than 90 percent of German industry was on a single- shift, five-and-one-half-day week. Not until March 1944 were German aircraft plants placed on double shifts with a seven-day work week.’  An intricate system of subcontracting was devised to allow dis- persed factories dedicated to the production of specific compo- nents to raise production levels. It was costly in terms of increased labor expenses, difficulties in keeping track of changes, additional expenses in tooling, and its great dependence on road, rail, and canal transportation. But the system worked well enough until it fell victim to the attacks of long-range fighters in late 1944 and early 1945. These
