rse of the war, the United States would build 325,000 aircraft of all types. The Ford Motor Company had been slow to come to war work, but by 1945, the Willow Run bomber plant was turning out one Consolidated B-24 every hour.  These new levels of air power would be exercised in the first six months of 1944 in two notable air campaigns. In one, the resilient Luftwaffe won its final major victory, achieving air superiority at night over the Reich after more than four years of struggle. This triumph would not have significant effect on the war or on history, for by the time the Battle of Berlin was concluded, Germany’s defeat was inevitable.  In the other notable campaign, the United States Army Air Forces led the way in blowing the Luftwaffe out of the sky, render- ing it a spent force, able to put up only limited resistance at great intervals. This victory had an immense effect upon history, for it permitted the invasion of Europe, secured Germany’s defeat on the Western Front, expedited the Soviet victory on the Eastern Front, and established a pattern for the future in which the air forces of the United States would be the primary protector of the free world.  The Night Campaign against Berlin: Last Victory for the Luftwaffe  When Bomber Command began its preliminary offensive against  256 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  Berlin in late August 1943, it had on strength about seven hundred four-engine bombers, approximately twice the number available to the Eighth Air Force. Where in the past its bombers had formed a 350- mile-long bomber stream that took hours to fly over a target, they now streamed across a city in about twenty-minutes, flying in a dense wedge no more than seventy miles long. Elaborate bomb-dropping tech- niques evolved, which included special Pathfinder crews to mark tar- get areas accurately with a variety of sophisticated markers, and a “Master of Ceremonies” who orbited the target at great risk and direct- ed incoming bombers as to wher
