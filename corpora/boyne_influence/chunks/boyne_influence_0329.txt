the night of November 18-19, 1943, and waged it without relax- ation until March 1944. In those four months, Bomber Command flew 20,224 sorties, during which about 2,700 Bomber Command aircraft were lost or heavily damaged. Of these 1,047 were shot down over Germany. There were 9,111 sorties against Berlin, with 492 aircraft missing, 954 damaged, and 95 written off upon return.° The final major battle over Berlin came on March 24, 1944, when just over 800 bombers were dispatched and 73 were lost. While this dire 9-percent loss rate was being digested, the climactic battle came, not over Berlin but Nuremburg. On the night of March 30- 31, Bomber Command put a force of 976 four-engine bombers and 15 Mosquitoes over Nuremburg in perfect weather. Ninety-six air- craft were shot down, with 960 crewmen killed or captured. The raid, with its almost 10-percent loss rate, had resulted in only 138 German civilian deaths. It was clear to many, including Winston Churchill, once bombing’s biggest backer, that the RAF bombing campaign was no longer worth the price that was being paid for it.    258 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  Harris and his supporters always maintained that the Battle of Berlin was not a defeat and that the RAF could have carried on, had it not been for the shift in mission to bombing the French transportation sys- tem. Yet the fact remains that at the crucial moment over Berlin, it was Bomber Command and not the Luftwaffe that stood down.  At that late date in the war, the Luftwaffe appeared to have won air superiority in the night skies over Germany. Harris had been defeated, but was spared the ignominy of admission by the swift pace of the war. In the spring of 1944, the requirements for the planned invasion of Europe, Operation Overlord, resulted in Harris’s having to place Bomber Command at the disposal of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the overall Allied commander.  On March 25, 1944, Eisenhower directed both Bomber Command and the Eighth Air Fo
