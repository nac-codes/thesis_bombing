Harris’s having to place Bomber Command at the disposal of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the overall Allied commander.  On March 25, 1944, Eisenhower directed both Bomber Command and the Eighth Air Force to concentrate their efforts on softening up enemy resistance by bombing the transportation system that connect- ed Germany to the coming battlefield on France’s coastline. When that campaign was over and area bombing of Germany could be resumed, Harris and Bomber Command would be the beneficiaries of the great American daytime victory over the Luftwaffe. By that time, area bomb- ing of Germany had become of questionable military value. Yet Germany had rebounded from apparent abject defeat before, as with the Christmas offensive that became known as the Battle of the Bulge. The retreating German armies were still huge and still possessed a great military potential against an unwary opponent. They were being led by men who had nothing to lose, so the habit of bombing cities was continued, in the hope of interfering with their movement. There was also, unquestionably, an element of vengeance, a desire to mete out to the Germans what they had so freely done to the British. The bombing was carried on until April 1945, and included among its terrible assaults Dresden, the subject of intense controversy ever since.  The controversy over Dresden began with a March 28, 1945, memo from Winston Churchill to the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshall Sir Charles Portal, stating that Dresden was a “serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing”—an indication that Churchill had anticipated the drift of public opinion. In 1963, the controversial author David Irving wrote in The Destruction of Dresden that 135,000 had been killed—erring by about 100,000 according to more accu- rate accounts. His book, combined with Kurt Vonnegutt’s Slaughter House Five, argued that it was an unnecessary and excessive reaction.    True Air Superiority, Then Absolute Air Supremacy, 1944-45 259  The
