er Brigadier General Eaker (who had flown with Spaatz on the famed 1929 endurance flight of the Question Mark), and VIII Fighter Command, under World War I ace Brigadier General Frank O’Driscoll (“Monk”) Hunter, who with his dramatic mustache and military flair was the very image of the glamorous fighter leader.  The Eighth Air Force grew from six men and no airplanes in February 1942 to 8,000 aircraft and 400,000 personnel by June 1944. Eaker became Commander of the Eighth Air Force in December 1942. His articulate voice at the Casablanca Conference convinced Churchill to stop pressing for the USAAF to join Bomber Command in the night-bombing role, and instead to complement it in “round-the-clock” bombing, a phrase Eaker used that appealed to the wordsmith in Churchill.  Eaker worked well with the RAF and with the British people, to whom he had endeared himself with his now famous arrival speech in which he said only, “We won’t do much talking until we’ve done more fighting. After we’ve gone, we hope you’ll be glad we came.” But despite his truly magnificent efforts, he never received the assets capable of doing what General Arnold constantly demanded of him. It may have been that Eaker was not quite ruthless enough with his subordinates. Neither his replacement at VIII Bomber Command, Brigadier General Newton Longfellow, nor the VIII Fighter Command’s Hunter, were obtaining the maximum results with their equipment. Hunter used his aircraft for short-range fighter sweeps,    True Air Superiority, Then Absolute Air Supremacy, 1944-45 261  which the Luftwaffe simply ignored. Eaker reluctantly replaced them, with Brigadier General Frank Armstrong Jr., and Brigadier General William (“Bill”) Kepner, respectively, but Eaker’s own com- mand was already forfeited.  His longtime friend and co-author, Arnold, bit the bullet and replaced Eaker on January 6, 1944, with Major General James H. (‘Jimmy’) Doolittle, a man who had previously been regarded as an outsider. Doolittle
