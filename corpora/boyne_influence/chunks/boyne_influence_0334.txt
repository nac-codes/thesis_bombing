e friend and co-author, Arnold, bit the bullet and replaced Eaker on January 6, 1944, with Major General James H. (‘Jimmy’) Doolittle, a man who had previously been regarded as an outsider. Doolittle had offended the regular corps of officers by resigning his commission in 1930, after spending ten years as a first lieutenant, to provide for his family with a more lucrative career in the business world. (In fairness, it must be noted that in those ten years, Doolittle became one of the most famous flyers in the world. He performed the first outside loop in an aircraft that he had instrumented himself to record the pressures and the stress. He earned three degrees, including a Doctor of Science in aeronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During the same period, he made many record flights, won the Schneider Trophy, and most important of all, initiated the science of instrument flying. The sheer brilliance of his performance was not rewarded with pro- motion solely because there were too many people senior to him on the Army promotion list.)

Glines, visited VIII Fighter Command headquarters soon after his arrival and saw in Kepner’s office a sign reading, THE FIRST DUTY OF THE EIGHTH AIR FORCE FIGHTERS IS TO BRING BOMBERS BACK ALIVE.

Instead of bomber formations being invincible, they were now bait to lure German fighters into the air where they could be destroyed by Eighth Air Force fighters. This was to be the secret of air superior- ity, a pragmatic recognition of first things first. It was not a product of years of study and the formulation of doctrine. It was an unvar- nished look at the real world of air warfare as
