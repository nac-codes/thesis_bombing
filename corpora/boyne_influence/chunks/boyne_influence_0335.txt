superior- ity, a pragmatic recognition of first things first. It was not a product of years of study and the formulation of doctrine. It was an unvar- nished look at the real world of air warfare as it existed in early 1944. (Doolittle, ever the modest warrior, always insisted that Eaker would have done equally well if he had been fortunate enough to have had sufficient equipment of the right type. When, in 1985 Doolittle  262 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  and Eaker were both honored with promotion to full four-star gen- eral rank, Doolittle insisted that Eaker’s be awarded first to main- tain Eaker’s seniority.)  Kepner and his men welcomed Doolittle’s sweeping directive. They were being re-equipped with a new fighter, the North American P-51B Mustang, itself a product of two sets of improbable circumstances in which individuals played key roles.  In the first of these, the Anglo-French Purchasing Commission had invited North American Aviation to produce Curtiss P-40 fight- ers under license. North American was a relatively new company, and a lucrative contract to produce fighters without any risk capital whatsoever must have been tempting to the company president, James H. (“Dutch”) Kindelberger. However, he consulted with his lead designers who convinced him that a more modern fighter could be designed and put into production before the P-40 could.  The British were not enamored of the P-40’s performance, and Sir Henry Self, the Director of the Purchasing Commission, agreed to a contract for four hundred new North American fighters, to be delivered at $37,509.45 each, and armed with eight machine guns. The prototype had to be ready in 120 days. (When the first contract arrived, it was for 320 aircraft.)  The North American team responded brilliantly with a beautiful new fighter that featured a laminar-flow wing and an innovative low- drag radiator system. (The laminar flow wing was the product of NACA research, and points up the value of a government-
