escort bombers all the way to Berlin and back. Fuel had to be used out of the new internal tank first, to keep the center of gravity within limits, but by the time that fuel was used, and the two external tanks emptied and dropped, the P-51 could whip any German piston-engine fighter it encountered. The first sortie of the P-51B was with the 354th Fighter Group on November 11, 1943. On December 13, the group escorted 710 bombers in a raid on Kiel, a round-trip distance of 980 miles.  The Eighth Air Force now had the weapon with which to defeat the Luftwaffe. There were other good fighters in the Eighth, includ- ing ever-increasing numbers of the Republic P-47 and two Lockheed P-38 groups, but neither had the Mustang’s range. One of the unforeseen benefits of the Mustang’s taking on the aerial superiority role was that it would free the P-47 to become one of the all-time great attack aircraft. Further, once the P-51 had won air superiority, both the P-47 and the P-51 had a free run against the German transportation system.  The Fight for Air Superiority  In some respects the Eighth Air Force and the Luftwaffe were like two champion boxers who fought each other repeatedly, each learn- ing from the other, each growing in strength and proficiency, and, for a long time, neither able to muster a true knockout blow.  The Germans had been forced to denude the most dangerous and critical battle area, the Eastern Front, to protect against the growing British and American onslaught. They also had to force Hitler to agree at last to cease production of bombers. The German leader was an eye- for-an-eye man who believed the British would stop bombing only when he bombed them back. His insistence on continued bomber  264 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  production badly hurt German fighter production, and it was not until the failure of Operation Steinbock, the final, pathetic Luftwaffe bombing campaign against England, that he finally agreed to cease building bombers in
