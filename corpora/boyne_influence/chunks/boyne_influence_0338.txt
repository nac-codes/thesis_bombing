German fighter production, and it was not until the failure of Operation Steinbock, the final, pathetic Luftwaffe bombing campaign against England, that he finally agreed to cease building bombers in favor of fighters.  The Luftwaffe had managed to gather 550 bombers together for Steinbock, including thirty-five of the trouble-prone Heinkel He 177 heavy bombers. Led by Major General Dietrich Peltz, the campaign began with a total of 270 sorties on January 21, 1944, and continued in fitful fashion until April 18. Most raids consisted of 100 to 170 air- craft, and while losses were high, bombing accuracy was low. When the campaign was concluded, Germany had fewer than 130 bombers with which to contend the coming invasion.” In its bumbling way, Operation Steinbock was an instruction manual on how not to use air power, for it was conducted with inadequate resources, ill-trained crews, and no means with which to attempt to gain air superiority.  Establishing True Air Power  By February 1944, the Eighth Air Force had finally grown to the point where its dismal in-commission rate did not prevent it from putting a lot of bombers over Germany. It now had 1,852 heavy bombers of which 1,046 were serviceable—a lackluster 56 percent in-commission rate. (When Eaker had only 350 bombers, a similar low in-commission rate meant that he had a striking force of 196, too few to do much damage—except to his reputation.)  The Eighth was also supplemented by the Fifteenth Air Force, which operated out of Italy with 835 heavy bombers. Of these, 570 were serviceable, a more reasonable 68 percent in-commission rate. With a combined effort, 1,600 heavy bombers could be placed over Germany."  The Luftwaffe had responded to the growing strength of the Eighth’s incursions in 1943 in the only way it could, by increasing its flak installations and building up its fighter force at the expense of other fronts. In January 1943, the Luftwaffe had 635 single-engine and 410 twin-engine fighters, a total
