twaffe bravely rising each day to meet new defeats. By February 25, the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces had flown more than 3,800 sorties and dropped almost 10,000 tons of bombs. The loss rate was high—just under 6 percent—with 226 heavy bombers shot down. The USAAF fighter loss rate was minimal, with only 28 aircraft lost out of 3,673 missions.  It was a different story for the Luftwaffe, which lost 2,121 aircraft in February, and would lose a further 2,115 in March."* Even more devastating to the Luftwaffe, however, was its loss in experienced pilots, especially its Experten, the high-scoring aces with a hundred victories or more. The effect of these losses was devastating, and put an impossible demand on the Luftwaffe replacement program. As more pilots were killed, their replacements were brought in with less and less training; these less-well-trained pilots were killed even more rapidly, accelerating the downward spiral to impotence. The obvious decline in the quality of Luftwaffe pilots was noted in many intelligence debriefings of Allied pilots, with comments made about enemy pilots flying straight ahead when under attack and others bailing out before an attack even began.  From the end of Big Week on, the Luftwaffe took up the chal- lenge less and less frequently, as it tried to husband its dwindling  266 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  supplies of pilots and fuel. Ironically, fighter production continued to soar, but losses to airfield and factory attacks were also soaring. The effectiveness of the suppression techniques was evident in the case of the Messerschmitt Me 262, the superb jet fighter that the Germans began introducing in 1944. Of some 1,340 built, only about 315 ever got into combat, the rest being destroyed by bomb- ing before they could be used.”  Yet the Luftwaffe even in decline had recuperative powers, and would occasionally strike out—it was like a wounded shark that has been brought on deck in a boat, dying, but still capable of
