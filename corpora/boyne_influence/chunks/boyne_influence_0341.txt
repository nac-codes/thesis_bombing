e used.”  Yet the Luftwaffe even in decline had recuperative powers, and would occasionally strike out—it was like a wounded shark that has been brought on deck in a boat, dying, but still capable of lashing with both teeth and tail. On March 6, 1944, when the Americans made their first major raid on Berlin, the Luftwaffe destroyed 69 of the 660 aircraft attacking.  The Big Week victory over the Luftwaffe opened up new avenues for the Eighth Air Force and Bomber Command in bombing and for RAF and USAAF fighters in strafing. The bombing statistics are reveal- ing, indicating that true air power was reached in 1944, for the first time in history. Never before had there been at one time a similar degree of aerial dominance and also the capability to deliver so much destructive power. The combined effort of the RAF and the Eighth Air Force, through the end of 1943, had resulted in 293,566 tons of bombs being dropped on the Nazi empire. This jumped in 1944 to a total of 1,154,897 tons; in the five months of war in 1945, the total reached 461,212 tons. In grand total terms, the Allies put down 1,909,405 tons of bombs in 793,700 sorties on occupied Europe."* (In contrast, the Germans had dropped 58,702 tons of bombs on the United Kingdom in what seemed at the time like a massive bombing campaign in 1940 and 1941, and a total of only 74,172 in the course of the war, less than 4 percent of the Allied total.’”)  Of the almost two million tons of bombs, a staggering 76 percent of the total tonnage (1,451,147 tons) had been dropped on Germany in the last seventeen months of the war. Ironically, the ability to deliver this devastating tonnage in the final months came about as a result of air superiority won not by bombing the enemy factories into oblivion, but instead, by utilizing the long-range fighter, which hammered the Luftwaffe into virtual impotence. Many of the later bomber missions were flown without seeing a single enemy fighter.  The full extent of that air superiorit
