committed his armored forces, the Allied fighter-bombers tore them to bits. Reinforcements could travel only at night, and with these delays, Germany’s sole opportunity to repel the invasion was lost. Under the cover of tactical air power, the bridgehead grew day by day, con- tained only by the fanatic Nazi resistance.  Allied bombers assisted in the breakout from Normandy with con- troversial carpet-bombing tactics that, while not always precise and sometimes inflicting friendly fire casualties, were nonetheless devas- tating to entrenched German defenders. As Field Marshal Gunther von Kluge reported to Hitler, “The psychological effect on the fighting forces, especially the infantry, of such a mass of bombs raining down on them with all the force of elemental nature, is a factor which must be given serious consideration. It is not in the least important whether such a carpet of bombs is dropped on good or bad troops.”"*  With the breakout, the fighter-bombers assumed a new role, some- times acting as flanking guards for advancing American armor, often with pilots riding in tanks as land-borne forward air controllers.    268 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  In France as in Italy, Germany demonstrated its new and ugly anti-air-power doctrine. Simply stated, the new doctrine postulated that soldiers could fight a strong defensive battle even without air power, even though in the end, many would die, and the battle would be lost. Similar circumstances would force Japan to adopt the same bloody doctrine on its road to defeat.  As the Allies advanced, the German radar system was pushed back so that there was even less time to alert the dwindling fighter force. The only advantage to the Luftwaffe was that, as it retreated, more and better-equipped bases were found in Germany, and there were more antiaircraft weapons available for defense.  The diminishment of the Luftwaffe’s threat permitted tactical avia- tion to come into its own in the advance across France,
