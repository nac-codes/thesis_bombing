Even on the “one pass and haul ass” attacks, many pilots were lost or captured, including some leading aces, such as then-Major Francis (“Gabby”) Gabreski.  But the greatest and most surprising triumph, the one that at last shut down the indefatigable German industry, was that of tactical fight- erbombers over the German transportation system. The fighter- bombers came in at low levels, making surprising raid on trains, canal barges, trucks, and automobiles. They shot them up with abandon and with a minimum of hazard, although the trains and even the barges sometimes had flak accompanying them, and often blew up just as the fighters passed overhead. Even in so powerful a nation as Germany, which had assiduously ransacked the territories it had conquered for equipment, there was a finite number of locomotives, railcars, trucks, and barges, and the marauding fighters eventually destroyed most of them. This left German industry with a host of dispersed factories making components for which it could not receive raw materials and from which it could not deliver finished parts.  Hitler had anticipated the problem, and had begun the con- struction of huge underground facilities in which raw materials would be brought in one end, and jet fighters flown out the other. A great deal of money and effort was spent in constructing these last-ditch efforts, but to no avail—the war was long over before they could be brought to practical use. Hitler had also correctly estimat- ed the hardiness of the German populace, reassuring Speer on one occasion that as long as the German worker had a hole to live in and a board for a roof, he would go on working, sustained by vaporous propaganda on “miracle weapons.”  It was in Hitler’s Berlin bunker where for the first time a totally unexpected aspect of the influen
