victory for air power alone, but not even the most stubborn anti-air-power critic could deny that its role had been essential. The German Army was generally admit- ted to be the best in the world, and it probably fought better with- out air power than any other army could have done. Letters and reports from German soldiers are filled with complaints about the “unfair” American infantry that would halt at the first sign of oppo- sition and summon air power to blow any resistance out of the way. It was not at all unfair, it was the only intelligent way to fight the war, and ironically, it was the way Germany initiated the fighting.

His IX TAC became the pattern for other USAAF tactical air commands. Despite a bitter feud with Lieutenant General Hoyt Vandenberg, Quesada emerged from the war as the biggest contributor to the cooperative success of American air and armored units.”  In the Pacific War, on the other side of the world, the United    True Air Superiority, Then Absolute Air Supremacy, 1944-45 271  States would use air power initially in much the same way as in Germany, with both naval air forces and the USAAF supplementing the advance of Marine and Army units. Ultimately, however, the great- est expression of air power to date would be found in the employment of the Boeing B-29. Within months, the ultimate in air power would be found in the c
