ssed into service as tankers and transports, consuming fuel as they carried fuel, defeating the object of fielding a strong force of the aircraft. The first combat mission, to Bangkok, was flown on June 5, 1944, and the first strike on Japan was made against the Yawata steel works on June 15. The results of this and subsequent raids were unsatis- factory, as there was not enough fuel and bombs available to send an adequate number of B-29s, and there were long stand-downs between raids as supplies were accumulated. Wolfe was relieved of command, and Major General Curtis E. LeMay was given the task of leading the B-29s against Japan.  LeMay undertook a substantial reorganization of training and tactics, but it was simply too difficult to conduct successful opera- tions out of China against Japan. He felt that the entire project had been unsound from the start and was frustrated by the failure to obtain better results. The Japanese made the situation worse with their last successful land-based offensive, which forced XX Bomber Command to pull out of China in January and return to bases in India. On January 18, 1945, LeMay went to the Marianas to assume command of the XXI Bomber Command, into which XX Bomber Command would ultimately be absorbed.  The XXI Bomber Command had previously been commanded by Hansell, who began operations from the Marianas on November 23, 1944. The high winds and weather of Japan conspired against the success of Hansellâ€™s high-altitude precision bombing tactics, howev- er, which achieved limited results. In the USAAF, if an officer worked for Hap Arnold, he had to deliver results no matter how far  276 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  back his friendship reached, and so Arnold dismissed Hansell. (It is worth mentioning that the military leaders of the United States, a democracy, were notably more severe in their demands for perfor- mance than were their counterparts in totalitarian Germany and espe- cially in Imperial Japan.
