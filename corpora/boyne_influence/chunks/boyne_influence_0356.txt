“He was a hardheaded bastard.””  LeMay, after long consideration, decided to adopt the tactics that he and his staff had not only planned but tested. There were many advantages to night area bombing, for the Japanese had few night- fighters, and their antiaircraft guns were designed to work against high-altitude intruders. Flying at low levels meant burning less fuel and putting strain on the still unreliable Wright engines. LeMay dis- mayed many when he ordered some guns and ammunition to be deleted. The off-loading of 8,000 pounds of ammunition allowed the bomb loads to be increased by 3,200 pounds up to much as 13,000 pounds per plane.”  True Air Superiority, Then Absolute Air Supremacy, 1944-45 277  The major test of LeMay’s theory came on March 9-10 in an attack on Tokyo, with 334 B-29s (about 100 more than on any pre- vious raid) carrying about 1,700 tons of primarily incendiary bombs. The attack was made at altitudes ranging from 4,900 to 9,200 feet, and was focused on a twelve-square-mile area where the population density was an incredible 103,000 persons per square mile. The lead squadron acted as pathfinders, each one dropping 180 of the new seventy-pound M47 napalm bombs. These were intended to start major fires that would mobilize the Japanese fire-fighting equip- ment and get them committed to different locations in the city. Following aircraft carried 500-pound cluster bombs, each with thir- ty-eight of the smaller six-pound M69 bombs. The fires would sud- denly be much more widespread, and the fire equipment would be unable to concentrate on the most serious blazes.  These small incendiary bombs were themselves a metaphor for the gigantic differential in strength between the United States and Japan and underlined how utterly foolish the Japanese leaders had been to provoke a war. The United States had not only developed a massive fleet of Boeing B-29 aircraft, surpassing anything the Japanese could build, they had deployed it halfway around the world
