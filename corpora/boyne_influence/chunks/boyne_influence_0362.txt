ons, but there were still many military installations, and like all Japanese cities, it was geared entirely to the war effort. It also had the positive feature that there were no Allied prisoner of war camps in the area.  The American air superiority was now so great that Tibbetts felt secure even though only seven B-29 aircraft were assigned to his mission. These included the bomb-drop aircraft (soon to be named Enola Gay after Tibbett’s mother) and two escort planes carrying observers. Three other aircraft were assigned duty as weather planes, with one aircraft retained as spare.  The Enola Gay took off at 0245 in the morning on August 6, 1945. Released at 0915, from 31,600 feet and at an airspeed of 328 miles per hour, the first nuclear weapon ever dropped in combat fell toward Hiroshima. It exploded fifty seconds later, at an altitude of 1,900 feet, with a force of 20,000 tons of TNT. Almost five square miles of the Hiroshima city center were wiped out, and almost 80,000 people were killed and another 80,000 were injured.  The reaction of the Japanese government was confused; official- ly they denigrated the power of the attack, saying only that it was a new bomb “which should not be made light of.”  There was only one atomic weapon remaining, and a decision was made to use it on August 9, in part to give the impression that there was a full stock of nuclear bombs to follow. This time the aircraft was Bock’s Car, flown by Major Charles W. Sweeney and his crew. Weather impeded an attack on Kokura, the primary target, and Sweeney flew the B-29 to Nagasaki where the bad weather cleared just enough to allow a visual sighting to be made and the bomb to be dropped. This time there were 35,000 people killed and another 60,000 wounded.  As the stunned Japanese were digesting this second blow, the Soviet Union lived up to its wartime treaties—and to its desire for revenge—declaring war on Japan on August 8. All of the major pow- ers were now arrayed against Japan, which
