eved what its philosophers and prophets had so hope- fully claimed for it. The Cold War, which broke out so soon after the end of World War II, would reveal that air power had become captive to its new potential in a way that no one could have imagined.    Chapter Nine  The Cold War, 1945-62  Adolph Hitler began World War II with the intention of obtain- ing colonies in the east. Joseph Stalin ended World War II with the complete defeat of Germany, and the acquisition of a series of buffer states that became, if not Soviet colonies, at least compliant client states that were exploited ruthlessly.  In this turnabout of historical events, air power had been of enor- mous consequence. None of the air-power theorists nor even any of the air-power practitioners could ever have imagined that air power would reach the ultimate heights that it did in the summer of 1945— “ultimate” meaning the combination of air superiority, the atomic bomb, and a long-range delivery system, the B-29. Yet oddly enough, instead of becoming a major new factor in world politics, ultimate air power had, for the moment at least, become a non sequitur, unnec- essary in a world in which the aggressive national states of Germany and Japan had been defeated, and where there seemed to be at least the prospect of peace for the immediate future.  It is worthwhile to stop for a moment and consider what might have been the case with ultimate air power in 1945 if it had not been the sole possession of the United States, but instead that of Germany or Japan or the Soviet Union.

The United States did none of these things. In fact, it did something
