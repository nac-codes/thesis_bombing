re was therefore tremendous public demand for all troops to be brought home and demobilized as soon as possible. This public outcry was translated into congressional action, and there began the greatest unilateral disarmament in history. The Army and Navy were immediately affected, but demobilization had the most adverse effect upon the United States Army Air Force, because of the higher degree of technical skills needed by its members.  The USAAF had 2,253,000 military and 318,514 civilian person- nel on-strength on the day Japan surrendered. Within five months, the totals had fallen to 888,769 military personnel. This figure fell to 303,600 by May 1947, when there were still about 110,000 civil- ians employed.  The stark reduction in numbers does not tell the whole story. Where there had been 350,000 mechanics, there were now less than 35,000. This meant that in-commission rates (the number of air- craft serviceable) fell to an embarrassing 18 percent—and that high only because most of the aircraft were brand new and scarcely flown. The USAAF had fallen from a worldwide strength of more than 70,000 aircraft to 25,000, and of these, only 4,750 were ready for  290 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  combat. Even this small number—about the size of the Luftwaffe in 1943—was dispersed on a global basis.  But, again, numbers did not tell the true story. Where on August 15, 1945, the USAAF had 218 groups of all types, most of them combat ready, by December 1946, it had fifty-two groups—of which only two were combat ready. The USAAF had become the most powerful air force in the history of the world in the forty-four months after Pearl Harbor. It took only sixteen months to render it virtually powerless.  Britain’s demobilization was slightly less hasty than America’s, because it still required armed forces to maintain order in its fast- diminishing empire. In terms of stopping Soviet aggression, howev- er, the RAF was as impotent as USAAF conventional forces.  Perha
