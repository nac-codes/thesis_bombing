he rations issued to West Berlin citizens increased, and Soviet embarrassment mounted.  Ineffective attempts were made to disrupt the steady, conveyor belt-like flow of C-54s streaming in orbits through the clearly defined airways into Berlin. Soviet fighter planes buzzed the transports, and false radio signals were transmitted to confuse them, to no avail.  On April 15, 1949, 1,398 aircraft brought in a staggering 12,940 tons of goods, more than West Berlin would have received by rail, road, and canal before the Berlin Blockade began. The Soviet Union ended the blockade on May 12, recognizing that it had suffered a humiliating diplomatic defeat. The airlift continued until September 30, 1949, by which time it had delivered 2,325,000 tons of supplies in 275,000 sorties. The airlift, to which the Royal Air Force made a major contribution, was expensive, costing more than $200    292 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  million. More serious were the twelve crashes that claimed thirty- one American lives.’  The influence of air power on subsequent history in the Berlin Airlift is difficult to overestimate. First and foremost it established the respective roles of the United States and the Soviet Union in the world. The Soviet Union was seen as repressive, hostile to the citi- zens of West Berlin, and willing to use starvation tactics to enforce its bullying methods of blockade. The United States was seen as brave, for standing up to an overwhelming force, and technologi- cally clever, for it created the miracle of the airlift virtually overnight. Most important of all, the United States was seen as humane—it was spending its money and the lives of its airman on the behalf of a defeated enemy populace.  This was the beginning of the largely unheralded history of com- passionate relief missions that have seen the USAF on the spot with relief supplies and remedial measures all over the world, whether the trouble is earthquake, fire, flood, civil war, famine, plague,
