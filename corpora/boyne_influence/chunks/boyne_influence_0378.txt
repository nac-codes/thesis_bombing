officially at war.  Yet even Truman’s speedy actions were almost too late, for the North Korean Army had pushed the South Koreans and a token UN force into the tiny Pusan Perimeter, where it looked like they would soon either be captured or backed into the sea. The president turned to the only thing he had to stem the tide: air power.    294 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  It may be said of United States air power in the Korean War that while it did not achieve victory, it averted defeat three times. The first time occurred in the days after the war began, when obsolescent air- craft, most veterans of World War II, flew out of Japan to slow down the advancing North Korean forces. The second time came after the massive intervention by Communist China in November 1950, when the UN forces were again pushed almost into the sea, and air power would again slow down, then halt the advance. The third time would come after the UN forces had once again established a front running roughly just above the Thirty-Eighth Parallel, and the only thing that restrained the enormous Communist forces from breaking through was close air support at the front and the interdiction of their supply lines by American air power.  Avoiding defeat was an exceedingly close-run thing, for the United States was depending upon a World War II-style air force to prevent World War III. If, in the first months of the war, the North Korean troops had not outrun their supply lines by such a large mar- gin, it is doubtful that the available handful of North American F- 51s, North American F-82s, Douglas B-26s, Lockheed F-80s, and Boeing B-29s could have stopped them. But stop them they did, and in doing so they prepared the way for General of the Army Douglas MacArthur’s masterful counterstroke at Inchon, launched on September 15, 1950. As Commander in Chief of the UN forces, MacArthur insisted on a risky flank attack that was perilous in the extreme, but which went off very well.  Carried away by
