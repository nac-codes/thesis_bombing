funds during the prewar years and had saved the entire industry by ordering its forced removal to beyond the Urals. He had intervened to accelerate pro- duction of the Shturmovik, and had graciously allowed talented designers such as Andrei Tupolev to continue working in jail, rather than killing them for suspected treason as was his usual custom. The Soviet dictator had asked the United States on three occasions for the delivery of B-29s under the provisions of Lend-Lease, but had been refused. When the Soviet Union acquired four examples of Boeing B-29s that landed there after being damaged in raids on Japan, he ordered Soviet engineering teams to reverse-engineer them, copying them as exactly as possible given the difference in Soviet and American materials and tools. Tupolev was assigned the  The Cold War, 1945-62 297  task of copying the aircraft, while A. D. Shvetsov was told to copy the Wright R-3350 engines.  The massive endeavor was insulting to the capability of Soviet engineers and designers, who felt they could have created an air- craft of equivalent performance in less time. But Stalin was intu- itively correct; the B-29, with its pressurized cabin, turbocharged engines, and central fire-control system, was far more sophisticated than any previous Soviet airplane. The task of reverse-engineering the B-29 and its components revitalized the Soviet aviation industry. When this revitalization was combined with the information gained from German sources after World War II, and, perhaps more impor- tant, with the political coup by which Britain’s Sir Stafford Cripps sanctioned the sale of fifty-five Rolls-Royce Nene jet engines, Soviet aviation was given a ten-year boost in progress that would have pro- found effects upon both political and scientific events.  The Tupolev Tu-4, as the copy was called, first flew on June 3, 1947. It was followed by some four hundred additional aircraft, of which three hundred were in service by 1950.‘ These aircraft had the
