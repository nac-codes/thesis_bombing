cketry and pulling equal in both atom- ic and hydrogen bombs. If the Soviet Union was the first to field a fleet of ICBMs, it would have the United States at its mercy—and mercy was not a commodity for which the USSR was noted.  Schriever had picked the Convair Atlas as the first missile to be developed. Not everything went smoothly; the first launch of the Atlas on June 11, 1957, followed what had become a classic American pattern: a first launch failure. But Schriever persisted, and the third launch on December 17, 1957, was successful. In the interval between the first and third launches the first series of Soviet space successes had occurred, and Congress at last provided unlim- ited funding.  302 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  Schriever, only forty-seven, had courageously taken the risk of concurrent development, production, and operations in the most sophisticated project in history. Within the first two years, he was coordinating the talents of 18,000 scientists, 17 prime contractors, 200 subcontractors, and 3,500 suppliers, all employing an estimated 70,000 people, and all initially focused on building the Atlas ICBM. Later Schriever’s team would extend their talents to improving the Atlas and to creating a series of missiles.  The speed and efficiency of Schriever and his team was dazzling, especially in comparison to other military and even commercial development programs. During the same general period, the prime contractor for the Atlas, Convair, took ten years to develop the admittedly advanced F-102 fighter, at a time when it was customary for General Motors to take five years just to introduce a new model Chevrolet. In contrast, Schriever guided the USAF and the newly born missile industry to four complete new missile systems within a period of eight years. These included the Atlas, Titan, and Minuteman ICBMs and the Thor intermediate-range ballistic mis- sile. The Thor was essentially a shorter-range spin-off of the Atlas. The Titan series
