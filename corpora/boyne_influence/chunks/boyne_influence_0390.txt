eight years. These included the Atlas, Titan, and Minuteman ICBMs and the Thor intermediate-range ballistic mis- sile. The Thor was essentially a shorter-range spin-off of the Atlas. The Titan series was larger and more sophisticated, but still pow- ered by liquid-fueled rockets. The Minuteman was an immense leap ahead, being a solid-fuel rocket that made it easier to manufacture, deploy, store, maintain, and launch.  The Strategic Air Command folded the new missile strength into its retaliatory capability as swiftly as it became available. By early 1959 three Atlas squadrons were operational, with a total of eigh- teen missiles among them. Two years later there were seven Atlas and three Titan squadrons. By 1962 there were thirteen Atlas, twelve Titan, and eight Minuteman squadrons, with a total of 637 missiles. By 1984, there were no less than 1,000 Minuteman and 54 Titan missiles in service—a bewildering, overwhelming strength— and but one part of an American strategic triad, for there were also 262 B-52s and 60 General Dynamics FB-111 strategic bombers and the burgeoning strength of the United States Navy’s submarine- launched ballistic missile force.*  In February 1957, well before the first success of the Atlas, Schriever had announced that at least 90 percent of the develop- ments of the ballistic missile program could be applied to space vehi- cles. The Atlas, Titan, and Thor missiles all became stalwart launch    The Cold War, 1945-62 303  vehicles for satellites, with the Atlas and the Thor (Delta) develop- ing into commercial systems of immense importance.  Developing the ICBMs had not been inexpensive; in 1970 dollars, more than $17 billion was spent on the ICBMs compared to $2 billion on manned aircraft procurement during the same decade of procurement.’  The Department of Defense was justifiably proud of the buildup in strength of its missile forces, but it was completely in the dark as to how well the Soviet Union was progressing. Soviet security was
