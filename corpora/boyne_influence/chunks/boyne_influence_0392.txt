and it maintained the production of military aircraft at the rate of ten thousand per year at a time when the United States was building fewer than a thousand combat aircraft annually. Much of the production was allocated to satellite air  304 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  forces, which were pleasantly surprised to be equipped with modern, first-line equipment rather than obsolete castoffs as was usually the case. These aircraft were also used to influence the politics of neutral nations, particularly in the Middle East, where Egypt and Syria in par- ticular received large quantities of MiG-15s and other first-line aircraft. Such largess became a competitive bribery process between the United States and the Soviet Union, each one bringing client states under its wing by equipping their armed forces. Thus it was that some third-world countries, unable to feed themselves, would still have mod- ern missile-armed jet fighters on their flight lines.  The Red Air Force treated the Korean War as it had treated the Spanish Civil War, as a perfect place to train its pilots for combat. It began rotating pilots through on so regular a basis that the Americans were able to tell when a new “class” had arrived. Recent research by Western scholars into the Soviet archives indicate that the Red Air Force did much better in Korea than American reports would indicate, so much so that the long-held belief that the F-86s shot down MiG-15s at the rate of ten to one is now suspect.  Veterans of the Soviet Air Force in fact claim to have won the air war in Korea, basing their claim that they achieved their primary objective of shooting down bombers and preventing them from attacking strategic targets by forcing the B-29s out of daylight attacks. They are particularly proud that no Soviet jet fell to B-29 gunners, despite many claims to the contrary. Their success in halt- ing the daylight bombing campaign cast serious doubts on the thir- ty-year-old claim that the bomber would
