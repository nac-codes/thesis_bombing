Soviet jet fell to B-29 gunners, despite many claims to the contrary. Their success in halt- ing the daylight bombing campaign cast serious doubts on the thir- ty-year-old claim that the bomber would always get through.  Seeing this situation, the Soviet Union turned away from building bombers on a scale equivalent to the United States, and began to emphasize the intercontinental ballistic missile. They also began arming their limited force of bombers with cruise missiles—the Kelt, Kipper, and Kangaroo missiles (NATO code names) were all being carried by the 1960s.’  Shortly after the end of the Korean War, the best estimates of the Soviet Air Force indicated that it possessed about 10,000 jet fight- ers, 5,000 tactical jet bombers, and 1,500 medium and heavy bombers, including 750 of the Tupolev Tu-16 Badger, a twin-jet equivalent to the Boeing B-47, and less than 100 of the impressive- looking but ultimately disappointing Myasishchev M-4, a four-engine jet intended to correspond to the B-52. The most successful Soviet    The Cold War, 1945-62 305  heavy bomber effort came with the huge, four-turboprop Tupolev Tu- 20 developed into the Tu-95. Given the NATO code name “Bear,” the Tupolev bomber first flew in 1954, and will likely remain in service well into the twenty-first century, with about 545 being built.  Like the United States, the Soviet Union had seized upon the German V-2 weapon as the basis to begin the development of an ICBM. These initial developments lent themselves to short-range tactical missiles initially, and were built originally at a great rate, approaching two thousand missiles per year. Later under the guid- ance of the great Sergei Korolyov, the Soviet Union developed indigenous missile systems that ultimately matched or exceeded the performance of their American counterparts. Born in Kiev in 1907, Korolyov was caught up in Stalin’s purges, and spent six years of his life in Siberia. Reinstated as a colonel in the Red Army in 1945, he became
