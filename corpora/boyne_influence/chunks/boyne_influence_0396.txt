war. They were very con- scious that the Germans had conducted such reconnaissance flights before their June 22, 1941, invasion.  Acutely aware of the danger, USAF Major John Seaberg, working at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, believed that the jet engine had reached a stage where a high-altitude, long-range aircraft could be built. Fortunately, the necessary equipment had also materialized in the form of a high-resolution camera developed by Dr. Edwin Land (of Polaroid fame). The camera could use new Hycon Corporation lenses, and Mylar-based film developed by Eastman Kodak.    The Cold War, 1945-62 307  In March 1953, the Air Force established a requirement for a sin- gle-seat spy plane capable of operating at altitudes of greater than sev- enty thousand feet. The Bell X-16 won the competition for the air- craft, but no one had reckoned with Lockheed’s famous engineer, Kelly Johnson, who presided over a secret engineering shop collo- quially called the Skunk Works after a mythical workshop in cartoon- ist Al Capp’s comic strip Lil Abner.  Johnson, perhaps the greatest aeronautical engineer of his time, bulled his way through the monumental red tape by promising the delivery of the first aircraft in eight months, and the delivery of twenty aircraft for $22 million despite the fact that Bell already had a contract for its X-16. Johnson’s offer was accepted, the X-16 pro- gram was killed, and on August 1, 1955, the famous Lockheed test pilot, Tony LeVier, made the official first flight.  The U-2 was a fragile aircraft, with a long, slender wing, narrow fuse- lage, and a bicycle-style landing gear. Weight considerations prevented installation of a pressurized cockpit, so the pilot was forced to wear an uncomfortable pressure suit through the long missions. The U-2 proved to be a dangerous aircraft to fly. It demanded extremely high piloting skills and was unforgiving of any error. There were many loss- es, and many pilots died in the U-2. All the while, NACA provided
