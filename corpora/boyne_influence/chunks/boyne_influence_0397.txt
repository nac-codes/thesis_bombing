to be a dangerous aircraft to fly. It demanded extremely high piloting skills and was unforgiving of any error. There were many loss- es, and many pilots died in the U-2. All the while, NACA provided a cover story that the U-2 was making high-altitude research flights.  The first U-2 spy flight took place on June 20, 1956, from Weisbaden, Germany, on a route that took it over Warsaw and Prague. Then on July 4, Leningrad and Moscow were overflown. The results were sensational—the photographs peered into the heart of Soviet defenses and industry.  There had been some hopes that Soviet radar could not detect the high-flying U-2, but this was not the case, and the Soviet foreign ministry bitterly protested the invasion of its territory. The United States “stonewalled,” denying that such flights were taking place, and ignoring the Soviet threats of military reprisals. The heart of the matter was that the Soviets were unwilling to admit that they could not stop the flights after the hundreds of billions of rubles they had spent on their air defense system.  In the next four years, the U-2s made forty overflights as well as many flights around the periphery of the country. On one of these flights, a pilot noted a previously undisclosed railroad spur; he elected to fol- low it, and found the supersecret Baikonur Cosmodrome—a bit of  308 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  sleuthing that the later satellites could not do. Sensors were soon added to the U-2 to bring back invaluable electronic information.  The information bonanza the U-2s brought back revealed not only that the Soviet bomber fleet was far less numerous than believed, but that the Soviet ICBM development, while serious and advanced in some areas, was in general not as far along as feared.  The U-2 overflights ended on May 1, 1960, when Francis Gary Powers was shot down near Sverdlovsk by the blast effect of a volley of fourteen SA-2 surface-to-air missiles.
