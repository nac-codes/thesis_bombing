silicon had roughly doubled every year since the technology was invented. This rela- tionship held until 1970, when the doubling period slowed to about eighteen months, a rate it has since sustained. Experience indicates that Moore’s Law is apparently self-fulfilling, for each increase in capacity gives the ability to improve performance. The improve- ments in satellite systems and in weaponry since CORONA support this concept, and would make it possible for aerospace power to reach beyond the heights it has demonstrated in the Persian Gulf War, Kosovo, and Afghanistan.  Yet before CORONA had fully developed, it happened that an older, tried-and-true piece of reconnaissance equipment, the Lockheed U-2, would provide critical information on the most dan- gerous flashpoint of the entire Cold War: the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Approach to Armageddon  It might be said that in some respects the Cold War was conduct- ed somewhat along the lines of a family quarrel, in which some mis- conduct was permissible, and some impermissible. It was permissi- ble, for example, to build up huge quantities of nuclear weapons, and it was also permissible to provide large quantities of conven- tional arms to allies. Providing nuclear arms to allies, however, was impermissible. It was permissible to build up huge forces of Soviet    The Cold War, 1945-62 311  intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) that threatened all of Europe, for the European states were presumably protected by the retaliatory capability of the United States. This capability included the installation of American IRBMs in Turkey—which the Soviets somehow regarded as impermissible.  All this information is background to the stark fact that United States intelligence sources had begun reporting that the Soviet Union was installing offensive weapons in Cuba, reports that Soviet officials persistently denied, saying that they were installing only defensive weapons in their Caribbean client’s homeland.  Cuba was attract
