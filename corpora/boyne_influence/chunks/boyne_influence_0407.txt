9.8 billion (8.5 percent), was allocated to defense. (These were official figures; unofficial esti- mates put the percentage much higher.)  The Soviet Army was estimated to be 2,000,000 men, with almost 17,000 tanks and an immense amount of artillery. The Army was orga- nized into 157 divisions, and could mobilize another 70 divisions, com- pletely equipped, in less than thirty days. The Soviet Navy was not yet a “blue water” surface navy, but it consisted of 475,000 personnel and had 290 conventional and 80 nuclear-powered submarines.  In comparison, in the same time period the United States pos- sessed 1,044 ICBMs, 656 SLBMs, and 540 strategic bombers. The    316 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  USAF had about 6,000 additional aircraft, including 700 interceptors and 1,000 tactical aircraft in the United States. An additional 3,000 aircraft of all types were dedicated to operations in Southeast Asia. The United States Army had a strength of 1,363,000, but was hope- lessly outnumbered in tanks and artillery. It did excel in helicopter strength, however, with almost 9,000 in its inventory. The key num- bers, however, would not ultimately be men, planes, or tanks but these: a smaller population of 205 million generated a Gross National Product of $932 billion. The annual defense outlay in the midst of war was $72 billion, or only about 7.7 percent of GNP.'  It was first perceived in the early years of the Ronald Reagan pres- idency that the relative percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) spent on defense would be the ultimate key to victory in the Cold War. The Soviet desire to be militarily strong everywhere would speed its ultimate collapse, as its economy was not strong enough to bear the costs of such strategic commitment or extensive weaponry. The overemphasis on military spending destroyed any chance of creating a strong domestic economy. The Soviet populace suffered extremes of hardship endurable only so long as they were unaware of what was happening
