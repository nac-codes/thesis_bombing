sis on military spending destroyed any chance of creating a strong domestic economy. The Soviet populace suffered extremes of hardship endurable only so long as they were unaware of what was happening in the free world. With the advent of mass means of communication, including television, they swiftly became aware of what they were missing. Those who directed the Soviet sys- tem lived well, which perhaps prevented them from understanding that without a strong domestic economy, the tax base was insuffi- cient to fund profligate military spending.  In contrast, while the United States did not spend a markedly smaller percentage of its GDP on defense, its economy was so robust that it generated a civilian economy unmatched in history. In doing so, the United States took some deliberate risks. There was, for example, nothing in the United States to compare with the massive Soviet civil defense efforts, and this deficiency would have been of overwhelming importance if a nuclear exchange had occurred. Instead, it was fortunate for all that instead of nuclear explosions there was an economic implosion in the Soviet Union that brought it down with a whimper and not a bang on Christmas Day, 1991.  The Korean War, where the outcome quite literally depended upon the efficacy of American tactical air power, should have led the United States to the development of a similar balance of forces as that of the Soviet Union even if not one of such extravagant scale.
