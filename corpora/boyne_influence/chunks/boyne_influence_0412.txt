those means include bombing.  The bombing campaigns of the Vietnam War have been much examined, and the general consensus of many of the books is that bombing was not effective because the war was ultimately lost. Nothing could be further from the truth. Air power was the only means by which the United States could sustain its own ground forces and those of its ally, the Republic of Vietnam, in the field. Just as in the Korean War, where military victory was also forfeited to political considerations, air power succeeded in Vietnam by preventing mili- tary defeat. It did so by gaining numerous small land victories in the field, including four of vital, history-shaping, importance.  The more numerous small victories include the thousands of situ- ations in which the arrival of air power won the battle for United States or South Vietnamese troops in contact with Communist forces. Perhaps the most dramatic of these were the nighttime relief of out- posts under attack by the timely arrival of airborne gunships, first Douglas AC-47s and then Fairchild AC-119s and Lockheed AC-130s. It was the proud boast of gunship crews that no outpost was ever taken when a gunship was on hand to prevent it. There were many other examples, from the firepower of army helicopters supporting troops being evacuated from landing zones to the heavy weapons of the McDonnell F4s demolishing enemy troops ringing a besieged hamlet to the extended engagements of Douglas A-1Es during rescue operations. It is impossible to estimate the number of lives these actions saved, nor the spin they put on the history of the war.  Yet these all pale when compared to the four major instances in which an air-power victory prevented defeat in the field. The first of  320 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  these was the aerial relief of Khe Sahn. The brilliant North Vietnamese defense minister, General Vo Nguyen Giap, planned to surround the base. His purpose was to effect a second Dien Bien Phu, the 1954 b
