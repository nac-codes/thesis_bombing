hat it could do, but by what politicians thought it could do. It may be said that the United States aerial involvement in the Vietnam War came about because American gov- ernmental officials felt secure in the immense nuclear power they possessed, which had grown from the less than 2,000 nuclear weapons that President Eisenhower had at his disposal in 1953, to 26,500 by 1962.Â° With this enormous strength at their ultimate dis- posal, those officials were more than willing to exert diplomatic and military pressure with token gestures of conventional air power. In theory it was much like the gunboat diplomacy of the Royal Navy in the previous century. Then a minor British force could be sent to    The Cold War, 1963-73 321  deal with colonial problems because it was implicit that the entire weight of the Royal Navy would be employed if the minor force met with difficulty.  Military officers, particularly in the USAF, were well aware of the limitations of air power and never had the same level of confidence that these token forces could accomplish the jobs they were asked to do. They were also all too aware of how conflicts sometimes esca- lated rapidly beyond the control of anyone involved. There was strong opposition to the idea of intervening in Southeast Asia throughout the military establishment, an opinion top civilian lead- ers in the Departments of Defense or State did not share.  The first step in the escalation process seemed harmless enough. After the French were forced from their former colony in 1954, the newly established nation of South Vietnam sought assistance from the United States. A 325-man Military Assistance Group (MAG) was in place by 1955 to train the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN.)  For the next six years, the United States Air Force had no formal involvement in Vietnam.
