formal involvement in Vietnam. Then-President Kennedy authorized the establishment of a mobile control and reporting post at Tan Son Nhut Air Base near Saigon. It began operation on October 5, 1961, and was soon followed by a detachment with the code name Farm Gate. Consisting of 155 officers and airmen equipped with four Douglas RB-26s, four Douglas SC-47s, and eight North American T- 28s, the Farm Gate contingent began arriving at Bien Hoa Air Base on November 15. The official mission was to train the South Vietnamese Air Force, but the Farm Gate crews were soon flying combat missions. It was the thin edge of what would become a bloody eleven-year wedge.  Operation Mule Train followed Farm Gate in January 1962, to provide troop carrier and cargo capability in the form of sixteen Fairchild C-123 twin-engine transports. In the same month, the first detachment of Operation Ranch Hand would arrive. Ranch Hand used the C-123 to conduct the highly controversial Agent Orange defoliant operations that Secretary McNamara authorized on November 3, 1961.  This cautious escalation was not without its costs, for several aircraft were lost. The first of these was a Fairchild C-123 on a training mission that crashed on February 2, 1961, killing its crew of three. Thousands more aircraft would be lost in the course of the Vietnam War.    322 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  The tempo of air-power operations did not increase substantially until after the August 2, 1964, Gulf of Tonkin incident when North Vietnamese torpedo boats were reported to have attacked the destroyer USS Maddox. President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered retal- iatory raids on North Vietnamese bases by carrier aircraft, and the air war in Vietnam began to pick up speed. In Operation Pierce Arrow, sixty-four sorties were flown from the USS Ticonderoga and the USS Constellation on August 5, striking North Vietnamese petro- leum storage facilities and naval vessels.â€™  Side Effects of the Success in Cuba  Many
