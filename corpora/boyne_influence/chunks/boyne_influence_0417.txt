One aspect of McNamaraâ€™s insurgency viewpoint was that the Viet Cong were to be considered a rebellious opposition party to the    The Cold War, 1963-73 323  South Vietnamese government, when in fact they were directed from Hanoi, and included a large number of North Vietnamese troops who were inserted into South Vietnam to terrorize rather than persuade. Because there were rebellions going on all over the world, McNamara saw the war in Vietnam as a laboratory, a learning experience. He believed that by using the methods of quantitative analysis that had given him a meteoric career at the Ford Motor Company he would be able to analyze the results of operations in Vietnam. This learning experience would presumably teach the United States how to handle future insurgencies elsewhere in the world. He ignored the human factor entirely, a grave mistake given the redoubtable fighting qualities of the North Vietnamese and their dedication to their mission.  The situation in Vietnam was in many ways parallel to that of Korea in 1950. Both Korea and Vietnam were bordered on the north by Communist China. Both had formerly been occupied by a foreign power. Both were divided in half with most of the limited industrial capacity in the North. In both instances, the northern portion of the country was militant, with an army well trained and well equipped by the Soviet Union, while the southern portion had an army that was poorly trained and poorly equipped by the United States.
