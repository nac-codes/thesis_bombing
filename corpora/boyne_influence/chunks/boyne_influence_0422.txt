standing, led to stiffened resistance by the North Vietnamese.  McNamara and his associates in government thus succeeded in forfeiting all the enormous advantages that American air power possessed, in part by imposing rules of engagement that gave every advantage to the enemy. These varied from time to time, and many were altered after McNamara left office, but they were very restric- tive, as some brief examples will indicate.  The United States military leadership was not without blame. Generals who knew that McNamara and his colleagues were wrong in their methods should have resigned their positions and gone public with their beliefs. Instead, most went supinely along with the misdirection.  The greatest danger to American aircraft came from surface-to-air missiles, primarily the SA-2 Guideline. The SAM sites were off-limits while under construction for fear that the Soviet advisers installing the sites might be injured. They remained off-limits to attack even after being completed, and could not be attacked until such time as the enemy radar had acquired the United States aircraft as a target and had switched from the radar-surveillance mode to the track mode, seconds before it was going to fire its missiles. Even then, however, missile sites could not be attacked if they were located in a    The Cold War, 1963-73 327  populated area or on a dike of the widespread irrigation system. Naturally enough, these became the favored place to install weapons. SAM sites within ten miles of Hanoi or Haiphong were off- limits entirely. The air bases from which the enemy MiG fighters flew were off limits to attack on all but a few occasions when such attacks were sanctioned. This meant that enemy fighters could sit in perfect safety in full view of American aircraft, taking off, attacking, and landing at times of their own choosing. It was forbidden to attack shipping in Haiphongâ€™s harbor, even though it made much more sense to sink a ship carrying three-hundred trucks with
