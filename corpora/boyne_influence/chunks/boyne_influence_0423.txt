attacking, and landing at times of their own choosing. It was forbidden to attack shipping in Haiphong’s harbor, even though it made much more sense to sink a ship carrying three-hundred trucks with one mission rather than take a thousand missions to destroy the trucks one by one as they came down the infamous Ho Chi Minh Trail. There were many other rules, all conducive to enemy safety, all dan- gerous to American flyers; if these rules were broken, the United States military men were punished, sometimes by court-martial.  With the full use of air power forfeited, McNamara next saw to it that the United States was engaged instead in the type of conflict that almost all American military leaders condemned, a long land war in Southeast Asia in which more than 500,000 troops were even- tually employed and in which more than 58,000 casualties would be incurred. In doing so, McNamara followed the advice of General Maxwell Taylor, who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for President Kennedy.

LeMay, like most military leaders, had bit- terly opposed entering the conflict in Vietnam. Once entered, how- ever, LeMay advocated winning the war in 1965 with a massive con- ventional bombing campaign directed against ninety-four North Vietnamese targets.

LeMay retired on January 31, 1965, being replaced by General John P. McConnell as Chief of Staff. The like- able McConnell lacked LeMay’s combat experience and did not have the personal wherewithal to challenge M
