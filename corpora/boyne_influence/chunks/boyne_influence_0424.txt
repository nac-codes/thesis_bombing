The like- able McConnell lacked LeMayâ€™s combat experience and did not have the personal wherewithal to challenge McNamara, in part because of a drinking problem.  328 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  McNamara decided that the war was to be conducted like corpo- rate accounting, with minute attention directed to the number of sorties flown, bombs dropped, and bodies counted, along with other totally irrelevant but highly quantifiable details. In the mud- dled process, it escaped notice that McNamara was not concentrat- ing on the ends of achieving strategic objectives, but was instead focused on those means that could be statistically quantified.

The possibili- ty of whether or not a victory could be secured by air power was debated all through the long agony of the Vietnamese war. But, as will be shown below, it was finally proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that air power could achieve victory in Vietnam in the eleven- day Linebacker II campaign of December 1972.  Air Power in Vietnam  Air-power naysayers are quick to point out that air power was not successful in bringing about victory in the Vietnam War. Air-power loyalists insist that air power was not applied correctly for almost the entire war, and that when it was, in December 1972, it worked.
