th Vietnam was far stronger, it was beaten into the ground by just such an air campaign.  It is intoxicating to think what air power’s influence on history    The Cold War, 1963-73 333  might have been if Johnson had elected to defeat North Vietnam in the manner described above. He almost certainly would have been reelected, perhaps even fulfilling his dream of the “Great Society,” and there might never have been a Nixon presidency.

The people of South Vietnam would not have experienced the harsh punishments handed out by the conquerors from the North—and the people of North Vietnam would have had a chance to get rid of the shabby, impoverished relic of their Communist government.

When the bombing of the North was resumed after an almost four- year interval, the North Vietnamese would possess the most sophis- ticated and powerful integrated air-defense system in history.  The Limits of Air Power, or the Limits of Political Will?  Some observers have used the Vietnam War as a measure of the limits of air power.
