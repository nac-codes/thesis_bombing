be a learning experience for SAC, which had dictated that the bombers were not to take evasive action from either SAMs or MiGs on the long run in from the Initial Point (IP) to bomb release. This costly measure was enforced to ensure that the main targets were hit with a minimum of collateral damage.  With four years to prepare, and a very limited geographical area to defend, the North Vietnamese were ready with the most power- ful integrated air-defense system in history.  On the first night of operations, three B-52s were shot down by SAMs out of the 129 engaged in the mission, for a 2.3-percent loss  The Cold War, 1963-73 339  rate. SAC rigidity was revealed on the second day, when the ninety- one missions were run with exactly the same procedures—aircraft attacking in three-ship cells (radar formations) over a seventy-mile- long axis. This time six B-52s were shot down and a seventh badly damaged—an unacceptable 6.6-percent loss rate, and 7.7-percent loss rate if the badly damaged aircraft is counted.  The losses dictated a change in tactics, and on each of the next two nights, only thirty-three B-52s attacked, and emphasis was shift- ed to destroying SAM installations and storage facilities. From December 20 to December 24, three more B-52s were shot down, but enemy resistance was perceptibly weakening."  After a thirty-six-hour stand-down for Christmas, bombing was resumed, with the intensity and the focus of the bombing stunning North Vietnamese leaders, who for the first time could see real air power in action.  December 26 saw renewed bombing, with new tactics. This time 120 B-52s struck ten different targets within a fifteen-minute peri- od—the results were devastating, and the North Vietnamese leaders inquired of Washington if January 8 would be a suitable day for resuming negotiations. Two more B-52s were lost to SAMs, a sad but acceptable 1.7-percent loss rate.  Sixty B-52 sorties were flown in each of the next three nights, with the last two B-52s bei
