d the fighting qualities of their  348 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  armies. They launched their war of revenge at two o’clock in the afternoon of October 6, 1973. In the east, Egyptian forces swarmed across the Suez Canal. In the north, well-trained and well-led Syrian forces swept down toward the Golan Heights. Both Egyptian and Syrian troops fought well, surprising the Israeli Army with defeat in every battle, and most important of all, bringing their incredible antiaircraft and SAM defenses along with them.  Israel expected the usual formula to apply: the Israeli Air Force would first blunt the Arab attack, then destroy the Arab Air Force and prepare the way for the Israeli Army counterattack. None of this happened, for the Soviet Union had advised Sadat correctly: Arab antiaircraft artillery and SAMs shot the Israeli Air Force out of the sky, while their newly inspired armies gave the Israeli ground forces more than they could handle. The Israeli armored forte of the past, the slashing tank counterattack, proved useless, as the Arab soldiers were provided with masses of anti-tank missiles that turned the Israeli tanks into blazing torches. The anti-tank weapon system that proved so deadly to Israeli armor was called the Sagger. The Sagger was a wire-guided missile literally flown by a gunner who operated a joystick, watching the missile’s flight and_ steering it right/left/up/down toward the target. The Sagger had an effective range of about a mile, perfect for desert terrain. Because the “gun- ner/pilot” could be located up to a hundred yards from the missile launcher, the Sagger was fairly safe to fire. Infantrymen carried the whole system in a suitcase-size package. The Arab forces thus added the densest anti-tank missile defense capability to their highly effec- tive air-defense system.  The Arab forces could probably have completely overrun the state of Israel within a few days, but were held back by Sadat’s strat- egy of just taking a strip of
