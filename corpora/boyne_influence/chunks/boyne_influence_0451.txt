ces retreated. Israel’s threat was also made known to Washington, and is considered by many historians to be the vital factor in expediting the airlift that fol- lowed.  The second near-instance of using ultimate air power came when the United States responded to a perceived Soviet threat by issuing a Defense Readiness Condition (Def Con) III alert about midnight on October 24. This action placed the nation in a state of increased readiness, and might have triggered a Soviet response that could have heightened the crisis.

On October 28, Egyptian and Israeli mil- itary officials met for the first time in twenty-five years to discuss dis- engagement. An agonizingly slow armistice process followed under UN jurisdiction in which the combatant forces were gradually drawn apart with UN peacekeeping forces acting as a buffer.

It was a partial step toward peace, but one that left the problem of Palestine unresolved.

The purpose was to prevent Iraq from develop- ing a nuclear weapon. The F-16s dropped a total
