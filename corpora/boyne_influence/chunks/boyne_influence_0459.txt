of air power for the most part, and were willing to have its nuances examined. In biblical terms, if Douhet, Mitchell, and Trenchard were St. John the Baptist announc- ing a coming, the current air-power philosophers are more in the mode of St. Augustine, preaching to a (not always receptive) choir.  In at least one instance, a philosopher of air power had the plea- sure of seeing the ideas he put forward as theory materialize as fact in actual combat. This philosopher was Colonel John Warden, who flew 226 combat missions in Vietnam as a forward air controller, and later commanded the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing at Bitburg Air Base, Germany.  Colonel Warden asserted in his 1988 book The Air Campaign: Planning for Combat that aerospace leaders should focus on translat- ing national political objectives and strategic military goals into the- ater campaign plans. As logical as this assertion sounds, it was rarely practiced in the past. Warden believed that air power could achieve those objectives and goals swiftly and at minimum costs. Just as Douhet, Mitchell, and Trenchard had emphasized “vital centers,” Warden emphasized striking at the enemy’s center of gravity (COG), i.e. attacking the enemy where he is most vulnerable, and where an attack will be decisive. (This is the opposite of the great nineteenth- century military philosopher Carl von Clausewitz’s concept of the center of gravity, which was always the center of greatest strength.)  Warden developed a model of five concentric rings. Each ring depicted individual COGs, ranging outward from leadership at the center to successive rings of organic essentials, infrastructures, pop- ulation, and fielded forces.*  Given today’s capabilities with stealth aircraft and precision- guided munitions, it was Warden’s belief that well-planned strikes could take out the leadership ring, not necessarily by killing every- one involved, but by cutting off their ability to control their forces and thus inducing a physical paraly
