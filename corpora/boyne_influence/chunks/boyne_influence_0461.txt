cutable air campaign.  In looking back over air-power philosophy, however, one finds that although the terms may be different, the basic idea has remained the same: air power permits the avoidance of a long war and high attrition by striking at the heart of the enemy and para- lyzing his ability to fight. The greatest differences lie not in the philosophies of various periods, but in the means that philosophers of those periods had at hand. If, for example, Trenchard had some- how been presented with stealth bombers and precision-guided munitions, he would almost certainly have modified his plans from attacking industrial centers to making exactly the same sort of sur- gical strikes that Warden and others now call for. The same is true for Douhet, Mitchell, Arnold, Harris, LeMay, and the others. They articulated philosophies of air power based on the resources that were available to them, or, more accurately, that they thought they could obtain in the relatively near future. Not one of these leaders would have preferred to slaughter tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians if they could instead have killed the ten or twenty key people who stood in the way of peace. The means were simply not  Post World War II Middle-East Conflicts, Terror, and the Modern Air War 357  available to them, and hence their philosophies of air power were bound to be less precise.  The most important fact to focus upon in considering the relative merit of the various philosophies of air power is that the means to achieve true air power did not occur until 1945, and the means to achieve true air power without the use of nuclear weapons did not occur until 1991.  Sadly, the means to achieve true air power may not be available to future leaders, not because of a loss of technical expertise, but because of the change in the nature of warfare.
