ut because of the change in the nature of warfare. With the battle no longer between alliances of great nations, or between two super- powers, or even between a great power and a rogue state such as Iraq, but instead between the civilized world and terrorists, even modern stealth and precision-guided weapons may not be the answer. The concept of killing or paralyzing the leaders of a nation is not fully equivalent to the killing of the leaders of an extraterritori- al organization such as al-Qaeda.

Ironically, with the persistent and increasing threat of rogue nations developing weapons of mass destruction, the industrialized nations may be thrust back into an age when the chosen response will inevitably be nuclear weapons, with the contemporary concerns about collateral damage ruthlessly put aside in the battle for survival.  Air Power in the Persian Gulf War  It is far too early to assess the influence of air power on history in terms of the Gulf War, but it is possible to examine the effect of air power on the outcome of that war, upon the Cold War, and upon subsequent Major Regional Contingencies (MRC). The survey will also give insight into the fact that there is no guarantee that air power will always be applied effectively, despite the demonstration of “how to” in the Gulf War, and the subsequent major improve- ments in technology.  Iraq had expended more than $40 billion and 100,000 lives during the eight-year war with Iran.
