and control air- craft, stealth attack aircraft, and precision-guided munitions.  Two units of six helicopters each crossed the border at 2:20 A.M. and took out specific radar sites to punch an initial hole in the Iraqi air-defense system. Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk stealth fight- ers followed to attack targets deep within Iraq with precision-guid- ed munitions of uncanny accuracy. No one knew for sure that stealth would work, but it functioned perfectly on the first night, and every night thereafter. The third element of the one-two-three strike was a flood of thirty-five CALCM (Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missiles) fired from Boeing B-52s that had taken off from Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, fifteen hours (and many refuelings) before. The B-52s were airborne for thirty-five hours, performing the longest combat mission in history up to that time. CALCMs were joined by TLAMS (Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles) launched from naval vessels.  This combination of helicopters, F-117s, and cruise missiles opened the way for a blinding attack by 650 coalition aircraft, including 400 strike planes. Within the first twenty-four hours of Desert Storm, the coalition forces had established air superiority, decapitated Saddam’s command and control system, shut down Iraq’s electrical production, and destroyed many SAM sites and antiaircraft batteries.  The coalition air forces targeted electrical plants, command cen- ters, roads, bridges, and government structures, each chosen with    360 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  the maximum consideration of avoiding collateral damage to the civilian populace.  There followed forty-three days of sustained attacks, during which the coalition flew 109,876 sorties and dropped more than 85,000 tons of bombs. Air Force tankers flew 15,434 sorties, conducted 45,955 refuelings, most within a very small area, and many within the actual combat zone.” About 7,400 tons of precision munitions were expended, of which about 30 percent w
