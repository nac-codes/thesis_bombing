15,434 sorties, conducted 45,955 refuelings, most within a very small area, and many within the actual combat zone.” About 7,400 tons of precision munitions were expended, of which about 30 percent was dropped by the F-117As. This small percentage of the total (about 9 percent) accounted for 75 percent of the damage." It was warfare on a scale of size and a measure of precision that was totally without precedent.  So successful was the air campaign that when the massive ground campaign was launched on February 24, the way was so well prepared for it that only a hundred hours were required to achieve the degree of victory desired by the Bush administration. During those hundred hours, air power continued to support the advance of ground forces.  In the afterglow of victory, the principal leaders of the coalition, including President Bush, General Powell, and his Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, made comments to the effect that the war had been won by air power. Due deference was paid to the bravery and skill of the ground and sea components, but the fact was obvi- ous—particularly to the Soviet Union—that United States air power had transformed warfare, and that no other country, including those of the coalition, had anything to compare to it. It was the advent of “differential air power” in which the power of the United States’ air forces meet all criteria for applying air power as an instru- ment of national policy.”  Perhaps the most monumental influence of the Gulf War was upon the perception of the leaders of the Soviet Union, both mili- tary and political. The United States’ tour de force in the Gulf War served notice to the world that a new age of warfare had arrived. The general effect upon an already shaky Soviet Union was immense. Economics and political expediency dictated a change in doctrine that had been fundamental to the Soviet Union for decades that wars would be won by offensive action, with a first strike the pre- ferred option.
