The Clinton administration was strongly opposed to any thought of a ground campaign, but did supply additional air assets.  Strong NATO air attacks did not begin until the fourth week of the campaign, and on May 3 a significant attack by USAF F-117s destroyed much of Yugoslavia’s electric power production. Although there were embarrassments, such as the bombing of the Chinese Embassy on May 7, the bombing campaign continued at the rate of about 250 sorties per day, and seemed to be having effect upon the Yugoslav economy.

Yet many observers believe that Milosevic’s capitulation had more to do with an increase in Kosovo Liberation Army action and a word of warning from Russia than the bombing itself.’°  Terrorism and Technology  The terror attacks of September 11, 2001, upon the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, with the subsequent campaign against the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan may prove to be the ulti- mate test of the influence of air power on history.  The situation is unusual in that it pits a shadowy world of terror- ism, using suicide bombers to strike innocent civilians, against the most modern technological giant in the world. Unlike the Cold War, where the opposition leaders were rational and concerned about their own survival as well as the survival of their nation, the terrorist leaders are (to the Western mind) irrational and unpredictable. And again, unlike the Cold War, where weapons of mass destruction were kept in check because of the certainty of massive retaliation, the ter- rorists are not inhibited by the thought of them or their countrymen being destroyed, but in fact welcome death as martyrdom.  Brilliantly employed air power to date has been able to eject the Taliban from power and to hound
