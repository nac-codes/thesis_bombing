will work against terror- ism. One would hope that the West, led by the United States in align- ment with the United Nations, will somehow muddle through perhaps decades of threats, of inconvenience, of expense, and even some level of physical harm from the terrorists. During this time there may be changes in the fervor and the direction of the Muslim world, signs of which are already apparent in Iran. If terrorist acts never again reached the horror of the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and if even the lower-level attacks such as the suicide bomb- ing in Israel were to diminish steadily over the years, the situation might, in half a century, resolve itself without radical action.  One method that might ultimately lead to such a hopeful solu- tion would be a huge modern Marshall Plan, in which the West and the wealthy Arab nations would provide the capital, resources, and leadership to energize the economies of Arab nations all over the world, bringing them up from their terrible poverty, and offering hope to their young. If in this effort, both sides would put aside con- flict, and direct their military budgets into constructive channels of improved industry and agriculture, the problem might be solved, not in fifty years but perhaps in twenty.  Such a possibility is no doubt Pollyannish. The real question, of course, is whether the terrorists and their sponsoring nations will    Post World War II Middle-East Conflicts, Terror, and the Modern Air War 365  have the restraint necessary to permit the West to be even grudg- ingly temperate in its actions. The impetus toward the use of a major weapon of mass destruction is great; if the September 11 attacks were a high point in terrorism, a nuclear weapon exploded in a major Western capital—Washington, London, Paris—would be the apotheosis of terrorism. Given this trend, restraining terrorists is doubtful, even though they and the nations that support them are painfully aware that there are at least
