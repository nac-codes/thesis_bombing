Iraq: Air and Space Power  A new epoch in warfare opened with the brilliant operations of the United States armed services in Operation Enduring Freedom. This all-out pursuit of Al-Qaeda terrorists and the eradication of the oppressive Taliban regime in Afghanistan only hinted at the almost unbelievable proficiency—and ferocity—with which those services (and those of their coalition allies) would operate in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). This new war, intended to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein, began on the night of March 19/20, 2003 with a surprise air attack intended to “decapitate” the regime.  There followed a brilliant land, sea and air combined operation that swiftly defeated Iraqi forces and allowed President George W. Bush to announce the cessation of combat operations on May 1. A low level but painful resistance by die-hard Ba'athist members and criminal elements continued, and will undoubtedly do so for a long time to come.  Operation Iraqi Freedom was a unique display of technological power, administered with an unprecedented compassionate concern to avoid collateral damage. It is perhaps the first war ever waged in which hostile actions were waged solely against the truly evil regime in power, and where so much care was taken to shield the captive population from harm.  The armed forces of Iraq, formidable on paper, were overwhelmed by a precisely executed war plan that sought to win by effects based operations (EBO) rather than by inflicting massive damage upon the enemy.

The coalition air forces were maintained on a constant alert, operating over the entire area of responsibility (AOR) night
