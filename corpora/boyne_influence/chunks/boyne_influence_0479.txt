o the disadvantage of the coalition air forces in terms of recognition for their accomplishments.  Iraq: Air and Space Power 371  The situation was far different with the ground forces, where embedded reporters rode to the front in armored vehicles, and thus reported the ground advances on an almost hourly basis.  Yet it was the continuous air attacks that sapped the strength of the Iraqi divisions, taking them far below the 50 percent level that is usually regarded as adequate for their elimination as a coherent fighting force. One estimate had Saddam's main battle tank force of some 700 reduced to a few dozen by May 1.  An unusual aspect of the air war, never envisaged by any previous generation of air-power philosophers, was the order-of-magnitude increase in the ability of fighters, bombers and even unmanned aerial vehicles to take out targets. The Northrop Grumman B-2A Spirit was able to strike as many as sixteen different targets with precision-guided munitions in a single raid.

In one instance, the Northrop Grumman B-2A stealth bomber demonstrated its versatility by dropping a bomb load of unguided bombs on a target.  Background to the War  The United States was certain that Iraq had possessed and used weapons of mass destruction in the past. The future use of such weapons, either locally against Israel or another neighboring state, or by provision of such weapons to al-Qaeda or other terrorists, was potentially fatal to the United States. President George W. Bush was determined to eliminate all doubt by removing Saddam Hussein's cruel and repressive regime.  He was opposed in the United Nations by a number of countries, including Russia, France and Germany. Each of those countries had its own rationale
