Currently sunk in poverty, the Muslim states have to reorient themselves to the creation of jobs and the advantages of a consumer society, and to turn away from the blind hatred of “infidels.”  The War Begins  The war began with an amazing demonstration of flexibility as General Tommy Franks attacked on the ground first (“G” Day) and then in the air (“A” Day).

Air power was used to cover the flanks as the 3rd peeled off individual battalions to stop Iraqi forces from intervening.    376 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  Sandstorms Not as Big a Problem as Anticipated  On March 24 100 mile-per-hour sandstorms obscured the battlefield, slowing operations of both land vehicles and helicopters.

The “Bone” as it is called, dropped as many as twenty-four of their Global Positioning System/inertially-guided JDAMs (Joint Direct Attack Munition) on a single mission.  Despite the weather, fourteen hundred strike missions were flown, with the major targets remaining the same:
