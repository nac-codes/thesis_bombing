Conclusion  Operation Iraqi Freedom was a brilliant military success, accomplished in spite of a series of what were either diplomatic disasters or simple foreign intransigence, based on resentment of the primacy of the United States in economic and military matters. Although there was a mutual recognition of the importance of land and sea forces in obtaining victory, air power was dominant in a way that was never possible before.

Conclusion  It is a shame that technology cannot somehow overcome the threat of terrorism through sheer brilliance, given that in the past it has done so well in overcoming threats that were equally serious at the time. Technology gave air power its (on balance) beneficial influ- ence upon history, and it might be well to review how that influence has, despite the death and destruction of wars, been benign.  Until the question of terrorism is resolved, it may be said that the first and most beneficial influence of air power on history was its contribution to the destruction of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Both of those nations were ruled by malevolent leaders who knowingly and deliberately did great harm to the people of the countries they conqueredâ€”and to their own people as well. Had they succeeded in their grandiose aims of conquering the world, the suffering would have been multiplied many times. Yet air power did make the key contributions that led to their defeat, and a badly bruised and shaken world was preserved from what would have been decades of horror and millions of additional deaths.  The second most beneficial influence of air power on history was the containment of the Soviet Union and
