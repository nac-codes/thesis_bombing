was preserved from what would have been decades of horror and millions of additional deaths.  The second most beneficial influence of air power on history was the containment of the Soviet Union and its ultimate dissolution as Communism foundered in its own economic contradictions. There were major conflicts in that process of containment, but United States air power kept the Cold War cold, and averted a World War III with the hundreds of millions of casualties that would have occurred.  The retaliatory strength of American air power served to keep Soviet and Warsaw Pact tanks within their own borders and pre- vented a first strike on the United States and its European allies. It gave hope to Soviet satellite nations, who began asserting their inde- pendence even as the Soviet Union began to crumble.  Even more remarkably, air power has influenced history the most  384 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  in totally nonmilitary ways.

Air power has provided the technology for vast improvements in agriculture, in disease control, and for compassionate relief of disaster victims.  Now air power has translated to aerospace power, as has been amply demonstrated since the Persian Gulf War. The capabilities of meteorological, intelligence-gathering, reconnaissance, and naviga- tional satellite systems have been integrated firmly into modern weapon systems, such as the Boeing E-3 Sentry airborne warning, battle management and command, control and communication air- craft, the Boeing/Northrop Grumman JSTARS land-battle manage- ment aircraft, and the Rivet Joint Boeing RC-135 real-time intelli- gence-gathering aircraft. This integration has gone beyond airborne platforms, however, and can now be found in the individual radar and fir
