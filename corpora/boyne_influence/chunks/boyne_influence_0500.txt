ning became immensely popular. There was a flood of experimenters, as well as a flood of merchandisers as the balloon craze swept first France, and then the rest of the continent and Great Britain. Those brave and rich enough to afford it sought ascensions. Those who were not had to be satisfied with the toy bal- loons sold on the street. The balloon motif was incorporated in jew- elry, furniture, clothing, even hairstyles.  Summoned to perform for King Louis XVI, Etienne Montgolfier constructed a huge hot-air balloon, more than fifty-seven feet in height and forty-one feet in diameter, and decorated in a manner fit for a king. On September 18, 1783, at Versailles, with the entire court assembled, the balloon was launched carrying a sheep, a cock, and a duck, the first animals to fly in a man-made conveyance. The intrepid animal aviators survived their two-mile flight, but the dan- ger was implicit.  Louis was immensely pleased, so much so that he awarded the brothers the Legion of Honor, the Order of St. Michael, and an annual pension. He also intimated that he looked forward to the first balloon flight by humans, and a twenty-nine-year-old scientist, Pilatre de Rozier, volunteered.    Appendix 389  Rozier was a thoughtful man who understood the dangers involved. He made a number of tethered test flights to gather experience, including one on October 17, 1783, on which he carried a friend, Andre Giraud de Vilette. Like most passengers on balloon flights, Vilete was exhilarated, but not just with the view of Paris. Instead, he immediately saw the military utility of a balloon being used for obser- vation purposes, and became the first military aviation author by writ- ing an article proclaiming this subject in the Journal de Paris. Vilette noted that the fairly inexpensive machine would be useful to an army in observing the enemyâ€™s position, maneuvers, movements, and sup- plies, and could report them by signals.* As with most seminal military articles, there was no
