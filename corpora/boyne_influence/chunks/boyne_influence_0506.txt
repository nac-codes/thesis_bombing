wise combination and given Rozier’s competence, the decision is difficult to understand. Some primitive safety precautions had been taken; for example, expanded hydrogen from the Charles was to be vented well below the fire-basket of the Montgolfier, but it was simply too risky.  Rozier, and his passenger, Pierre Ange Romain, launched at 7:00 A.M. on the morning of June 15, 1785. Twenty-three minutes into the flight, at an altitude of five thousand feet, the inevitable hap- pened. The balloons caught fire, and both men perished in the ensuing crash. (In modern times, the term Rozier has been applied to the balloon type most preferred for long-distance flights. The Breitling Orbiter 3, which flew around the world in twenty days in 1999, was a Rozier-type balloon. It used inert helium rather than hydrogen, and kerosene burners rather than burning straw.)    Appendix 393  Despite Rozier’s failure, the flight of Blanchard and Jeffries had made it obvious that England was no longer an island—and that the balloon could well be a practical military tool. Military observers began to write with notable prescience about the possibilities of using balloons in warfare. Some of the proposals might be consid- ered obvious, given that generals had always wished to “see the other side of the hill.” But it was soon noted that the balloon would be useful for reconnaissance, gathering intelligence on enemy forces and positions through observation. It became an aid to navi- gation when used as an airborne marker to guide the advance of reinforcements. Seasoned observers could use the balloon as a plat- form from which to make maps. Balloons also had defensive pur- poses, acting as airborne early-warning sentinels to guard against surprise. It was also suggested that a system of signals, including semaphores and flares, be created so that balloons could be used for long-range communications. Given that any balloon observer of the time would also certainly have commented on any observed
