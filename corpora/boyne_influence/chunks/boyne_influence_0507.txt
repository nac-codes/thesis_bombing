cluding semaphores and flares, be created so that balloons could be used for long-range communications. Given that any balloon observer of the time would also certainly have commented on any observed weather phenomena, one can immediately see that the duties pre- scribed for balloons have parallels in modern military navigational, intelligence, communication, and meteorological satellites.  But as desirable as innovation is in military journals, it is rarely given equal appreciation in military budgets, and after the first flight of the Montgolfier balloon in Paris, it took ten years and the French Revolution before serious consideration was given to the use of a military balloon.  The great patron of balloonists, King Louis XVI, lost his head to the guillotine on January 21, 1793. The revolutionary government, faced with internal disorder and at war with Austria, Britain, and Prussia, was in such military disarray that drastic remedies were sought. Among these remedies were suggestions for the use of bal- loons. These suggestions included one by Joseph Montgolfier that huge balloons be used to drop bombs on Toulon, another that bal- loons would be useful as reconnaissance platforms, and yet another that powered, steerable dirigibles be built for offensive purposes.  Amid all the suggestions, the idea that balloons could be used for observing enemy action was most feasible. On October 25, 1793, an act was passed authorizing sufficient funds to build a balloon and procure the necessary equipment for use by the Republican Army of the North.    394 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  This operation, like so many in the history of air power, would suc- ceed or fail based on the talents and energy of the men to whom the task was assigned. In this instance the choices were excellent for an engineer, Nicolas Lhomond; a scientist, Nicolas Conte; and a chemist, Jean Marie-Joseph Coutelle; were given the difficult task of preparing the hydrogen-generating apparatus.
