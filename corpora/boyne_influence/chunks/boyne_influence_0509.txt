build equipment, including hydrogen generators.  Despite the technical nature of their task, the Aérostiers were sol- diers first and foremost, and were given the same training as regu- lar troops. Aware of the specialized nature of their calling, however, Coutelle saw to it that they received special uniforms. The coat, waistcoat, and breeches were blue, piped with red. The collar and cuffs were black, with red facings, and the buttons, interestingly, used infantry instead of engineer patterns. Given that much of the balloon work was dirty, Coutelle also devised a fatigue uniform of  Appendix 395  blue cotton slacks and jacket. He did not want his men to be con- fused with the ordinary French infantry.  This sensible, straightforward, and effective approach would be sadly missing in many later efforts to use the balloon at war. Coutelle’s work became the standard by which the French operated their balloon corps.  He had managed well during a time of rapid change. Authorized on April 2, the unit inflated its balloon, the Entreprenant (Enterprise), and went into action near Maubeuge, in the north of France, near the Belgian border, during the end of May. Austrian and Dutch troops confronted the French, who were commanded by General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, a short, fat little man of unheroic aspect. The son of a surgeon and a consummate survivor, Jourdan had served King Louis XVI in the American War of Independence.

In his role as hero of the French Revolution, Jourdan, the com- mander of the Army of the Moselle, welcomed the arrival of Coutelle and his Aérostiers. (There was no little irony in this inci- dent, as Jourdan had the year before summarily dismissed Coutelle’s offer of help, advising h
