Jourdan may have been silent in his reports, but he nonetheless called for the balloon to accompany his campaign, serving at the Battles of Liége and Brussels. The result of Jourdan’s campaign was the occupation of the Rhineland and Holland, with the hotly desired peace negotiations following in 1795.  Subsequent events strengthen the case for the early influence of air power on history. The new French Republic, financially exhaust- ed by the extravagance of the Bourbons and by war and revolution, was so strapped for funds that it often could not provide shoes or arms to its battalions. Nonetheless, not only did it authorize the con- struction of a new balloon, the Martial, it also provided for a balloon depot near Aix-la-Chapelle, complete with supplies and an appara- tus for making hydrogen. A second company of balloonists was enrolled, and, most significant, a permanent training school for military aeronautics to be known as Ecole Nationale Aérostatique    398 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  was established at Meudon. It would go on to become a historic part of French aviation as a research center for many years, and then as the repository of the collection of the French Air Museum.  These were acute, far-thinking steps that could not have been undertaken if the results of aerial observations had not been gen- erally accepted as extremely valuable. They were also, it is sad to say, far-thinking steps that would not be repeated for decades.  The new “balloon school” was a serious endeavor, tripling Coutelle’s original company, and operated according to the stan- dards of the French Army, which maintained strict discipline and organization despite the changes brought about by the revolution. The scientist, Nicolas Conte, who had been Coutelle’s colleague dur- ing the first experiments with balloons and in establishing the first company of Aérostiers, was named to head the school. Coutelle was rewarded with the command of the second company of Aérostiers.
