rdi- nary infighting and continual defeats of Italian forces by the Austrians, with the result that Venice came under siege in May 1849. During the course of that siege no less than 60,000 shells fell upon the city from Austrian guns, but none had as much long-term polit- ical effect as a handful of ineffectual bombs dropped from the air. Lieutenant Franz Uchatius, an Austrian artillery officer, envisaged the use of balloons to drop bombs upon the city. He immediately organized two “aerial torpedo” units, each one consisting of one hundred hot-air balloons, each eighteen feet in diameter, and made, like the earliest Montgolfiers, of paper and cloth. Each balloon car- ried one bomb of his own design, a pear-shaped vessel filled with gunpowder. Uchatius also saw to it that the necessary wind screens (to protect the balloon when tethered close to the ground), wagons, and other equipment were provided. Smaller balloons were used to test the air currents over the city. Tests showed that because the pre- vailing winds ruled out release from the land, it was necessary to equip a ship so that the balloons could be released from the sea. As a result, the aptly named paddle steamer Vulkan became the first aircraft carrier in history. The Vulkan was positioned so that the wind would drift the released balloons over the city. The bombs were dropped by a conventional burning fuse mechanism, timed to release the bombs over Venice. (An account in the March 1849 edi- tion of Scientific American quotes the Vienna Presse as follows, “[T]hey will be fired by electro magnetism by means of a long isolated cop- per wire with a large galvanic battery placed on the shore. The bomb falls perpendicularly and explodes on reaching the ground.” This early version of a modern wire-guided missile seems highly improb- able, but Uchatius was unusually creative.
