ms highly improb- able, but Uchatius was unusually creative. (He later became the com- mander of the Vienna Arsenal and invented, among other things, a    402 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  new method of casting artillery pieces and, as a military training aid, a forerunner of the motion picture projector he termed the “Lantern Wheel of Light.”)  The results of the aerial bombardment were minimal, as might be expected, with the Venetian defenders claiming that only one bomb had dropped within the city. Paradoxically, this air-power nonevent was to have tremendous influence on history, for it set in motion a train of thought that civilian populations would succumb in terror if bombarded by air. The fact that before succumbing the Venetians had endured 60,000 cannon shells (also arriving through the air) was ignored, as was the virtual zero result of the balloon bombs. Instead, the myth grew that bombing by air would place such an emotional strain on the civilian populace that they would panic and surrender. The idea was picked up by Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, and began to be debated by governments. Russia, in particular, sought that bombs from balloons be prohibited. The net result was that the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare included a provision stating: “It is for- bidden to attack or bombard by any means whatsoever, towns, villages, dwellings or buildings that are not defended.”  The intent of the Hague convention to prevent aerial bombard- ment was ignored as military leaders in every nation began to plan to use the air weapon as soon as they had the means to do so. Yet the sentiment behind the anti-bombing provision grew stronger and stronger until it became a potent political force, a decider of national existence, in the years before World War II.  How Not to Do It  For most of the nineteenth century, balloonists became entertainers who made money from their profession much as circus aerial artists made money from theirs. Ballooning was also
