.  How Not to Do It  For most of the nineteenth century, balloonists became entertainers who made money from their profession much as circus aerial artists made money from theirs. Ballooning was also adapted to advertising and even to aerial photography. In Paris, Gaspard Félix Tournachon, who used the dramatic name Nadar professionally, took the first aerial photographs, and was far-sighted enough to patent the concept of aerial mapping by the use of overlapping photographs. In 1863, Nadar created the largest balloon built to that time, Le Géant (The Giant). It was 196 feet high and carried a two-story observation car with a built- in photographic studio. Unsuccessful, it gained notoriety rather than fame, but it nonetheless inspired a generation of large balloons.  Appendix 403  In the United States there were dozens of balloonists who made names for themselves by public ascensions and long-distance flights. Among this group, there emerged four well-intentioned if often argu- mentative aeronauts —James Allen, John Wise, John La Mountain, and Thaddeus S. C. Lowe—who were determined to place themselves and their balloons at the service of their country when the Civil War erupted. Fate treated them as unkindly as they treated each other.  If the four balloonists and their followers had cooperated, they might have penetrated the inner workings of the Union high com- mand. Instead, they each operated alone, some with greater success than others, and they failed to make Union commanders realize exactly what it was that they had done, and more important, what they could do. Whatever their success in individual ballooning efforts, their larger failure had an adverse affect upon the appreci- ation of the potential of air power.  The long-feared Civil War erupted on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter. Three days later, President Abraham Lincoln made his optimistic call for the states to provide 75,000 militiamen for what everyone believed would be
