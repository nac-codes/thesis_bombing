861, when Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter. Three days later, President Abraham Lincoln made his optimistic call for the states to provide 75,000 militiamen for what everyone believed would be a short war. James Allen, a thirty-seven-year-old native Rhode Islander, immedi- ately volunteered his services. Allen had been flying balloons since 1857, and was widely recognized as “the New England Aeronaut.” Despite his greatest efforts, Allen’s career as the first United States military balloonist would be a failure. He was caught in the classic dilemma faced by air-power advocates of all ages. On the one hand, the novelty of his equipment was expected to work wonders upon the battlefield. On the other, the lack of experience and the pres- sures of time resulted in Allen’s going to war with balloons designed for fair-weather airshow work, supported by detailed units com- posed of men who were completely ignorant of balloon operations. Failure under these circumstances was inevitable, and the same cir- cumstances would be found in the future.  Allen himself was apparently an able man, well liked, and adapt- able to circumstance. Later in the war, when Thaddeus S. C. Lowe brought a balloon corps into existence, Allen served well, twice becoming corps commander, at Malvern Hill and again at Chancellorsville.  Veteran John Wise, a self-taught balloonist who made his first bal- loon at the age of twenty-seven, followed Allen into the contentious  404 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  fray of Civil War ballooning. In learning his profession, Wise endured crashes, hydrogen fires, and bankruptcy, but persisted with his art. He approached his calling with the point of view of a scientist, conducting various meteorological experiments and publishing two books on his profession. In the process he developed better materials for balloons and experimented with parachutes, using them to drop animals safely to the ground. Even more miraculous, he made a liv- ing by flying
