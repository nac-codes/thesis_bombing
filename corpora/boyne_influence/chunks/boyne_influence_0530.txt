It would be    410 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  interesting to know if Scott was aware that balloons had been proposed for use during his famous Mexican campaign fifteen years earlier.  Lincoln personally inspected Loweâ€™s equipment, which had been towed to the White House, and to his bright mind the experiment was highly successful; he intuitively believed that the balloon could be very useful.  There followed a brilliant sales effort by Lowe, giving demonstra- tions on the south lawn of the White House, carrying dignitaries, and actually making observations of enemy activity in the Confederate-held towns of Vienna and Fairfax, Virginia. Lowe understood how effective it was to take up a senior staff person on the combined adventure of a first balloon ascent and the direct observation of enemy troops. Nor did he neglect reporters, who rec- iprocated with favorable stories in many newspapers. Lowe then backed up his demonstrations with approving scientific apprecia- tions from his Smithsonian friend, Secretary Henry.  In short, Lowe had done with his balloon what all successful mil- itary contractors do with their products today: differentiate them from the competition (which Lowe had done by combining the bal- loon and the telegraph), then take them to the hottest market (Washington, then and now), and sell them at the highest level pos- sible (starting with the president, if possible). The next step was to attend carefully to the interests of everyone in the procurement hierarchy, from the public to the contracting officer, generating the maximum amount of publicity possible. Lowe took care of all of this promotion.  Although still lacking any formal association with the govern- ment, Lowe was pressed into service on June 22, 1861, by General McDowell, still a month away from his debacle at Bull Run.
