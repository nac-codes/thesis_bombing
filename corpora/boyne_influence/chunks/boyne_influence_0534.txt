to be raised.  Unfortunately for Porter, instead of the customary three restrain- ing ropes, only one was attached, and it had been weakened earlier when corrosive fluid from the hydrogen generator had been spilled on it. At about fifty feet up, the rope parted, and Porter was on his  Appendix 413  way to the first free-flight reconnaissance by a general officer over enemy territory.  As the balloon rose, air currents drifted it west over Confederate lines. The valve cord to release gas, normally at hand, was tucked up in the balloon netting, and could not be reached. Porter coolly made the best of a bad situation, and, using his telescope, recon- noitered the Confederate lines. He then climbed up the netting that surrounded the balloon envelope, reaching the valve cord and releasing gas—a dangerous but necessary task if he was not to be taken prisoner.  The descending balloon fell into air currents that carried him back into Federal lines, but he had misjudged the amount of gas to be released, and the balloon collapsed—into an impromptu para- chute. Porter hit the ground, stepped out of the basket, and imme- diately began sketching enemy positions that he described as having been recorded as “instantaneous impressions like a photographic instrument.” (The next general officer to fly over enemy lines would be Billy Mitchell in 1918.)  The Federal balloon operations had great psychological effect upon the Confederates, causing them to waste a great deal of time in avoiding being seen, doing their construction under cover of trees, and in general posing an uncomfortable sense of inferiority. Their natural response was to fire artillery shells at the balloon. None ever hit, but the errant shells did a great deal of damage to all of the Federal positions around the balloon sites.  Lowe was aware of the psychological effect, and when Union troops moved up the Peninsula, he flew his balloon as often as pos- sible, knowing that it would be seen in Richmond and be regarded
