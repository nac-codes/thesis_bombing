sites.  Lowe was aware of the psychological effect, and when Union troops moved up the Peninsula, he flew his balloon as often as pos- sible, knowing that it would be seen in Richmond and be regarded there as an ominous sign of the Federal presence.  On the Peninsula, Lowe and his balloon proved to be of tremen- dous value. The hesitant McClellan had become bogged down near Fair Oaks, with his forces split by a swollen Chickahominy River. Canny Joe Johnston saw an opportunity, and launched a massive attack on the smaller section of McClellan’s army. The vigilant Lowe saw the attack coming, and sent warning to McClellan, who had time to order additional troops to face Johnston. The resulting bloody two-day battle ended in a draw, but would certainly have been an overwhelming Confederate victory had it not been for Lowe’s timely intelligence.    414 THE INFLUENCE OF AIR POWER UPON HISTORY  Here the influence of air power on history is clear. Had the Union Army been destroyed on the Peninsula, Lincoln would almost cer- tainly have had to come to an accommodation with the South.  The Union generals were by now generally convinced of the util- ity—some said necessity—of the Balloon Corps. This belief was not translated to an effective command system. Lowe fell under the authority of officers who were more interested in auditing his accounts than assessing the information he provided. This approach proved to be disastrous to Lowe, who had largely ignored paperwork, channels, and common sense in his determination to get balloons into action. It was easy for the auditors to find discrep- ancies, and Lowe was suddenly on the skids.  In the meantime, the military balloon proved its use in two great battles. No balloon was present at the Battle of Antietam on September 19, 1862, and its absence was deeply felt by McClellan, who declared to Lowe that it would have been invaluable to him. Then on December 13, 1862, at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Lowe per- sonally flew in a tether
