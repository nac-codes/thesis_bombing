or the other (and sometimes both) in interpreting air intelli- gence. In fairness, however, it must be noted that as the air weapon became more familiar to military leaders, air intelligence was used in an exceedingly capable manner, as typified by the British pin- pointing Peneeminde, the site of the German experimental base for V-2 weapons, as a target in World War II, the American discovery of missile sites in Cuba, and the later intelligent achievements of the Persian Gulf War.  Even as the Civil War balloon operations dwindled because of lack of interest, Lowe continued to make efforts to be reinstated, but it was a lost cause. The Balloon Corps simply collapsed, and would not be revived in the United States until thirty years later.  The Union Balloon Corps experience was not unlike the experi- ence of the French Aérostiers. Despite giving good service, and being appreciated by some general officers, others did not have the ability to analyze and interpret the reports of the balloonists, even when those reports were furnished by qualified military officers. In both cases, the “others” outnumbered those who believed in the balloon as a weapon of war, and in both cases these “others” aban- doned the concept as soon as possible.  In closing the subject of Civil War ballooning, it should be noted that the South made periodic use of both hot-air balloons and bal- loons filled with gas from the Richmond city gas mains. There were very few hot-air balloons, and only two gas-filled balloons. One of the hot-air balloons, manned by young Captain John Randolph Bryan, made several ascensions. The most important of these was an inadvertent but significant free-flight reconnaissance in mid-April 1862, which provided valuable information on advancing Federal forces to General Johnston. The gas-filled balloons used silk in their construction, leading to the myth that they had been built from the dresses of patriotic Confederate women. Neither of the gas balloons was used in
