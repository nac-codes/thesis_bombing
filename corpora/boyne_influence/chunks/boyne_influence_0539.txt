it to the United States in 1863, during which he observed a balloon ascension. Then, in his capacity as a dashing cav- alry officer in the Wurttemburg Cavalry Brigade in 1871, he wit- nessed the French use of balloons. These early experiences would lead him, late in life, to the career in which he became world famous, and which would inaugurate a totally new phase in air power, that of strategic bombardment. The fleet of Zeppelins that bombed England during World War I had an influence on military thinking out of all proportion to the damage they caused. More important, they had great effect upon German and British planning before World War II.    Notes  Chapter 1  1.
