ll Air Force Base, Alabama, especially Marvin Fisher and Mickey Russell. Their friendly support provided access to the extensive documents and photographs of the Air Force archives. The staff of the U.S. Military Academy library at West Point, NY is acknowledged for their help in accessing the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey Reports. The New York Society Library staff was helpful in providing access to the more recent historical and biographical books. The thoughtful comments and assistance of my family, especially my daughter, Mary and son-in-law, John Boer are appreciated. Without the good-natured patience, untiring support, and keyboard skills of Rose Marie Pratt, this book would still be scribbled notes. Thanks is offered for the fortitude and foresight of Turner Publishing Company, espe- cially the president, Dave Turner, for taking on this book project, and Randy Baumgardner, Editor, and his staff for completing the book design. Every effort was made to provide accurate information and data and the author as- sumes all responsibility for errors and omissions. Corrections from the reader are invited. 5  Military Casualties in WWI As Estimated by the U.S. War Department* Total Mobilized Forces ALLIES Killed and Diedi Wound Casualties Prisoners and Missing Total Casualties CHAPTER I PRECISION BOMBING CAMPAIGN Russia France2 British Empire 8,904,467 908,371 Italy 5,615,000 650,000 U.S.3 4,355,000 Japan 12,000,000 1,700,000 8,410,000 1,357,800 126,0004 234,3004 800,000 300 Background The slaughter on the fields of France during World War I (WWI), in many ways, dictated the strategy in WWII. Air warfare theorists Douhet, Mitchell and Trenchard all stated that future warfare would move from the troop vs. troop of the 19th and early 20th century doctrine enunciated by Clauswitz. The latter's theory dictated that for one country to impose her will on another country demanded the destruction of the other's military forces which, for many nations, meant its ground forces.
