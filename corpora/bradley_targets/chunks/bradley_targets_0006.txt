g WWI, the Germans bombed London and Paris and. just as the war ended, the Allies were preparing to bomb Ber- lin. General Billy Mitchell commanded the American Air Corps and tactics were developed to use the airplane to bomb enemy troops and cities.

No longer would troops face troops in a stalemated trench warfare. Now the plane would take the battle to the sources of strength in war; the enemy's warmaking industry. When this is destroyed, then the intruder can impose his will on the opposition. The Italian general, Guilio Douhet, published the gory details in his book The Command of the Air (1). Gen. Mitchell is best remem- bered for sinking old German battleships and then subsequently being court martialed for insubordination. This bizarre turn of events came about when he would not keep quiet about air power and how it would win the future wars.
