of Kyushu, Honshu and Shikoku and a base for the west- ern naval thrust. Based upon European experience it was as sumed that fighter escort would be needed and therefore Iwo Jima was captured to provide the base for P-51 fighter escort The Saipan Island invasion was an awakening blow to the Japa- nese on their home islands. Industrialists realized that thei factories, heretofore assumed to be out of range of America bombers, were now within bombing range of the B-29s. 1 Japanese were apparently well informed despite the secret clas sifications of the B-29 characteristics. If the operating range of the B-17 was approximately 700 miles, one might assume that a follow on plane would double this range which was ap- proximately correct. High explosive (HE) ordinance dumped indiscriminately on urban centers is a very inefficient and ineffective use of this weapon system. To truly saturate an area with HE requires about 300 tons per square mile from a large force of bombers. Consequently, area bombing with incendiary bombs (IB), was espoused by Mr. Allan Mitchie (3) and vigorously pursued by RAF Bomber Command under Air Marshall Sir Arthur "Bomber" Harris. American air power theorists preached a gospel of precision target bombing. The Norden Bombsight made this possible. The famous bomb sight with which the B- 17 was equipped was America's secret weapon during WWII. This device, coupled with the airplane, could precisely attack a strategic target system deep inside enemy territory. In 1941, Air Corps planners came up with AWPD-1. This document detailed how American air power would be used in an antici- pated war against Germany and Italy. Air power would be projected over mass troop concentration and attack the enemy's war-making sinews. In 1940, it was obvious that the mobility of modern armies depend on oil and the enemy's oil industry On 15 June 1944, Saipan was invaded and declared se- cure on 9 July 1944. On 24 June 44, Tinian was invaded and declared secured on 1 Au
