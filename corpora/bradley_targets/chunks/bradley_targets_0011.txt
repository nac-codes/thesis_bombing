ity of modern armies depend on oil and the enemy's oil industry On 15 June 1944, Saipan was invaded and declared se- cure on 9 July 1944. On 24 June 44, Tinian was invaded and declared secured on 1 August 1944. Guam was invaded on 21 July 1944 and was declared secure on 10 August 1944. We 8 lost 3,426 killed in action (KIA) taking Saipan, 389 KIA tak- ing Tinian and 1,290 KIA O KIA taking Guam. Japanese casualties were 23,811 KIA and 921 POWs in the assault on Saipan; 5,000 KIA and 250 POWs during the Tinian assault; and 10,693 KIA and 98 POW's during the Guam assault. Almost immediately following the invasion on Saipan, Engineering and Seabee bat- talions were at work in preparing the B-29 airfields. These airfields had runways 8,500 feet (1.6 miles) long and had to take a heavier load compared to the B-17 and B-24 airfields which were in common use up to that point in WWII. Aircraft production rose from 445 planes in 1930 to 5,088 planes in 1941 which abetted its planned aggression in Southeast Asia. The four major manufacturers were Nakajima Aircraft Co., Mitsubishi Aircraft Co., Kawasaki Aircraft Co. and Tachikawa Aircraft Co. They produced 67% of all aircraft produced and 75% of combat type aircraft manufactured between 1941 and 1945. Aircraft production figures with comparison to German and U.S. production during the same years are reproduced in Table I. The 73rd Bombardment Wing (BW) training at Victoria, Grand Island and Pratt and Salina airfields in Kansas were origi- nally scheduled to go to China-Burma-India (CBI) theater, but after the capture of the Marianas, they were reassigned to Saipan. In addition, this meant a change in bombing tactics. They were training to bomb at night by radar while their mis- sion, under Gen. Hansell, would be daylight precision bomb- ing in formation (4). In accordance with the precision bombing theory it is de- sirable to select a component of an industry which is highly concentrated at a few selected targets. The most famo
