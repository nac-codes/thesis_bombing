ily basis as follows: Hansell, as a major in 1940, helped to write AWPD-1, the planning document for the strategic air offensive of WWII. He commanded a Bomb Wing and Division in the 8th Air Force and Gen. Arnold knew him very well. He was selected to imple- ment the B-29 bombing campaign against the Japanese Em- pire from the Marianas. 24 November 1944 After several postponements due to weather, Bomber Com- mand Mission No. 7 was flown with 111 B-29s participating. As described by Maj. Cotton (7), planes flew in formation at low altitude from Saipan to near Japan where the formation climbed to the bombing altitude of 32,000 feet. Only 24 planes found the Musashino plant and dropped their 60 ton GP and incendiary bombs. According to Rust (8) 48 bombs fell in the target area destroying 1% of the buildings and damaging 2.4% Hansell was the apostle of daylight precision bombing in formation, as practiced in England by the 8th Air Force where the initial target system to assure air supremacy was the Ger- man aircraft industry. The Japanese aircraft industry as de- scribed by the U. S. Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) (5) got its start in the 1930s by making licensing arrangements with aircraft manufacturers in Germany, Britain and the U.S. 9  PAPER 32803 of the machinery based on photo analysis. The radar target was the Tokyo dock and urban area and 59 B-29s hit this target and five bombed targets of opportunity (TO). Six planes failed to bomb due to mechanical difficulties and 12 planes aborted on the way to Japan. Over Tokyo, the B-29s met 125 Japanese fighters and moderate flak. One B-29 was rammed by a Tony and crashed into the sea 20 miles offshore with all lost. An- other B-29 ditched and all 12 aboard were rescued. B-29 gun- ners claimed seven Japanese planes destroyed, 18 probable and nine damaged (See Table 3). Tokyo Rose described the mission as follows: (4) "Enemy bombers appeared over Tokyo today in large groups of ten. They did not achieve great tangible bo
