ed, 18 probable and nine damaged (See Table 3). Tokyo Rose described the mission as follows: (4) "Enemy bombers appeared over Tokyo today in large groups of ten. They did not achieve great tangible bombing results because of effective interception by Japanese fighter planes. Upon interception the big bombers fled to the southern and northern outskirts of the city. Several enemy bombers were knocked down." 27 November 1944 In accordance with standard offensive doctrine - don't give the enemy a breather - 81 B-29s headed for the same target on 27 November 1944 but the weather was overcast and 49 planes hit the Tokyo dock and urban area by radar and 13 hit targets of opportunity. All together the planes dropped 114 tons GP and 64 tons IB, but none on Musashino. One plane ditched with all aboard lost. The Japanese were not taking the B-29 attacks against the Empire lightly. Normally, take-off for daylight missions was in the early hours after midnight. On 27 November 1944, two Betty bombers hit the 499th Bomb Group dispersal area on Saipan destroying one B-29 and, five minutes later, 17 Zekes strafed Isely Field and destroyed two more B-29s and severely damaged seven others. Most of the Zekes were shot down by fighters and antiaircraft fire. As described in (9), microwave early warning radar (MEW) was not initially installed on Saipan under the assumption that few Japanese planes could make the approximately 1,200 mile trip from Iwo Jima to Saipan and back, but suicide missions were now becoming standard mili- tary doctrine in Japan's increasingly desperate situation. 3 December 1944 Mission No. 10 was run against the same target #357 with 86 B-29s airborne and 60 bombing the target and eight others hitting the Tokyo dock and urban areas and 7 TO. This was a disastrous mission for the 73rd BW (4). Flying in the lead plane of a formation at 32,000 feet were Col. R. T. King, Com- mander of the 500th BG and Col. Byron E. Brugge, A-3 Deputy Chief of Staff of the 73rd BW as
