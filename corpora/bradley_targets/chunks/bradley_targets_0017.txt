ammed by a Tony which damaged the No. 3 engine and had to drop out of the formation. The plane survived 131 fighter attacks and made it back to Isely Field. Some references give six planes lost on this mission (4) and Rust (8) gives five planes lost. From the air the Musashino Aircraft Engine Plant looked unscathed after three missions with the loss of nine B-29s. But the USSBS (5) states that, following the first raid on the plant, frantic, almost panicky efforts were made to disperse plant pro- duction and manufacturing levels dropped dramatically (see Figures 2 and 3). The direct effects of the effort were minimal, the indirect effect was great. 13 December 1944 Gen. Hansell next struck the Mitsubishi Aircraft Engine Plant in Nagoya with better success in placing bombs on tar- get. On 13 December 1944, 90 B-29s took off for the Mitsubishi plant and 71 planes bombed visually the primary target and nine the secondary target. Each plane carried 2.5 tons with two squadrons carrying 500 lb. GP bombs, and one squadron carrying incendiary clusters. Bombing results were excellent with 40% of the plant damaged. Nagoya (See Figure 6) is about 35 miles up a bay which became known to the 73rd BW as "Flak Alley" since antiaircraft guns were mounted on both sides of the bay. There were 108 Japanese fighter passes at the B-29s. No plane went down but 35 were damaged and four ditched on the return trip. Of the four crews, only one crew was rescued. At this point one can appreciate Gen. Harold Arnold's request to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) for the cap- ture of Iwo Jima. This was approved in October 1944 with the invasion set for 19 February 45. The island was too small to stage many troops through for an invasion of the home islands but capture would serve three goals: 1) eliminate the harassing attacks of the Marianas by Japanese bombers from Iwo, 2) pro- vide bases for P-51 fighter escorts for the B-29 and 3) provide a landing base for returning crippled B-29s. 18 December
