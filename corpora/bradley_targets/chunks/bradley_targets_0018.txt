ate the harassing attacks of the Marianas by Japanese bombers from Iwo, 2) pro- vide bases for P-51 fighter escorts for the B-29 and 3) provide a landing base for returning crippled B-29s. 18 December 1944 B-29s, 89 strong, took off for the Mitsubishi aircraft plant but only 19 bombed visually and 44 planes bombed by radar. Again, the results were excellent. Flak was described as mod- erate and there were 188 fighter attacks, but the fighter attacks were described as nonaggressive. One plane was shot down over the target and two planes ditched on the return trip with 7 men rescued from one ditched plane. The fourth plane that was lost ran out of gas as it was landing and crashed but all aboard survived. On this mission gunners claimed five Japa- nese fighters shot down. ary targets and TO. Thirty planes turned back for various rea- sons. One plane, carrying Maj. William H. Walker, engaged in a gallant but futile fight against Japanese fighters, principally the Tony. The plane called "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was rammed three times and fell straight down from 20,000 feet. The ag- gressiveness of Japanese fighters on this particular mission was attested to by the 21 Japanese fighters which were claimed by B-29 gunners. Another plane ditched on the return flight with four crewmen rescued and 14 planes suffered battle damage. Two hundred seventy two fighter attacks were endured. The flak was described as meager to intense. The Nakajima Musashino and Mitsubishi Nagoya aircraft engine plants were proving to be tough nuts to crack. 22 December 1944 The Mitsubishi aircraft engine plant in Nagoya was hit again on 22 December 1944 by 78 B-29s. The bomb load was changed to 2.75 tons M76 IB. Weather conditions necessi- tated radar bombing by 48 B-29s from 28,000 to 32,600 feet. Radar from that altitude was relatively inaccurate and the bombs were scattered with only minor damage to the plant. Fighter opposition was aggressive with Japanese making 59 attacks and B-29 gunners claiming
