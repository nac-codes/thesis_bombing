m that altitude was relatively inaccurate and the bombs were scattered with only minor damage to the plant. Fighter opposition was aggressive with Japanese making 59 attacks and B-29 gunners claiming nine Japanese fighters. No B-29 was lost over the target but one ditched on the way back. An- other was damaged so badly it was designated as a trainer. Another plane ditched on the trip up to the Empire. 9 January 1945 After trying their luck in an area incendiary attack against Nagoya (See Chapter II), the 73rd BW went back to precision daylight bombing in the Hansell mode on 9 January 1945 in Mission No. 18 attacking target 357 for the fifth time. This mission was a test of endurance and flying skills. The 1,500 mile trip up was in clouds and assembly point was also socked in making formation flying impossible and 18 diehards bombed Target No. 357 individually by radar resulting in slight dam- age to the engine plant. Thirty four planes bombed various targets of opportunity. Six planes were lost on this mission. Two planes were shot down over the target and four planes ditched with no survivors from any of the ditched planes. The need for Iwo was getting desperate. Twenty planes aborted on Mission No. 18. One dare not attempt the 3,000 mile round trip unless the plane was in perfect condition. To date three aircraft plants, the Nakajima Musashino air- craft engine plant, the Mitsubishi Nagoya engine plant and the Mitsubishi Nagoya airframe plant had been hit, but only the Mitsubishi Nagoya aircraft engine plant was seriously dam- aged. The cost in B-29s had been high. Twenty B-29s had been lost and, on the last three missions, 56 had suffered battle damage. Precision daylight bombing in formation over Japan was not turning out to be an easy task. Even the Japanese press were calling the B-29 a "white elephant" The obstacles to precision daylight bombing over Japan were formidable. First and foremost was the weather. Targets were visible from about 25,000 feet only a
