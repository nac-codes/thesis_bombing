were calling the B-29 a "white elephant" The obstacles to precision daylight bombing over Japan were formidable. First and foremost was the weather. Targets were visible from about 25,000 feet only a few days a month. Even with weather planes up every day predicting the weather over a target, six to eight hours later when the planes were over the target was proving unreliable. One thing that apparently was not forecast very reliably in advance was the 100 to 200 mile an hour jet stream coming out of Siberia over Japan. Rumors among some crews had the jet stream velocity as high as 600 miles an hour at times. This made accurate bombing with the Norden optical bombsight impossible. At this veloc- ity one could not go directly up wind, you would be a sitting duck, downwind you would be going too fast and the drift cor- rection going cross wind was difficult with such high wind velocities. The second difficulty was the wear and tear on the B-29, especially the engine, in the climb to over 25,000 feet. In the first Empire mission the 73rd BW got 111 planes in the air but they never went above 100 planes again until tactics were changed. 14 January 1945 Mission No. 19 took place five days later against the Mitsubishi Nagoya airframe plant. Through haze, 40 planes bombed the plant by radar but post strike photos showed that only three buildings were hit. As in past flights over Nagoya, fighter opposition was aggressive with 583 passes at the bomb- ers and 16 enemy planes claimed to be destroyed. Our losses were heavy as well with one plane ditching on the way to the target and three ditched on the return flight. Within the normal flight time of 14 to 16 hours, the bomber designated "Lassie Come Home" had not returned but after 19 hours she landed struggling all the way back on two engines. But the plane was so badly damaged it never flew again. Twenty planes aborted on this mission. 19 January 1945 27 December 1944 For the last precision daylight raid of the year, the 73rd
