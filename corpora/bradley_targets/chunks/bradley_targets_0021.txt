two engines. But the plane was so badly damaged it never flew again. Twenty planes aborted on this mission. 19 January 1945 27 December 1944 For the last precision daylight raid of the year, the 73rd BW hit Target 357, its nemesis the Musashino aircraft engine plant for the fourth time. Seventy-two B-29s took off with one ditching right after takeoff. Over the target there was bedlam. Planes flew at incorrect altitude and off course due to exces- sive unforecasted winds. Bombs were dropped from 28,000 to 33,800 feet. The engine plant received only slight damage from the approximately 98 tons of HE dropped by the 39 planes bombing the primary target. Thirteen planes bombed second- To date all precision daylight raids were against the air- craft factories around Tokyo and Nagoya but Mission No. 20 was launched against the Kawasaki aircraft plant in Akashi, located near Kobe (this city was close to the center of a 7.2 magnitude earthquake which devastated Kobe on 24 January 1995 at 5:46 am Tokyo time). Eighty B-29s were aloft and 62 visually bombed the plant with excellent results. Nine planes bombed secondary targets and nine planes aborted. Four Japa- nese fighters were claimed destroyed by B-29 gunners. The bomb load on the target was 152.5 HE tons averaging 2.45 tons per plane. The plant responsible for producing Tony and 11 10  Nick Japanese fighters was so heavily damaged that it never resumed production. Forty percent of the bombs fell within 1,000 feet of the aiming point (AP) for the most successful precision daylight attack of the campaign to date. Twelve B- 29s suffered battle damage. The mission was flown at alti- tudes between 25,100 to 29,400 feet. The change in target caught the Japanese off guard and no B-29 was lost. 23 January 1945 Mission No. 22 was flown against the Mitsubishi Nagoya aircraft engine plant (Target No. 198) with 73 planes up, but only 28 bombed the primary target. Poor weather en route and over the target resulted in poor radar bombi
