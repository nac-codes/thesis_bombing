survived the war as POWs. Another plane was hit, flames developed, dropped back out of formation and exploded. Another plane, "Shady Lady" was hit and dropped out of for- mation and was never seen again. The plane "Irish Lassie" was attacked by fighters: a Zeke barreled down and tore off part of the left wing taking eight feet of aileron and one third of the flap with it. This plane claimed three enemy fighters. Another Japanese fighter, a Jack, came into the tail gunners position from 6 o'clock high. The tail gunner kept firing and the Jack disintegrated but rammed the left side of the tail gunner's compartment. The primary target was cloud cov- ered and 56 planes hit Tokyo urban area and six targets of opportunity (TO). Since the initial target was cloud covered, this necessitated two bomb runs and the total time of the for- mations for the two bomb runs totaled over two hours giving Japanese defenses a field day. Altogether, five B-29 were lost 12 from 497 BG; three planes were downed before the target "Hayley's Comet", "Werewolf" and "Shady Lady". About 250 miles from the coast, "Ghastly Goose" had to ditch as a result of being hit over Tokyo. Crew members were seen on the planes wings and getting into life rafts; for five days after ditching a storm raged on the eastern coast of the Empire and planes came up from Saipan approximately 2,000 mile roundtrip and searched in the area for 15 to 18 hours a day to no avail. No crew member or life raft was ever found. The "Irish Lassie" struggled back to Saipan. On the approach to Isley Field runway, the plane, badly shot up and with pilot at the throttle, co-pilot at the controls, the nose dipped below the cliff but the co-pilot picked up the nose in a last desperate effort and the plane bounced down on the runway. The nose wheel collapsed and scraped along the runway out of control. The No. 1 engine burst into flames, a wing caught an embank- ment, spun around and the burning engine falling off and the plane slammed
