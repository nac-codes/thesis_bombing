effort dramatically affected aircraft engine and aircraft production from November 1944 on and never recov- ered (See Figures 2 and 3). Phase Two: Precision Bombing LOSSES: 30 B-29s lost in transit to Saipan Gen. LeMay found that the training of the B-29 crews was lacking in gunnery and radar bombing and cruise control (es- sentially fuel management) and training missions were in- creased to hone these skills. The favorite target for training missions was the bypassed island of Truk, the former bastion of the Imperial Navy in the central Pacific. These flights pro- vided excellent experience in overwater gas consumption and cruise control and, depending upon the weather, good bomb- ing practice, either visually or by radar. Two additional wings were also coming to the Marianas. The air echelon of the 313th BW started to arrive at North Field, Tinian in January 1945 and entered combat over the Empire on 4 February 45. The 314th BW was stationed on North Field, Guam and entered combat over the Empire on 25 February 1945. The 313th BW was led by Gen. John H. Davies and the 314th BW by Gen. Thomas S. Power. The three BW's (73rd, 313th and 314th) would play the major role in bringing the Japanese to their knees by 15 August 1945. 13.5 B-29s lost due to Japanese raids on Saipan 90 B-29s lost (15 planes per raid x 6 raids/month) 133.5 B-29s lost/month total The attrition rate was approximately equal to their esti- mated production rate and therefore, according to the Japa- nese analysis, the raids will cease after the number that were stockpiled prior to the start of the B-29 campaign was used up. The B-29 losses for January 1945 were 27 B-29s for the XXI BC and four B-29s for the XX BC, not the 90 assumed in the Japanese analysis. More accurate, probably, was the state- ment, " ... then after going through all that expense and trouble, many super heavy bombers carry out blind bombing dropping missiles on civilian homes, mountain areas and into the sea."
