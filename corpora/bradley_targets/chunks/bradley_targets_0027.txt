" ... then after going through all that expense and trouble, many super heavy bombers carry out blind bombing dropping missiles on civilian homes, mountain areas and into the sea." The same article goes on to state, " ... up to 14 January 1945, 1,350 enemy B-29s have raided Japan. Of this total, our forces have shot down or damaged 424 Superforts. In Manchuria, 31 enemy B-29s and in Shonan two more were similarly ac- counted for by our forces. The enemy has, therefore, lost 475 Super heavies shot down or damaged. Assuming that about 50 enemy bombers either met or otherwise broke down on their flight to Japan and 181 more were damaged or destroyed by our raiders on the Marianas, the grand total of enemy Superfort losses is 706. In personnel, the enemy has lost 5,775 airmen." Taking into account the normal exaggerated claims of the Japanese, their analysis was apparently not far afield from the analysis in Washington since the results of bombs on target were minuscule to date and a change in command more pliable to Washington's demands for more area bombing with incendiaries. Gen. Hansell, in his defense, stated: "Soon after my return, the manner of target selection was altered and a greater latitude was afforded to commander in field. Although the target priorities were not appreciably changed, permission was granted to commander, XXI Bomber Command, to use radar against industrial and urban industrial targets when the weather was not suitable for daylight precision bombing ... " He stated that O'Donnell wanted to use the night air raid technique since it was found, in Europe by the 8th Air Force, that losses from German fighters on daylight raids were prohibitive without fighter escort and the B-29s to date had As described by Gen. LeMay (10), another innovation was made in aircraft maintenance. Long, overwater flights and climbing to 25,000 to 35,000 feet were taking a heavy toll on the aircraft, especially the engines. This was also causing a high abort rate. Nor
