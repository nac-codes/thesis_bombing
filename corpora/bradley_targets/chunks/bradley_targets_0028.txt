de in aircraft maintenance. Long, overwater flights and climbing to 25,000 to 35,000 feet were taking a heavy toll on the aircraft, especially the engines. This was also causing a high abort rate. Normal AAF maintenance policy had a crew chief for each aircraft and routine maintenance done locally but a new, more centralized maintenance set-up was put in place and time for engine overhaul was drastically reduced. First and second echelon maintenance was done at the Wing. A centralized supply depot was also put in place with a fleet of C-54s, keeping the supply stream stocked with critical supply items from the States. Gen. LeMay's bombing philosophy was not as rigidly wedded to daylight precision bombing in formation and he believed in varying the target systems and tactics. As noted above, Gen. Hansell believed that directives from Washington did not grant him this flexibility. Another important psychological lift came to the B-29 crews on 19 February 1945 when the Marines invaded Iwo Jima for the express purpose of providing a base for fighter escort for B-29s and, as important for B-29 crews, an emer- gency landing field for crippled or fuel-short B-29s returning from the Empire. All of these factors provided a psychological lift to the crews and they began to attack the Empire with re- newed enthusiasm. 13  PAPER 10 February 1945 On 10 February 1945, the 73rd BW was joined by the 313th BW in a joint mission against the Nakajima airplane plant at Ota on the Kanto plain, west of Tokyo. One hundred eighteen B-29s took off and 84 bombed the airplane plant, dropping approximately 210 tons GP and IB on the target with fair re- sults. Only about 97 GP bombs and seven IB bombs fell in the target area damaging 11 out of 37 buildings in the factory com- plex, mainly as a result of fires. Seventy-four Franks were de- stroyed on the ground. Flak was weak and 330 fighter attacks were made on the Superforts. However, the 20th Air Force lost in this raid the largest number of
