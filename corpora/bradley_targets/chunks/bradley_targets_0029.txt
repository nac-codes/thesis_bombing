lt of fires. Seventy-four Franks were de- stroyed on the ground. Flak was weak and 330 fighter attacks were made on the Superforts. However, the 20th Air Force lost in this raid the largest number of B-29s in a single raid to date. This was the result of a variety of causes including the green 313th BW crews. From 313th BW one plane was lost on takeoff, two were lost in a mid-air collision, one was lost to enemy action over Japan, one was missing and four ditched. The 73rd BW lost three planes in ditchings. Twenty-one Japanese fighters were claimed destroyed, 15 probable and 26 damaged. Bombing alti- tude varied from 26,000 to 29,400 feet. The bombing altitude was important since the Japanese fighters could not climb much above 26,000 feet without lots of lead time. 15 February 1945 The Mitsubishi aircraft engine plant near Nagoya was at- tacked again by both the 73rd and 313th BW on 15 February 45. One hundred seventeen planes were airborne but the for- mations ran into clouds from 28 degree latitude north to the Honshu coast. This caused formations to break up but 33 B- 29s bombed primary target and 68 the secondary target and TO. Sixteen planes aborted. No plane from the 73rd BW was lost and 12 suffered minor battle damage. One B-29 from the 313th BW ditched on the return flight. Seven planes were claimed destroyed, eight probables and 23 damaged. 19 February 1945 Mission No. 37 was run on 19 February 1945 against To- kyo as a maximum effort in conjunction with the Iwo Jima invasion on this date. Target 357 was to be hit but it was clouded over and 131 planes hit secondary targets, 119 bombed Tokyo urban and dock area by radar, seven bombed last resort target, five TO and 19 planes aborted. Flak was effective and three planes were lost over the target: two by ramming; one plane ditched on the return flight. One 313th BW plane crashed on landing and collided with another parked plane. The raid claimed six planes, one that was not even on the mission, 39 Japanese p
