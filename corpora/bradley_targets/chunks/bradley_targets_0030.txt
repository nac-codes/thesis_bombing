; one plane ditched on the return flight. One 313th BW plane crashed on landing and collided with another parked plane. The raid claimed six planes, one that was not even on the mission, 39 Japanese planes destroyed, 16 probable and 37 damaged. 4 March 1945 Again, Target 357 was the object of Mission No. 39 with 192 B-29s from the 73rd and 313th BW. The charmed life of this target continued and it was not visible due to cloud cover and 159 planes bombed the Tokyo urban and dock areas by radar and 18 TO. One plane from the 73rd BW ditched with the loss of two crewmen. Iwo Jima was invaded on 19 Febru- ary 1945 and a B-29 from the 9th BG of the 73rd BW returning from Mission No. 39 ran into trouble and made an emergency landing on Iwo Jima, the first of over 2,000 emergency land- ings by 15 August 1945 (See Fig. 4). 24/25 March 1945 The Mitsubishi aircraft engine plant (Target 193) near Nagoya had been attacked four times and it continued to elude destruction so a new approach was tried: night precision bomb- ing. This technique involved illuminating the target with flares and then marking the target with incendiary bombs. As de- scribed in 314th BW report (12), 50 B-29s, of which 20 were "pathfinder aircraft", attacked this target. A few pathfinder aircraft dropped M26 flares fused to open at 3,000 feet. With the target illuminated, the remaining pathfinder aircraft dropped their M17 incendiary clusters on the target and the remainder of the force dropped on the burning target. Planes came in at an altitude from 8,200 to 9,800 feet. The main force came in at 6,900 to 7,800 feet carrying a mixed bomb load of M-64 GP, M-76 IB and M-81 fragmentation bombs. An observation plane was over the target at 11,000 to 15,000 feet and dropped an M- 46 photoflash bomb to take photographs of the target area. Cloud cover varied from clear to broken clouds over the target area. Flak was of moderate intensity but generally inaccurate. Enemy fighter opposition was weak and unaggressive
