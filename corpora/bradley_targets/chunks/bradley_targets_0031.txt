phs of the target area. Cloud cover varied from clear to broken clouds over the target area. Flak was of moderate intensity but generally inaccurate. Enemy fighter opposition was weak and unaggressive. Ten aircraft suffered battle damage of which 8 aircraft were repaired within one day. Two hundred twenty-three B-29s bombed pri- mary target and 3 bombed TO. Five B-29s were lost: one plane to flak, one plane ditched and three planes were missing. There were four from the 73rd BW and one from the 313th BW. Damage from Mission No. 43 was as follows: 173,000 square feet or 4.5% of the total roof area destroyed, five sur- rounding industrial targets damaged or destroyed and 8 mil- lion sq. ft., or 183 acres of Nagoya destroyed. 30/31 March 1945 Target 193 was hit by 12 B-29s from the 314th BW on the night of 30/31 March 1945 for mission 48 hoping to use the same technique as on Mission No. 43 but, as so often stymied the 73rd BW, weather was the determining factor. On the first run, the 12 planes encountered clouds over the target and ex- ecuted a second run for a radar drop. The bombs dropped to- taled 99 M-64 GP, 112 M-26 flares and 10 M-46 flash bombs. Flak in the target area was meager in intensity and generally inaccurate but from heavy caliber guns. Three enemy aircraft were sighted but none attacked the B-29s. All aircraft returned safely to Guam. 1/2 April 1945 For Mission No. 51 on 1/2 April 45, 73rd BW tried the new experimental tactic of night precision bombing of Target 357. One hundred twenty-one B-29s were airborne and 115 B-29s bombed the Musashino aircraft engine plant with no new damage to the plant evident in post strike photos. A 73rd BW report stated "recent experience indicates that successful night attacks against precision urban targets lacking prominent ra- dar features are beyond the capabilities of presently available equipment." Also, the raid was a disaster for the 73rd BW. losing six planes or 5% of the strike force. Missions 55, 56 and 57 we
