raids of the 20th Air Force resulting in the destruction of 2,200 machine tools which were damaged or destroyed and were irreplaceable by the Japanese at this stage of the war. Mission No. 56 was run by the 313th BW against the Nakajima airframe assembly plant at Koizumi on the Kanto Plain near Tokyo. Seventy-eight planes were up and 43 bombed the primary target and 18 hit the secondary target with 17 aborts. No planes were lost and one enemy plane was claimed destroyed. Mission No. 57 was run by the 73rd BW against the Tachikawa aircraft manufacturing plant located about 20 miles west of Tokyo which produced about 9% of the Japanese air- plane production in 1944. Of 115 planes leaving Isley Field, 61 bombed the primary target and 49 the secondary target. Dam- age to the Nakajima plant was described as scattered with about 10% of the roof area destroyed. A common complaint by this wing was that illumination was inadequate to delineate the target at night. One plane from this Wing was lost on this mission. 12 April 1945 The 73rd BW again attacked the Musashino aircraft en- gine plant for the last time with 94 B-29s putting 490 tons of HE in the target area and 13 B-29s placing bombs on the sec- ondary targets. A haze over the target prevented a good visual bombing pattern to be laid down. The results from all previ- ous bombings up to this time were that 63% of the plant roof area was destroyed. As noted above, frantic dispersal efforts contributed greatly to reduce aircraft engine production which was at about 1500 engines per month as noted on Fig. 2. P- 51's provided full escort coverage to the B-29s while they were over the Empire. Fighter opposition was reduced partly as a result of the Okinawa invasion which started on 1 April 1945 but B-29 gunners claimed 11 destroyed, two damaged and ten probables and P-51's claimed 15 - 6 - 3. No B-29 was lost but two P-51's were lost. Thirty-six B-29s had some degree of battle damage. On all these missions, attack altitude
