oyed, two damaged and ten probables and P-51's claimed 15 - 6 - 3. No B-29 was lost but two P-51's were lost. Thirty-six B-29s had some degree of battle damage. On all these missions, attack altitude was from 5,700 to 8,875 feet which permitted bomb loads of between five to six tons per plane, a dramatic improvement over the tonnage pos- sible on daylight precision runs. 7 April 1945 The Musashino aircraft engine plant was hit in a classic daylight precision raid in formation with a fighter escort for the first time on 7 April 45. 90 P-51D's were escorted by a navigational B-29 (P-51 did not have navigational equipment for the long overwater flight from Iwo to the Empire) and ren- dezvoused with B-29s at Kozushima and escorted the forma- tions in. Coverage for the first several formations was fine but there was no fighter coverage for the later formations. Natu- rally, the fighters were thinking of their 700 mile journey back to Iwo Jima and could not linger over the target for later for- mations. This day the weather cooperated, it was CAVU (clear and visibility unlimited). The bomb load was changed to one ton bombs and damaged 48% of the plant. One hundred eleven B-29s were airborne and 101 bombed the primary target and two the secondary target. There was a stiff air battle over To- kyo and the 73rd BW lost six planes, three over the target: two to flak and one to air to air bombing, a rarity. Two P-51's were lost. There was a claim of 80 Japanese fighters for the B-29s and 21 by P-51's for a total of 101 Japanese fighters destroyed, 23 damaged and 50 probables by B-29s. Sixty-six B-29s suf- fered battle damage, in addition 31 planes landed at Iwo on their way back. On 12 April 1945 Missions No. 64 and No. 65 were run by 313th and 314th BW against the chemical plant at Koriyama, north of Tokyo (See Fig 6). The plant was bombed visually from 6,800 to 8,000 feet, an unusually low altitude for a day- light mission. The 313th BW placed a total of 735,500 lbs. (367.75
