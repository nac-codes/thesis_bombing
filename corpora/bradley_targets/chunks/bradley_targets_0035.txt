t Koriyama, north of Tokyo (See Fig 6). The plant was bombed visually from 6,800 to 8,000 feet, an unusually low altitude for a day- light mission. The 313th BW placed a total of 735,500 lbs. (367.75 tons) of M-64 GP on the target area with the following results: bombing accuracy was excellent with all identified bomb bursts falling within 2,000 ft of the AP; all main build- ings were seriously damaged or destroyed representing 73% of the total roof area. Weather was clear with visibility at 15 miles. Enemy aircraft opposition was ineffective. Several air- to-air bombing attacks were made but no damaged was caused. Two aircraft were lost by the 314th BW; one ditched and one crashed on landing. These were the first raids against a target system other than the aircraft industry. This was the first mis- sion for many 314th BW crews, and with assembly in forma- tion and flying to Koriyama 130 miles north of Tokyo, the mis- sion lasted up to 18.5 hours for some crews. 13/14 April 1945 Mission No. 67 was a night raid by all three Wings against the Tokyo arsenal on the night of 13/14 April 1945.

M-59 GP and 1147, 425 lb. E-46 incendiary clusters; 5445, 70 lb. M-47 incendiary bombs and 33, M-46 photoflash bombs. But the resistance was intense, flak heavy and intense, some accurate and others inaccurate; 35 Japanese attacks were made and four E/A were destroyed; seven B-29s were lost: three from the 314th BW. While classified as a night precision raid, this raid could be considered an urban area raid with the Tokyo arsenal as the aiming
