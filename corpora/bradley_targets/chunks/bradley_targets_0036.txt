r E/A were destroyed; seven B-29s were lost: three from the 314th BW. While classified as a night precision raid, this raid could be considered an urban area raid with the Tokyo arsenal as the aiming point. 24 April 1945 Mission No. 96 was a joint raid by three Wings against the Hitachi aircraft company complex located in Tachikawa. Most of the planes and engines produced at the plant were small training types. A total of 474 tons of M-64 GP bombs; damage assessment indicated that the main engine assembly and en- gine parts manufacturing building was about 80% destroyed. Japanese fighter opposition was aggressive with closely pressed attacks. Flak over target was moderate to intense and accurate and inaccurate. Twenty-one B-29s received some battle dam- age and two received major battle damage and a total of five planes were lost: One from the 73rd BW, two from the 314th BW and two from the 313th BW; at least 25 E/A were claimed to be downed. 30 April 1945 Mission No. 126 was conducted by the 73rd and 313th BW's on 30 April 1945 against the Army Air Depot at Tachikawa on the Kanto plain The 73rd BW found cloud cover over the target and its 55 planes bombed the radar target, the Hamamastu urban area with excellent results.

Phase Three: Precision Bombing 4 May 1945 Mission No. 146 started off on 4 May 1945 with an attack on the in-house Hiro Naval Air Depot near Kure which pro- duced both air frames and engines for the naval air service. Military depots produced 4.4% of the total Japanese combat aircraft and 5% of the total engines from 1941 through 1945 and were an important contributor to the total Japanese air- planes produced. However, whether they were at this time part of the Japanese aircraft production or were dispersing was not known. This mission was a two Wing effort with the 73rd BW contributing 130 B-29s and the recently relocated from the CBI theater the 58th BW flying its first mission from Tinian contributing 18 B-2
