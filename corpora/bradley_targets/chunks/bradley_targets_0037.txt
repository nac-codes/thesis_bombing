t known. This mission was a two Wing effort with the 73rd BW contributing 130 B-29s and the recently relocated from the CBI theater the 58th BW flying its first mission from Tinian contributing 18 B-29s to the effort. As on many daylight pre- cision missions, some bomb groups were able to see the pri- mary visual targets; other BGs due to haze or cloud cover had to bomb the radar targets. The radar target was the Hiro Naval Arsenal. From the 73rd BW, 11 squadrons bombed the visual target and three the radar target. Post strike photo indicated that 75% of the aircraft factory was destroyed. The 73rd BW lost three planes with 39 having battle damage. The 73rd BW history states that a late change in bomb load prevented instal- lation of bombay gas tanks which necessitated 64 aircraft to 16 land at Iwo to refuel. This mission placed 578 tons HE on the targets with planes averaging 3.9 tons per plane. 10 May 1945 In another assist to the US Navy the Imperial Navy's Fuel Station and Naval Coal Yards and Briquette Factory at Tokuyama were hit on 10 May 1945 in Mission No. 163 and 164 respectively. Tokuyama is on the inland sea between Hiroshima and Shimoneseki (see Fig 6). 54 B-29s placed 243 tons on the Fuel Station and 56 B-29s placed 262 tons on the Naval Coal Yards and Briquette Factory destroying 85% of these targets. Flak was meager and inaccurate with 12 planes suffering some battle damage but no plane was lost. Weather over target was CAVU. The XXI BC taking advantage of the clear weather over the Empire sent the 314th BW against the Otake oil refinery the first oil refinery hit. The oil industry was considered the second most important strategic target after the aircraft indus- try was destroyed and this was the first of many missions against this industry launched by the XXI BC but note concluding cri- tique at end of this chapter. The 314th BW sent 112 planes against this target dropping 549 tons HE on the target, each plane averaging about five tons per plane.
