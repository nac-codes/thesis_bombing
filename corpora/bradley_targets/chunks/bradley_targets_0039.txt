. Surrounding area damaged included 70% de- stroyed merchant marine college adjacent to the plant and 3,936,000 sq. ft of residential and small manufacturing areas northwest of the target destroyed. 73rd BW estimated 35% of target destroyed. There were 88 enemy attacks which dam- aged five planes; four enemy planes destroyed, 18 probable and eight damaged. One plane was lost on this mission which went into the water on takeoff from Guam. The 58th BW also sent 32 B-29s dropping 173 tons on the Tomioka plant of the Nippon (Japan) Aircraft Company lo- cated near Yokohama. The plant built primary and intermedi- ate trainers for the Navy. In 1943 and 1944 the company pro- duced 20% of all Japanese trainers but this had declined in 1945 to 12%. The USSBS (5) stated that as a result of this raid, dispersal of the plant began resulting in 239,844 sq. ft dispersed above ground and 41,654 sq. ft. underground. At war's end 70 to 80% of the above ground dispersal was com- plete and 40 to 80% of the underground dispersal was com- plete although part of this was due to a reduction in the area planned for underground dispersal. But the damage was rela- tively minor from the raid itself; 1.8 tons falling in the plant area and 0.8 tons on buildings destroying 5% of the building area and damaging 10% of the buildings. Damage was de- scribed as "medium" and there were 38 casualties at the plant as a result of this raid. 19 May 1945 Mission No. 178 amply showed the vagaries of predicting weather 7 hours in advance for the Empire. The visual target was to be the Army Tachikawa air depot last hit on 30 April 1945 but after the formations assembled, they ran into 10/10 cloud cover with 73rd BW history describing the weather as the worst they had encountered up to that date. This broke up the formations and each plane attacked the radar target: the city of Hamamatsu singularly. Hamamatsu is about 118 miles southwest of Tachikawa (see Fig 6). The bombs were scat- tered over Hamamatsu but th
