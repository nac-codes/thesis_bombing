formations and each plane attacked the radar target: the city of Hamamatsu singularly. Hamamatsu is about 118 miles southwest of Tachikawa (see Fig 6). The bombs were scat- tered over Hamamatsu but the 73rd BW bragged that 83 of 94 B-29s at least bombed the correct city which was a big im- provement in their radar bombing technique. The three Wings dumped 1456 tons HE from 272 planes on the city from 13,300 to 26,640 feet. About 5% of the city structures or 0.22 sq. mi. of the city were damaged, scattered throughout the city in both the residential and industrial area. One numbered target, the Suzuki Loom Works, was 20% destroyed. Four B-29s were lost on this mission. If one believes in persistence, then the assignment of tar- get 357 to the 73rd BW must be a prime example. But the plant's luck held and it was cloud covered and the assigned radar target - Hitachi Aircraft Engine Works, Kaigar plant, was attacked. While it was the radar target it was hit visually by 118 planes dropping 806 tons HE from 20,000 feet. Each plane carried approximately seven one-ton bombs. The BW meant to finish off the Musashino plant but unluckily the Hitachi plant took the brunt of this attack. This plant was a leading producer of tanks, military vehicles and aircraft components. Over 96.8% of the roof area was destroyed. 9 June 1945 No other daylight precision raid was conducted until 9 June 1945 when the three aircraft producing plants were hit. Mis- sion No. 191 was made by the 58th BW against the Kawanishi aircraft company, Naruo plant near Osaka. As noted, Kawanishi produced planes strictly for the Navy. 44 B-29s dropped 264 tons HE on the plant with no planes lost. The 314th BW was also sent up to attack three separate precision targets on 10 June 45. Mission No. 198 attacked the Hitachi Aircraft Plant in Chiba by 26 B-29s dropping 138 tons HE. Hitachi, from January 1941 to August 1945, produced 11.6% of all aircraft engines and 2.6% of airframes produced during this period. It w
