achi Aircraft Plant in Chiba by 26 B-29s dropping 138 tons HE. Hitachi, from January 1941 to August 1945, produced 11.6% of all aircraft engines and 2.6% of airframes produced during this period. It was a relatively new plant opening in 1942 for engine production. The 313th BW sent 24 B-29s against the Akaski plant of Kawasaki Airplane Company. This company produced exclu- sively for the Army and produced 17% of the combat air frames and 12% of the combat aircraft engines in 1944. Kawasaki produced the single engine fighter, Tony, which resembled the ME 109 and the twin engine, Nick, a two place fighter. This plant was last hit by the 73rd Wing on 19 January 1945 in what was considered their most successful precision raid of the cam- paign. The 313th BW dropped 144 tons HE from 24 planes without any losses. No bombs hit the target and no new dam- age was done. The next plant that was hit was the Nakajima aircraft plant in Okigubo. 52 planes dropped 281 tons HE on the plant. One plane was lost over this target but no other plane was lost by the 314th BW on this day. Finally, Mission No. 200 was flown against the Army air depot at Tachikawa previously hit on 30 April 1945. Twenty- six planes dropped 138 tons on the target. Mission No. 193 was against the Aichi airplane manufac- turing plant in Nagoya by the 313th BW dropping 271 tons HE from 42 planes without loss of a B-29. USSBS estimated that four tons hit the plant area and two tons hit buildings destroy- ing 20% of the buildings and damaging 10% of the buildings. Damage to the plant was described as "heavy". P-51 escort fighters were up on this date chasing the Japa- nese fighters away from the B-29 formations. The P-51s claimed 26 Japanese fighters destroyed. The aircraft industry continued to receive the main attention of the XXI BC during daylight precision raids. 22 June 1945 10 June 1945 On 22 June 45, six missions were sent against precision targets including the Kure Naval Arsenal.
