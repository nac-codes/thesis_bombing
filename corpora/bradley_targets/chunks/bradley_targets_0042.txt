tion of the XXI BC during daylight precision raids. 22 June 1945 10 June 1945 On 22 June 45, six missions were sent against precision targets including the Kure Naval Arsenal. The rationale for the Kure arsenal may have been that this would curtail the pro- duction of antiaircraft weapons. On 10 June 45, four missions were directed at precision targets. Mission No. 195 was directed against the Kasumigaura Seaplane Base (spelled on some maps as Kasumi-ga-ura) by the 58th BW. Twenty-three B-29s dropped 123 tons of bombs on the facility. This location is a large inland lake and presum- ably the seaplanes could conduct reconnaissance flights over the Pacific which the US Navy did not like. The 58th and 73rd BW hit the Kure Naval Arsenal with 796 tons of HE from 162 B-29s damaging 56% of the target. Fifty-six planes had battle damage and two were lost. Mission No. 216 was launched against the aircraft plant in Mizushima. 108 B-29s dropped 603 tons HE on the Mitsubishi 17  PAPER to bomb visually and these destroyed 435,000 sq. ft of roof area: the remaining planes bombing the radar target Kawana city. Approximately 231 tons HE were deposited on the arse- nal and 779 tons HE on the city. This was the last mission in which the 73rd BW suffered significant battle damage. Forty- six planes suffered battle damage but none were lost. Again the vagaries of visual bombing were noted during this mission. Mission No. 287 flown by the 313th BW with 66 B-29s depositing 451 tons HE on the Aichi aircraft plant in Eitoku, also with no losses. On Mission No. 288 the 313th BW placed 280 tons HE from 38 B-29s on the city of Tsu, the radar target. aircraft plant. Two planes were lost, one to enemy aircraft and one was missing. The statistical summary indicated that 16 B- 29s were damaged by flak, two damaged by flak and enemy aircraft and two were damaged by friendly fire. The Himeji plant belonging to the Kawanishi Aircraft Company was attacked by 52 planes from the 58th BW which dropped 3
