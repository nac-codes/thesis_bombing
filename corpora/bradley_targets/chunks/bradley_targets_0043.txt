k, two damaged by flak and enemy aircraft and two were damaged by friendly fire. The Himeji plant belonging to the Kawanishi Aircraft Company was attacked by 52 planes from the 58th BW which dropped 351 tons HE on the plant with no planes lost. The 313th BW ran Missions 218 and 219 against the Kawasaki aircraft plant at Kagamigahara about 25 km north- west of Nagoya in group strength. Thirty-four planes dropped 206 tons HE on the plant with the loss of one plane. Seventy-five aircraft from the 314th BW were set to hit the Mitsubishi aircraft factory in the northwest section of Nagoya but it was cloud covered and the city of Tsu, the radar target, was pelted with two-ton bombs. For experimental pur- poses, planes were loaded some with two, some three and some four of these monsters. The people of Tsu must have thought the world was coming to an end. The bombs caused shock waves in the clouds when they exploded on the target. Due to the bomb load and difficulty in trying to assemble in forma- tion, 15 planes had to refuel on Iwo. Nine planes had minor flak damage but there was no plane loss. Following up this attack, 25 planes from the 313th BW dropped 148 tons HE on the Akashi plant of the Kawasaki Air- craft Company with no planes lost on 22 June 1945. 26 June 1945 The 26th of June 1945 was to be another clear day on Honshu, so several precision targets, including some old fa- vorites, were scheduled for attack in strength ranging from Group to Wing efforts. A total of nine missions were launched on this date. The aircraft industry and arsenals were the targets. Mission No. 290, run concurrently by the 314th BW, sent 77 B-29s against the Nakajima Aircraft Plant in Handa and deposited 537 tons HE on the target by radar, although this was supposed to be a visual run. The raid was successful as 44.2% of the target was destroyed or damaged. There were no losses and two planes suffered slight flak damaged. The 58th BW with 64 B-29s dropped 382 tons HE on a light metal pl
