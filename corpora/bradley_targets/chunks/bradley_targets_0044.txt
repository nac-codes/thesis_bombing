raid was successful as 44.2% of the target was destroyed or damaged. There were no losses and two planes suffered slight flak damaged. The 58th BW with 64 B-29s dropped 382 tons HE on a light metal plant in Osaka with no loss of aircraft. The 73rd BW launched 122 planes to hit the Osaka arse- nal and 109 reached the visual target only to find it 10/10 cloud cover and bombed the radar target with poor results. The 313th BW in Mission No. 225 hit the Kawasaki air- craft plant in Akashi with 31 planes dropping 184 tons HE on the plant. On Mission No. 229 50 planes from the Wing depos- ited 346 tons HE on the aircraft plant in Eitoku. No planes were lost on the first raid but two planes were lost on the second raid. The 58th BW launched 60 planes which dropped 412 tons HE on the Kawasaki aircraft plant in Kagamigahara with one plane lost. On 7 August 1945, four Wings 58th, 73rd, 313th and 314th BW's provided a total of 124 B-29s to bomb the Toyokawa Naval Arsenal with 813 tons HE losing one plane. P-51s from Iwo Jima provided escort on this mission one day after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Toyokawa is about 60 km south east of Nagoya (see Fig. 6). The 314th BW was also very active this day. Missions 226 and 227 hit the Nagoya arsenal with 334 tons HE from 58 B-29s with the loss of one plane from flak. On 8 August 1945, 314th BW hit the Tokyo arsenal by radar with 289 tons HE from 60 planes with a loss of three planes; two from flak and a third from a mechanical problem. These planes were the last B-29s lost to enemy action by the 20th Air Force. It is ironic that the planes were lost on a raid that initially the Mission No. 320 set out, as so many others, to attack Target 357, the Nakajima Aircraft Engine Plant near Tokyo, its charmed existence held as it had from the first at- tempt to attack it by the 73rd BW on Mission No. 7 on 24 November 1944. This plant obviously does not stand as a shin- ing example of precision bombing of selected target system as
