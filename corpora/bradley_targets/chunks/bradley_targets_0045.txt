from the first at- tempt to attack it by the 73rd BW on Mission No. 7 on 24 November 1944. This plant obviously does not stand as a shin- ing example of precision bombing of selected target system as espoused by Gen. Douhet, Gen. Billy Mitchell and Gen. Hansell. This plant stands as a monument to how nature can thwart the most technologically advanced attack of its time. Mission No. 230 was against the Sumitoma duraluminum plant in Nagoya with 29 planes depositing 156 tons HE on the plant (see Fig 6). Duraluminum is an aluminum alloy used in airframe construction. Mission No. 231 sent 25 planes dropping 143 tons HE on the Hitachi aircraft casting plant at Kawasaki. Two planes were lost to Japanese fighters. 24 July 1945 From 1 July 1945 to 20 July 1945 all missions were run at night.

The cloud cover persisted for many planes on this trip but 35 B-29s were able Not to be daunted, the 314th BW sent 70 B-29s on 10 August 1945 against the Tokyo arsenal again dropping 320 tons HE with the VII Fighter Command providing P-51 escort and not losing a plane. 10 August 1945 18 14 August 1945 On 14 August 1945 the 58th BW with 157 B-29s placed 885 tons HE on the Hikari Naval Arsenal and the 73rd BW with 145 B-29s placing 707 tons HE on the Osaka Army Arse- nal.
