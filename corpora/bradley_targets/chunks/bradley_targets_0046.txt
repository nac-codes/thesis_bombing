th 145 B-29s placing 707 tons HE on the Osaka Army Arse- nal. The VII FC provided fighter escort for the Osaka mission. In a new target system, the first to be attacked by the 20th AF the railroad yards at Marifu were hit by 108 B-29s from the 313th BW with 710 tons HE. There were no B-29s lost on these three raids. 2/3 July 1945 Eagle Mission No. 3 against the Maruzen oil refinery at Wakayama on 2/3 July 1945, 39 B-29s dropped 297 tons HE on the refinery with poor results damaging only 5% of the plant. To date, the oil refinery campaign was obtaining results com- parable to the aircraft engine campaign from November through January 1944. Phase Four: Precision Attacks Against the Petroleum Industry 6/7 July 1945 Eagle Mission No. 4 was mounted on 6/7 July 1945 against the same refinery. This was one of the most important refiner- ies for the Japanese Navy. Sixty B-29s took off from North- west Field, Guam and 59 hit the refinery from 10,200 to 11,500 feet with 441.5 tons HE, 500 lb. GP with an estimated 95% of the plant destroyed and only a few storage tanks remaining intact. The Radiation Laboratory at MIT conceived of a high al- titude radar blind bombing device as early as November 1941. The rise and fall of expectations of the Radiation Laboratory personnel in developing this device designated Eagle, is typi- cal of many sophisticated devices over the last 50 years. By the time it was developed into an operational unit, the standard AN/APQ-13 radar set on the B-29 scored almost as good as the Eagle radar set designated AN/APQ-7. The target diam- eter for laying 50% of the bursts from a string of bombs on a specified aiming point for Eagle radar was 3,000 feet against an oil refinery and for the APQ-13 against a comparable coastal urban target was 4,000 feet. However, the Eagle radar had ten times the resolution of the APQ-13 radar set and the operators were much better trained than the early radar operators. The target system selected for 315th BW was the Japane
