, the Eagle radar had ten times the resolution of the APQ-13 radar set and the operators were much better trained than the early radar operators. The target system selected for 315th BW was the Japanese oil re- finery and tank farm industry located along the south coast of Honshu which made good radar targets. The bomb run required was about 70 miles, therefore, you had to fly straight and steady for 10 to 15 minutes, abnormally long if flak was accurate. 9/10 July 1945 Eagle Mission No. 5 was run on 9/10 July 1945 against the oil refinery located at Yokkaichi with 61 B-29s depositing 469 tons HE on the plant. 12/13 July 1945 Eagle Mission No. 6 was mounted on 12/13 July 1945 by 53 B-29s depositing 452 tons HE on the Kawasaki Petroleum Center located at Kawasaki causing about 25% damage to the plant. The 315th BW lost its first two B-29s on this mission. The crew of one plane bailed out between Guam and Tinian after takeoff and one B-29 was missing. The 315th B-29 was specifically designed and coupled to the Eagle radar system. To increase bomb load, all armament was removed except for the 50 caliber machine guns in the tail. Removal included the two upper and the two lower tur- rets and three gunners, but this restricted operations to night raids. According to Gurelac (14), since the 315th BW was to do precision radar bombing, intelligence, training and briefing were done by the Wing and it did its own mission planning and prepared its own briefing material. 15/16 July 1945 Eagle Mission No. 7 on 15/16 July 1945 was a return visit to the Nippon Oil Company refinery at Kudamatsu previously attacked but missed the target on Eagle mission 2. This time 59 planes placed 494 tons HE on the target completely de- stroying it. 19/20 July 1945 Eagle Mission No. 8 mounted on 19/20 July 1945 saw 83 B-29s depositing 702 tons HE on the oil facilities located at Amagasaki. The bomb load averaged 8.5 tons per plane on this mission. 26/27 June 1945 The 315th BW conducted 15 mission
