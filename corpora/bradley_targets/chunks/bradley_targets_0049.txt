% of each facility was destroyed. 28/29 July 1945 On the night of 28/29 July 1945 Mission No. 11 was mounted against the Shimotsu Oil Refinery located at Shimotsu. 76 B-29s deposited 658 tons HE on the refinery. It was estimated that 75% of the tank capacity, 90% of the gasoline capacity and 6% of the roof area were destroyed or damaged. 1/2. August 1945 On the night of 1/2 August 1945, 120 B-29s - almost the entire Wing - hit the Kawasaki Petroleum Center on Eagle Mission No. 12 and deposited 1,017 tons HE but the mission did not appear to increase markedly the damage caused to the same refinery on Mission No. 6. USSBS states the precision attacks against the aircraft engine and aircraft plants was a duplication of effort. The aircraft engine plants were slowing production before the bombing campaign started due to a critical shortage of mate- rials such as steel and alloy metals such as chromium, vana- dium and magnesium. In addition, the initial air attacks in November 1944 caused what the USSBS described as a pan- icky effort to disperse the aircraft industry plants resulting in a declining production from a peak of 5,000 aircraft engines in July 1944 to 1,200 engines in February 1945. Figure 1 shows the decline in production to February 1945 and a pla- teau after this date despite a rising tonnage of bombs which were falling mainly on empty and abandoned plants. The pro- duction decline caused by the bombing was estimated to be 18% but it would have been a 40% reduction if dispersal had not occurred. 5/6 August 1945 Eagle Mission No. 13 on 5/6 August 1945 was a return visit to the Ube Coal Liquefaction complex and 106 B-29s deposited 958 tons HE leaving 100% of the refining units and 80% of the storage units destroyed or damaged. The petroleum campaign was even less successful in its effect on the war effort since there was no crude oil or oil in storage at most refineries making it a futile effort. The ton- nage was being dropped on refineries that were alread
