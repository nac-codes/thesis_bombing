gust 1945 - the last night of the war - was mounted by 132 B-29s depos- iting 959 tons HE on the Nippon oil company plant at Tsuchizaki. This was a 3,740 mile round trip mission from Guam and was conducted without bomb-bay gas tanks. Each plane averaged 7.3 tons per plane HE. 13 planes had to stop at Iwo to refuel. Post strike photos indicated that 100% of the plant was destroyed. In summary, in seven weeks the 315th BW put out of commission six of the nine petroleum targets in the Em- pire. Between 26 June to 14 August 1945, 1,200 B-29 sorties were mounted and 1,095 sorties were flown over the targets depositing 9,084 tons HE on this target sys- tem. Missions were flown between 10,000 to 15,000 feet and interception and flak were meager. Three B- 29s were lost and 66 B-29s damaged. The effort de- stroyed the oil storage capacity of six million barrels of oil, destroyed the Japanese synthetic oil industry and its refining capacity. Contribution of the Precision Bombing Campaign to Ending the War The primary objective of the strategic bombing campaign was to eliminate the war-making capability of the Japanese industry. The initial target selected was the aircraft industry as it was in the European Theater. The mere fact that there was such a campaign was sufficient to dramatically reduce the production of aircraft engines and complete aircraft, thereby stifling the Kamikaze attacks through the lack of planes. In addition, the type and variety of armament that was needed to The effort, however, was criticized by the USSBS. It states the Japanese were refining virtually nothing by the time the bombing effort started since the blockade had cut off its sup- ply of crude oil from the Netherlands East Indies and the Asian continent. It would appear that post strike analysis of photos would have shown this to be the case since there was nothing to refine. Presumably most of the Japanese workers were back in the hills. 20 blunt the B-29 attacks such as antiaircraft weapons w
