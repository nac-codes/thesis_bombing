photos would have shown this to be the case since there was nothing to refine. Presumably most of the Japanese workers were back in the hills. 20 blunt the B-29 attacks such as antiaircraft weapons were not produced since the arsenals were hit.

Both the Japanese army and navy were hoarding planes for Opera- tion Ketsu, Decisive Operation, the defense of the home is- lands.
