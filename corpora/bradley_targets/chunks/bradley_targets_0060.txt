case, the British effort seemed to have failed. The record is clear that the fire raids on Japanese cities were made with the intention of causing a conflagration but it is stated they were not terror raids in the Bomber Harris tradi- tion (2). The rationale for the different attitude is that with the limited level land mass in Japan industry and residential areas were intermingled to a much greater extent in Japan as op- posed to German cities. The nature of Japanese industry also made it unavoidable that residential areas would be hit. While the Japanese industry was highly concentrated in easily identi- fied large factories, they were backed by a myriad of subcon- tractors. As an example, Nakajima Aircraft Co. and the Mitsubishi Aircraft Co. relied for a finished airplane on sub- contractors for approximately 40% of the parts. These sub- contractors were not located in suburban industrial parks but were concentrated in cities. There was a legitimate strategic rationale to burn down the cities. Figure 1 shows the location of Nakajima Koizum plant's subcontractors in Tokyo and vi- cinity. However, the doctrine preached by Fairchild, Hansell and others at the Air Corps Tactical School (3) stated that the strategic industries important to an enemy's war making capa- bilities (such as aircraft, steel, oil and transportation) should be combined in the final stages of a bombing campaign with civilian morale as a legitimate strategic target. Whether this is a euphemism for terror raids is immaterial. The object is the 32 same and the Japanese certainly took them as terror raids Among the B-29 crews, it was commonly believed that if one was captured by civilians - no mercy would be shown. Re- turning B-29 POW's stated that they would have been killed by civilians if they had not been rescued by the police or army troops. Certainly, the fire raids brought home to the civilian popu- lation and, in the case of Tokyo, Emperor Hirohito himself that the war was lost despite pr
