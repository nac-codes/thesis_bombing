not been rescued by the police or army troops. Certainly, the fire raids brought home to the civilian popu- lation and, in the case of Tokyo, Emperor Hirohito himself that the war was lost despite propaganda to the contrary. Near the end, to take some of the sting from the accusations about the raids, propaganda leaflets were dropped listing the cities that were to be hit. This obviously did not go over very well with some of the B-29 crews but our air mastery at the end was so great that it had no effect on aircraft losses. This chapter cov- ers those fire raids against cities with a population of 300,000 or more and attacked in multi-Wing strength. Background to the Fire Raids That Japanese cities would burn was no secret. Well known was the catastrophic Tokyo and Yokohama fires re- sulting from the earthquake on Saturday, 1 September 1923. It registered 8 on the Richter scale and the New York Times reported several days later that the death toll in Tokyo was approximately 30,000 and in Yokohama 50,000. A refugee described Tokyo as an inferno. Fires were reported as effec- tively extinguished on Monday evening. In the turmoil, Count Yamiomoto formed a new Cabinet at 5:00 pm on Sunday and proclaimed Marshall law. The U.S. Navy arrived in Yokohama on Wednesday with aid. According to Morrison (5) studies were conducted in the U.S. on the appropriate mix of incendiary bombs to cause comparable conflagration. It was estimated that the 38 M-69 incendiary bombs in a E-46 cluster would require about 0.3 ton per acre (2). Working backward from this value, air staff analysis came up with the number of planes needed to cause an uncontrolled blaze. Such a force was not available to LeMay until March 1945. out and he was administered oxygen when he was recovered and was revived. A picture of Krantz dangling from the plane is shown in Figure 2.
