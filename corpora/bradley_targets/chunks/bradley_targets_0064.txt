a time as pos- sible. The Tokyo fire raid, despite the extremely poor weather conditions and broken up formations, was still able to burn one square mile of Tokyo. Gen. Power reasoned that a change in tactics such as increased bomb load through lowering the bombing altitude should cause an even greater fire. But lower- ing bombing altitude would put the B-29s at increased risk from anti-aircraft fire and enemy fighters. The most feasible tactic was to go in at night at a much lower altitude than had been tried. Gen. LeMay reviewed all the risks. Japanese AA de- fenses consisted of two types of weapons: one was effective 3 January 1945 Mission No. 17 was a raid against Nagoya by the 73rd BW. The 97 aircraft were airborne and flew in formation to Nagoya climbing to 29,000 feet as the bombing altitude. The formation did not go over the target in a closely spaced time span and the bomb patterns were not concentrated. Only 3.2 acres of Nagoya were damaged or destroyed. Fifty-seven planes bombed the primary with 139.65 tons of IB and 11.97 tons of fragmentation bombs. The latter were used to keep the fire fighters away. Twenty-one planes dropped bombs on the secondary target and TO and there were 18 aborts. As was normal for Nagoya, fighter attacks were aggressive with 346 passes and.claims by B-29 gunners of 14 destroyed, 14 damaged and 70 probable. Five B-29s were lost: a new crew on its first mission crashed and burned on Anatahan Island in the Marianas for unknown reasons; one plane was shot down by fighters; one was missing; two ditched on return flight with no survivors from one plane and five from the other. A memorable event happened on this mission with the plane "American Maid". Attacked by fighters, the tailgunner had his finger shot off and the left scanner gunner, Sgt. James Krantz had his left blister blown off. The plane immediately decompressed and Sgt. Krantz was blown out of the plane. Fortunately he had rigged himself a harness which saved his life. Ap
