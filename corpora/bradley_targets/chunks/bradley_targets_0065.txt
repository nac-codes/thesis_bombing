r, Sgt. James Krantz had his left blister blown off. The plane immediately decompressed and Sgt. Krantz was blown out of the plane. Fortunately he had rigged himself a harness which saved his life. Apparently these early B-29s had no seat straps for side gunners (later B-29s did). It took the efforts of the other two gunners and the copilot to haul him into the plane within ten minutes. Without oxygen at 29,000 feet one would not last long, but he was wearing his oxygen mask when he was blown 33  up to 5,000 to 8,000 feet and the other was most effective from 8,000 to 15,000 feet. The region between 5,000 to 9,000 feet was believed to be not well covered by Japanese AA batteries. Japanese night fighter planes were not believed to be very good and to have no airborne radar. In fact, our intelligence indi- cated that there were just two night fighter squadrons on the home islands. To prevent "friendly fire" and increase the bomb load, Gen. LeMay ordered all planes to fly on the next incendi- ary mission at night without ammunition except for the tailgun position. toward this goal. One must remember, that following the Okinawa conquest, the Kyushu invasion was scheduled for November 1945 and Honshu invasion scheduled for March 1946. If the strategic bombing of Japan was to win the war, there was need for a drastic change in tactics. Precision daylight bombing in formation was not placing sufficient bombs on target to defeat or even impress anyone, least of all the Japanese. To achieve the merging of fires caused by incendiary bomb patterns laid down by an individual plane requires a continu- ous stream of airplanes. To orchestrate these fire raids required a considerable amount of staff work. Otherwise the individual fires caused by individual planes could be isolated and extin- guished by local fire brigades. For the Tokyo fire raid of 9/10 March 1945, 325 B-29s from the 73rd, 313th and 314th BW were sent aloft, 279 bombed the primary target in Tokyo, 20 B-29s the sec
