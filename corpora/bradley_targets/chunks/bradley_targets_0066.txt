extin- guished by local fire brigades. For the Tokyo fire raid of 9/10 March 1945, 325 B-29s from the 73rd, 313th and 314th BW were sent aloft, 279 bombed the primary target in Tokyo, 20 B-29s the secondary target and 26 aborted. Each Wing was assigned a range in altitude which is shown in Figure 3. Also, each Wing's planes had an esti- mated time of arrival over the maximum point of impact MPI as indicated in Figure 4. For the Tokyo attack, the three bomb Wings deposited 1,665 tons, IB averaging six tons per plane. The incendiary bomb was the 500 lb. E-46 bomb cluster which was fused to release 38 M-69 incendiary bombs at 2,500 feet The M-69 was a 6 lb., oil-based incendiary bomb with cotton streamers attached to slow its descent. The streamers, as shown in Figure 5 could be seen as far away as Osaka. Some planes carried in addition, 100 1b. M-47 IB which exploded on im- pact. The M-47 was gel-gasoline with white phosphorus bomb. The resulting fires rapidly overwhelmed the meager Tokyo fire fighting resources and theory became practice. The fires from the individual bomb clusters, which were estimated to cover 16 acre area, merged. When these individual fires merged they spread to other combustible buildings in the area and even- tually, abetted by a 46 mph wind blowing from the west, merged into a fire storm. Fires smoldered for several days. Post strik photos revealed the consumed area to be an astounding 15.8 square miles (see Figure 6). Greater even than the staff theo- retically estimated as the burned out area. Japanese Civil Defense Up to the 3 January 1945 fire raid against Nagoya, there had been no fire raids against Japanese cities but Japan must have been well aware of what Bomber Harris was doing to German cities. The Japanese ambassador located in Berlin must have sent reports back on what had happened to Hamburg and what was happening to Berlin and other German Cities. Japa- nese believed they were ready. Since 1929, Japanese cities were supposed to b
