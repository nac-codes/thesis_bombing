mated that in the first two hours two planes per minute were over the target. Osaka was generally cloud covered and most runs were made by radar although 314th BW had nine pathfinder planes. The damage to Osaka was impressive with 8.1 sq. mi. destroyed (see Fig- ure 8). Five enemy AC attacks were reported by the 314th BW and 4 AC from the BW suffered minor flak damage; two planes were lost; one from the 313th BW on take off and one from the 73rd BW missing. Approximately 60% of the theoretical fire zone based on the bomb load was destroyed. In this fire zone there were many numbered and unnumbered industrial targets. One enemy plane was claimed to have been shot down. 16/17 March 1945 (Friday night) Three nights later 16/17 March 45, the strongest force thus far of 330 B-29s took off for Kobe, the important industrial city 25 miles southeast of Osaka. The 306 planes bombed Kobe and three planes bombed secondary targets with 21 aborts. The 314th BW had six of its planes designated as pathfinder with 500 lb. M-76 IB with instantaneous tail and nose fuses while the remaining force had E-46 incendiary clusters plus photoflash bombs with most bombing done visually. Antiaircraft fire was sporadic and erratic and enemy fighter interception was ineffective with eight unaggressive attacks. Approximately 1,836 tons IB were dropped on Kobe causing damage to 79,630,000 sq. ft. or 2.86 sq. mi., about 20% of the city proper (see Figure 9). 11/12 March 1945 (Sunday night) The Nagoya fire raid was another maximum effort by the BC and 285 B-29s bombed Nagoya with 1,710 tons, E-46 in- cendiary clusters. Based on observations of the Tokyo raid it was believed that bombs were wasted and they were falling too close together, therefore, the Intervelometer setting was increased to place individual bomb clusters 100 feet apart than the 50 feet for the Tokyo raid. In addition, the forces were divided. The 313th and 314th BW came in first with 154 planes and one hour later the 73rd BW came i
