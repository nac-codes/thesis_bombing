idual bomb clusters 100 feet apart than the 50 feet for the Tokyo raid. In addition, the forces were divided. The 313th and 314th BW came in first with 154 planes and one hour later the 73rd BW came in with 131 planes. This was also a mission in the British Bomber Command tradition; six planes from the 314th BW dropped M-47 IB bombs to mark the AP and the following 36 B-29s visually dropped their bombs on the initially marked areas. Staff estimated with the 1,710 tons, IB, on the target areas there would result in devastation of about 8,100 acres but damaged area was only 1300 acres or 2.02 sq. miles. Based on these poor results the next fire raid to Osaka went back to the proven tactics of the Tokyo raid. 18/19 March 1945 (Sunday night) On Sunday evening 310 B-29s took off in what has be- come known as Nagoya II. This strike was deemed necessary since Nagoya I a week earlier had done only scattered damage to the city and it was believed that the tactics were faulty and a much greater damage could be done if one reverted to the To- kyo raid tactics. This was done and the damaged area was concentrated but not to the theoretical value. 290 B-29s placed 1740 tons, IB on the area designated as Incendiary Zone No. 1. Approximately 2.95 sq. mi. were destroyed as noted in Figure 10. Important industrial targets damaged included the Nagoya freight yard, Togo cotton mill, Atsudo factory, Nagoya arse- nal, Aichi aircraft works and the Yamada engineering works. This strike brought to an end five hectic missions in which the air and ground crews were strained to the utmost to get aloft over 300 planes every other night for a 10 day period. What were the results? Certainly, the XXI BC took the gloves off and there were no more precision bombings of strictly in- dustrial targets. Morale was now also a strategic objective. As was suspected, Japanese cities burned but the results in area burned per ton of incendiary bombs never equaled the Tokyo raid value. An analysis by the XXI B
