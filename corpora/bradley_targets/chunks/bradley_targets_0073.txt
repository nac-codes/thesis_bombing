rd a consensus building process was initiated to end the war. In conclusion, 1,434 sorties by B-29s from bases on Saipan, Tinian and Guam placed 8,595 tons IB on four major indus- trial and commercial centers over a ten day period. Many be- lieved that Japan's industrial and governmental structure never fully recovered from the devastation to her economy and it rapidly went downhill after that period. But wars, once started, have a momentum of their own which we shall show. Follow up Major Fire Raids The remaining cities with populations greater than 300,000 persons were as follows: on Honshu Yokahama population 1,102,000, Kyoto 1,089,726; Hiroshima 344,000; Kawasaki 300,777; on Kyushu Fukuoka: 323,000. Both Kyoto and Hiroshima had been flagged and were not to be touched by conventional bombing. Two facts delayed the continuation of the incendiary at- tacks. First, the BC ran out of incendiary bombs. Flying in formation and dropping incendiary bombs on Tokyo from 25,000 to 28,000 feet on 25 February 1945, 314th BW planes averaged a bomb load of 2.25 tons IB while on the low alti- tude night raids the average bomb load was six tons and ex- pended 8,595 tons of incendiary explosives. This essentially depleted all the IB in the Marianas. The second reason was the tactical diversion requested by the Navy to assist the inva- sion of Okinawa through mining (see Chapter IV) and attack- ing Kyushu and Shikoku Island kamikaze airfields (see Chap- ter III). 15/16 April 1945 On the night of 15/16 April 1945, the 313th and 314th BW sent 194 B-29s against the Kawasaki industrial area which is part of the metropolitan urban sprawl which included Tokyo, Kawasaki and Yokahama. Ninety-nine planes were from the 314th BW and 95 planes were provided by the 313th BW. These two Wings dropped 1,110 tons IB and fragmentation bombs destroying 4.5 sq. mi. of the city or 55% of the target area. The night was clear and ideal for the Japanese search light crews and twelve B-29s were lost. Late
