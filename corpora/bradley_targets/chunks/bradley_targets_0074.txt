1,110 tons IB and fragmentation bombs destroying 4.5 sq. mi. of the city or 55% of the target area. The night was clear and ideal for the Japanese search light crews and twelve B-29s were lost. Late planes coming over the tar- get area met thermals rising from the burning city. Flak was of heavy caliber, moderate to intermediate and generally accu- rate. Enemy airplane opposition was marked by increasingly aggressive attacks (7). The 73rd BW, on the same evening, sent 104 planes against Kawasaki or the southern suburb of Tokyo. These planes 36 dropped 769 tons of IB on the area burning 5.2 sq. mi. accord- ing to Davis (10). One plane crashed trying to land at Iwo. Mission Nos. 68 and 65 summaries are at variance with one another. The 73rd BW history (10) states that they bombed a southern suburb of Tokyo called Kawasaki. The resulting conflagration damaged 8.1 sq. mi. of Tokyo of which 5.2 sq. mi. was accomplished by the 73rd BW. Rust (4) states that the 313th and 314th BW hit Kawasaki on 15/16 April 1945 and burned 3.4 sq. mi. and the 73rd BW on the same night hit To- kyo burning an area of 6.0 sq. mi. and due to spillage 1.48 sq. mi. of Yokahama. The 314th BW battle summary (7) stated that Mission No. 68 was against Kawasaki, burning 4.5 sq. mi. of the city. Probably, the most likely occurrence was that the approximately 8.1 sq. mi. of Tokyo and its suburb of Kawasaki were burned with possibly some spill-over into Yokohama. No urban area incendiary raid was conducted until 14 May 1945 when Mission No. 174 was run as a coordinated strike by four BW's - 58th, 73rd, 313th and 314th against Nagoya. The fire raid hiatus was brought about by the lack of incendiary bombs and the Kamikaze diversion. LeMay states that he en- listed Marines and Seabees to get the bombs to the planes. The bombs were not even stored in bomb dumps, but they were moved directly to the planes from ships. The 58th BW was redeployed to West Field, Tinian from the China-Burma-India (CBI) theater s
