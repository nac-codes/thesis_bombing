Bombing altitude varied from 7,800 to 15,100 feet with 1/10 to 6/10 cloud cover. Pathfind- ers vere used to mark the target and subsequent planes dropped their incendiaries on the pathfinder marked areas. On this mis- sion, the 73rd BW history stated that 93% of their planes went over the target within 42 minutes for 3.8 planes per minute, an excellent concentration in time. The total effort of 500 B-29s went over the target from 3:00 am to 4:38 Guam time or 4.3 planes per minute.

From 1 June to 15 June 1945, a series of daylight incendi- ary raids were run against the important industrial complex formed by Osaka-Kobe region. Five maximum effort missions with over 400 AC were run during this period and at the end regional industrial production based on USSBS study (13) was essentially paralyzed. The March raid on Osaka had burned out the central commercial district but the surrounding indus- trial and residential areas remained essentially intact. Of the 16,155 registered factories, 2,000 factories and 50,000 employ- ees were removed from the police rolls at once and during the 10 week period from 13 March to 1 June another 1700 facto- ries closed and 16,000 workers dropped from the payr
