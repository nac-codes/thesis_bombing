ctories and 50,000 employ- ees were removed from the police rolls at once and during the 10 week period from 13 March to 1 June another 1700 facto- ries closed and 16,000 workers dropped from the payrolls. As noted in Table 3, energy usage dropped from a pre-strike value of 72 million kW-hr in January 1945 to about 50 million kW- hr in April and May, a 30% decline in power usage. 25/26 May 1945 Mission No. 183 took place two nights later on 25/26 May 1945 with 464 B-29s placing 3262 tons IB on the south central Tokyo urban area from 11:38 pm to 2:13 am Guam time aver- aging three planes per minute. Bombing altitude varied from 7,915 to 22,000 feet in 1/10 to 9/10 cloud cover. Each BW had 12 pathfinder planes which carried 500 lbs. M-76 IB fused to ignite instantaneously on landing. The M-76 was a gel-gaso- line magnesium bomb which burned with a very bright glow from the magnesium. The follow up strike force dropped E-46 incendiary clusters on the designated areas but, due to high rising thermals, late arriving planes had to climb above the thermals and bomb by radar. Osaka-Kobe region is another urban sprawl similar to the Tokyo-Kawasaki-Yokohoma region and was attacked on the following days: Osaka: 1 June 1945, Mission No. 187; Kobe: 5 June 1945, Mission No. 188; Osaka: 7 June 1945, Mission No. 189; and Osaka: 15 June 1945, Mission No. 203. The Japanese were ready for us on this mission and ex- tracted a heavy toll. Twenty-six B-29s were lost or 5.5% of the attacking force. Flak was moderate to intense and the incom- ing planes were greeted by 80 Japanese night fighters. Three B-29s were shot down by flak, one by flak and fighters, one plane ditched, four planes made it back to Iwo where they could not land due to the storm in the area and the crews bailed out off Iwo; 17 planes were missing. Eighty-nine planes were dam- aged by flak and 11 by combination of flak and enemy fight- ers. Only one damaged plane was able to land at Iwo. 1 June 1945 On Mission No. 187,
