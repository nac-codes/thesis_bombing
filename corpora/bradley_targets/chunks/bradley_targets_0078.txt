The price was high with 10 planes lost or 2.1% of the attacking force (USSBS states 12 planes lost on this mission) (13). The flak was intense and accurate and the B-29s were attacked by Japanese fighters which were aggressive. Gun- ners claimed 16-9-24. Damage was estimated at 3.15 sq. mi. to an area west and north of the March area damaged central Osaka (see Fig 11 showing damage to areas after the March and June 1945 raids). On all the Tokyo missions, bombardiers were advised to avoid hitting the Imperial Palace which sat in the middle of Tokyo but due to the heat of battle on this mission, some bombs dropped on the Imperial Palace grounds and numerous build- ings were destroyed (10). Approximately 18.2 sq. mi. of the Tokyo urban area, south and west of the Palace, were burned as a result of these two missions, bringing the total damaged area to 56.3 sq. mi. or 50.8% of the total built up Tokyo area. Damaged or destroyed were a minimum of 31 numbered tar- gets. Gunners claimed 19-0-4 enemy aircraft. Tokyo was never hit again by a major strike during WWII. On this mission, 54 P-51s from the VII Fighter Command on Iwo Jima being escorted by a navigational B-29 encoun- tered a weather front with turbulence and 27 P-51s collided and were lost.
