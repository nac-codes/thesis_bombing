nly of wooden or combustible structures since no HE bombs were used, and two B-29s were lost. light steel framework, were generally destroyed if the contents were flammable. Most warehouses and mud and straw construc- tion were not destroyed. Practically no attempt at reconstruction was made since there was an acute shortage of building materials and manpower. Industrial activity essentially ceased in July as noted by the dramatic reduction in electrical usage and gas usage in both cases about 10% of the January 1945 level! Finishing Touch 19/20 June 1945 One relatively small raid was run against a major Japa- nese city before 15 August 1945. Fukuoka, a city of 323,000 and the largest city on Kyushu Island, was hit on 19/20 June by the 73rd and 313th BW with 221 B-29s placing 1525 tons IB and HE on the city. As noted in Table 5, 1.3 sq. mi. or 20% of the city's built up area was damaged or destroyed. No B-29 was lost on this night attack. Contribution of Major Fire Raids Toward Ending WWII It could be claimed that of all the B-29 raids the major fire raids were the most important, both in the strategic sense and in the terror sense. As noted above, in the Osaka-Kobe area. industry and commercial activity almost ceased to exist in July 1945. As Foreign Minister Togo noted, by late June 1945, in- dustrial production decreased drastically, not only in the pro- duction of aircraft but salt, essential for production of explo- sives, became scarce, food shortage was acute and serious public unrest by winter was predicted. Even more important, was the effect of the 9/10 March 1945 incendiary raid on Tokyo since it directly affected those who were making the decision of peace or war for the Japa- nese people. Emperor Hirohito personally got involved in the peace process and eventually overcame the military's reluc- tance for peace.
