to conserve resources; men, planes and ammunition, for Operation Ketsu (Decisive Operation), the defense of the inner zone. The Navy, on the other hand, wanted to hit the Americans at the outer fringes of this line to inflict as heavy a cost as possible, called Operation Ten-Go (Operation Heaven). The reasoning was not to win, no Japanese military man in January of 1945 now thought this possible. What the Navy wanted, as described by Togo, the Foreign Minister in Adm. Suzuki's Cabinet, was a victory in order to sue for peace from a position of some strength. Both services implemented their own respective strategies. The Army's strategy was a heaven- sent relief to B-29 crews, although they were unaware of it at the time. After suffering up to 5 to 10% casualties in certain missions in the first four months in the Honshu raids, the casu- alty rate went down in the last three months of the B-29 cam- paign to lower than in the Training Command (3). Hitting shipping through mining was on the list of target systems to be attacked as recommended by the Joint Target Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and was vigorously pur- sued by the XXI BC from 29 March 1945 to 15 August 1945 as described in Chapter IV. The mining operation complicated logistical support to Adm. Ugaki's Kamikaze force on Kyushu Island. To finalize these plans, a meeting took place on 7 March 1945, between representatives of LeMay's XXI BC and Nimitz' staff, it was agreed that the XXI BC would provide the follow- ing assistance to the Okinawa invasion dubbed Operation Ice- berg (2): 1) Landing day (L) minus 22 to L minus 10 (10 to 22 March 1945) maximum effort against Honshu. For the Japanese Navy, without a Navy, the strategy meant the Kamikaze concept. Naval fliers would direct their planes with 550 lb. (250 kg.), 1,100 lb. (500 kg.) and 1,760 lb. (800 kg.) explosives into American ships. The 1,760 lb. explosive was assumed to be sufficient to sink a battleship. From the Battle of Midway on, the Ja
