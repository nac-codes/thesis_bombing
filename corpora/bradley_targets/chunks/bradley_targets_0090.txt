. (250 kg.), 1,100 lb. (500 kg.) and 1,760 lb. (800 kg.) explosives into American ships. The 1,760 lb. explosive was assumed to be sufficient to sink a battleship. From the Battle of Midway on, the Japanese carriers, the backbone of Navies in World War II, were whittled away and now only one capital warship, the Yamato, remained seaworthy in the Japanese Navy. It was also destined for a Kamikaze style operation. 2) L minus 20 to L minus 12 (12 to 22 March 1945) photo reconnaissance of Nansei Shoto (Ryukyus Islands) with particular attention to Okinawa Gunto. 3) When requested, reconnaissance of enemy picket boats in specific areas requested by Nimitz. 4) L minus 10 to L minus 5 (22 to 27 March 1945). a)Alternatively L minus 10 or L minus 9 (22 or 23 March 1945), depending upon weather, attack Kyushu air installations as selected by Nimitz if visual bombing possible. Under radar bomb- ing conditions attack Nagasaki or Omura. On 2 February 1945, Adm. Ugaki was invited to a meet- ing at the Naval minister's house near Tokyo (4). He was placed in charge of the Fifth Air Fleet located on Kyushu and was responsible for the defense of Okinawa and the southern ap- proach to the home islands using the Kamikaze concept. This was all the Navy had left at this stage of the war. Adm. Ugaki was somewhat of an anomaly in the Japanese Navy. The Japa- nese Navy, as opposed to the Army, was reluctant to advance the Kamikaze principal on an organized basis and certain of the high officials such as Adm. Teroka, who commanded the Third Air Fleet on Honchu, was against it. If one had an inex- haustible supply of planes and pilots and the fuel to train them, the system might have worked for the Japanese, or at least made the American advance increasingly costly in American lives and ships. b)L minus 6 or L minus 5 (26 or 27 March 1945) Depending upon weather, attack Kyushu air in- stallations as selected by Nimitz if visual bomb- ing possible.
