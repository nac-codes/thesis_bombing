raditional "Big Week" offensive from 9 March to 19 March 99 50 51  31 March 1945 The day before the Okinawa invasion, the 73rd and 314th BWs were out again to assist the Navy. In what might be con- sidered a mission with a strategic objective in this campaign, the 73rd BW was assigned to hit the machine works at the Tachiarai aircraft staging facility at the A/F which had been hit four days previously (6). Four squadrons were assigned Tar- get A and seven squadrons assigned Target B at the staging facility. Assembly of formations was in the vicinity of Iwo Jima and Groups proceeded to the Empire in loose formation. One A/C, flying in formation at 600 feet, received machine gun fire from two small vessels and was forced to abort; an- other A/C of the same Bomb Group ditched shortly after with one engine on fire. All crew members except the tail gunner were rescued by a Lifeguard submarine. 1945 as described in Chapter II and the Kyushu airfields were attacked on 27 and 31 March 1945 with 144 sorties hitting airfields and 40 sorties hitting an aircraft factory since the in- tended airfield was cloud covered. In addition, on 27/28 March 1945 and 30/31 March 1945, the 313th BW from Tinian block- aded the Shimonoseki Strait with mines as described in Chap- ter IV. On 8 April, the 73rd and 313th BW attempted to bomb Kanoya A/F but without success due to weather. 27 March 1945 On this date the 73rd and 314th BW sent up 161 A/C of which 151 bombed their assigned A/Fs on Kyushu according to Bomber Commands Statistical Summary in Rust (5). The Wing histories tell a somewhat different story. The 73rd BW hit the A/F but the 314th BW assigned A/F was cloud-covered and the Wing hit the Omura A/C factory instead. Target A was hit by the four squadrons bombing visually, although complicated by some low clouds. Bombing was from 15,000 feet. While the bombing patterns were not all good, the last squadron hit a bullseye and 39% of the bombs were within 1,000 feet of the AP. The 73rd B
