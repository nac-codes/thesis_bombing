icinity of Beppu. On this day, 39 A/C from the 73rd BW hit the Oita Naval Air Base causing heavy damage (6). The AP (aiming point) at this A/F was the center of the installation. Photos indicated that four hangars and four general purpose buildings were dam- aged and three other buildings in the north east corner were destroyed. Ten planes were damaged or destroyed on the ground. A small residential area about one mile south east of the AP was also hit. Bombing results were rated fair as 38% of the bombs landed within 1,000 feet of the AP. On this mission, 144 tons of 500 lb. GP bombs were dropped from 15,000 feet. The 314th BW hit Omura A/F in north Kyushu on this day (7). The 32 A/C dropped 71.5 tons of M-64, GP HE visually on the A/F from an altitude of 15,300 to 17,500 feet. About 10.4% of the total roof area at the A/F was destroyed or dam- aged including 5 hangars and 15 other buildings used for ad. ministration, shops and radio installation. Flak, while not in- tense, was fairly accurate and 11 B-29s were damaged, but there were no losses. Eleven enemy A/C were verified as de- stroyed, two probable and two damaged. The 314th BW was assigned the important A/F at Kanoya - Adm. Ugaki's headquarters (7). A total of 44 A/C flew from the North Field, Guam to the Wing assembly area at Minami- Iwo-Jima, an island southeast of Iwo Jima. Forty A/C as- sembled into Wing formation and flew to the primary target. The A/F was cloud-covered and the formation flew on to Omura A/C factory in northwest Kyushu. The formation dropped 94 tons (376, AN-M64, 500 lb. GP) bombs on the factory from 12,500 to 16,000 feet. Total damage to the factory was an estimated 9.1% of the total roof area. Flak encountered was meager but augmented by fire from the naval vessels in the bay, west of the target. While the formations were over Kyushu for a considerable time traveling from Kanoya A/F to Omura factory, Japanese air opposition was ineffective since fire was inaccurate and lacked coordina
