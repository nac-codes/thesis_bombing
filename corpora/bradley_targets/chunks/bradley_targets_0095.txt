target. While the formations were over Kyushu for a considerable time traveling from Kanoya A/F to Omura factory, Japanese air opposition was ineffective since fire was inaccurate and lacked coordination and aggressiveness. Six enemy A/C were claimed to have been damaged. No B-29 was lost, but 15 reported battle damage from flak which was more accurate than on previous missions. While these were the B-29 tactical missions, that the XX Bomber Command had agreed to, Ugaki's Kamikaze attacks on the Okinawa invasion fleet on 6 and 7 April 1945 caused Nimitz to demand more intense B-29 bombing effort on the Kyushu A/F. On this date, the 73rd BW was assigned to put out of com- mission the Kanoya A/F, but the A/F's luck held for the second time since it was cloud-covered and raining (6). The second- ary visible target was Izumi A/F, but all of south Kyushu had 10/10 cloud cover. The radar target, City of Kagoshima, was hit. Twenty-nine A/C deposited about 70.7 tons, HE on the city, not necessarily the most effective bomb for the target. No 8 April 1945 B-29 was lost, no enemy A/C was encountered and there was only one anti-aircraft burst noted. For the first time, the 313th BW was used in a strike against the Kyushu A/F and it was assigned the Kanoya East A/F, but all of south Kyushu was cloud-covered (8). However, six A/C hit the A/F and 13 hit the city of Kagoshima, the radar target. Approximately 24 tons were deposited on the A/F and 15 tons HE on the city. One plane crashed into the sea shortly after take off and one plane aborted. Second, third and fourth waves of 27 planes each, flew over the Okinawa, Forty army planes flew escort to island. One hundred-ten navy and 90 army special attack planes hit Ameri- can fleet. In addition this attack included radar countermea- sures as described by Ugaki(10): " ... Army Headquarters re- connaissance aircraft dropped radar-deceiving tapes to the east." The mission summary table in Rust (5) indicated that on Mission No. 60 on t
