Naval Base. It was spotted by a B-29 plane and reported to the Navy. Since Shimoneski Straits had been blocked by mining on 30 March 1945, the Yamato ven- tured out Bungo Strait, the southeast exit from the Inland Sea entering the Pacific Ocean (see Figure 1). There a US sub spotted the exiting Yamato with her escort ships and alerted the 5th Fleet. As described by Morison (1), the Yamato was the largest battleship afloat with 18 inch guns (larger than any on US battleships) and nine-inch thick armor plate. The Yamato was on a Kamikaze-style mission. She was going to the Okinawa invasion landing site on the west shore of Okinawa and was going to be beached and use her guns on the landing ships and beaches. She had to be stopped. While Japanese planes were used for kamikaze attacks on the 5th fleet on 7 April 1945, none were used to shield her from the 5th Fleet carrier planes - certainly a tactical error. As described by Morison (1), planes from task groups 58.1 and 58.3 attacked the Yamato task force. Between 1232 and 1423 hours on 7 April, Yamato was hit by five medium bombs and ten torpe- does before she finally slid under the ocean with 2498 of her men on board. Adm. Ugaki, despite indicating that little damaged had been done to date from the B-29s, he was dissatisfied with the defenses at his bases. Kamikaze Attacks On 1 April 1945, Adm. Nimitz' strike force under Adm. Spruance invaded Okinawa and the Japanese put into force their plans for the defense of the island. The Army had written off Okinawa as far as trying to reinforce the island and it was left to the Japanese navy to hinder the invasion fleet. The Japa- nese navy planned two different operations. Operation Ten Go was orchestrated mainly out of the naval headquarters in To- kyo and Operation Kikusui (Floating Chrysanthemums), the latter plan by Adm. Ugaki out of the Kanoya airfield on Kyushu Island. Adm. Ugaki believed, as a result of these kamikaze at- tacks, he had sunk or badly damaged 169 capita
