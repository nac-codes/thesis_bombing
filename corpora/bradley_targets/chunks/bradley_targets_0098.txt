Ugaki believed, as a result of these kamikaze at- tacks, he had sunk or badly damaged 169 capital ships and many transports (see Table 3). While these reports were highly inflated, the US Navy was concerned and, no doubt, Nimitz ordered LeMay to step up the anti-kamikaze campaign. Actu- ally, this campaign to date (see Table 4), partially due to weather, had not struck the main airfields at Kanoya from which Adm. Ugaki was directing the kamikaze attacks and done little damage to the extensive network of airfields on Kyushu and Shikoku. The U.S. Fifth Fleet, during its sweep of Kyushu airfields, was subjected to kamikaze attacks almost continuously from 18 March through 27 March 1945. Adm. Ugaki lost 197 kami- kaze planes in these operations but, based on returning fliers' reports, he believed the following ships were sunk: five carri- ers, four battleships, one heavy cruiser, two cruisers and dam- aged five to six other ships. These were exaggerated reports but the attacks damaged the carriers Franklin and Wasp and five other ships (see Table 1). As a result of Kamikaze and regular bombing attacks up to 10 April 1945 Adm. Ugaki claimed 169 American capital ships were sunk or badly damaged in addition to many trans- ports near the landing beaches on Okinawa. Based on these reports, Adm. Toyada, Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet, speculated that there was a 50/50 chance of winning the Okinawa battle. These reports were highly inflated. As noted in Tables 1 and 2, the major capital ship damaged was the Kikusui No. 1 was systematically planned for 6 and 7 April 1945 with decoy planes making defense difficult.
