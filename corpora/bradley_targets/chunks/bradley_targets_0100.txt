7 April to 11 May 1945, 75% of all XXI BC sorties were flown against Kyushu and Shikoku airfields. Planes from the 73rd, 313th and 314th BWs participated in these missions (see Tables 5 and 6). 17 April 1945 On this date, the weather was fair over Kyushu and six missions, No. 70 through 75, were staged against Tachihari, Kokubu, Isumi, Nittigahara, Kanoya and Kanoya East airfields. A total of 118 B-29s placed 485 tons of HE on these six air- fields for an average of 86 tons per airfield. From the 313th BW, 20 planes hit Kokubu air field and 20 planes hit Kanoya East airfield with fragmentation bombs which were more effective in destroying aircraft on the ground (8) No B-29 was lost on these missions, but one squadron of the 73rd BW over Tachihari airfield at 15,000 to 16,000 feet made a second pass over the field in order to e in at a different heading to strike a concentration of aircraft on the ground and was subjected to 56 fighter attacks on the second pass. On 12 April 1945, as part of Kikusui No. 2, 185 kamikaze planes and 200 regular fighters and bombers attacked the Okinawa invasion fleet. Over half of this force was shot down. The Oka was a 5,000 lb. flying rocket on a one way trip. They were attached to a twin engine bomber which released them at a distance from their target. The Japanese Naval High Command (11) put great faith in this weapon. The 2.5 ton device made the carrying bomber slow and an easy prey for American fighters. All the Oka carrying bombers were shot down except for one. The one surviving Oka sank the Abele. Adm. Ugaki, in his diary (10), made no mention of the air raid on his fields on this day, but he states that his key officers and others were exhausted. Kamikaze raids had been staged almost daily since Adm. Mitcher's carriers appeared off the Empire on 18 March 1945. Believing the reports of his fliers, Adm. Ugaki (10) by 12 April 1945 had the completely erroneous idea that he had crippled the US Fleet and it was the cause of Presid
