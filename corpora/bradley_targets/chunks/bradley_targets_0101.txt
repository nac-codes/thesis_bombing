ff the Empire on 18 March 1945. Believing the reports of his fliers, Adm. Ugaki (10) by 12 April 1945 had the completely erroneous idea that he had crippled the US Fleet and it was the cause of President Roosevelt's death on this date. He believed that one more big push would finish off the American carrier fleet. He had hurt the fleet but it was far from being crippled. Another aspect of the Kikusui campaign was the cooperation between the Army and Navy who were loath to cooperate even in their last des- perate struggle. In Tokyo, Foreign Minister Togo had best described the object of the battle (11). Japan needed a victory so they could hope to negotiate a peace from a position of some strength, this the Americans were not going to permit, not after Pearl Harbor. This is the backdrop to the campaign that LeMay launched on 17 April and lasting till 11 May 1945 when Okinawa-based B-25s and B-24s took over the job of keeping the Okinawa and Shikoku A/F pitted and their planes tied down. 18 April 1945 Again, these same airfields, most important in Ugaki's kamikaze campaign, were hit by 112 B-29s with 13 B-29s hit- ting secondary targets, dropping an average of 73 tons per air- field. Also, the same Bomb Wings (73rd, 313th and 314th) hit the same airfields. Two planes were lost from the same squad ron of the 73rd BW through coordinated fighter attacks over Tachihari airfield. The squadron had taken 55 minutes to as- semble over Okino Island off the coast of Shikoku and the same island where the planes had assembled the day before to attack the same airfield. One plane was rammed by a Japanese fighter Overall, for the 12 missions over the two day period, fighter opposition was weak and flak was meager and inaccurate over most airfields and with no flak being reported at Kokubu air- field. This is where the efforts of the XXI BC paid off. Continu- ous bombing of Kayushu A/F on 17, 18, 21 and 22 April 1945 during which 2,361 tons of HE were deposited and so disrupted Ugak
