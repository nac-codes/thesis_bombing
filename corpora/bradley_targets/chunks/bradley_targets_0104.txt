There were only 30 of them, but as the runway was damaged, the daylight search could not take place before 1100. 9 one-hour delay 9 two-hour delay 50 six-hour delay 51 twelve-hour delay Unless interceptors are provided here, it will be difficult to continue operations in the future. In view of the situation the Combined Fleet or- dered three Raiden interceptor units to come to South Kyushu to be placed under my com- mand."
