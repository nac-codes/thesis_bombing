In addition, the Combined Fleet ordered a new policy which limited Ugaki's aggressive Kamikaze tactics, presum- ably to conserve his dwindling planes, gas and personnel for Operation Ketsu. But, Ugaki stated in this diary for this date (10) that a re- port from Hata Jima (an island north of Iwo Jima in the Bonin Island group) specifying that 2 groups of enemy planes, on a 280 degree heading, were approaching the Empire. Until after 0900, about 70 enemy planes attacked south Kyushu. It was troublesome since they used time-fused bombs again. A night attack from Miyazaki base suffered some losses and personnel and material from the time-fused bombs. But, Ugaki took heart that interceptors, jointed by Raiden, shot down three B-29s (actually, two were shot down). With the long string of islands from the Mariannas to the Empire, it was almost impossible to approach it undetected. No raids were initiated against Kyushu or Shikoku air- fields on 23, 24 and 25 April 1945. On 23 and 25 April, it was cloudy in the area and on 24 April the three BWs attacked the Hitachi Aircraft Engine plant at Tackikawa, near Tokyo. Ugaki mourned the destruction of Tokyo and hoped that reconstruc- tion would be made afresh. His wish has been fulfilled beyond his wildest dream! Ugaki also estimated that his aircraft losses were, since 25 March, as follows (10): 620 missing and eight destroyed on the ground. The total number of planes available to Ugaki was 620, of which 370 were operational. This attri- tion was at the rate of 163 planes per week and, it is no wonder that the Combined Fleet gave him orders to slow the pace or he would be without planes in about two weeks if his attrition rate continued as before. Airplane production was estimated at 1,000 planes per month, but replenishment would do little good without fuel
