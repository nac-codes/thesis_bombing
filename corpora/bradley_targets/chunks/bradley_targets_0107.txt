would be without planes in about two weeks if his attrition rate continued as before. Airplane production was estimated at 1,000 planes per month, but replenishment would do little good without fuel (See Chapter IV). To keep Ugaki's planes grounded, ten air fields on Kyushu and Shioku were hit on 26 April 1945. 26 April 1945 It was fair over Kyushu again on this date and the Bomb Wings hit the same airfields with even a heavier bomb load averaging 150 tons per air field. Ugaki stated that, at the Miyazaki base, more than a dozen large planes were lost this morning on account of time-fused bombs that hit near the shel ter so a night attack was impossible (10). But, the price was high as five B-29s were lost. Ugaki crowed that seven B-29s were shot down and 20 were damaged. " ... we're inflicting some damage to these daily sorties". The 73rd BW dropped 81 tons of high explosives on each of the following airfields: Usa, Oita, Saeki and 102 tons of high explosives on Tomitaka. All airfields but Saeki had been hit previously. Bomb loads averaged about 4.3 tons per air- craft. Since it was raining on Kyushu on this date, all bombing was done by radar with unobserved results (6). The 73rd BW hit the Izumi air field depositing 114 to HE and, on Miyazaki airfield depositing 120 tons of HE, b losing one aircraft in the strike (6). The 313th BW hit Miyakonojo airfield with 17 aircraft depositing 437 bombs and 17 aircraft deposited 405 bomb Kokubu airfield. One crew bailed out on the way home and enemy attacks did major damage to one aircraft and minor dam- age to four others. One hundred enemy attacks were endured and flak was experienced over Miyakonojo both accurate and inaccurate (8). The 313th BW hit the Nittigahara and Miyazaki airfields on Kyushu and Imbari on Shikoku. The 314th BW hit Kokubu, Miyakonojo and Kanoya airfields on Kyushu. Ugaki described the raids on this cloudy day as follows (9): "About 30 enemy planes raided southern Kyushu persis- tently, flying in sma
