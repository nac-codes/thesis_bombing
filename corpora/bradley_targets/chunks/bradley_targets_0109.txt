mitz as the major Japanese naval air fields from which the Kamikaze planes originated and all within about 50 miles of Kanoya air field, Ugaki's headquarters (see Figure 1). The 73rd BW sent 19 aircraft against Miyazaki airfield and deposited 109 tons HE on the field and 22 aircraft against Miyakonojo air field depositing 127 tons HE but losing two planes in this raid (6). On 3-4 May 45, Adm. Ugaki launched Kikusui No. 5 with 75 navy planes and 80 army planes; Adm. Ugaki, based on reports, assumed it was highly successful, claiming three battle- ships and four heavy cruisers. These claims were highly in- flated but the destruction to the Picket destroyers used to warn of the approach of Japanese aircraft were hit hard. Morison (1) gives a diagram of the disposition of 17 destroyers in a circle around Okinawa. On 3 May 45, U.S. Navy figures in- dicate that destroyer Little and LSM (R-195) were sunk and destroyers Macomb and Aaron Ward were damaged. On 4 May 45, Destroyer Morr and LSM (R-194) were sunk and the following ships were damaged: Destroyer Sloe, Luce, Ingraham, Birmingham and Sangamon. The Japanese also damaged two British carriers: Formidable and Indomitable. The Japanese bombers reported that the steel decks on the British carriers were thicker and stronger than on American carriers (see Table 3). The 313th BW hit Kanoya East airfield with 288 bombs or 72 tons HE from 14 aircraft and Kokubu air field with 560 bombs or 140 tons from 22 aircraft. On the Kanoya East raid, the B-29s were attacked by 25 Japanese planes which at- tacked aggressively while on the Kokubu raid, 50 to 60 planes were sighted but attacks were not aggressive. No planes were lost (8). The 314th BW attacked Kanoya and Kushira air fields. Ugaki complained that several Raiden, which were sent down here after all our troubles, were set on fire and destroyed on the ground. These planes can't stay aloft longer than one hour and in a long raid are apt to be caught on the ground. He also states
