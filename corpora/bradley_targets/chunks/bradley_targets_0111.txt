laimed to have shot down 30 Japanese fighters and our claims may have been inflated as well. It the case of the 330th BG, 13 aircraft were scheduled to attack Kanoya airfield. Nine aircraft were airborne, but 4 air- craft failed to take off due to mechanical reasons. The 9 air- craft assembled at Tanega Shima (off the south coast of Kyushu, see Fig.1) and proceeded to Kanoya airfield and dropped 176 GP 500 pound bombs; 158 bombs with instantaneous fuses and 18 bombs with 6-hour delay fuses. Bombing results were fair. All bombs dropped within 1,200 feet of the aiming point from an altitude of 18,000 feet (7). Phase Three: Anti-Kamikaze Campaign, 30 April to 11 May 1945 The 457th Squadron of the 330th BG sent ten aircraft to the assembly point of Minami Iwo Jima (a volcanic island stick- ing out of the Pacific south of Iwo Jima). They dropped 196, 500 pound bombs; 84 bombs with one to two-hour delayed fuses on Tomitaka air fields from 17,000 feet. The air field was visible through a thick haze. No B-29 was lost this day. This eight day campaign deposited 5092 tons HE averag- ing 637 tons each day on 12 Japanese airfields. According to the U.S. SBS, this campaign prevented Adm. Ugaki from mounting a concentrated effort against the Okinawa invasion fleet. But it did not eliminate the Kamikaze attacks. There was an estimated 55 A/F on Kyushu alone so the complete elimination would take more aircraft and a more concentrated effort which could only be launched from Okinawa. As soon as the air fields on Okinawa could be secured and planes brought up from the other islands, this effort could start. Ugaki indicated (10) that the day was fair over south Kyushu and his reconnaissance planes were having trouble locating Adm. Mitscher's carriers, but the B-29 air raids were having a debilitating effect on his air crews for he states: " ... only a few planes are left for use among the fighter group, crews of which are so exhausted that they said they just didn't care about anythin
