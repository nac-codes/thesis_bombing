ued. The ditching took place at about 1730 on 3 May, about 50 minutes after bombs away and 150 miles south of Shikoku Island. Two buddy aircraft hovered overhead and dropped two one-man dinghies. The CFC and tail gunner retrieved the dinghies and three dinghies were latched together. Presumably reporting from the air, the radio operator was in a 7-man life raft alone and 50 feet away was the bombardier in his Mae West in the water and 75 feet away were the three dinghies with the CFC and gunners. About 24 hours later they were sighted by another B-29, the red sail was waved, flares fired, sea markers spread and a signal mirror used until the B-29 circled at 50 feet and dropped smoke bombs. A second B-29 came over and stayed until a submarine arrived. Three hours after the first B-29 arrived, survivors were picked up by the USS Scabbarfist and later transferred with the USS Picuda. Five were rescued but six perished in the sea. 3 Max 1945 On 3 May 1945. Missions 133 through 138 were launched by the 314th BW with 59 planes with a loss of one plane. They deposited 301 tons HE on Tachiarai, Miyazaki, Miyakonojo, and the two Kanoya airfields and Kokubu. As recorded in Combat Chronology (9), B-29s on the Tachiarai mission claimed ten Japanese fighters. The average bomb load was 5.1 tons per aircraft, which resulted in 50.2 tons per airfield. As recorded in the 314th BW history (7), Tachairai air field was bombed by 9 planes between 1607 and 1608 from 18,000 feet in clear weather restricted by haze. The squadron was met by aggressive fighter attacks resulting in ten enemy aircraft destroyed, four probably destroyed and two damaged. Flak was meager but accurate. No plane was lost but, three suffered battle damage and one crewman was killed. Six planes landed at Iwo, 67% of the attack force! Strike photos indicated that bomb results were fair. Again the importance of Tachiarai air field for staging, repair and servicing of aircraft in the Kami- kaze campaign is indicated by
