attack force! Strike photos indicated that bomb results were fair. Again the importance of Tachiarai air field for staging, repair and servicing of aircraft in the Kami- kaze campaign is indicated by the strong opposition to this strike. Both Miyazaki and Miyakonojo airfields were hit by 11 aircraft each from 17,700 to 18,100 feet. The bomb results on Miyazaki were good but poor on Miyakonojo. Over Myakonojo, 40 enemy aircraft were sighted and 20 attacked the formation. One enemy plane was probably destroyed and four were damaged. No B-29 or personnel were lost or injured on either mission. Both strikes struck the airfield in the after- noon around 1600. Finally, nine aircraft hit Kokubu airfield at 1634 from an altitude of 18,500 feet with 48 tons of HE with excellent re- sults. It was the opinion of the strike photo analyst that the airfield was inoperative with only one portion of the field uncratered. No aircraft were lost but the squadron was attacked The airfield at Kanoya was hit by eight B-29s at 1636 from 18,000 feet with excellent results. The bomb pattern of 2,000 feet wide by 5,500 feet long crossed the air field from the south, through the center to the north and cut both runways. The airfield was badly cratered but probably still operational. by 40 enemy aircraft. Ugaki records (10) that their airfield was attacked by B- 25s coming in at low altitudes so that the airfields on Okinawa were being developed and planes from there could take over these tactical missions, but this was still eight days off. Kanoya East airfield was hit by 11 aircraft from the 19th BG at 1631 from 17,400 feet in clear weather with excellent results. There were six enemy attacks and one enemy aircraft probably destroyed. One plane landed at Iwo Jima and an- other at Okinawa and one B-29 was lost in a ditching(7). The aircraft that ditched received a direct flak hit over the target which tore a hole 18 to 20 inches in the aft part of the center wing section and passed through th
