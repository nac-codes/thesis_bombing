B-29 was lost in a ditching(7). The aircraft that ditched received a direct flak hit over the target which tore a hole 18 to 20 inches in the aft part of the center wing section and passed through the tunnel. Fuel lines to No. 2 engine were severed and the flight engineer disconnected the fuel transfer gas lines into the second section. Gas filled 12 to 14 inches of the rear bomb bay floor and the bomb bay doors were opened to drain gas but the gas was caught in the slip stream and came back through the camera hatch wall. Ap- proximately 15 minutes after bombs away, No. 4 engine had to be feathered due to a runaway prop. With only No. 1 and No. 3 engines functioning, and with only enough gas for one to three hours, ditching was the only possibility. Equipment was thrown overboard and No. 3 engine feathered as the standard procedure prior to ditching (although this is not what the pilot manual states). The wind was about 15 knots with waves six to ten feet high and 30 feet between the crests. The plane came in at 125 mph between the crests, the tail hit first and skidded 150 feet in the water before slamming down and breaking in two behind the radar section. The tail section floated for about one minute and the front section for about six minutes. The Bomber Command Missions No. 140 through 143 were run against Oita, Omura, Saeki and Matsuyama airfields. The latter airfield, located on Shikoku, was hit for the first time. These strikes deposited 210 tons of HE on the air fields for an average of 5.1 tons per aircraft and 52.5 tons per air fields (See Table 6). But, the averages miss the drama of some of these mis- sions and several were longer than normal(7). The Oita air field was bombed by 11 B-29s between 1006 and 1007 from 17,200 to 18,040 feet depositing 54.8 tons. Enemy aircraft made 14 attacks inflicting damage on one B-29 and B-29 gun- ners claimed six enemy aircraft were damaged. One B-29 was lost in a crash landing, from which four crew were rescued and se
