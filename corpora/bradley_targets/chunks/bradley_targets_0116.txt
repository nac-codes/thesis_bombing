Enemy aircraft made 14 attacks inflicting damage on one B-29 and B-29 gun- ners claimed six enemy aircraft were damaged. One B-29 was lost in a crash landing, from which four crew were rescued and seven perished. Almost the whole squadron, 10 planes, landed at Iwo Jima. Strike photos showed results as unsatisfactory. The Omura airfield was attacked by 10 B-29s with 42.5 tons of HE at 0953 to 0956 from 18,000 to 18,500 feet. Ten 4 May 1945 attacks were made by enemy aircraft with one being destroyed. A tactic occasionally tried of bombing the formation was used. Five to eight enemy aircraft made up to eight inaccurate phos- phorus bomb attacks. No B-29 suffered any combat damage. Strike photos showed that bomb results were poor. gets. Also, since airfields were beginning to be developed on le Shima and Okinawa, planes from these much nearer bases could take on this task. But the raids by B-29s continued on 7. 8, 10 and 11 May 1945, by 313th BW. Nine B-29s placed 46 tons of HE on the Saeki air field with fair results. The area of burst across the target was ap- proximately 800 feet wide and one enemy aircraft was prob- ably destroyed. 7 May 1945 Matsuyama airfield on Shikoku was bombed by 17 air- craft from 0909 to 0925 from an altitude of 18,900 feet. Eigh- teen attacks by enemy fighters resulted in B-29 gunners dam- aging four enemy aircraft. No B-29 was lost and no crew ca- sualties. Bombing results ranged from excellent to poor. 5 May 1945 During this last phase of the B-29 anti-kamikaze effort, the 313th BW supplied the planes and crews. On this date 41 B-29s deposited 238 tons HE on Oita, Usa, Ibusuhi and Kanoya but lost three B-29s in the effort. On the Oita and Usa mis- sions 34 Japanese aircraft was claimed to be destroyed by B- 29 crews (9).The 313th BW averaged 5.8 tons/A/C and 59.5 tons/A/F. The 313th BW situated on Tinian and closer to the Empire tended to carry heavier bomb loads per A/C than the 314th BW located on Guam. On this date the 314th BW sent
