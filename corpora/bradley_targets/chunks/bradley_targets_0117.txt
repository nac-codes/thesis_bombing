d 5.8 tons/A/C and 59.5 tons/A/F. The 313th BW situated on Tinian and closer to the Empire tended to carry heavier bomb loads per A/C than the 314th BW located on Guam. On this date the 314th BW sent 55 B-29s against Oita, Tachiarai, Kanoya , Chiran and Ibusuki airfields depositing 276 tons HE on all the fields. The 314th BW lost three planes on Missions 144, 145, 147, 148 and 149. 8 May 1945 Mission No. 144 saw 17 B-29s hit Oita air field between 1316 and 1320 from 17,900 feet depositing 105 tons HE in clear weather. The planes experienced meager and inaccurate flak and one enemy fighter attacked and it was claimed to be destroyed. The bombing results ranged from good to excellent with half the target covered with bursts and one bomb pattern was in the west portion of the Oita Naval Air Depot. No air- craft were lost. The important Tachiarai air field and staging area was hit by 10 aircraft at 1325 from 18,200 to 18,500 feet depositing 65.5 tons HE. Twenty-seven enemy fighters attacked the squadron in waves and shot down two B-29s and damaged two others. Seven enemy aircraft were destroyed, seven prob- ably destroyed and seven damaged accounting for most of the attacking fighters. Bombing results were classified as fair. On Missions 155 through 158, 250 tons HE were depos- ited by 40 planes on Kanoya, Miyakonojo, Oita and Matsuyama airfields. On this date the planes averaged 6.3 tons per plane, the highest bomb load on any day during this campaign (see Table 6). Ugaki indicated that it was cloudy at Kanoya on this day and B-29s bombed an area north of Miyakonojo from above the clouds and did no damage(10). But, he was in a retrospec- tive mood. The 3/4 May 1945 army offensive on Okinawa ended in failure and our strength has been reduced, troubles increased and a third Tan Operation was given up. The Tan Operation was a Kamikaze mission to Ulithi Island (the main anchorage of the US Navy in the western Pacific). "How to cope with this crisis is a very important matt
