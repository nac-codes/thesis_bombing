Tan Operation was given up. The Tan Operation was a Kamikaze mission to Ulithi Island (the main anchorage of the US Navy in the western Pacific). "How to cope with this crisis is a very important matter. So I ordered my staff to study it ... " Kanoya airfield was attacked by ten B-29s that deposited 54.6 tons of HE on the field with good bombing results re- ported. One B-29 and 11 crewmen were lost in a crash landing on Saipan. 10 May 1945 Forty-two planes of the 313th BW on Missions 159 through 162 hit Matsuyama, Usa, Miyazaki and Kanoya airfields with 240 tons HE and losing no aircraft. Chiran air field was bombed by eight B-29s at 2111 from 17,000 feet depositing 32 tons HE on the field with poor results as the bombs landed in open country in the north east of the field. Two planes suffered flak damage but no B-29 was lost. Ugaki described the Kanoya raid as follows: " ... Again we had guests, large enemy airplanes from early this morning un- til 1000.

Ugaki scheduled Kikusui No. 6 Operation for this date but his fliers were showing the strain (10). A Zero fighter tak- ing off from Kokubu air field deviated from the runway on take off and crashed into planes ready to take off and exploded. Fires broke out one after the other and more than 10 planes were destroyed. These five missions closed out the anti-Kamikaze cam- paign for the 314th BW. The daily pounding of Kanoya
