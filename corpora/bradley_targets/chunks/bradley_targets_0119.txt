off and exploded. Fires broke out one after the other and more than 10 planes were destroyed. These five missions closed out the anti-Kamikaze cam- paign for the 314th BW. The daily pounding of Kanoya and the other airfields was taking its toll in efficiency in the prosecution of the Kikusui campaign. There were wrecked operational rooms, damaged planes and uncertain take off times all contributing to decreased efficiency. However, Ugaki believed, based on radio reports, that four had charged on carriers and two had charged on other vessels. Two Oka planes were used but they were a failure. As noted in Table 3, these results were exaggerated but Adm. Mitscher's flag ship, CV Bunker Hill, was crashed at 1000 by two Kami- kazes killing 396 and wounding 264 men. Also, Adm. Turner, LeMay and other commanders in the 20th Air Force were not happy with this diversion of effort from the strategic tar- 99 58 59  While for a Strategic Air Force the raids may have been misdirected, to the sailors experiencing these attacks, the dan- ger was great and as Morison (1) and Hoyt (4) state no certain defense was set up against these attacks when the war ended. As the campaign raged on Okinawa itself and as U.S. Army and Marines ground down Japanese opposition into the south- east corner of Okinawa, Adm. Ugaki continued to wage his Kikusui campaign, although on a greatly diminished basis af- ter the B-29 effort started in earnest on 17 April 1945. Adm. Ugaki's campaign was adversely affected by fuel shortages which were the result of increasing effectiveness of the blockade around the four home islands. American planes had complete mastery of the skies over the Japanese home is- lands. On 11 June 45, 11 B-24 bombers escorted by 30 fight- ers attacked Kanoya airfield and were intercepted by 40 Zeros but not a single American plane was shot down. The Japanese pilots lacked skill and determination, partly the result of lack of training which was precipitated by the lack of aviation gas
