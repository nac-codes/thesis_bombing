together, 1,823 sorties hit the primary airfield targets and 130 sorties were diverted against secondary targets totaling 1,953 sorties depositing 8,135 tons on the primary targets with a loss of 22 B-29s. One gunner stated "these airfields are certainly not a strategic target but, the Navy must be hurting to divert our attention to them." The B-29 raids in Phase One were only pinpricks to Ugaki's bases and he described one raid on 8 April 1945 (10): " ... dropped about thirty small bombs on a village at little dis- tance from the airfield killing a farmer in the field ... " So, as hindrance to the Kamikaze Campaign, the raids were ineffec- tive. Only the 100+ plane raids in Phase Two caused Ugaki to yearn for a reprieve. But from 11 April 1945 the raids dramati- cally decreased the effectiveness of the kamikaze attacks. The Okinawa campaign was the equivalent of Hitler's lunge through the Ardennes in December 1944. These were desperate suicidal plunges designed, in both cases, to gain a victory at whatever cost in men and material in order to sue for peace from a position of some strength.
