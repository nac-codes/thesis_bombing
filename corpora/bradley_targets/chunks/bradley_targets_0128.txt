Starting in January 1944. airborne 10 cm radar became available (the so called H2S ra- dar) and mining altitude was raised to 15,000 feet. Hilary St. G. Saunders (1) states that the loss rate was 2.7% of aircraft sorties. New enemy ship losses from January 1943 to June 1944 were 255 ships totaling 175,000 tons or approximately 50 tons per mine dropped. Background The British, during WWII, were mining the waters around Europe since 1939 and considered mining both a defensive and offensive weapon. Britain found that the most effective delivery system was aircraft with the Royal Navy providing mines and mining expertise and the Royal Air Force Bomber and Coastal Commands providing the delivery systems. Nor- mally, mines were not delivered ballistically in a free gravity fall as in a standard bomb release, but released attached to a parachute which was designed to be released underwater. Aim- ing points and bomb runs would be distinct and required a dif- ferent set of rules and required practice by air crews to obtain effective results. In Europe this was called "Operation Gar- dening" and utilized
