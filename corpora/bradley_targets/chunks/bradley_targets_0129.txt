s and bomb runs would be distinct and required a dif- ferent set of rules and required practice by air crews to obtain effective results. In Europe this was called "Operation Gar- dening" and utilized two types of mines one, actuated by a ship's sound, the acoustic mine, the other, actuated by the ship's magnetic field, the magnetic mine. Near the end of the War, these two actuating mechanisms were used together on the same mine to confuse enemy mine sweeping techniques. In the Eu- ropean theater, a deadly cat and mouse game between the Brit- ish and German mines and sweeping techniques continued throughout the war. A particularly effective mining campaign, partially because the Germans did not expect it, occurred on the Danube River near Belgrade. Bomber Command, using Liberators, dropped 40 mines in April 1944, 354 mines in May 1944. Mining was done on moonlit nights with aircraft flying as low as 200 feet. Later, pathfinder aircraft were used and dropped flares and succeeding aircraft could see where to drop the mines. A total of 1,382 mines were dropped in the Danube River from April to October 1944. Between April 1944 to August 1944, critical barge traffic consisting of fuel oil from Romania and grain from Hungary dropped 60 to 70%. It also delayed deployment of troops to the eastern front during the Russian offensive. Ger- man defenses included balloons, antiaircraft batteries and the use of Junker 52 aircraft with detonating devices to sweep the Danube. A demagnetizing station was erected at Rusthik. Saunders (1) states that mine laying was much more ef- fective than had been thought at the time and was much more effective than direct air attacks on shipping. From April 1940 to March 1943, Bomber Command dropped 16,000 mines, lost 329 planes and sank 369 ships totaling 361,821 tons. During this same period, 3,700 aircraft attacks on ships at sea result- ing in 648 planes lost, 107 ships sunk totaling 155,076 tons In the Southeast Asia theater, the British con
