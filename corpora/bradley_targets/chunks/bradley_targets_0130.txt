taling 361,821 tons. During this same period, 3,700 aircraft attacks on ships at sea result- ing in 648 planes lost, 107 ships sunk totaling 155,076 tons In the Southeast Asia theater, the British conducted a min- ing campaign aimed at blocking the port of Singapore. In to- tal, 1,000 mines were dropped and showed the much lower mine warfare effort in this theater compared to Europe. In one By 1943, British production reached 1,300 mines per month and 95% of these were laid in enemy waters around Europe. In 1943, 13,776 mines were laid in northwest Europe by the British Bomber Command (1) and in the three months before D-Day 6,875 mines were laid from the Frisian Islands to Girond. These mines interfered with the flow of iron ore from Sweden to the Ruhr, movement of U-boats and supplies to the German troops in Norway. At the end of the war, the Germans stated that sealanes to the Baltics were blocked for days and weeks at a time. Bomber Command found that the Lancaster bomber was the best suited for aerial mining. Initially, aerial mining took 68 notable flight, RAF Liberators flew 3,350 miles in 21 hours to mine the Singapore harbor.

Besides crude oil from the field, the tankers transported avia- tion gasoline, the most precious commodity for the Japanese war machine. In summary, RAF Bomber and Coastal Commands min- ing campaign sank 759 ships, totaling 721,977 tons and dam- aged at least 130 ships totaling 426,000 tons. These figures represent 32% of all enemy ships sunk and 22% of the total tonnage sunk during the war in Europe. This impressive feat was not fully appreciated at the time. This was a modest mining operation; each plane carried two mines and the eight planes deposited 16 mines in the river. 25/26 January 1945 In the Far East Japan's vulnerability to blockade was ap- preciated by
