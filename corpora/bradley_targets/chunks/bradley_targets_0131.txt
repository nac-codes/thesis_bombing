a modest mining operation; each plane carried two mines and the eight planes deposited 16 mines in the river. 25/26 January 1945 In the Far East Japan's vulnerability to blockade was ap- preciated by the U.S. Navy and mining is an effective weapon in a blockade. Japan imported 20% of its food, 90% of its oil, 86% of its iron and 24% of its coal (2) from overseas, all trans- ported over water by her Merchant Marine. The Merchant Marine comprised 6,200,000 tons in 1942 but an immobilized 1,500,000 tons in August 1945. Her critical oil imports and tanker tonnage are depicted in Fig. 2. Initially, the US could only impede this traffic by submarine and in fact the few subs that penetrated within her defense perimeter had a lame punch. The torpedoes in use by the subs had a high defect rate and it was not until 1943 that the defects were fully corrected. Mission Number 30 took place on the night of 25/26 Janu- ary 1945 and involved 50 planes airborne with 41 planes min- ing the primary target area which consisted of six mine fields in the Singapore Harbor. Four planes dropped 24 mines at Victoria Point and Penang Bay. The planes mined the primary target from an altitude of 4,000-6,000 feet. While this was a night mission, 24 aircraft laid the mines visually on a clear night. Two Bomb Groups, 444 and 468, dropped 137, Mark 26 mines and 54, MK-25 mines weighing a total of 124 tons in the Singapore port area (4). Aircraft averages of three tons per A/C and carried either six M-26 mines or three M-25 mines (M-26 weighted 1060 # and M-25 weighted 1980 #). These mines were set to arm immediately and at various intervals ranging from ten to greater than 30 days. This delayed arming or making the mine inactive for certain periods was a tactic to deceive the sweeping counter measures. The Singapore mis- sion set another distance record by exceeding 4,000 statute miles. Mine warfare is a simple and effective interdiction method for shipping but, it was not until the last few months
