The Singapore mis- sion set another distance record by exceeding 4,000 statute miles. Mine warfare is a simple and effective interdiction method for shipping but, it was not until the last few months of the Pacific War that a noticeable rise in shipping loss from mines occurred. Tonnage lost does not in fact tell the whole story in mine warfare. As noted with the Danube River boat traffic, the traffic was immobilized until the river was cleared of mines. This secondary effect can be as devastating as the actual loss of ships. Mission Number 31 was flown on the same evening by 26 planes from 462nd BG with 25 mining the primary target area in Saigon Harbor with 184 Mark 26 mines. These mines had the new acoustically actuated devices. No aircraft were lost on these missions. The types of mines used against Japan are summarized in Table 1. Execution One aircraft landed at Chakiha Air Base because its radio was out. The mines were dropped visually on a clear night in Saigon Harbor. Mines were set for immediate arming and with arming delays of 10, 15, 20 and 30 days. One aircraft placed mines in Navan Bay, a target of opportunity, the remainder placed 101.76 tons on the primary target, Saigon Harbor. The night was clear and visibility unlimited with 5/10 cloud cover. XX Bomber Command, Mining Missions The XX Bomber Command, operating from bases in In- dia, sent out seven missions devoted exclusively to mining in SE Asia. These were Missions Number 5 (partial),30, 31, 39, 40, 46, 47 and 48. All missions were executed by the 58th Bomb Wing and involved some of the longest flights both in duration and distance covered of any combat mission that had been flown up to that time. Statistics on these missions are summarized in Table 2. 27/28 February 1945 Chronologically, the next mining mission was No. 40 con- ducted on the night of 27/28 February 1945 against the great naval base at Singapore. The primary mining target was Johore Strait where 10 aircraft dropped 55 M-26-1 mine
