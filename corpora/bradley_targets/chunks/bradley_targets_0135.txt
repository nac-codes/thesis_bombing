XXI Bomber Command Mining Missions Background The XXI Bomber Command mining missions were car- ried out against a high stakes background of the best and most effective use of the B-29 as a strategic weapon with important egos involved. According to Craven and Cate (5), Gen. Hansell, commanding general of the XXI Bomber Command, met with Adm. Nimitz in Hawaii in October 1944. Nimitz tried to in- fluence Hansell in the utilization of mines in the strategic air war against Japan. Hansell, the prime advocate of precision daylight bombing in formation against strategic targets, was not to be deterred by such a diversion. The actual effect of which would not be immediately observable and might take many months to become fully effective. Adm. Nimitz was determined and in December 1944 sent a request for mine warfare to be instituted as follows (5): Another aspect of the mining campaign had to be factored in. While magnetically actuated mines were developed by the British in WWI, their first real use was by Germans against British ports in the fall of 1939, soon after the start of WWII on 1 September 1939. These were very effective but were not initially used in quantity and the British rec mines as recounted by Johnson (7). Therefore, countermea- sures were quickly developed by the British s the German mining offensive gained momentum in the spring of 1940. It was quickly blunted. The moral of the story is that if you are going to use mines, you must use them quickly and in quantity to have a telling effect. red two of the 2 Type magnetic 80% acoustic 20% magnetic 60% pressure 20% acoustic 20% magnetic Date # mines Dec. 44 1500 2300 # sorties 405 590 General Le May ordered a four prong approach for the 313th Bomb Wing, assigned responsibility in the XXI BC for mining, as follows: Phase 1 Jan. 45 1400 Apr. 45 Training a) 15 February to 15 March 1945 b) 16 March to 31 March 1945 Partial blockade with stan- dard magnetic and acoustic mines Complete blockade wit
