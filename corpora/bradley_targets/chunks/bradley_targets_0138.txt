of Kure, Hiroshima, and Sasebo. These three ports would be important in supplying naval ships and army troops for any support operation to the Japanese garrison on Okinawa, which was to be invaded on 1 April 1945. Japanese countermeasures included sweeping the channel bottoms with explosives for firing the acoustic activated mines and it was presumed, based on later studies, that such charges also detonated the A-5 low sonic frequency actuated mines. Mines with magnetic firing mechanisms were fired by sweep- ing the channel with a wire with current which sets up a mag- netic field prematurely firing the magnetic mines. Conse- quently, it was believed that the acoustic and magnetic mines could be cleared fairly efficiently by the Japanese(7). The Twentieth Air Force divided the 46 mining missions into five phases: Okinawa Support, Industrial Center Block- ade, Northwest Honshu - Kyushu Blockade, Intensified North- west Honshu - Kyushu Blockade and Total Blockade. These missions are summarized in Tables 3 through 6. During the initial phase, a total of 2,030 mines consisting of 25% mag- netic and 75% acoustic firing mechanisms in two sizes 1,000 and 2,000 pound high explosives. Phase Two: Industrial Center Blockade: 3 May to 6 May 1945 For Phase Two of the mining campaign, LeMay ordered the 313th Bomb Wing to sow 2,000 mines in April 1945 but during April only five small mining mission were conducted as noted above. This resulted from diversion to higher priority targets such as the Kyushu air fields and urban areas. There was also a logistic problem with the availability of mines and appropriate firing mechanisms to thwart Jap countermeasures. Consequently, only 368 mines were sowed as opposed to the 2,000 ordered. Execution Phase One: Okinawa Support: 27 March to 13 April 1945 27/28 March 1945 Phase Two, designated the Industrial Center Blockade, was designed to close the supply routes to Honshu's industrial heart- land consisting of Osaka, Nagoya and Tokyo.
