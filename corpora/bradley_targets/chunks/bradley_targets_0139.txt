ril 1945 27/28 March 1945 Phase Two, designated the Industrial Center Blockade, was designed to close the supply routes to Honshu's industrial heart- land consisting of Osaka, Nagoya and Tokyo. Execution in- volved two full Wing efforts on 3/4 May and 5/6 May 1945 (See Table 4). Johnson (7) states that at that stage of the War, Japanese economy required 12,000 ship passages per year through the Straits, Inland Sea and 15,000 ship passages to the Kobe-Osaka inlet area. Nagoya and Tokyo Bays opened di- rectly onto the Pacific Ocean and as most B-29 crew members knew, with U.S. subs sitting a few miles outside these bays, they were essentially closed to the Jap merchant marine at the end of Phase Two. A full Wing effort on the night of 27/28 March 1945, 94 planes sowed 837 mines in the Shimonseki Straits and in the shipping channels of Suo-Nada, that part of the Inland Sea ex- tending from the Straits to the Isthmus of Kunisaki extending out from the northern coast of Kyushu. In this effort, the planes went over the target at 5000 feet and three planes were lost (see Table 3). 30/31 March 1945 Another full Wing effort on 30/31 March 1945 had 87 planes sowed 825 mines in the Straits and the ports of Kure, Sasebo and the army Port of Embarkation at Hiroshima at 5,000 feet with the loss of two planes. 3/4 May 1945 The 3/4 May 1945 effort sowed 691 mines weighing 577 tons in the Shimoneseki Straits, Suo Nada and Kobe and Osaka harbors. On this mission, 91 B-29s operated at altitudes be- tween 4,800 to 8,650 feet with no loss of planes (see Table 4). 5/6 May 1945 1/2 April; 2/3 April; 3/4 April; 10 April; 12/13 April 1945 There followed five missions in Squadron/Group strength in which five to 20 planes participated hitting the same targets except that Sasebo was not hit presumably since it was either devoid of naval vessels or effectively bottled up on the initial raid. Mission Number 52 was exceptional in that mining took place from an altitude between 25,700 to 26,450 fe
