ably since it was either devoid of naval vessels or effectively bottled up on the initial raid. Mission Number 52 was exceptional in that mining took place from an altitude between 25,700 to 26,450 feet. No planes were lost on this mission nor on the subsequent four missions On 5/6 May 1945, 90 B-29s sowed 728 mines in the In- land Sea and the harbors of Kobe, Osaka and Nogoy and To- kyo. No B-29 was lost during these sorties (see Table 4). After the 5/6 May raid the harbors of Tokyo and Nagoya were closed and received no more shipping. All supplies would 70 71  16/17 May 1945 On this date, 27 planes placed 165 mines in Shimonaseki Straits, Miyazu, and Maizuru (see Table 5). Miyazu and Maizuru received shipments from Manchurian ports. have to be delivered over an already overtaxed railroad and motor transport system. These sorties were conducted at alti- tudes between 6,000 to 8,400 feet. The mix of firing mecha- nisms was 23% magnetic, 27% acoustic and 50% pressure- magnetic. The latter mechanism was a new type that was be- lieved to be unsweepable. At this stage in the mining cam- paign, it was believed based on photoreconnaisance that the Japanese were able to sweep a channel in mine fields with only magnetic or acoustic mines in a few days. 18/19 May 1945 On 18/19 May 1945, 30 planes sowed 192 mines in the Straits and port of Tsuruga. 20/21 May 1945 On 20/21 May 1945, 30 planes deposited 184 mines in Miyazu and Maizuru harbors and the Straits. This effectively closed the Wakasa-Wan (Wakasa Bay) to ship traffic from Man- churia. Table 5 gives two values for planes lost on this date, three planes from Rust (8) and one plane from Johnson (7). A general reappraisal now took place based on results to date to determine the future course of the mining campaign. Johnson (7) believed with the number of mines available it would be more effective to go after vessels of 5,000 tons or more rather than to try and sink or damage every vessel that passed within the range of the
