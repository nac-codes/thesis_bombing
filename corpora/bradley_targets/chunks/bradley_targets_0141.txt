believed with the number of mines available it would be more effective to go after vessels of 5,000 tons or more rather than to try and sink or damage every vessel that passed within the range of the firing mechanism. Accordingly, the sensitivity on the mines was decreased making the effec- tive channel covered by the mine smaller but increased the prob- ability that the larger vessels would be either sunk or damaged. On 22/23 May 1945, 30 planes placed 178 mines in the Straits and the Jap situation was getting desperate. Industry was shutting down due to lack of materials, but more impor- tant at this time of year, the importation of foodstuffs was criti- cal to prevent starvation. Desperate measures were required and ship captains were authorized to try and run the blockade without adequately cleared channels. The results are given dramatically in Figure 4 which shows the increase in sinkings from the almost continuous mining of the Straits from 3 May 1945 onward. Furthermore, the new type firing mechanism, pressure-magnetic, contributed to the debacle. On 1 May 1945, LeMay ordered the 313th Bomb Wing to drop 1,500 mines during May continuing the blockade at the Shimonoseki Strait and the harbors on the northwest coast of Honchu and on the coast of Kyushu. In March 1945 before the blockade started 40 vessels per day passed through the Straits from ports on the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan. These seas are relatively shallow making the seas dangerous for U.S. subs and Japanese ship traffic continued to ply these seas relatively unhindered until the blockade. Ship traffic would now be di- verted to smaller ports such as Nigata, Miyazu, Maizura, Tsuirya, Fushiki on the northwest shore of Honshu and Fukuoka and Karatsu on the northwest shore of Kyushu. It was also believed that the logistic effort in order to get a whole comple- ment of 90 to 100 Wing planes off on the same night was too great and the effort was scaled back to BG strength.
