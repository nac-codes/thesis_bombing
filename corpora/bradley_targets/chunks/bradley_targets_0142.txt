eved that the logistic effort in order to get a whole comple- ment of 90 to 100 Wing planes off on the same night was too great and the effort was scaled back to BG strength. On 24/25 May 1945 Niigata was hit again and the harbors of Nanao and Fushiki on the Toyama-Wan Inlet were block aded for the first time which received traffic from Korea and Hohkado. In addition, the Straits were hit. All together, 27 planes deposited 186 mines on these targets with no loss of planes. 22/23 May 1945 24/25 May 1945 26/27 May 1945 27/28 May 1945 To properly plant a mine field was dependent upon many factors. Since all mines were sowed at night by radar, radar IP and AP points had to be selected taking into consideration the location of the mine field and antiaircraft batteries, the width of the channel to be mined had to be determined which set the sensitivity of the firing mechanism and finally the time be- tween each mine release from the bomb bay had to be deter- mined. Also, the proper mix of firing mechanisms had to be determined based on intelligence as to the type and effective- ness of Japanese countermeasures. Since some of the more distant ports on Honshu probably were not as well equipped with mine sweepers, the older acoustic and magnetic firing mechanisms were used while the more sophisticated pressure- magnetic mines were used in the Shimonoseki Strait. A single Group was used to sow these mines in Phase Three. Working further up the west coast of Honshu, Fukuoka receiving traffic from Manchuria and Hohkado was hit on 26 27 May as well as Karatsu on the west coast of Kyushu. In addi tion, Fushiki and the Straits were hit again. All together 29 planes deposited 206 mines in these areas from 5,900 - 6,200 feet. Closing out the month, on 27/28 May nine planes hit Moji and the Straits. Moji is the major port on the north Kyushu coast opposite the port of Shimonaseki. Sixty-three mines were sowed on this missions with the loss of one B-29. In summary, from 13 through 28
