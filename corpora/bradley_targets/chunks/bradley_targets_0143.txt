the Straits. Moji is the major port on the north Kyushu coast opposite the port of Shimonaseki. Sixty-three mines were sowed on this missions with the loss of one B-29. In summary, from 13 through 28 May, 209 aircraft depos ited 1,313 mines with a loss of three aircraft (7). One aircraft was lost on May 22/23 and one on 27/28 May to enemy anti- aircraft batteries and one on 20/21 May to other causes. The loss in shipping as shown in Fig. 4 caused the Japanese to in- crease the anti-aircraft batteries in the Straits area. Phase Three: Northwest Honshu - Kyushu Blockade: 13 May to 28 May 1945 The mix of firing devices was 54% magnetic, 9% acous- tic, 24% pressure-magnetic and 13% new low sonic frequency devices(7). 99 73 On 13/14 May 1945, 12 planes sowed 139mines in the Straits and Niigata harbor. The location of these harbors is indicated in Figure 3. Niigata was a major port on the north- west shore of Honshu receiving shipments from Korea, Man- churia and Hohkado. 13/14 May 1945 Phase Four: Intensified Northwest Honshu - 17/18 June 1945 Kyushu Blockade 7 June to 4 July 1945 Phase 4 of the mining campaign lasted from 7 June to 4 July 45 and was an intensified campaign against northwest Honshu ports and Shimonoseki Straits. It involved 404 air- craft, 378 aircraft in laying mines and 25 auxiliary aircraft involved in reconnaissance with the loss of one aircraft to "other causes" and one aircraft lost to enemy action. A total of 3,542 mines were laid on target at altitudes ranging from 4,200 to 9,000 feet. Most mine fields sowed during this pe- riod were intended to close channels opened up by Japanese countermeasures. All mine laying during this phase was by the 505th BG. Mining Mission No. 23 (Table 6) was against Shimonoseki Strait and Kobe with 27 aircraft laying 277 mines from 6,200 through 8,350 feet. Kobe, a major port on the Inland Sea, was last mined on 3/4 May 1945 and this was in the way of keeping what was left of the Japanese fleet bottled up. 19/20 June
