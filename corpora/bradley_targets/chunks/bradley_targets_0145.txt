diverted to Niigata, a considerable effort to keep the port closed was being made by mining it every six to seven days. 11/12 June 1945 On 11/12 June 45, Shimoneseki Strait and the port of Tsuruga were hit by 26 aircraft with 182 mines from 7,200 to 8,200 feet. Tsuruga is a port on Wakasa-wan (Wakasa Bay) and had not previously been mined but the port was opposite Osaka and Nagoya and a logical diversionary port for imports to these centers. It did re- quire the transport over a poorly developed train and road system from the west coast to the east coast of Honshu (see Fig. 3). 25/26 June 1945 On 25 June 45, Shimoneseki Strait as well as Tsuruga for the 2nd time and Okama. A total of 26 aircraft laid 201 mines on these three targets. 13/14 June 1945 27/28 June 1945 Continuing on the odd numbered nights, on 13/14 June 45, Shimoneseki Straits and Niigata were mined again, the Straits for the 16th time and Niigata for the third time indicat- ing their importance for the importation of food and raw mate- rials to Honshu. A total of 311 mines were laid from 7,000 feet to 7,700 feet by 29 aircraft. On 27 June 1945, Hagi, a port which received shipping from Korean ports of Fusan (present day Pusan) and Wasan was hit for the first time (see Fig. 3). Niigata was hit for the sixth time. Nigata was a major port for ships from Hokaido and Manchuria. Also the port of Kobe and Osaka were hit for the third and fourth times respectively. A total of 29 aircraft deposited 275 mines from an altitude of 6,700 to 8,700 feet. 29/30 June 1945 15/16 June 1945 On 15/16 June 45, Shimoneseki Straits and the ports of Fushiki, Fukuoka and Karatsu were mined. Fushiki is on Toyama Bay and could be used to funnel imports to the east coast of Honshu. Fukuoka was hit for the third time and Karatsu, a port about 40 kilometers southwest of Fukuoka on the west coast of Kyushu, was hit for the second time. Both these ports are on the Genkai-Nada. A total of 30 aircraft laid 297 mines on target from alt
