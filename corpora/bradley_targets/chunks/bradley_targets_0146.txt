ort about 40 kilometers southwest of Fukuoka on the west coast of Kyushu, was hit for the second time. Both these ports are on the Genkai-Nada. A total of 30 aircraft laid 297 mines on target from altitudes from 7800 to 9000 feet. On 29/30 June 1945, Shimoneseki Strait and Maizuru were mined as well as Sakata. The latter was mined for the first time since it is about 135 kilometers north of Niigata and an alternate to that port. A total of 25 aircraft deposited 225 mines on target from an altitude of 4,200 through 8,500 feet. 1/2 July 1945 On 1/2 July 1945, 24 aircraft deposited 203 mines on Shimoneseki Strait and Nanao and Fushiki harbors. The latter two ports on Toyama Bay. A total of 24 aircraft deposited 203 72  PAPER PROUD mines consisting of 161 tons, HE from an altitude of 7,200 through 8.700 feet (see Table 6). Logistics dictated tactics. Only a limited number of A-6 modified pressure-magnetic firing mechanisms were available. A large number of acoustic firing mechanisms were available and it was decided to use them against northern Korean ports since they were assumed to be out of range of the B-29 but if they staged through Iwo Jima, they could reach these ports. It was also necessary to continue blockade of Simonoseki Strait, ports of Niigata and Fusikiki and other northern Honshu harbors. Flak damage to aircraft at Shimonoseki Strait indicated a major reinforcement in that area and new high altitude auto- matic weapons were in use. The 313th BW requested that the mining altitude be raised(7). The final mission of Phase Four was flown on 3/4 July 1945 and hit Shimoneseki Strait for the 19th time, Maizuru for the fourth time and Funakawa for the first time. Funakawa is not on present day maps of Japan but it was a port north of Sakata and an alternate to that port and Niigata (see Fig. 3). 3/4 July 1945 During Phase Four, 3,542 mines comprising 63%, 1,000 lb. HE size and 37% one ton size. Firing mechanisms were distributed as follows: 55% magnetic, 21% aco
