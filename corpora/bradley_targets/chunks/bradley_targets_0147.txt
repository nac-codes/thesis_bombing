port and Niigata (see Fig. 3). 3/4 July 1945 During Phase Four, 3,542 mines comprising 63%, 1,000 lb. HE size and 37% one ton size. Firing mechanisms were distributed as follows: 55% magnetic, 21% acoustic, 21% pres- sure-magnetic and 3% low frequency acoustic. Johnson (7) estimated that 300,000 tons of Japanese shipping were sunk or damaged during June 1945. It was also estimated that the Japa- nese Merchant Marine was down to only 400,000 tons. A few observations could be made at this stage in the mining cam- paign: 9/10 July 1945 On the night of 9 July 1945, 30 B-29s from 6th BG sowed 274 mines in Shimoneseki Strait and Niigata and Fusihiki har- bors. One plane was lost to enemy action and mines were dropped from an altitude between 6,900 to 8,800 feet. From 9 July to 20 July 1945, all mining missions were conducted by the 6th BG of the 313th BW. a. Shimonoseki Strait was repeatedly mined but Japanese ship captains could run the blockade with results as noted in Figure 4 and complete closure of the Strait remained a top priority. b. The acoustic A-3 and subsonic A-5 firing mecha- nisms were sweepable by Japs in two to three days by bombing. c. Major ports were closed for two to three days and minor ports for two weeks. 11/12 July 1945 For the first time Fusan (Pusan) on Korean peninsula was mined and Rashin on the Asian coastline of Manchuria. Planes to these ports staged through Iwo Jima. Also, since it was assumed that mine countermeasures were not as highly devel- oped as in the Japanese home islands, the magnetic, acoustic and the low sonic frequency firing mechanisms were used(7) Maizuru and Shimoneseki Straits were hit again. A total of 27 planes deposited 199 mines from an altitude between 6,900 to 9,400 feet with the no loss of a B-29. d. Mines with firing mechanisms A-3, A-5 and mag- netic were sweepable by Japs. A-6 pressure mines could be defeated by traveling at very low speed and port closure would decline unless tac- tics were changed (7). This was
