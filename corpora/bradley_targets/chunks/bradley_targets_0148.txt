chanisms A-3, A-5 and mag- netic were sweepable by Japs. A-6 pressure mines could be defeated by traveling at very low speed and port closure would decline unless tac- tics were changed (7). This was Johnson's ap- praisal, but the Japanese saw it otherwise as noted by their comments at the end of this Chapter. Staring on the evening of 7 June BG 505 sent planes out every other night to ensure the effectiveness of the mining cam- paign with the loss of one plane. 13/14 July 1945 Mining Mission No. 34 occurred on the night of 13 July 1945 with 31 planes mining the harbors and channels of Shimoneseki Strait, Fukuoku on Kyushu, Seishin in Manchu- ria, Masan in Korea and Reisui. The planes deposited 254 mines from and altitude of 6,900 to 12,500 feet with the loss of no planes. The rise in altitude was necessitated by increased fire power being thrown up in the Shimoneseki area. Phase Five: Total Blockade: 9 July - 15 August 1945 15/16 July 1945 It was concluded (7) that by the end of June: a. Jap countermeasures would be well developed. b. Maximum use of the A-6 pressure firing mecha- nism and modified magnetic firing mechanism was needed. On the evening of 15 July 1945, 27 aircraft deposited 244 mines in Rashin Harbor in Manchuria for the second time and Fusan Harbor in Korea for the second time, and Genzan Har- bor in Korea for the first time; Konan and Nousetsu and Niigata on Honshu. No planes were lost flying at an altitude of 6,900 to 8,000 feet. c. Logistics limited B-29 effort and a total blockade was not possible. 99 In July, the Japanese abandoned ports opposite the Yellow Sea and concentrated on shipping goods from the Asiatic main- land through the Korean ports of Fusan (Pusan), Masau, Gezan, Konan, Seishin, Rashin. Reconnaissance indicated that Japa- nese ships used these Korean ports and the Kyushu port of Karatsu and Funakawa on the northwest coast of Honshu. Little traffic passed into the Inland Sea. Large imports of coal and fish passed from the Hokaido
