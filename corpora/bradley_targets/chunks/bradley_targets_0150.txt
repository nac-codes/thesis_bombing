st of Honshu and Okama. No planes were lost sowing from an altitude of 6,900 to 8,400 feet. 27/28 July 1945 On the last four mining missions no planes were lost. All nine missions from 22 July to 14 August were run by the dili- gent 504 BG who always ran mining missions every other night except during the period 10-14 August 1945 when many mis- sions were canceled due to peace rumors In summary, during the final phase 3,578 mines were sowed in 17 fields utilizing firing mechanisms as follows: 37% mag- netic, 19% acoustic, 13% subsonic and 31% pressure-magnetic as 1000 lb. 44% and 2000 lb. mines 56%. Mining Mission No. 40 is unique in the loss of three planes from "other causes". Twenty-five planes deposited 189 mines from an altitude between 8,000 to 10,400 feet. The areas hit had all been hit before except Senzaki. The other areas were Shimoneseki Strait and Niigata, Mizyazu and Maizuru on Honshu. 29/30 July 1945 Contributions of the Mining Campaign Toward Ending WWII On 29/30 July 1945 the port of Rashin in Manchuria near the Russian border was hit for the fourth time together with Shimoneseki Strait and Fukuoka on Kyushu. Twenty-six planes sowed 196 mines from an altitude of 7,900 to 12,900 feet with- out the loss of any planes. The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey estimated that the B- 29 Mining Campaign, which took four and one half months, resulted in the sinking of 770,000 tons and damaged 478,000 tons of Japanese shipping. The B-29 loss rate was less than 1% of the aircraft involved and crew casualties were less than 0.7%. The B-29s deposited 12,053 mines during the campaign for an efficiency rating of 100 tons of shipping sunk or dam- aged per mine expended. The British estimated an efficiency rating, for their European mining campaign, of 50 tons ship- ping sunk or damaged per mine expended. And the ships sunk or damaged were only part of the damage caused by mines. The USSBS stated that the shipping days lost could not be es- timated but were considered just
