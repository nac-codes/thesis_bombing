or damaged per mine expended. And the ships sunk or damaged were only part of the damage caused by mines. The USSBS stated that the shipping days lost could not be es- timated but were considered just as damaging in reducing food and raw material supplies to the home islands. 1/2 August 1945 Mission No. 42 on 1 August 1945 was a greater effort than the prior mining missions with 42 planes sowing 354 mines from an altitude of 6,500 to 12,000 feet, the previously hit ports of Rashin and Seishin in Manchuria and Shimoneseki Strait and Hamada. Hamada was hit for the first time and would be considered an alternate port on the west coast of Honshu. The disadvantages to using small ports on the west coast was the lack of a good transportation net to get the food from the ports in the west to the major east coast cities. There was no loss of aircraft on this mission. The words of the Japanese themselves, as to the effective- ness of the mining campaign, are the most revealing, a Japa- nese industrialist stated: "We could not continue the war. We had no raw materials and, if the blockade continued another year, 10,000,000 Japanese would have starved ... " (3). 5/6 August 1945 Prince Kanoye stated: "The aerial sinking of Japanese ves- sels and B-29 aerial mining of Japanese harbors were equally as effective as the B-29 attacks on Japanese industry in the closing stages of the war, when all food supplies and critical materials were prevented from reaching the Japanese home is- lands ... " (3). On 5 August 1945, 28 planes sowed 253 mines in Rashin, Tsuruga, Hagi, Geijitsu and Oura at altitudes ranging from 7,000 to 8,600 feet with the loss of no planes. 7/8 August 1945 On 7/8 August 45, the evening after the first atomic bomb was dropped, the ports of Maizuru and Sakai on the west coast of Honshu and Rashin Harbor in Manchuria were hit as well as the old standby Shimoneseki Straits. Thirty planes re- leased 255 mines from an altitude ranging from 7,300 to 12,000 feet. Captain T
