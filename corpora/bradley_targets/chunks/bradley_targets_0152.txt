coast of Honshu and Rashin Harbor in Manchuria were hit as well as the old standby Shimoneseki Straits. Thirty planes re- leased 255 mines from an altitude ranging from 7,300 to 12,000 feet. Captain Tamura, head of the Mine Sweeping Section of the Japanese Navy, stated: "About 1 April 1945, your mines changed from a nuisance to a problem. We increased the air- craft units and searchlight units attached to certain areas such as Niigata and Shimonoseki at the expense of the cities. The result of the mining by the B-29s was so effective against ship- ping that it eventually starved the country. I think you prob- ably could have shortened the war by beginning earlier."

Royal Air Force 1939 - 1945, Volume 3, London, HMSO London 1953. Adm. Chester Nimitz, after all the arm twisting and lean- ing on the Air Force to initiate a mining campaign, sent a con- gratulatory message to the 313th BW citing the "phenomenal results" achieved (5). On 7 April 1945, he wrote to the XXI Bomber Command: "The Navy is gratified on being able on Army Day to congratulate XXI Bomber Command on its out- standing accomplishment in completing the very effective min- ing operation reported yesterday. This project, like all opera- tions to date, has been executed with precision and determina- tion which arouses our admiration. It is a definite contribution toward winning the war." (6) 2.
