Mining can be an indiscriminate weapon of war and is presently the subject of several treaties limiting their effective- ness only to belligerents. At the end of World War II, many mines were still active in the water surrounding the Japanese home islands and Korean ports. Most of the mines were de- signed to be sterilized or automatically disarm after a period of time, but there was always the possibility that the sterilized mine might explode. Gen. MacArthur entrusted the clearing of mines to the Japanese. They were not completely cleared until 1947. 6.
