he target. 3/4 July 1945 It is ironic that such urban area bombing should be un- leashed on Japanese cities in this late stage of the war since the Japs initiated such bombing tactics against civilians in China in 1937. At the time they made no effort to justify such tactics based on strategic objectives. Hitler's air war against Britain was initially aimed at industrial targets until one German raid accidentally dumped bombs on London and the British recip- rocated by bombing Berlin. The Germans reoriented their bombing campaign from industrial to populations centers and, in so doing, lost the air campaign on a strategic basis. Two nights later, Takamatsu, Kochi, Himeji and Tokushima were hit. Himeji was on Honshu. All the rest were on Shikoku and were the first cities to be fire bombed on this island. Two planes from 58th BW and one plane from the 73rd BW were lost during these raids. Damage was impressive this evening with Kochi 48% burned down; Himeji 71.8%; Tokushima 74% and Takamatsu 78% burned. Takamatsu was described in the 58th BW History (3) to be the leading port on Shikoku and the focal point for the ma- jor rail and road system on the island. The following strategic targets were listed: railway terminal, repair shops and rail yards, Kinashiki aircraft plant, Makito Iron Works, chemical plant and seaplane base. While 78% of the urban area was burned out, there was no indication of damage to these targets. Two planes lost by the 58th BW this night typified the hazards of getting a heavily laden B-29 off the runway. The two planes lost, never got very far from Tinian, one crashed off the end of the runway and the other immediately after take-off. Casual- ties were 11 killed and eight injured. In June 1945, the 73rd BW dropped 508 bombs spreading 15,240,000 leaflets and 101,000 newspapers over Japan's heavily populated areas. July Fire Raids 1/2 July 1945 After a three day interval, B-29's bombed Kure, Kumamoto, Ube and Shimonoseki. Damage ranged from 20% t
