12/13 July 1945 Sensing that the Japanese may be "on the ropes", LeMay sent his crews out again three nights later to raid Utsunomiya, Ichinomya, Tsuruga and Uwajajima. One plane from the 58th BW ditched with one crewman killed and another injured and the rest rescued. Four hundred fifty-three B-29's deposited 3127 tons of bombs on the four towns. A possible premonition. Three days later, Chiba, Akashi (home of the Kawasaki Aircraft Co. plant), Shimizo and Kofu were hit. Damage ranged from 43.4% of Chiba to 64% of Kofu. A total of 3,864 tons of bombs were dropped on these four cities. Two cities; Akashi with a built up area of 1.73 sq. mi. and Chiba with a built up area of 1.98 sq. mi. had relatively small populations, but each housed important industrial targets. USSBS (8) states that the Akashi oxygen plant of the Kawasaki Aircraft Co. was heavily damaged and the Chiba plant of the Hitachi Aircraft Co. was lightly damaged as result of this raid. 6/7 July 1945 Damage to Utsunomiya and Tsuruga was 32% and 68% respectively, but damage to Uwajajima, by the usually reliable 314th BW, was only 16% and the 73rd BW completely missed Ichinomya damaging less than 1% of the town. Both Uwajajima and Ichinomya were small towns with populations estimated to be 52,000 and 42,000 respectively. Tsuruga had a popula- tion of only 31,000 but 68% of the town was damaged by the 313th BW. This could be explained by the fact that the 313th BW was familiar with the town through its mining missions Tsuruga is a port on the Sea of Japan (See Chapter IV) where ship traffic was being diverted because of the mines in the Shimonoseki Strait. One plane from the 313th BW was lost this night. The 314th BW History (7) states that all but 19 out of 131 planes over Kofu bombed by radar from an altitude between 11,200 to 17,100 feet with bombs away between 00:47K through 2:35K. Kofu was 64% burned out including railroad marshal- ling yards south of the city. According to Rust (9) the 330th BG receiv
