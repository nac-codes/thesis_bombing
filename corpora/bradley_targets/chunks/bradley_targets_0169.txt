between 11,200 to 17,100 feet with bombs away between 00:47K through 2:35K. Kofu was 64% burned out including railroad marshal- ling yards south of the city. According to Rust (9) the 330th BG received the Distinguished Unit Citation for this raid be- cause hydroelectric power sites were damaged. The USSBS does not mention this target in its report on the electric power distribution system in Japan. Uwajajima, on the southwest corner of Shikoku, was com pletely cloud covered and most planes bombed by radar with relatively poor results requiring another raid several weeks later on 28/29 July 45. In Utsonamya urban area resided one of the Nakajima air- craft plants and, according to the USSBS (8), it was heavily damaged as a result of the 58th BW raid this night. Missions 257 through 260 were run against Sendai, Sakai, Wakayama and Gifu with 58th BW and 314th BW each losing one plane. Damage ranged from 27.8% of Sendai to 74% of Gifu. 9/10 July 1945 16/17 July 1945 Numazo, Oita, Kuwana and Hiratsuka were raided this night and no B-29 was lost. Results, as summarized in Table 2, were excellent ranging from 25.2% to 89.5% of the cities areas leveled. All four towns were small, ranging in popula- tion from 20,000 to 77,000. Oita, on the east coast of Kyushu had recently become the headquarters for Adm. Ugaki of Kamekazi fame. It was to be his control center for the ex- pected Kyushu invasion (11). Hiratsuka was hit by most of the 314th BW planes bombing by radar. This city is near Sagama Bay below Tokyo Bay making it an excellent radar target and as a result 41.9% of the urban area was damaged or destroyed. Sendai, near the Pacific coast in north Honshu, was the site of a POW camp, Sendai 7B and as recounted by Daws (10) American prisoners evacuated the town with the fleeing na- tives escaping the devastation resulting from the fire raid. One American prisoner of war, John Cowalski, after escaping from Sendai 7B and then recaptured was asked by the officer at his court-
