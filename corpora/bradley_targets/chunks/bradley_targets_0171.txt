y enemy planes which shot down one B-29 and damaged another. Twelve crewmen were missing. Matsuyama was an important military center and the larg- est city on the western shoreline of Shikoku Island, serving local army and navy air bases including a branch of the Kokura Arsenal Depot. The main coastal railroad passed through the city and several railroad shops and yards were located within the target area. It was estimated that this raid burned out 73% of the built up area. 19/20 July 1945 Keeping up the pressure, the XXI BC launched planes against Fukui near Honshu's west coast, Hitachi, Choshi on Honshu's east coast (across the bay from Tokyo) and Okazaki southeast of Nagoya. Raids this day were originally planned to support Adm. Halsey's Third Fleet attacks against the east coast of Honshu. His targets were harbors and shipping (12). As described by LeMay (2), in a disparaging swipe at the Na- val air effort, he stated he was directed to support Halsey with a maximum strike against airfields in the Tokyo area. He pro- tested that these were tactical targets and were not in accor- dance with the strategic objectives of the 20th AF. Gen. Arnold directed him to assist Adm. Halsey in any any way that Halsey desired. Gen. LeMay accordingly planned daylight precision raids, weather permitting. But, if weather prohibited such raids, then fire raids against urban areas would be executed which actually took place. Tokuyama, below Hiroshima on the Inland Sea, hit by the 313th BW, had industries including two large chemical plants, a large refinery and oil storage facility and was served by the Sanyo Mainline Railroad. It also had dock facilities for small ships. The dock area was observed to be covered with fires and the raid resulted in 53.5% of the urban area devastated. 28/29 July 1945 Two nights later, six missions were launched against Aomori on the northern tip of Honshu, Tsu, Ichinomya for the second time, Ujiyamada, Ogaki and Uwajima for the second time.
