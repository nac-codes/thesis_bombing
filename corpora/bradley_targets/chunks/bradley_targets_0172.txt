29 July 1945 Two nights later, six missions were launched against Aomori on the northern tip of Honshu, Tsu, Ichinomya for the second time, Ujiyamada, Ogaki and Uwajima for the second time. No planes were lost on these six missions. Damage is summarized in Table 2. On 27 July 1945, all these cities had leaflets dropped warn- ing the population to leave the city since four to five cities out of 11 listed cities would be bombed (13). It was believed that the populations of the cities not bombed would also take to the hills. In some cases the Navy planned surface bombardment against strategic targets at some of the same locations hit by the 20th AF. On 18 July 1945, Adm. Badger attacked six ma- jor industrial plants in Hitachi (12). The following night the 73rd BW hit the same town losing two planes. Damage to Hitachi was estimated to be 78.2%. Damage to the other three cities ranged from 43.1% of Choshi to 84.8% of Fukui. The 314th BW had one damaged aircraft and one crewman seri- ously injured but no planes were lost. Aomori was the important terminus of shipping traffic from Hokkaido where most of Honshu's coal originated. On 15 July 1945, the 3rd Fleet had sunk eight of the 12 railcar ferries ply- ing between Aomori and Hakodate and put out of commission the other four ferries which reduced the transport of coal by 50%. Most of the fossil fuel power generation, transportation and heating of cities on Honshu depended on this coal. Aomori received 546.5 tons of bombs from 61 B-29's of the 58th BW through 4/10 cloud cover permitting some visual bombing. These planes averaged nine tons/AC which was made possible by staging the planes through Iwo Jima. Two weather planes went on ahead and relayed back data on wind velocity for the incoming bombardiers. These weather planes also dropped propaganda leaflets on Marioka, Hirosaka and Akita. The 58th BW History states that Fukui, one of the most important industrial cities on the west coast of Honshu border- ing the Sea of J
