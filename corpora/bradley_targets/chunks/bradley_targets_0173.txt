also dropped propaganda leaflets on Marioka, Hirosaka and Akita. The 58th BW History states that Fukui, one of the most important industrial cities on the west coast of Honshu border- ing the Sea of Japan, was an important manufacturing hub for aircraft parts, electrical equipment, machine tools, rubber goods, chemicals and textiles as well as an important transportation center. Both visual and radar bombing was used with weather CAVU to 3/10 cloud cover. Two weather planes were deployed and provided accurate wind velocity data which was essential to assist the bombardiers on their bomb run. The average at- tack altitude was 12,800 feet. Results were impressive with 84.8% of the urban area burned out. The 40th and 444th BG's of the 58th BW hit Tsu with 729.8 tons from 76 aircraft (9.6 tons per plane!).

Thirteen attacks were made by Japanese night fighters damaging two B-29's and three planes suffered flak damage, but no plane was lost. 0.54 sq. mi. out of 1.38 sq. mi. of the built up city area were damaged. The B-29 named "City of Omaha" had on board a journalist from Omaha who recorded his experience live while going over the target (13). After planned daylight raids on 24 July as described in Chapter I, two nights later the 73rd BW hit Matsuyama with 896 tons of bombs; 313th BW hit Tokuyama with 752 tons of bombs and the 314th BW hit Omuta with 965 tons of bombs. Omuta was hit on 17/18 June 1945 with minimal damage requiring this second raid. The 314th BW attacked from alti- tudes between 13,000 to 16,000 feet with half the planes plac- ing their bo
