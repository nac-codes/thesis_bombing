of bombs. Omuta was hit on 17/18 June 1945 with minimal damage requiring this second raid. The 314th BW attacked from alti- tudes between 13,000 to 16,000 feet with half the planes plac- ing their bombs visually on pathfinder markers and half bomb- 0 ts id 99 85  (7). The maximum effort by all four BW's, probably unbe- knownst to the Japanese, was to honor U.S. Army Air Force Day. On the return visit to Uwajima by the 314th BW. 0.35 sq. mi. or 37% of the built up area was damaged. Psychological Warfare Effort in July 1945 The improvement in fuel management by B-29 crews was dramatically demonstrated on this mission. Carrying an aver- age of 6,600 gallons, the average gas consumption was 5,850 gallons and the flight plan called for 5,828 gallons. Bomb load for the 330th BG planes was as follows: 1 - 70 lb. M-47 A2 (Phosphorus); 91 - 70 lb. M-47 A2 and 20 - 425 1b. E-46 with average bomb load of 7.6 tons. In July, the psychological warfare effort doubled to 1,101 bombs depositing 33,000,000 leaflets and 200,000 newspa- pers. During this month, the 314th BW joined the 73rd BW in the combined weather and propaganda missions. The 313th BW also participated in the psychological warfare leaflet cam- paign but emphasized the starvation that will result from the blockade which they were engaging in through their mining campaign (see Chapter IV). With the issuance of the Potsdam Declaration on 27 July 1945, a new effort was initiated spe- cifically warning cities in advance that they were to be firebombed. Up to 5 August 1945, 31 cities were notified and by 15 August, 14 of these were firebombed. This warn- ing, whether heeded by the Japanese people or not, takes some of the sting out of the accusation that these raids were "terror raids". 5/6 August 1945 This evening four Japanese cities were firebombed; namely Saga, Maebashi, Nishinomya and Imbari. Saga escaped with only 1.5% of the city damaged. The 58th BW crews complained that Saga was a poor selection for radar bombing
