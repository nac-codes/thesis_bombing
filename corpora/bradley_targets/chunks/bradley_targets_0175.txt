ese cities were firebombed; namely Saga, Maebashi, Nishinomya and Imbari. Saga escaped with only 1.5% of the city damaged. The 58th BW crews complained that Saga was a poor selection for radar bombing. The city is in the northwest quadrant of Kyushu and was an important railroad center with small manufactur- ing plants and housed part of the 48th Infantry Regiment re- placement unit but apparently had few distinguishing radar features. One B-29 in this raid crash landed at North Field. Tinian, with no casualties. Two Groups, 4th and 444th, from the 58th BW attacked Imbari from 12,000 feet and clear skies to 5/10 clouds permit- ted visual recognition of the target by most crews. Result were excellent with an estimated 76% of the target burned out. Flak and enemy fighters were nil. The forewarned cities of Ichinomiya, Tsu, Utoyamada, and Ogaki surrounding Nagoya housed important feeder industries for Nagoya's main industrial base. Surprisingly, despite the warnings and consternation of some crewmen, enemy opposi- tion was nil. Douhet had become a prophet (14). Maebashi, a town with a population of 89,000 and 80 miles northwest of Tokyo, was firebombed by the 313th BW result- ing in 42.5% damage to the town. As described in the 330th BG History (15), 33 planes were aloft from the Group to hit Nishinomya. An additional plane flew as a superdumbo and another plane flew a RCM mission Six pathfinder planes carried 178, 70 lb. M-47 bombs and one 500 1b. T4E4; and one 100 1b. M-46 bomb. The remaining 27 planes carried 39, 425 lb. E-46 bombs. The average bomb load was 16,525 lbs. Out of the 27 planes over the target, 13 bombed visually and 14 by radar. Meager and inaccurate flak was reported over the target and approximately 25 searchlights were reported in the target area but they were ineffective. This was attributed to the RCM ship over the target which jammed enemy radar. Average altitude for the attack was 13,400 feet. August Fire Raids Major strikes were flown against H
