During May and June, the propaganda leaflets were dropped on the weather/ reconnaissance strike missions. But during July, 12 sorties and in August, 24 sorties, were devoted exclusively to psychologi- cal warfare by the Twentieth Air Force. 8/9 August 1945 The force of 91 B-29's that could not get off the ground for the Yawata mission took off in the evening for a night at- tack on Fukuyama. According to the 58th BW History (3) this was a center for chemical production. Bombing was from an altitude of 12,000 feet which rendered 73.3% of the city's built up area in ruins. Flak and fighter opposition were meager and no Wing aircraft were lost in this fire raid.

As noted in Table 4, 18 of the minor cities hit dur- ing this part of the B-29 effort contained strategic aircraft plants and about half of these received heavy damage. But overall, the US Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) did not have a great deal of praise for many of these raids against secondary Japa- nese cities. In most cases, even the strategic targets were be- ing immobilized for the second or third time. The first time was the precision raids, the second and most effective was the blockade which prevented Japanese from receiving any food or raw materials from her erstwhile Empire.
