accepted the Potsdam Declaration. However, they were haggling over the peace terms, especially the status of the Emperor (12). The average B-29 crewman was unaware of all these developments and it took the respite as a matter of course. The Navy contin- ued to press their attacks on the Japanese but the Air Force stood down until the night of 14/15 Aug 1945. The 313th BW teamed up with part of the 314th BW to hit Kumagaya depositing 593 tons and destroying 45% of the city area. Kumagaya was an industrial city located north of Tokyo, 40 AC from the 330th BG participated in the mission; one AC was a superdumbo and one was a RCM plane carrying two 4,000 lb. GP/HE bomb. The average bomb load for the re- maining planes was 20, 425 lb. E-46 and 92 - 70 lb. M-47 A2 totaling an average of 7.52 tons per plane. Most planes bombed by radar due to 10/10 cloud cover over the target. The 73rd BW providing 8 planes and the 314th BW pro- viding 76 planes attacked Iaesaki (also north of Tokyo) in Mis- sion Number 330, the last mission of the strategic bombing campaign from the Marianas which started on 24 Nov 1944. During the attack on Iaesaki, 86 planes dropped 614 tons on the target destroying 17% of the built up area. No planes were lost over Iaesaki or Kumagaya in either mission. Many crews were still landing on Guam when word came that President Harry Truman announced that Japan had surren- dered unconditionally. Psychological Warfare Summary In conclusion, the psychological warfare conducted by the 73rd, 313th, 314th and 58th BWs consisted of 200 sorties from May to 15 August 1945 dropping leaflets and newspapers all over the Empire urging the populace to surrender.
