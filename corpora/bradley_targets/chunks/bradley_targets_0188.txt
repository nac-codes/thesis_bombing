an 8.000 lb. (4 ton) bomb to be carried in the Lancaster, the standard British bomber used in their night bombing cam- paign against German cities. There was some thought given to using the Lancaster, but Gen. Arnold stated the B-29 would be modified to accomplish the delivery of the bomb and since America has spent $2,000,000,000 to develop the ordnance, the Air Force would do every thing to assure its delivery on target. He was true to his word. The ordnance was not expected to be ready for six months, therefore, Ja- pan would be the most likely target since it was expected that Germany would be defeated before the bomb would be ready. Col. Tibbets had already served a tour in the European theater. ' He returned to the States in February 1943 and, es- sentially, checked himself out in the B-29 and was assigned as pilot instructor in Birmingham, Alabama. At this stage in the B-29 development, the plane was suffering growing pains with the engine over-heating. The engine heated up and caught on fire on the ground. Consequently, the Training Command was encountering reluctance on the part of some pilots to train on the B-29. The Training Command occasionally used WASP (Women Air Service Program) pilots to demonstrate how easy it was to fly some of the hot planes as they came off the pro- duction line. They were very successful in demonstrating to the reluctant trainee pilots how easy it was to fly the B-26. Lt. Col. Tibbets heard of this goading effect the WASP pilots had on the B-26 pilot trainees. He obtained two WASP pilots, Dora Dougherty and Doritha Johnson, from the Elgin Air Force Base in Florida where they were piloting planes towing tar- gets. He checked them out on the B-29, instructing them to takeoff without engine checks as quickly as possible after start- ing the engines. They were not informed as to the reason for the quick takeoffs (3). The two WASP pilots then toured B-29 bases in New Mexico demonstrating how easy it was to fly the B-29. The tactic
