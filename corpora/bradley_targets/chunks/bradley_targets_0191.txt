paign, code named Torch. He rose to 12th Air Force Staff Operations Officer but crossed swords with Col. (at the time) Lauris Norstad, Chief of Operations and was transferred back to the States by General Doolittle. The Bomb When Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann identified the sus- pected fission of natural uranium under neutron bombardment in December 1938, every physicist in the field of nuclear physics understood that a new era had dawned. Albert Einstein's fa- mous equation arising out of relativity theory equating mass with energy meant that if an atom split enormous energy must be released. Chemical reactions for explosives release tiny bits of energy per reaction, equivalent to about 10 electron volts, while a nuclear fission reaction releases 200 million electron volts per reaction. A factor of 107 greater than an ordinary chemical reaction. One immediately perceives the enormous explosive power in a nuclear device. Even a relatively modest bomb of a couple pounds of uranium would have the explosive equivalent of 10,000 to 20,000 tons of TNT. The bomb, to- gether with its ancillary explosives, might only weigh five to six tons. When one considered that a 1000 plane B-29 raid could, at best, only deposit about 7000 tons HE the new di- mensions of the bomb are immediately obvious. the rate of fissions and the number of fissions, the chain reaction can be controlled either to produce power or to have an explosion. The two isotopes most important in 1943 for making a nuclear ordnance were Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239. Ura- nium-235 is found in nature at an abundance of 0.7% by weight of natural uranium. This was a dilemma. Uranium's only com- mercial use up to 1940 was as pigment for a glaze in pottery and as a source of radium (radium-226 is one of the daughters in the decay chain of Uranium-238, the most abundant isotope in natural uranium). There was suddenly a need for tons of uranium which were not readily available. The three major sources available to the
