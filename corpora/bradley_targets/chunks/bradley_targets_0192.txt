the decay chain of Uranium-238, the most abundant isotope in natural uranium). There was suddenly a need for tons of uranium which were not readily available. The three major sources available to the U.S. were Canada's Great Bear Lake, Belgium Congo and the carnotite deposits in the American west. Relative to the other two deposits the carnotite ore was of very low grade. Through an intercession with the Belgian govern- ment, the U.S. government was able to obtain 3000 tons of Belgian Congo ore which had been shipped to Staten Island, NY prior to the war for safe keeping. These deposits and the reopening of the mine at Great Bear Lake met the immediate needs of the Manhattan Project. Many physicists who had fled Germany had great fears that this type of ordnance would fall into Hitler's hands. As recounted in Rhodes (5), Einstein, Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller met in the summer of 1939 and decided on a course of action. An immediate concern was to secure a source of the rare element, uranium. They were aware that Hitler had closed off the export of uranium from the St. Joachimsthal mine nium supply from the Be Fermi calculated that he could build a self-sustaining chain reaction with a pile of natural uranium embedded in blocks of graphite. This is about as far as the Germans got, although they took a slightly different route by employing a sphere of natural uranium in heavy water. Heavy water contains Hydro- gen-2 rather than Hydrogen-1 as in ordinary water and conse- quently is less poisonous to a self-sustaining reaction. The Germans had in mind a nuclear heat source to power a ship, possibly a submarine. in Czechoslovakia. They wanted, at least, to secure the ura- he Belgian Congo (now Zaire or Congo). Initially, Einstein was going to approach Queen Elizabeth of Belgium whom he knew, but they believed that the energy po- tential from nuclear fission must be first brought to the atten- tion of the U.S. government. It was suggested that a letter be
