ous was a lapse in procedure. She was to have become part of a task force which was out on training exercises. When the ship did not show up the task force commander assumed she was de- layed en route but made no inquiry as to her whereabouts. The court martialed naval captain later committed suicide. The production reactors went on line at Hanford, Wash- ington in the spring of 1944 and the first samples of Plutonium from the irradiated slugs arrived in Los Alamos in July 44. Following additional purification, criticality experiments were run which indicated a disturbing fact. The isotope Pu-240, which decays by spontaneous fission, was present with Pu- 239. This meant that additional neutrons are given off and Pu- 239, when bringing the subcritical masses together, would lead to predetonation and result in a dud if the gun-type ordnance was used. The dud, of course, still releases about 1000 tons TNT equivalent. The only practical way then thought feasible to bring the subcritical parts of plutonium together was in an implosive type bomb. A meeting of all the principle players - Groves, Fermi, Oppenheimer, Conant, Compton and Nichols - was convened on 17 July 1944 to decide on a course of action. The gun-type bomb was abandoned for Pu and the implosion type bomb research and development were greatly expanded. Ballistic tests were run on the gun type ordnance and its dimensions were frozen in March 45. R & D on the implosion device expanded with the addition of J. von Neumann to Neddermeyer's implosion group. Calculations indicated sev- eral advantages to the implosion device. Pu did not have to be as pure, a smaller critical mass would explode and finally, de- spite the presence of Pu-240, the velocity of approach was suf- ficiently great that predetonation did not occur. But, there were sufficient number of unknowns that Oppenheimer stated that the implosion device could not be used over enemy territory without a test. These tests were dubbed "Trinity". Gen. Gro
