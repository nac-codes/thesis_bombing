ccur. But, there were sufficient number of unknowns that Oppenheimer stated that the implosion device could not be used over enemy territory without a test. These tests were dubbed "Trinity". Gen. Groves wanted no slip ups in preparation for deliv- ery of the bomb and sent Col. Kirkpatrick to Tinian in March 1945 with a letter of introduction from Arnold to LeMay and from King to Nimitz to ensure that everything was in place when the 509th BG arrived on Tinian, then scheduled for June 1945. The facilities included, beside the standard B-29 facili- ties for a bomb squadron, laboratory space, machine and weld- ing shop for assembly of the atomic bomb. In addition, there had to be a special loading area with a recessed bay built to get the 5-6 ton bomb into the forward B-29 bombay. From the Trinity test number one was run with 100 tons high explo- sive and a small amount of Pu on 2 May 1945. The high ex- plosion test was successful but the Plutonium critical mass test had to be delayed till 17 July 1945. Since Secretary Stimson (Secretary of War and the highest ranking civilian who was responsible for development of the atomic bomb) was leaving for the Potsdam Conference scheduled to begin on 16 July, Groves wanted the test put forward but Oppenheimer stated that this was impossible. On 7 July, Oppenheimer called Groves 96 outside, the atomic bombs looked like conventional ordnance. The only difference was their dimension and weight requiring special handling equipment. The transport of the Plutonium core and initiator was by two C-54s, everything was in place by 2 August 1945 for use of two bombs, one Uranium-235 bomb dubbed "Little Boy" (Fig. 2) and the other bomb with Plutonium-239 dubbed "Fat Man" (Fig. 3). The only uncertainty, as with all B-29 strikes, was the weather. Training Missions Overseas hit their primary targets and three, their secondary targets. Results were described as "effective and successful". Photo interpretation bore out the initial impressions
