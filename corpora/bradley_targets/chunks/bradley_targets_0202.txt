stomed to seeing single B-29s over the Empire and normally the planes would not be molested and, in fact, none were attacked. In the European theater in the recently ended air campaign, the Allied Air Forces were taking considerable verbal flak for the area bombing of German cities, especially by Bomber Har- ris. Many of these targeted cities did not appear to have strate- gic significance or contributed to shortening the war. Since the atomic bomb was area bombing on an unprecedented scale, Spaatz wanted a written directive from the highest echelon for dropping the atomic bomb. He got the directive on 25 July 1945 (reproduced in Figure 4). Four select targets are listed: Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata and Nagasaki. The bombs were to be dropped any time after 3 August 1945. Dissemination of all information regarding the "special" bombs was reserved to the Secretary of War and the President of the United States. The directive was issued by direction and approval of the Sec- retary of War and the Chief of Staff, United States Army. Cop- ies of the directive were to be delivered, preferably in person, to General Douglas MacArthur and Admiral Chester Nimitz. General Spaatz also informed Washington that there were sus- pected POW camps at Kokura and Nagasaki but received word to go ahead with the bombing. There was no going back now. According to information supplied by Capt. Parsons, the Manhattan Engineer District (MED) weapons expert, the B-29 must be at least 15 miles away to be out of the pressure wave generated by the atomic bomb blast. To ensure this, B-29s were required to make steep 150 degree turns away from the target upon release of the bombs. In addition, with four recent crashes on take off from North Field, Tinian, Capt. Parsons decided to arm Little Boy after take off rather than chance oblit- erating Tinian in case of a crash on take off. Field Order No. 13 specified the Hiroshima initial point as 34 degrees, 24 minutes north and 133 degrees, 05 minutes, 30
