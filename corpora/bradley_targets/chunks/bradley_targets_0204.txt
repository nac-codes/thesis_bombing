personnel of the immediate effects of the bomb, and operational particulars. The second part, just before takeoff, covered air-sea rescue and weather details. It was stated that no aircraft could go within 50 miles of the target prior to strike time and 6 hours subse- quent to strike time except for participating aircraft. In case of distress, rescue facilities would not enter the forbidden area for the prescribed length of time. Special air-sea rescue facili- ties were provided by Super Dumbos, Navy planes, and sub- marines were to be posted to give better than usual coverage to planes participating. The route to and from the target was below 5000 feet until past Iwo Jima; below 10,000 feet until it was necessary to climb to bombing altitude. The weather ship over Hiroshima indi- cated that a visual run was feasible and Tibbets headed for that city (See Figure 5). As described in the 509th History, this arrangement involved considerable radio briefing, precision coordination among crews participating and stop watch tim- ing. The gears had to mesh. Of course, these procedures were normal for precision daylight strikes and sometimes involved up to 300 A/C - that is when gears had to mesh and, unfortu- nately many times did not. Capt. Eatherly reported weather over Hiroshima as 2/10 lower and middle lower and 2/10 at 15,000 at 0815 K (0715 Hiroshima time). At 0915 K (0815 Hiroshima time) the atomic bomb was away with the axis of attack at 265 degrees, 31,600 feet. The air speed was 196 knots. Weather at the target was 1/10 cloud coverage with consider- able haze over the target. Major Sweeney, in the instrumenta- tion plane, dropped three instrument packages for scientific measurements. Many Japanese on the ground saw the para- To divert attention, a major effort by the 20th AF was con- ducted on the night of 5/6 August 1945 by 602 B-29s striking a variety of targets including the urban areas of: Saga, Maebaski, Nishinomiya, Imabari, the oil refinery at Ube and vario
