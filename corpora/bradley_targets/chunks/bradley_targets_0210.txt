second atom bomb as close to the first as possible also to give the impression that there were many more to follow. However, at that time, there was fission- able material for only one plutonium (Pu) bomb and that was on Tinian, although another could be delivered in a matter of weeks. Two C-54's departed Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, on 26 July with the initiator, or neu- tron source, and the plutonium core which arrived on 27 July after a 6000 mile trip. Also, on the same day three B- 29s left Kirtland with three "pumpkin" bombs, each with a Fat May high explosive assembly which arrived on Tinian on 2 August 1945. Also arriving on Tinian on 31 July 1945, was Gen. Groves' deputy Brig. Gen. Farrell who was in charge of the bombs on Tinian. Assembling the Pu core into the Fat Man with its implosion charges began immedi- ately and was a ticklish operation. As described by Rhodes (5), the "pumpkin" bomb with the high quality explosives was designated F-31. Originally, the second atom bomb mission was scheduled for 11 August, but Capt. Parsons proposed to Col. Tibbetts to move the date up to 10 August since everything should be in place by that date. Weather, as always, became a factor. Tibbets explained that there was a forecast of bad weather for five days over Japan start- ing on 10 August 1945 - could the assembly of the implo- sion bomb be moved up to 9 August? Parson explained to Tibbets that moving the schedule up two whole days " ... introduced a large measure of uncertainty into the prob- ability of meeting such a drastically revised schedule". At 2200K, 8 August 1945, Fat Man F-31 was loaded into the forward bombay of aircraft No. 297 named Bocks Car. Field Order No. 17, dated 8 August 1945, stated: 1. No friendly aircraft within 50 miles of either target during this strike four hours prior to strike time and four hours subsequent to strike time, except for one routine weather plane of this command. In no case will any friendly A/C fly at any time in t
