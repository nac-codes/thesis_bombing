Ashworth was in charge of the weapon and he authorized a radar approach by the bombardier. Orders were to bomb visually but there had been tremendous pressure to get this mission off and under- standably, there was a great reluctance on everyone's part to bring Fat Man back. In fact, there had been some discussion about whether the crews should have been trained for a radar drop (10). In any case, many of the bomb runs with "pump- kins" had been dropped by radar so the bombardier and radar operator were very familiar with the technique. In actuality, a hole in the clouds did open up, and Capt. Beahans, the bom- bardier dropped the bomb after a 20 second bomb run. Bomb- ing altitude was 31,000 feet with bombs away at 1158 K (10:58 Nagasaki time), 323 miles per hour ground speed (2). The Combat Report stated: Gas for Aircraft No. 297: 7,250 gallons. All others, 7,400 gallons. Take off: Weather ships 0230 K and strike ships: 0330 K "90% of run was radar - bombardier took over and made visual corrections in the last 10%.
