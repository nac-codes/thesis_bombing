0 feet rising to 30,000 feet in 1/2 to 2 sec- onds. Many small bright fires observed. Consid- erable smoke observed 175 miles from area. Five shock waves were felt." Maj. Sweeney's plane, loaded with Fat Man, was discov- ered to have a defective fuel pump used to transfer fuel from the aft bombay tank. The 600 gallons of gas would not be available during flight leaving him only 6,650 gallons - obvi- ously a risky condition. Takeoff was actually at 0347 K (0247 Nagasaki time) on 9 August 1945 with Comm. Ashworth as weapons officer. He remembers the night well: " ... the weather forecast told us of storms all the way up from the Marianas to the Empire. Our rendezvous was to be off the southeast coast of Kyushu some 1500 miles away As in the case of Little Boy, Comm. Ashworth decided not to arm Fat Man until the plane was air- borne. He then fully armed Fat Man 10 minutes into the mis- sion so that the plane could climb above 17,000 feet to be above the weather system. Flying at this altitude, he was probably bucking a good head wind as well. On the way up, St. Elmo's fire swirled around the propellers. St. Elmo's fire was a com- mon phenomenon seen by B-29 crews flying through certain weather conditions. Maj. Sweeney circled over Yakushima Island waiting for his companion ships at 0900 to 0950 K. The Kokura weather plane reported 3/10 low clouds and no inter- mediate or high clouds. The Nagasaki weather plane reported "clear and visibility unlimited" at the secondary target. Only one plane showed up although Capt. Bock, in the instrument ship, did see the other plane in the distance. Maj. Sweeney has asserted that the other plane was flying at 39,000 rather than the assigned altitude of 30,000. After circling for 50 minutes, Maj. Sweeney took off for Kokura and arrived at 1044 K. At this time there was heavy ground haze and smog obscured the target. In total, three bomb runs were made " .. . hoping that the target might be picked up after closer observation. However,
