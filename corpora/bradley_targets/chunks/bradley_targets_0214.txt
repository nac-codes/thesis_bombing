1044 K. At this time there was heavy ground haze and smog obscured the target. In total, three bomb runs were made " .. . hoping that the target might be picked up after closer observation. However, at no time was the aiming point seen". Altogether, 45 minutes were spent in the Kokura area. Lt. J. Besser - the electronic countermeasures man on this flight as well as on the Little Boy flight - remembers "The Japs started to get curious and began sending fighters up after us. We had some flak bursts and things were getting a little hairy, so Ashworth and Sweeney decided to take a run down to Nagasaki ... " As the plane approached The aiming point in Field Order 17 was the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works and ground zero was 500 yards north of the edge of this plant and 0.75 miles from its center (11). In this case, five shock waves were experienced by the strike aircraft, none of great intensity and were probably the result of reflection of shock waves off the hills surrounding the Urakami Valley. Maj. Sweeney, after circling the mushroom cloud and low on gas, headed directly to Okinawa and landed at Yontan Field at 1351 K. He took off at 1706 K and landed at Tinian at 2245 K. The strike aircraft reported, after the explosion, that shock waves were felt but none of great intensity. Comm. Ashworth reported the results to Gen. Farrell on Tinian while on route to Okinawa but this report was never received. He indicated some uncertainty as to results since the city was basically cloud-cov- ered but the bomb blast looked similar to that at Hiroshima. According to Jones (12) Ashworth checked with the crews on Okinawa and they reported that the flash was brighter, shock waves were greater, cloud larger and moved up faster than at Hiroshima.
