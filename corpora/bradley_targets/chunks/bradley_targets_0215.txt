Railroad trains were damaged for 7000 to 8000 feet from ground zero but limited railroad service was available 48 hours after the blast. On 10 August 45, police rescue units and workers from the shipyard began the task of clearing debris from the Omura-Nagasaki highway which was the main access road into the city from the rest of Kyushu.
