residential units in the city on 1 August 45, 14,145 (27.2%) were completely destroyed; 5441 (10.5%) partially burned or destroyed. In Nagasaki, only the Mitsubishi Dockyards were remote enough to escape serious damage. The other three Mitsubishi plants were seriously damaged. The arms plant was 58% destroyed and the steel works 78% destroyed by estimates by plant management. The USSBS estimates the two plants to be 50% destroyed, Mitsubishi Electric Works suffered 10% structural damage. In general, as with the HE and IB raids, damage to machines was less than damage to buildings. Short- ages of raw materials had reduced operations at these four Mitsubishi plants to a fraction of their capacity. If the raw material situation was normal and the war continued, it was estimated that restoration of production would have been pos- sible but slow. The steel works would have required one year to get back into substantial production; the electric works would have resumed production at a reduced rate in two months and been back at capacity in 6 months and the arms plant would have required 15 months to reach 67% of former capacity. The USSBS concluded that the most striking effect of the atomic bomb was the great number of casualties. The exact number will never be known due to confusion after the blast. Because of decline in activity in the two port cities, constant threat of the incendiary raids and formal evacuation program of the gov- ernment; an unknown number of inhabitants had either drifted away from the cities or had been removed according to plan. USSBS estimates that the casualties were distributed as follows: After the Hiroshima atomic bombing, an intensified pro- paganda campaign was launched. According to Tibbets (4) the US Armed Services Radio told the whole story of the Hiroshima attack and Radio Saipan broadcast surrender appeals and fur- ther, airplanes with loud speakers flew low over Japanese cit- ies informing of atomic destruction awaiting them if they
