of the Hiroshima attack and Radio Saipan broadcast surrender appeals and fur- ther, airplanes with loud speakers flew low over Japanese cit- ies informing of atomic destruction awaiting them if they did not surrender. Millions of propaganda leaflets with pictures of the atomic mushroom cloud over Hiroshima were printed and dropped on cities all over Japan. The leaflets carried the fol- lowing message (4): "To the Japanese people: America asks that you take immediate heed on what we say on this leaflet. We are in possession of the most destructive explosive ever devised by man.
