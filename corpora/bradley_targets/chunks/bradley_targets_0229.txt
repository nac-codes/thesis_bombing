olu- tion so as ye enhance the innate glory of the Imperial State and keep pace with the progress of the world." 105  Fig. 3 - Plutonium bomb dubbed "Fat Man." PAPER PRODUST . Unit History, 509th Composite Group, 20th Air Force, 17 December 1944 to 15 August 1945. Imperial Scal affixed, the 14th day of the 8th month of the 20th year of Showa. Admiral Suzuki's cabinet fell on 16 August 1945 but issued a proclamation before the fall stating: "Imperial judgment has been passed. The way for His Majesty's subjects to follow is self evident ... and there is "no way" for Japan to realize her "ob- jective in the war" with the use of the new bomb which has destructive power unprecedented in his- tory. Science has brought a change in the method of warfare, moreover, the Soviet Union on 9 Au- gust 1944 declared war on Japan and Japan has come to face unprecedented difficult situation. ... Japan must develop its fortunes in the fu- ture through its endurance. The way for people to proceed is in guarding the national polity." Neither statement mentioned surrender or defeat. Both emphasized the power of the atom bomb against which they were powerless. Finally, they emphasized the need for the Japa- nese people to now come together for the common good and rebuild the nation. This call was resoundingly taken up by the Japanese people who now have one of the strongest econo- mies in the world, and that with few inherent natural resources. 3.
