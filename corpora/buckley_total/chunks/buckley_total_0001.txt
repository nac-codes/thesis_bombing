First, I must thank my colleagues in the Department of History and War Studies at the University of Wolverhampton for allowing me the time away from teaching to prepare this work. Additionally, I must thank those students who have undertaken HS1000: Bomber Offensive  over the last few years and have asked many searching and pertinent questions, and who have surely taught me as much as I them. I am also very grateful to Steven Gerrard and Aisling Ryan for their patience and understanding and to Jeremy Black, general editor of the Warfare and History  series. For comment and advice, thanks are due to John Gooch, Simon Ball, Michael Paris, Peter Caddick-Adams, Peter MacDonald, T oby McLeod, Mark Howells, Steve Mill
