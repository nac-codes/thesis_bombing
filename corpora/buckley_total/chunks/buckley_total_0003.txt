In the space of a little over 40 years, aircraft progressed from the Wrights’ first faltering flights in the Kill Devil Hills in 1903 to the mass destruction of Dresden, T okyo and, most poignantly, Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The air raids of the Second World War, in particular those which to this day evoke bitter feelings ofresentment and guilt, were the culmination of a revolution in warfare which saw aircraft do more than any other weapon to bring in the era of total war. Air power was to prove radically different from any other arm in the history of war. In the 5,000 years or so of recorded history, stretching from the nascent cities of Sumer to the end of the nineteenth century, war had been essentially two dimensional. Enemy fleets and armies could be avoided, even defeated, by means other than directcombat but ultimately ground forces of infantry and cavalry and their supports were the final arbiters of victory or defeat. Enemy forces, for the most part, could be kept at arm’s length by effective military activity whereas cities and rear zones could beprotected by high walls and fortifications, thus minimizing the impact of enemy raids. The destructive zone of war was always limited to where the enemy could deploy their land or naval forces, whether it was in armed combat or in the prosecution of asiege or blockade.
