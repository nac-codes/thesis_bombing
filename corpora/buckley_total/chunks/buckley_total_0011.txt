Those states which used such strategies realized that they weretravelling a dangerous and perilous moral path. The fact that they sought to conceal the scale and nature of their actions from their own populations reveals much about their self-doubt and how much stomach they believed their own people had for suchtactics. 5 Tactical and operational air power The emphasis on strategic bombing in the past 50 years has to a degree concealed theimpact of air power on the conduct of war in other areas, many of which shaped theoutcome of war as much if not more so than strategic bombing. The importance of ground support operations was considerable. Without aerial control, or at least the denial of such power to an enemy, land operations became at the very least hazardousand at worst untenable. The impact of German air power in leading the so-called blitzkrieg  of World War II was impressive, as was Soviet and most notably Allied domination of the air over the battlefield in the latter stages of the war. In both world wars, wherelogistical support was crucial, the surrendering of airspace to the enemy usually led to the interdiction of rear zones, loss of initiative and the curtailment of resupply. Additionally, aerial intelligence gathering and artillery spotting were important elements of groundsupport that offered considerable advantage, especially if simultaneously denied to the enemy. The value of airborne troops should also be considered, for although they often played a supportive role to the main ground forces, they were also useful in seizing important areas or denying them to the enemy.
