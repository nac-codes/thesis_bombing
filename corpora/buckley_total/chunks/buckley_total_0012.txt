Page 18 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 7was often the key, as in the German offensives on Belgium and the Netherlands in 1940 and the assault on Crete in the following year. The Allies did much the same inNormandy in 1944, and in the failed Rhine crossing, Operation Market Garden.  However, the value of such operations was often partial and could only produce a small operational advantage. This was because such forces were lacking in heavy equipment and couldnot hope to prevail against traditional land forces. Nevertheless, the nature of operations had been changed by the advent of such flexible forces. Air power was also a key factor in the development of clandestine operations. Resistance groups, intelligence agents and whole guerrilla armies could continue their activities behind enemy lines thanks to resupply from the air. T o Tito’s partisans in Yugoslavia, and for British strategy between the middle of 1940 and late 1941, the useof air power to foster underground armies was significant, although in the latter case it was never an entirely realistic means of prosecuting the war. In maritime operations the impact of air power was perhaps even more notable. Even in the First World War the role of aircraft in providing air cover to convoys was crucial. In the Second World War it was essential. The provision of air escort to merchant shipping across the whole Atlantic by 1943 ended the U-boat offensive. It could havedone so much earlier and the debate as to why this did not occur continues. 6 Naval support in the shape of reconnaissance and gunnery direction was already being developed in the 1914–18 conflict but was to be replaced in importance during theinterwar years by direct aerial attack on naval and merchant shipping. The world’s navies fought a rearguard action against air power that was commendable, if ultimately doomed, and which for the most part revolved around the question of whetheraircraft could sink modern capital ships. Although many navies
