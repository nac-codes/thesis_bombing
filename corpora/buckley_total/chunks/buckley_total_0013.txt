action against air power that was commendable, if ultimately doomed, and which for the most part revolved around the question of whetheraircraft could sink modern capital ships. Although many navies claimed that modern battleships were safe from aerial attack, by the Second World War they could only rarely operate without air cover. The Bismarck  was crippled and doomed by air attack, the Prince of Wales  and the Repulse  were helpless in the face of concerted aerial bombing and the two greatest battleships ever built, the Japanese Yamato  and Musashi,  were sunk by single-engined US naval bombers in the last months of the war. The importance of air power to the conduct of maritime operations was emphatically demonstrated in the campaigns against Japan. In this theatre, between 1941 and 1945, offensive strategy was effectively dominated by the aeroplane. The island-hoppingoperations were only viable when air superiority was attained, either by land based or carrier-borne air power. In addition, the projection of force in the Pacific was dictated by aircraft carrier battle groups which rapidly supplanted the battleship as the capitalvessel in naval warfare.

In particular, it is essential to note that the developmentof air power within states was linked to national strategies, although at times the connections seemed to be inappropriate. The creation of state air power was not an end but a means, a method, of prosecuting national policy. T oo often historians andothers have criticized planners for not having appropriate air policies, the obvious examples being those states which did not develop strategic bombing forces in the 1930s, and those which did not create independent air forces like the RAF . The realityis of course, that the st
