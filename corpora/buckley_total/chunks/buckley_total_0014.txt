vious examples being those states which did not develop strategic bombing forces in the 1930s, and those which did not create independent air forces like the RAF . The realityis of course, that the strategic requirements of states dictated their air power needs: what was right for one power was not necessarily appropriate for another. For example, nations such as Japan and Germany did not develop strategic bombers prior to World War II for a number of reasons, one of which was that such a policy did not suit developing national strategy. There were many other reasons, such as technical difficulties and lack of industrial resources, which resulted in strategic bombing beingrepeatedly marginalized once the war was underway and Germany seemed to be winning without having to resort to the kind of long and attritional conflict in which heavy city bombing might have played a significant role. Likewise, in World War I onthe Western Front, although the Allies sought to maintain the offensive they also aimed to take the air war to German lines and rear zones in an aggressive and usually costly manner. In contrast, the Germans more often preferred to adopt a reactive anddefensive doctrine that was better suited to their largely defensive posture for much of the war on the Western Front. In addition, many powers had only finite resources available and, for the continental states, armies and ground forces were the primary concern. For France in the interwar era, a large army and its much vaunted Maginot Line  were of more importance than strategic air forces in keeping the Wehrmacht  at bay. Indeed, it may well have been the case that the dabbling of the French air force with the theories of Douhet and its own struggle for independence contributed to the disaster of 1940, though this is by no means clear. 7 Likewise, the Soviet Union, embroiled as it was with internal and border affairs, had only a limited role for strategic air power in national strategy. This, along with the
