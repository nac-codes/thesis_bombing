and causing revolutions, air bombardment often pushed the bulk of the population together, at least superficially. Modern research has been presented that argues that too much has been made of this resilience ofsocieties under air attack. This resilience supposedly cut across class boundaries but the notion of classes all being in the same boat was and has been exaggerated. However, at the very least the worst forecasts of the interwar theorists proved to be ill-founded. 17 Despite the total experience of war society did not collapse, even when subjected to mass area bombings on the scale of Hamburg, Dresden and T okyo. It has been argued that Germany and Japan were able to resist air bombardment on such a huge scalebecause of the nature of their regimes – authoritarian, regimented and conditioned by excessive propaganda. However, before the Second World War, similar analysts claimed that totalitarian dictatorships were brittle and especially prone to morale-sapping airraids, saddled as they were with alien and unnatural forms of government which evoked little deep-rooted support. 18 Conversely, liberal democracies could endure the excesses of total war, as had been proved by the First World War, thanks to their greaterbases of national support. This is of course a simplistic approach, for there were many  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 27 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 16other factors which dictated whether a state could or could not survive aerial attack, such as the nature of its industrial base, the distribution of its population and geographical factors. However, both lines of reasoning may be correct for it is just as possible that despite all the upheavals and destruction of air bombardment, the fear of air attack far outweighed the reality. Air power was simply not capable of bringing about the destruction of whole modern societies in the manner envisaged in the interwar era – that potential did not emerge until the nuclear age.
