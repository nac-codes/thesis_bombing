er was simply not capable of bringing about the destruction of whole modern societies in the manner envisaged in the interwar era – that potential did not emerge until the nuclear age. The measure of total war As well as being a direct cause of total war, air power was also an indirect measure of the new age of industrial warfare. The aeroplane was the supreme embodiment of all that total war stood for: it was more dependent on economic and technological factors than any other weapon; it required vast investment in an effort merely to remain viable as obsolescence overcame aircraft more rapidly than any other arm; and air power was arguably the most wasteful weapon of war, frittering away the nation’s resources in a highly profligate manner. Air power was in essence a yardstick by which a state’s total war capability could be measured. Both the breadth and depth of effort required by a state to enter and stay in the air power “club” meant that membership was only open to the most advanced technological nations. The exponential rise in defence spending in the twentieth century has come about due to the rise in both the amount and the sophistication of equipment required to remain a top level power. As the century has moved on, so some states have been forced out of the top league. Only the great powers of the early part of the century had the capability to develop and maintain first-rate air fleets. The aeroplane was yet another factor in the acceleration of western states down the road to total or modern industrial war and away from the conflicts hitherto witnessed in the wider world and in the West. The gap between those states with industrial might and technological know-how grew enormously in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but the rise of air power was perhaps the most significant development in the ever widening gulf between the great military powers and the rest.19 It is inconceivable that Britain would have suffered the same failures and di
