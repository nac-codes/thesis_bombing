r was perhaps the most significant development in the ever widening gulf between the great military powers and the rest.19 It is inconceivable that Britain would have suffered the same failures and disasters as it did in the Second Boer War (1899–1902) if it had had an effective air power capability. Non-industrial states such as Transvaal and Orange Free State would no longer have been able to compete in open, traditional, military conflict with air power equipped  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 28 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 17armies, such as Britain’s. Nor could they aim to match or even begin to contest air power status with large western powers because they had no industrial base to createthe support structures needed for a major air power effort. Whereas armies could be raised quite easily and equipped to a limited degree, perhaps from abroad, and still be able to compete, air forces could not. Such was the cost, and so high were theattritional rates, of maintaining air power that only the richest and strongest nations could participate in a meaningful way. The success of western style powers when using air forces against the nations of the wider world was significant: notably the Italians in Abyssinia, the Spanish and French in Morocco and the British in Iraq and Somaliland. Indeed, the divide between the West and the rest of the world had grown so large by the post-World War IIperiod, that new styles of warfare had to be sought, a search that was eventually to lead to people’s war, which was demonstrated so graphically in Vietnam and Afghanistan. In many ways, the abandonment of traditional forms of war by the wider world when confronted by western power, or at least its unwillingness and inability to come to terms with the West’s annihilatory Clausewitzian view of conflict, is a testament to the impact of industrial war, of which air power was the most significant factor. Airpower was the final step along a path which resulted in the West wi
