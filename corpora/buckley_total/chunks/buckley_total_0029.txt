ausewitzian view of conflict, is a testament to the impact of industrial war, of which air power was the most significant factor. Airpower was the final step along a path which resulted in the West winning military dominance over the world to such an extent that the other states had to abandon the idea of trying to play the same game. However, although industrial states could develop air power (as they had previously developed sea power) and thus gain significant advantages over states which could not, they themselves had to be able to match, or at least be able to compete with, theirown industrial rivals or face the consequences. Clearly, military and political rivalry was nothing new, but the demands of maintaining air power were such that the effort required to match other states grew rapidly and was soon beyond the means of anumber of nations. Only a limited number of industrial powers were able to develop the component technologies to support first rate air fleets, and thus another division had been created in the military pecking order. By the time of the Second World War,only a handful of states were able to count themselves as first rate air powers, and by the post-war era only the USA, a declining Britain, and a burgeoning USSR were left. While air power was only one factor in the decline of the old world order and thearrival of the bi-polar Cold War world, it was one of the most significant factors in separating the new superpowers from the great powers they replaced. The pressures on governments to meet the demands of air power were significant throughout the period and unlike the demands of navies and armies, the threat of air  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 29 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 18power was direct and immediate and could not be ignored. Unfortunately, the nature of air power was such that not only were there problems of mass-production of equipment to arm the air force, but there were also crucial issues concerning technological
