was a direct cause of Japan’s catastrophic defeat at Midway in 1942. In the same way, the technological side of the strategic bombing campaign was pivotal to success andfailure. Increasingly more sophisticated and better equipped aircraft were produced in an attempt to win operational advantages. New innovations could win significant coups for one side or the other: the introduction of x-verhafen  radio beams by the Germans resulted in the heavy damage to Coventry in 1940; the use of “window” by the Allies in 1943 aided in the destruction of Hamburg; the advent of the long-range Mustang escort-fighter in 1944 brought about the winning of air supremacy by theAllies; and of course technology ultimately resulted in the atomic bombings of Japan. During the post-war period, even without military conflict, the respective adversaries worked slavishly to maintain parity in air power and nuclear technology. Not to do somay have unhinged the delicate balancing act that the superpowers had saddled themselves with. Rarely had history witnessed such military based paranoia and never with such stakes at risk.

Although the resulting advantages were often not decisive in themselves, they did indicate the relative position of the belligerents and the manner in which they werecoping with the stresses and exigencies of total war. For the most part it was the Allies in the Second World War who were able to manage the technological input into the air forces better than their Axis enemies. Initially, the German and the Japanese airforces held both qualitative and quantitative advantages over their opponents, particularly over the smaller powers such as Poland, Belg
