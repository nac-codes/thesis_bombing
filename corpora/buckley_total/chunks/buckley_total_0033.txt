ilyavailable, in mass-production, and had aircrew to fly it. The ability to mass-produce effective equipment and train sufficient personnel was the cornerstone of Allied success in World War II, and a clear measure of the manner in which the respectiveapproaches to total war differed between the belligerents. The Allies, with their sophisticated and responsive industries, were able to meet the needs of their armed forces and generate technological development and advancement internally in a mannerthat the Germans had never thought possible in a capitalist economy. For example,  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 31 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 20Goering had stated that the US economy was fit only for producing refrigerators and automobiles. Conversely, the Soviet economy was suited to total war by its strictly centralized and managed industries, and it was this single-minded approach to the war that resulted in part in the recovery of Soviet air power. As the Axis economies flounderedin a morass of confusion, rivalry and dissipated effort, the authoritarian and pragmatic Soviet economy proved remarkably suited to the type of modern industrial war thrust upon it. Whereas the Allies coped with and embraced the dictums of modern air war, the authoritarian yet disorganized and disparate Axis dictatorships struggled. Their air power development was continually hindered by an interfering political/military leadershipwhich did not understand the requirements of mass-production, and by a decentralized non-integrated economy used neither to political management nor to the necessary adaptability of modern capitalist models. Repeated design changes and shiftingspecifications saw new aircraft types put back months and eventually produced in a hotchpotch fashion, often resulting in poor rehability and service back-up. In consequence, the Luftwaffe  had virtually disappeared from the skies by the middle of 1944 and the last vestiges of real Japanese air strength were f
