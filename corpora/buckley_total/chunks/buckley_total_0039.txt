the Commission Scientifique  called for balloons to be delivered to the army for military use, and a formal “Aerostat Company” was established in 1794.6 Importantly, considering the future heavy demands of air power on skills and technical training within a society, the Compagnie d’Aerostiers  required a very high proportion of skilled tradesmen. However, the arm had limited success and many practical problems remained. The Aerostat Company travelled with Napoleon’s army to Egypt but was abandoned when the campaign failed and Napoleon disbanded the balloonists on his return in 1799.7 Nevertheless, the military application of an air arm for observation purposes had beenestablished. Balloons were first used aggressively in war in 1849 when the Austrians tried to bomb Venice, but although around 200 hot-air balloons may have been used, they had little effect. 8 Balloons were employed by the Union armies in the US Civil War (1861– 5) and they even utilized the latest telegraph technology to transmit battle reports directly from the air to the ground. Nevertheless, the balloons were still crude and notoriously unstable in any conditions other than dead calm and the Union balloons were abandoned in 1863. Notably, after Gettysburg a Confederate general commented on the defensive and cautious influence balloon observation had on his forces. Extra care had to be taken to try and avoid being spotted from the air, and delays were caused, giving an advantage to the Unionist forces.9 Attempts by Captain F . Beaumont, who had been attached to the Unionist balloon forces, and Lieutenant G.E. Grover to persuade the British Army to adopt balloons for observation duties met with scepticism and it was well into the 1870s before Britain started to take an interest. Indeed, it was the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) that provoked real European interest in military air forces. Although only limited numbers of balloons were used in the war, balloon mail was employed by the French during th
