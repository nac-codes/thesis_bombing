right to suspect that he was working for the British government. 13 In 1904 Colonel Capper was despatched from Britain to find out what the Wrights hadachieved, but the brothers were not yet willing to open negotiations. 14 The immediate impact of the Wrights’ work is often overstated for although they had achieved what many had thought impossible, it was some time before it becameclear to the world that the breakthrough had been made. Curiously, the first publishedeye-witness account appeared in the journal Gleanings in Bee Culture.  The brothers perceived that their creation had important military possibilities and might even preventwars by creating “an awesome military deterrent”. 15 The Wrights attempted to sell their invention and its patent for $200,000, but after the Langley fiasco the US administration was wary. The British, German and French governments also missed the  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 38 --- THE BIRTH OF AIR POWER 27opportunity to take the lead in aerial development by purchasing the Wright “flyer”. Unwilling to risk having their invention compromised, the Wrights packed up theirfledgling aircraft and did not fly between October 1905 and May 1908. It was only when they began demonstrating their aircraft in the USA and Europe in 1908 that interest really started to blossom. The growth of “air-mindedness” Perceptions of air power in the western world were to develop rapidly once it had become clear that air travel, and therefore air conflict, had become a reality. It is indeed strange in the late twentieth century to discuss the growth of “air-mindedness”, butultimately it became a serious concern of western peoples, perhaps in a similar vein to modern notions of space travel. In the same way that there was little other than scientific speculation prior to the 1960s upon which to base assumptions about spaceexploration, so the world of the 1900s had to rely on what amounted to, in many cases, science fiction. The roots of air-mindedness
