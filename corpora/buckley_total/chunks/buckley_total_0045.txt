rench novelist Jules Verne who became most associated with aerial warfare books. As early as 1863, Verne was marrying scientific fact and speculation with adventure stories to great effect. He wrote a number of tales concerning ballooning, but it was in the 1880s that Verne published The clipper of the clouds  which was the first major speculative air power work. Verne’s story centres on an electrically powered airship, the “Albatross”, not too far removed from the scientific realities of the 1880s, and this was perhaps one of the reasons for the book’s popularity. Additionally, Verne illustrated the destructive side of technological innovation, reflecting his growing doubts over the future of civilization. Verne repeated the formula in the 1904 novel The master of the world,  in which the world’s powers attempted to secure the use of a highly advanced aerial vessel against which there was no defence.17 Others followed Verne’s lead and books such as T om Greer’s A modern Daedalus (1885) and Harry Collingwood’s Log of the flying fish  (1887) and With airship and submarine (1908) generally pursued the aerial theme. Verne’s stories inspired many to aerial achievements such as Santos Dumont who became the first pilot in Europe. Early pioneer aviators such as Geoffrey de Havilland, Philip Joubert de la Ferte and even Billy Mitchell claimed to have been influenced by Verne’s books.18 In the 1890s, partly inspired by the London based American air power enthusiast/ inventor, Hiram Maxim, Graham Moffat and John White wrote What’s the world coming to?, in which, by the twenty-first century, air fleets dominate the world and have put an end to ground armies. Indeed, the use of aircraft to attack cities and towns directly started to emerge, in books such as George Griffiths’ The outlaws of the air  (1895) and Douglas Fawcett’s Hartmann the anarchist  (1895). It has been argued that these novels helped to bring home to society the fear of aerial attack and went on to shape the m
