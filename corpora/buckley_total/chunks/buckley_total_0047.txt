erber, the French airman, also indicated the influence of Wells’ work on him.20 Literature from the era leading up to World War I did help to foster “air mindedness” and with the growth in aerial activity, and media attention given to it, air power became a subject of debate, and in certain circles provoked consternation. Generally, the future war novels predicted that air power would be a crucial, and perhaps pivotal, aspect of modern war with roles ranging from reconnaissance to artillery-spotting prevailing, although references to aerial bombing were also made. Initially, concerns over the ethical aspects of aerial bombing resulted in the novels only portraying mad scientists or megalomaniacs using such tactics, but by the years leading up to the Great War, with tension and nationalism flourishing, such reticence was diminishing. The view often portrayed in the literature was of society buckling under aerial attack, with panic and chaos rapidly following bombing of cities. Superficially at least, this view was to be reinforced by the events of World War I, leading to the strategic theorizing of the interwar era.21 The air power revolution, 1908–9 Aerial activity in Europe and the USA prior to 1908 was patchy and sporadic, despite the efforts of some within the press to boost interest. It was in France that most work was carried out with a powered glide, similar to the Wrights’ first effort of 1903, taking place at Meudon in 1905. By that year, the French had the most powerful aero-engine then in existence, surpassing even the Wrights’ designs, thanks to the pioneering work of Leon Lavavasseur. By 1908, the leading French aviator was Henri Farman who had managed to stay aloft for 30 minutes. However, the arrival of Wilbur Wright in August of that year shattered the illusions of the Europeans, as the “flyer” easily outperformed  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 41 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 30the best that the French had and, despite the claims of th
