he claimed about aviation’s value, “. . . c’est zero”.32 On the outbreak of war, France still held aerial superiority in certain areas, but the lead was nowhere near as significant as it might have been. The aircraft and aero- engine industry was the strongest in Europe, but time and effort had been wasted and the lead of 1912 had been frittered away in internecine squabbles and ill-fated development initiatives. Indeed, by August 1914 the French air arm only had 141 aircraft available which did not compare favourably with Germany’s 245 aeroplanes and ten airships. Germany German air power followed a different line to that of France in the years leading up to World War I. The airships of Count Zeppelin were to be, in some ways, the most significant aspect of air power development and, in a broader sense, more symbolic of Imperial German power. Certainly, the Zeppelin was the most sophisticated and advanced airship of the era, but crashes and problems in 1909 had led to military contracts being withheld and the Zeppelin was forced to rely on its new civilian airline and public support. It also had in the aeroplane a rival which was beginning to develop at a pace. The controversy over whether Germany should concentrate on aeroplanes or airships continued in the lead up to the Great War. The General Staff plumped for aeroplanes on grounds of cost and ease of operation, while the War Ministry preferred airships for reconnaissance duties and for broader strategic reasons. Supporters of the Zeppelin repeatedly played the nationalism card, on at least one occasion recruiting the Kaiser to support them, whereas the aeroplane was portrayed as a French weapon and one to be eschewed by Imperial Germany. Consequently, the German aeroplane industry struggled to assert itself and was overshadowed by foreign competitors and hampered by technical failings. Military contracts were small and only 130,000 marks were allocated to aeroplane procurement in 1910. The situation was not ai
