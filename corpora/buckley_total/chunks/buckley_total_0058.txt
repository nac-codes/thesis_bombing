any value in the war, though contrary to popular belief he was later to change his opinion. The majority however, recognized that aircraft, especially in the field of reconnaissance, would be of some value. Certainly, on the outbreak of war Britain lagged some way behind both France and Germany in air power development. United States of America Paradoxically, in spite of the achievements of the Wrights, the USA took longer to embrace air power than the Europeans. Away from the volatile pressure of European militarism and nationalism, the USA lacked the impetus to develop what the Wrights had delivered to them. Quite simply there was no strategic need for major investment. There was no cash for development until 1911 and the army had only one Wright flyer and one pilot. The Wrights and Glenn Curtiss, another leading airman, were forced to work long and hard to boost interest in aviation in America, setting up, for example, a series of airshows and circuses where aircraft would perform for sizeable crowds. Slowly, the US armed forces began to take an interest setting up a flight school and allocating $125,000 for aviation in 1912, although in contrast with Europe this was a small investment and little of substance was done. Nevertheless, US aircraft were involved in operations at Vera Cruz against Mexican forces and in pursuit of Pancho Villa in the years leading up to entry into the Great War in 1917. Despite this, and paradoxically in view of the USA’s industrial potential, US air power in 1917 was distinctly embryonic.37  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 48 --- THE BIRTH OF AIR POWER 37Austria–Hungary The aeroplane took longer to establish itself in Austria–Hungary as a potential aid to military operations, and took even longer to become integrated into the Austrian economy. Lacking industrial and technological sophistication, Austria–Hungary wasalways, like Russia, likely to struggle to meet the challenge of air power development.As a measure of the growing i
