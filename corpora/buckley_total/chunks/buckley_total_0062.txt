power, native designs and production had to be persevered with. However, with an industrial base such as Russia’s this wasgoing to prove exceptionally difficult. On the outbreak of war, Russia’s front line air force was considerable – 244 aircraft. However, many were already obsolete, and the support services for this size of air forcewere decidedly lacking. Orders had been placed for another 400 aircraft, including ten Sikorsky four-engine heavy-bombers, but again the likelihood of Russian industry being able to meet this demand and to meet the attendant logistical supportrequirements was very low. 41 Conclusions In the years leading up to World War I a number of factors shaped and influenced thenature and speed of air power development. The growth of air mindedness was certainlyimportant, and the pressure brought to bear on governments as a result of burgeoning public interest and excitement in the conquest of the air from 1909–12 was also a significant influence. Indeed, there were many other peripheral factors, but the twomost significant in supporting air power development were the involvement of themilitary, and economic provision. In some cases, the latter was lacking, and in the caseof the USA it was the former. Contrary to popular perceptions, the armed forces of Europe in particular considered it essential to keep abreast of air power innovations. Their essentially pragmatic enthusiasm was no doubt fuelled by military rivalry and nationalistic fervour, and anyinvolvement was linked to the possible use of aircraft in any future major war, whichby 1912 seemed to be a probability rather than a possibility. Without military involvement,aeroplane and air-ship development would have floundered once the initial publicinterest over the achievements of the Wrights and subsequent aviators had subsided.
