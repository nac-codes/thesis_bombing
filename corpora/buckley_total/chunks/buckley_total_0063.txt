subsequent aviators had subsided.

Civilian aviators were at the forefront of aircraft technology and experimentation but the founding of true aero-industries was almost entirely dependent on militaryand government backing. The kind of air league fundraising activities that helped tosave the Zeppelin programme in Germany were merely short-term measures andcould not go on indefinitely. Private companies who for the most part supplied the military with aircraft lived or died by military contracts. The methods and policies of the military establishments also shaped the nature of aircraft development. In an era of experimentation and haphazard design initiatives,the attempts of the British to centralize aircraft development under the aegis of theRoyal Aircraft Factory served merely to stifle initiative and to starve private companiesof contracts necessary for survival. The French and Germans, who were by 1914 the world’s leading air powers relied more heavily on private adventures for their aircraft, but again sought to control their respective industries via the issuing or otherwise ofcontracts. The second crucial factor which shaped air power prior to World War I was economic development, both in the field of industrial capacity and technological sophistication.Both were essential prerequisites for a healthy air power. Russia, Austria–Hungary and, to a lesser extent, Italy were all hampered by the inability of their industrial bases to provide the capacity for continued air power growth. This was coupled withtechnological deficiencies that restricted sustained experimentation and innovationand fused with industrial shortcomings to preclude the founding of long-term majorair power status. Military interest existed and doctrinal and theoretical innovationswere already taking ro
