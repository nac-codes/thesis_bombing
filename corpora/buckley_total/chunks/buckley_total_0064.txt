innovationand fused with industrial shortcomings to preclude the founding of long-term majorair power status. Military interest existed and doctrinal and theoretical innovationswere already taking root, but membership of the first rate air power club was already being restricted to the highly developed economic states of northern Europe and the USA. Although military interest in aircraft development was essential to founding aero- industries, it did not necessarily lead onward and upward. The military establishmentsup to 1914 saw only limited roles for aircraft in war – essentially reconnaissance andartillery spotting. The chasm between what the military considered was technically feasible and what the air power advocates claimed would emerge after serious development of air power was vast. The aspirations of the latter group however, simplycould not be realized by the technology of the day, and armed forces had to deal withthe realities of a Europe cascading towards war. However, by relying so heavily on military funding, aero-industries encountered problems, in particular the smothering  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 52 --- THE BIRTH OF AIR POWER 41of innovation. Aeroplane firms were in essence dictated to by the armed forces and their particular vision of air power in any future war, perspicacious or myopic as it maybe. Armies tended to emphasize reliability, ruggedness and stability. Aircraft manufacturershad to meet their demands or face rejection and bankruptcy. This relationship couldhave damaging effects. For example, in Germany aircraft development had been stunted by the army’s demands for certain kinds of aircraft, often developed at the expense of experimentation. German aircraft in 1914 were reliable and steady, thus making them useful reconnaissance aircraft, but investigation into larger and more powerful engines had been marginalized. It was a problem that was to plague German aircraft development and production throughout the Great War. The
