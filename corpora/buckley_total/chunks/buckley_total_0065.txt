e aircraft, but investigation into larger and more powerful engines had been marginalized. It was a problem that was to plague German aircraft development and production throughout the Great War. The link between military requirements and industrial productive innovation was still some way off and indeed, it was never to be properly established in some countries. On the outbreak of war in 1914 French and German air power was the most developed. The level of reliance of their partners on their aero-industries as the war progressed was testament to this. French superioriy in aeroplane technology was to prove a more important and longlasting advantage than Germany’s lead in airships, but in 1914 this was by no means obvious. Indeed, in numbers of available aircraft Germany also seemed to have a significant advantage in 1914 – 245 to France’s 141. In airframe design, Germany was to excel as the war progressed, but failings in engine design and production were to remain considerable hindrances, and the roots of this can, in part, be traced back to the pre-war years. France’s advantages lay in its superior aero-engine industry and in the depth of its aircraft production expertise and support services, not to mention its significantly higher proportions of reserves. Military enthusiasm for air power in 1914 was still mixed. For many it was a distraction from the proper job of fighting, but most accepted the need not to be compromised in the future by the enemy gaining a serious aerial advantage, should it become technologically feasible. Few believed air power would be a decisive factor in 1914 or in the foreseeable future, but most agreed that aircraft may become a necessary part of military operations.
