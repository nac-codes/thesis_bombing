orld War, 1914–18 More than any other period in the history of air warfare, the First World War is popularly viewed as an era of fighter aces, chivalry and heroism, in stark contrast toperceptions of the suffering and carnage below in the trenches. Moreover, whilepopular images of air combat in World War II are based around great battles or campaigns with few heroes, the literature and films of the Great War extol the virtues of heroism and the actions of “aces”. During and after the First World War, where the role of theindividual was swamped by the deeds of the masses, writers sought out heroes fortheir respective populations to focus upon, and the “knights of the air” offered one ofthe few viable options. Lloyd-George referred to them as the “cavalry of the clouds”. 1 Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron), Oswald Boelcke and Eddie Rickenbacker, for example, all became famous heroes largely because of the perceived nature of aerial fighting between 1914–18, which supposedly offered an older, honourable andmore gallant approach to war than the bloodletting of the Somme and Verdun. Indeed,in the post-First World War era a flood of new air adventure literature emerged: bookssuch as The Red Baron  and King of the air fighters  and magazines such as Battle aces  and War birds. 2 Laurence Goldstein has likened the memoirs of the aces to the age old tales of knights and heroes, all fired with a strong moral purpose.3 The enduring image of air conflict in the First World War had already been cast. The reality was of course somewhat different. For example, loss rates among pilots and aircrew greatly exceeded those of other armed forces and was to remain a seriousproblem for the duration of the war. The demand for new airmen was such that manyof a nation’s most able men were rushed into action, sent aloft with inadequate training and preparation, and promptly frittered away.
