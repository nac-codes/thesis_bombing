however, is open to debate, not least because it was largely a product ofwartime propaganda. Success in aerial combat was often linked with technological advantage, and had little to do with prowess or chivalry. The German airmen Boelcke and Immelmann dominated the air in 1915 thanks to the superiority of their FokkerEindekker monoplane, and Albert Ball likewise later gained fame thanks to his Nieuport aircraft. Even Richthofen’s success was, to a degree, based on the technical attributes of the Albatross. Nevertheless, although technological advantage did offer success, only a few men were able to seize the opportunity. Even so, despite the popular image, the key to survival and long-lasting fame was neither chivalry nor camaraderie. The air aces wereruthless and efficient exponents of their art, and the belief that they were paladins of the air is simply not sustained by the evidence. Richthofen preyed on slow reconnaissance aircraft, William Bishop possibly invented the incident which earnedhim his Victoria Cross and Mick Mannock apparently enjoyed seeing his German adversaries die in the air. 7 Y et the heroic image of Great War air fighting persists, clouding discussion and debate on the impact of air power on World War I. In many libraries, whereas air power  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 55 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 44selections on the Second World War often include a number of high quality analytical works on a variety of aspects of the air war, the same can rarely be said of the GreatWar where books on air power are still largely dominated by the traditional “aces of the air” approach. The First World War marked the beginning of modern air power in many ways, and the crucial aerial events of the Second World War were rooted in the 1914–18 experience. The first air superiority campaigns, ground-attack operations and strategic bombing offensives were all undertaken in the Great War and the impact of air cover on convoyswas a crucial factor
