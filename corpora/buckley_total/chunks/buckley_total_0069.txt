erience. The first air superiority campaigns, ground-attack operations and strategic bombing offensives were all undertaken in the Great War and the impact of air cover on convoyswas a crucial factor in the defeat of the U-boat menace in 1917–18. On a wider scale, the impact of aerial bombing and combat profoundly altered perceptions of war, deepening the already marked move towards total war involving civilian populationsand whole economies. Air power with high wastage and attrition rates proved to be a major drain on national resources, and more importantly on particular areas of economies – the most expensive and technologically-based sectors. The pressures of production,technical superiority and training put enormous strains on emerging aero-industries and few were able to maintain significant effort in the field for the duration of the war. The wider and deeper aspects of the air war of 1914–18 tell us a great deal moreabout the impact of air power in this critical and formative period than do the much repeated tales of the air aces and their individual acts of heroism. The air war and national strategy The conduct of the air war by all sides followed certain strategic axioms that rapidly became apparent as the war became established. However, it is fair to say that air policy mirrored or suited specific national strategies more obviously in some cases than others. The air strategies adopted were most clearly influenced by geostrategy in that themajor continental powers, notably the French and the Germans, placed great emphasis on aerial observation and reconnaissance aeroplanes to support their armies, which were crucial to their national strategies. Conversely, the British developed maritime airpower to support their navy, which again was their defensive linchpin. After the failure of the Schlieffen plan to bring about the desired rapid victory, Imperial Germany was forced to adopt a largely defensive posture for much of thewar on the Western Front. In part,
