. After the failure of the Schlieffen plan to bring about the desired rapid victory, Imperial Germany was forced to adopt a largely defensive posture for much of thewar on the Western Front. In part, this was in recognition of marked quantitativeinferiority. Consequently, German air strategy was for the duration of the war essentially  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 56 --- THE FIRST WORLD WAR, 1914â€“18 45defensive, aimed at denying operational advantage to the Allies. German air power sought to drive Allied air power out of German skies by making such offensiveoperations cripplingly wasteful. The German air forces were able to maintain this policy almost until the end of the war when they started to be overrun by weight of numbers and to be undermined by ever increasing supply problems. However, this isnot to say that German air strategy was negative. When it was required, offensive duties were undertaken and often gained local air superiority for significant periods of time, over Verdun in 1916 for example. Elsewhere, German air power supported thestrategic aim of knocking Britain out of the war in 1917 by a combination of U-boat blockade and heavy bomber raids. The probable effects of aerial bombing could only be guessed at but the linking of air power to national strategy was clear: it had becomeapparent that unless France could be isolated and defeated on land the war would not be won by Germany. Although the air offensive eventually failed, and unrestricted submarine warfare resulted in the USA declaring war in 1917, the crucial point tonote is that air power was linked directly to national strategy in an effort to achieve certain political aims. For most of the war the British and the French pursued an aggressive and offensive strategy against Germany, resulting in the flawed attempts atdecisive battles on the Western Front, for example at Ypres, the Somme and Passchendaele. Again, air strategy reflected this with a high level of air superiority fighters
