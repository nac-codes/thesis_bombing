ing in the flawed attempts atdecisive battles on the Western Front, for example at Ypres, the Somme and Passchendaele. Again, air strategy reflected this with a high level of air superiority fighters deployed by the British (55 per cent of the air force by 1918) and a growing interest in aerialbombing, though this was partly prompted by the desire for reprisal raids following German air raids on Britain. 8 Of the other powers, only the Italians were able to mobilize their air forces to meet strategic aims, and then only with any effect by 1918 when Austrian defences were starting to crumble. The adoption of aerial bombing reflected Italy’s geographical position vis-à-vis  its opponent and demonstrated that a stronger industrial base, properly organized, could offer considerable air power advantages over a state not so well equipped.9 Austria–Hungary suffered throughout the war from the lack of a sound industrial base and, despite competent design work, continued to be heavily relianton Germany, providing yet another drain on her senior partner’s already over-stretched resources. Russia, despite beginning the war with a considerable air fleet, was never able to maintain it effectively and, like Austria, suffered from industrial shortcomings.The Russians were heavily reliant on French support to maintain their air fleet, but the inability of the home economy to support the expansion of the nascent aero- industry under the pressures of war, and fundamental failings in logistical support, ledto the marked disintegration of Russia’s air forces. As early as September 1914, the  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 57 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 46Table 3.1 – Air force composition, August 1918 Source:  Mor row, The great war in the air,  p. 346. front-line air strength had dropped by 40 per cent and replacements were exceptionally difficult to procure at home, principally because of aero-engine shortcomings. The implication was clear: an unsophisticated and techn
