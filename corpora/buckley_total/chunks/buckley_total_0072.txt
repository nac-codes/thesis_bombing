th had dropped by 40 per cent and replacements were exceptionally difficult to procure at home, principally because of aero-engine shortcomings. The implication was clear: an unsophisticated and technologically deficient economy such as Russia could not adequately sustain a major air power effort.10 Reconnaissance and aerial observation The first and perhaps the most crucial duty of the belligerent air forces in 1914, and indeed for much of the war, was that of reconnaissance and observation. Armies for centuries had been effectively two-dimensional in their intelligence-gathering, relying on scouting cavalry, fast moving light infantry or espionage. The advent of air power, even in the relatively primitive form of aerial balloons, added greatly to the ability of  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 58 --- THE FIRST WORLD WAR, 1914–18 47armies to keep each other under observation and the later arrival of the aeroplane dramatically increased this ability. Paradoxically, this new method of gathering information, highly effective as it was, became a severe braking and hindering influence on offensive ground operations. Much of military activity, especially offensive operations,relies heavily on surprise and continuing momentum, often gained by concealing intent until the moment of impact. In the age before air power this task was easier to accomplish, but the arrival of the observation balloon and then the reconnaissanceaircraft severely curtailed the ability of armies in the First World War to catch their enemies unawares. The build-up for the big push was invariably kept under observation from the air and the defenders were able to prepare in good time. For example, thebuild up for the Somme offensive was already being noted in February 1916 by German aircraft, contributing to the Germans’ defensive preparations which were to thwart Haig’s attempted breakthrough. 11 If anything, air power hindered offensive capability unless the enemy’s reconnaissance aircraft could
