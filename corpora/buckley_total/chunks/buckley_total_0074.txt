h it was eventually to prove a factor in solving the problem, during the 1914–18 period it was a smothering and constraining force, hardly thedynamic panacea envisaged by many pre-war novelists. Reconnaissance and artillery spotting were the key roles played by air power in the Great War. All other aerial duties either attempted to deny use of aerial observation to the enemy by use of fighter  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 59 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 48aircraft, or as in the case of strategic bombing, were of little real importance in deciding the outcome of the war. The importance of observation really started to become clear when the initial war of movement on the Western Front had ground to a halt in the autumn of 1914,although prior to this the value of aerial observation of enemy movements had been indicated at the time of the Battle of the Marne, where aeroplanes had kept the respective armies informed of the enemy’s positions. 13 However, once the front had settled down to the archetypal trench warfare that we have come to associate with the Great War, the use of balloons as a means of keeping the enemy under everyday surveillance came to the fore. Before World War I, reservations about the aerial balloon were being voiced in light of the combustibility of its hydrogen and the fact that it was expected that the war would be a short, fluid and mobile conflict, in which the static balloon would be oflittle value. The French even went as far as abolishing the bulk of their balloon units prior to the war. However, as the war developed, one of the most noticeable, though subsequently less famous, sights of the battlefield was to be the array of observationballoons which lined the front, variously christened “sausages” by the French and “ das Mädchen’s traum ” (the maiden’s dream) by the Germans in recognition of the observation balloons’ rather phallic shape. 14 It was a sight only really associated with the Great War as the advent of more mobi
