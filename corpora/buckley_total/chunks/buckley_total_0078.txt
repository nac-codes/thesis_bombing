tilities photographic technology had improved considerably and images could be taken from as high as 15,000 feet.20 Photographs were rapidly distributed down the chain of command, even to the trenches, and complex and detailed plans could be drawn up of enemy positions and fortifications. During the war the Germans apparently took enough photographs to cover the area of Germany six times over.21 The age of armies marching blindly around Europe was gone for good, and the aeroplane was the reason for this change. However, aircraft had once again contributed to the strategic stalemate by providing so much information that the element of surprise was largely lost, that is until more sophisticated techniques at concealment, infiltration and faster preparation could be developed. The emergence of air combat and the search for air superiority Although the first, and arguably most important duty of aircraft in the First World War was reconnaissance and observation, so the interception and destruction of such aircraft was likewise to become a crucial factor. If enemy reconnaissance aircraft could be driven from the skies, then an important operational advantage would be obtained. As has been noted, the gathering of information on army preparations, movements and artillery direction was an important factor in stifling offensive enemy activity and preparing friendly attacks. If information could be denied to the enemy while simultaneously maintaining friendly reconnaissance operations, the potential for offensive action to be successful could be increased, perhaps dramatically so. The need to shoot down or drive away enemy observation aircraft therefore soon became recognized as an important activity of air forces, again underlining the importance attributed to reconnaissance operations. Even before the war broke out, there had been contemplation of the nature of aerial combat and its importance to ground operations. Such terms as “air superiority”,  File: --- buckley_total.pd
