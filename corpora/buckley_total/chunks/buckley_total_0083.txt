of Sopwith Camels, SE-5s and latterly the SPAD andNieuport 28s which gained and then maintained the lead on both technological andnumerical grounds. The formula was to be repeated against both major Axis powers in World War II, when once again the technological battle for air superiority swung to and fro and was eventually decided by weight and effective allocation of resources. No other theatre of operations saw such a concerted effort to seize and then maintain air superiority as the Western Front, but paradoxically the value of total airsupremacy was demonstrated most effectively elsewhere. Aerial ground supportoperations in Palestine showed what could be achieved, but the Turks had no real means of contesting air superiority, and for the Germans in the West, merely challenging Allied air superiority over the front was an effective use of resources in itself. Simplydenying air supremacy to the Allies was crucial, and the German air forces, heavilyoutnumbered as they were by 1918, especially in light of the ever increasing flow ofequipment and men from the USA, never totally lost control of their airspace. Ground support operations The value of artillery observation and reconnaissance has already been noted, but from the first air superiority operations grew the opportunity for aircraft to intervene directly in the ground war – what later became called ground-attack duties. Aircraftwere to hold a marked psychological advantage over ground troops, even when theland based forces became used to air attacks and were able to develop counter-measures. The initial impact of concerted air attack on ground forces was notabletherefore for the panic it created. The Germans were suitably impressed by the Allies’  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 65 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 54use of ground-attack aircraft over the Somme in 1916 to begin closer investigations themselves.29 It was the Allies who pressed the development of ground-attack aircraft as a logical prog
