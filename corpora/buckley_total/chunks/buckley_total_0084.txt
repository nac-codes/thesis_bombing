TOTAL WAR 54use of ground-attack aircraft over the Somme in 1916 to begin closer investigations themselves.29 It was the Allies who pressed the development of ground-attack aircraft as a logical progression of their air superiority campaign. If the Allies were able to gain control of German airspace for periods of time, what were they to do with it? The British andFrench, who were actively pursuing an offensive and aggressive air war strategy, developed the idea of using their air superiority fighters as ground-attack aircraft, thus making them multipurpose. Allied fighters began to be equipped with bombs andwere detailed to attack trenches and the rear zones of the German lines. Almost immediately, ground support operations split into two distinct halves: close air support, directly attacking enemy front-line troops to gain advantages for friendly groundforces; and battlefield interdiction, disrupting enemy rear zones, supply lines and support units. 30 Essentially, ground support operations have remained so divided ever since, with the former duty considered to be the most dangerous activity undertaken byaircraft and aircrew. Loss rates on close-air support operations were always high, never less than 30 per cent in fact, and with threats coming from both enemy interceptors who would be awaiting them, and ground fire with the increasing introduction ofanti-aircraft gunnery, many pilots preferred aerial combat and all its inherent dangers to the exigencies of ground support operations. 31 German policy was quite different to the Allied approach, and reflected national strategy. The German air forces in World War I were essentially defensive in nature, and aimed to deny the Allies the freedom to roam German airspace. They did not attempt to engage the Allies too often in drawn out battles for air superiority, preferring towait for the enemy to cross German lines where they would be attacked by dedicated fighter interceptors. Nevertheless, it quickly became apparent
