in drawn out battles for air superiority, preferring towait for the enemy to cross German lines where they would be attacked by dedicated fighter interceptors. Nevertheless, it quickly became apparent that ground-attack operations were effective, if costly. However, German development originated in theneed for rugged two-seater escort aircraft to provide protection for the more vulnerable reconnaissance aircraft. These escorts then began to double as ground-attack aircraft, for which their sturdy construction made them well-suited. 32 Thus, German designs tended to be twin-seater aircraft with greater ground-attack capability, whereas the Allies modified single-seater fighter aircraft to carry out these duties. Both ideas had advantages and disadvantages. The German model led to superior ground-attack aircraft, which would be more vulnerable to enemy fighter-attack, while the Allied plan resulted in more flexible but less capable ground-attack aircraft. Which strategy was most effective is rather difficult to gauge, as Richard Hallion has argued, because the Allies had general air superiority in the later stages of the war and  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 66 --- THE FIRST WORLD WAR, 1914–18 55the performance of superior German ground-attack aircraft such as the Junkers J1 “Furniture Van” could not be properly analyzed. Nevertheless, where ground-attackaircraft could be deployed they had a considerable impact, especially when air superiority, or even air supremacy, could be attained. It was in 1917, during the Passchendaele campaign, that the British first used ground- attack aircraft in a predetermined and organized manner to disrupt German ground forces, although the organization was still rather ad hoc. 33 By the Cambrai offensive of 1917, both sides were using ground-attack aircraft with some effect, as it was consideredthat aircraft could prevent stalemates from developing and were able to maintain momentum in an attack, predating aspects of blitzkrieg
