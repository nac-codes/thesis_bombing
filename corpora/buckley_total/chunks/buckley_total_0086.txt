ng ground-attack aircraft with some effect, as it was consideredthat aircraft could prevent stalemates from developing and were able to maintain momentum in an attack, predating aspects of blitzkrieg  by a little over 20 years. The importance of aircraft in co-operation with the tank also came to the fore in theCambrai offensive as it rapidly emerged that the biggest threat to tanks was anti-tank gunfire, in this early stage of armoured warfare usually provided by direct firing artillery. However, aircraft were able to maintain the tank’s offensive capability by neutralizingenemy gun batteries. Although problems were to persist in co-ordinating such aircraft/ tank operations, the axiom of all arms co-ordination being the key to breaking the stalemate on the Western Front was beginning to be realized. 34 It was clear that aircraft could add an offensive dimension to ground operations. This was particularly evident on the Western Front in 1918 when the Germans attempted to end the war with a final knockout blow. The Germans had developed an effective doctrine for the use of aircraft in supporting the new “stormtrooper” tactics.35 Indeed, 38 ground-attack squadrons were deployed by the Germans for the offensive.36 General Ludendorff was especially impressed by the contribution of the German air forces to the breakthrough, noting the value of combined arms co-ordination to the near success. The numbers of aircraft and the size of formations involved rose dramatically as the importance of aircraft increased,with over 600 aeroplanes being used by the French to lead a counter-attack against German forces between Courcelle and Wargemoulin on 11 June 1918. Air superiority was initially gained and German observation aeroplanes were driven from the skies,before French aircraft attacked enemy positions and allowed French forces to defeat the German attack. 37 Subsequent offensives in 1918, in particular St Miheil in September, demonstrated the continuing need for air superiorit
