acked enemy positions and allowed French forces to defeat the German attack. 37 Subsequent offensives in 1918, in particular St Miheil in September, demonstrated the continuing need for air superiority before aircraft could really begin to influence ground operations. Despite the advantage of numbers gained by the Allies around St Miheil – they were able to muster 1,481 aircraft of which 701 were directed to attain air superiority and to carry out ground-attack missions – the Germans were still able  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 67 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 56to contest control of the air space and carry out a number of aggressive ground support missions of their own. Ultimately, unless air superiority could be maintained at a level akin to air supremacy, aircraft could not be decisive, even if they were technologically capable of being so against a modern well-equipped enemy, which in 1918 was still far from proven. Nevertheless, tactics for neutralizing German anti-tank guns were developed, principally using smoke to screen advancing British tanks, but once again close air support operations took a heavy toll, influencing post-war RAF perceptions of the value of such duties.38 However, if the correct circumstances could be manufactured, the potential for aircraft to influence ground operations was evident. It was doubly true if modern air forces were deployed to support operations against enemies who could not contest air superiority effectively, as was demonstrated in campaigns against the Turks and Bulgarians, although this could hardly be expected in modern war against significant powers.39 By the end of hostilities, ground support operations had become an integral part of the mix of modern forces required to conduct campaigns. Many problems in the use of aircraft in these roles were being overcome, such as communications with the ground and other aircraft, and close co-operation with mobile land forces, which now included tanks in significa
