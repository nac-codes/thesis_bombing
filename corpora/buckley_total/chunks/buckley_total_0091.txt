the same result. 42 Elsewhere, maritime air power had little effect on the war, although the potential was clear. Naval reconnaissance and gunnery direction clearly benefited from air support but, Jutland aside, there was precious little in the way of action to test what was and was not feasible in wartime. Moreover, the ability of aircraft toattack or destroy naval shipping was never really tested, despite the continuing development of bombers and torpedo-bombers. 43 The airship enjoyed something of a renaissance for a time in maritime duties. As a weapon of war, faith in the hydrogen filled dirigible airship was shattered by a series of disasters and catastrophes in the early stages of the conflict, and its vulnerability to anti-aircraft fire and fighter aircraft was repeatedly proven. However, the airship’s superiorendurance and bomb load capacity indicated that it could be effective on naval operations. Despite this, poor weather over the North Sea was the bane of the airship’s life, even preventing Zeppelins from intervening in the Battle of Jutland. Subsequently,when battles for air superiority, similar to those over land, began over the sea the airship was again driven from the skies. Everywhere, that is, apart from the western approaches to Britain where the airship was able to operate outside the range ofGerman fighters and provided excellent air cover to convoys. By the end of the war, British maritime air power, which was by some distance the most developed, amounted to some 3,000 aircraft, 55,000 men and 12 aircraft handlingships. Much had been done to indicate what the future might hold with the first naval air reconnaissance, bombing and anti-submarine operations all having taken place by 1918. 44 The basics of maritime air power were evident but the aircraft had certainly not been able to convince conservative naval elements of their value, and the majority of the world’s fleets continued to remain sceptical about the potential of air power well into
