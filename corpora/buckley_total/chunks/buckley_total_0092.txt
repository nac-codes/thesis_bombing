aft had certainly not been able to convince conservative naval elements of their value, and the majority of the world’s fleets continued to remain sceptical about the potential of air power well into the interwar period.

Initially, this was represented by the Zeppelin fleet of Germany, and Allied newspapers warned their readers of the threat of bombing raids as soon as war broke out.45 The apocalyptic vision was of course wholly unrealistic, and the majority of airmen were well aware of the aircraft’s limitations, but the enthusiasts had, in the years before the war, glossed over what was and was not possible. More than anything it was the prospect of demoralizing the enemy with aerial bombing which sold the idea to politicians and military observers, and the repeated outbreaks of “Zeppelinitis” in newspapers increased the pressure on those in power still further. The airship was therefore seen by many to be the key to successful aerial bombing. Planning for air raids to be undertaken in the early stages of a future war was being considered seriously by the Germans and French by 1914.46 Targeting was already developing and the idea of deliberately attacking enemy morale as well as industrial and administrative centres was under consideration. However, when war broke out difficulties started to emerge. Problems of navigation, endurance and bombing accuracy had all been conveniently passed over by the bombing enthusiasts prior to the war, and when the defenders started to organize themselves, and even dared to shoot back
