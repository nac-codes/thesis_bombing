a joint knockout blow to Britain in conjunction with the launch of unrestricted submarine warfare.However, although they were more successful than their airship predecessors, they too were eventually forced to abandon daylight raids in order to keep losses down, as they were beginning to suffer at the hands of concentrated anti-aircraft fire and betterorganized fighter defences. Moreover, large aircraft of this type were still relatively new and lacked an effective gestation period. German development went back only to the RGO1 programme of late 1914 and successive designs encountered many problems,most notably the Gotha, which suffered from structural weaknesses to such an extent that more aircraft of this type were lost in flying accidents than on combat duty. 50 Notably, a trend was established that was to be followed many times in attempted strategic bombing campaigns. Daylight raids by Zeppelins in 1915–16 and heavy bombers in 1917–18 proved to be too dangerous and were replaced by night-time operations to keep losses down. This, however, seriously affected bombing accuracy, ultimatelydid not provide the protection desired and eventually led to the abandonment of bombing operations. Physical destruction from both Zeppelins and heavy-bombers was minimal in World War I with total damage amounting to less than one per cent ofthat caused by rats. 51 However, the psychological impact of bombing was to be far more profound and was markedly to influence perceptions in the post-war world. Early French daylight efforts were suspended when German Fokker Eindekker fighters started to take a significant toll of the bombers and, like the Germans, they switched in 1916 to night operations. The Allies were unable and unwilling to undertake a serious long-range bombing campaign until much later in the war when, with theinflux of US equipment and the gradual diminution of German defences, the prospects for bombing offensives against targets as far away as Berlin looked fair.
