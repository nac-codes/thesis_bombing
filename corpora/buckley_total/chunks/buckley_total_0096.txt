to whether long-range bombing was an effective use of resources. Many believed that air power should be used to support the land battles and that attacks on cities or enemyindustries were merely distractions. Hugh Trenchard, later an arch-proponent of strategic bombing, argued in 1918 that air forces should be used to aid the army, although he and others were to change their views as a result of the impact of bombing on thepopulation of London and its environs. The real impact that the summer of 1917 had on the development of strategic bombing was the influence that the scenes and reports of panic and consternation had in London as the German bombers roamedoverhead, apparently at will. Although death and damage was limited, the image of a city close to the point of collapse into anarchy, grossly exaggerated as this may have been, went on to be used by advocates of strategic bombing in the years after the war.In an effort to allay fears that Britain was helpless and at the mercy of the Germans, the British government, following the findings of the Smuts Committee, established the RAF in April 1918 as the first independent air force. As well as helping to bring toan end a series of duplication of effort fiascos between the RFC and the RNAS, the RAF was charged with defeating the air raids and underpinning public confidence in Britainâ€™s air defences. Additionally, one of the more overlooked motives was that ofrevenge: Lloyd-George announced that Britain would strike back at Germany, not necessarily for sound strategic reasons but for public consumption. 54 It was clear that bombing of civilian populations aroused great feelings quite out of proportion to the deaths and damage incurred: only 300 tons of bombs were dropped on Britain by German aircraft, killing 1,400 people, a tiny fraction of the carnage of the Western Front.55 Y et the disruption caused in London, whether by bombing or by fear and terror, made strategic air offensives look viable and indeed possibly v
