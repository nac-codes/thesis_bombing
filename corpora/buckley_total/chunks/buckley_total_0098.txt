cs of air power The expansion of the aero-industries in the First World War was remarkable by any standards and was a clear indication of the importance of economic mobilization to modern war. Once it became obvious that the war was not going to be over by Christmas 1914 and the demands for ever larger armed forces grew, so it was that theutilization of a state’s energies was required to continue to prosecute the war. For the first time, whole populations became embroiled in war, even if indirectly, and with conscription and mass-production factory work, including female labour, the natureand scale of war had taken an exponential leap forward. The demands of air power on home industries and economies were arguably more pronounced than any other aspect of war production. Not only did air power require ever increasing output but it also made heavy demands on a nation’s technological base. The need to marry military requirement, industrial mass-production and scientific advancement was a  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 74 --- THE FIRST WORLD WAR, 1914–18 63Table 3.2 – World War I frontline strengths Source:  Angelucci, Military aircraft,  p. 29. test that few states were able to meet effectively, and certainly over any length of time the smaller and less advanced industrial powers began to suffer. The scale of expansion is certainly worth noting. On the outbreak of war in 1914 the British air forces (RFC and RNAS) numbered a little over 2,000 men, but hadreached 291,000 by November 1918, making the RAF the largest air force. 56 The French had grown from 3,500 to 90,000 in the same period57 while, remarkably, the US Air Service, which had joined the war only in 1917, had expanded from 1,395 to195,000 by the armistice. 58 Even the Italian air forces numbered around 100,000 in November 1918.59 In terms of engine and airframe production all the major combatants increased their output dramatically as the war progressed. In 1914 such levels were measured in hundreds at
