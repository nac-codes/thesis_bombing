,000 in November 1918.59 In terms of engine and airframe production all the major combatants increased their output dramatically as the war progressed. In 1914 such levels were measured in hundreds at best but by 1918 monthly airframe output was reaching levels of 3,000 in Britain, 2,700 in France and even in Germany, where the stresses of the blockade andbeing heavily outnumbered were beginning to tell, 2,200 airframes per month were being produced. In engine production, France led the way at 4,000 per month while the British and Germans were at half that level. Throughout the war France produced  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 75 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 6452,000 aircraft, Germany 48,000 and Britain 43,000. French aero-engine production at 88,000 doubled the output of Germany and Britain. If the war had gone on into 1919,the USA was ready to surpass the Europeans in engine production thanks to the Liberty model, but was still reliant on European airframe technology. Like many other aspects of the rise of air power, 1919 appeared to be the year in which the aircraft andits attendant industries would come of age. The other powers’ production levels were dwarfed by the big three. 60 Austria–Hungary managed a mere 4,346 engines between 1914–18 and Russia was heavily dependent on France for its air power requirements.The methods and policies adopted by the belligerents in the war give a fair indication of the demands of air power on economies and societies. There was a marked contrast between the approaches of Germany and Britain to production and industryorganization. Germany managed to mobilize its aircraft industry quite adequately, but not always as effectively as it might have. Moreover, there was a marked split between the front-line and the home front and, as was also the case in Austria–Hungary, theGermans suffered from bureaucratic wrangling and petty squabbling. Efforts by the military to control the situation did not help as they were preo
