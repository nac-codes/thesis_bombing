The latter power was able to expand its productive base considerably in the later stages of the war by adopting a number of policies which could be identified more closely with thedemands of industrial war. The British aero-industry grew from 60,000 workers in August 1916 to 347,000 by November 1918, almost twice the size of the French industry (180,000). However, as has been noted the respective outputs of the twoindustries, and indeed the German industry too, were not reflective of the disparity in size of workforce. Britain relied heavily on labour dilution with the replacement of skilled labour by unskilled workers, usually women. In August 1916 this level hadstood at 31.7 per cent, but by October 1918 had been increased to 46.1 per cent. This resulted in a much higher ratio of workers to aircraft produced – about one aircraft per month per 120 workers – but allowed an easier expansion of the industry than waspossible in Germany where the lack of skilled labour was a key factor in hindering increased production. 62 German aircraft were relatively complicated and sophisticated in comparison with Allied designs, mostly in an effort to make up for engine and numerical deficiencies. But in the final two years of the war such an approach fused with increasing administrative chaos, faltering transportation and shortages of materials and labour tocause many problems. As John Morrow has argued, it was becoming clear to the German high command that a modern economy could not be ordered about like an army. 63 The French were able to meet the challenge of modern war by careful management and procurement policy decisions and, thanks to the adoption of a standardization plan as early as October 1914, they were able to maintai
