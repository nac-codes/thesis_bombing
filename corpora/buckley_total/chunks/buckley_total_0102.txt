ble to meet the challenge of modern war by careful management and procurement policy decisions and, thanks to the adoption of a standardization plan as early as October 1914, they were able to maintain their lead for much of thewar. The policy of standardization was also pursued by the British, but their industry was less well developed and thus had to rely more on labour dilution to keep up with the increasingly excessive demands of the war. Standardization resulted in Franceproducing 264 prototypes for 38 service models, Britain 309 for 73, while Germany constructed 610 prototypes for 72 service models. This policy allowed the French to harness an already well developed aero-industry while at the same time maintaining asignificant lead in engine production, where independent initiative was encouraged. In stark contrast with Germany, where engine production was stifled and restricted to two main producers, France’s aero-engine industry was allowed to flourish and thustheir lead was maintained throughout the war. 64 By 1918, France and Britain, along with increasing support from the USA, were threatening to swamp the German air forces. The Germans were no longer able to  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 77 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 66keep up, nor had they any further reserves to call upon and the prospects for 1919 were bleak indeed. The Germans’ most significant failing was their inability to manage their air industries effectively. While the French adopted perspicacious procurement policies from the off and the British greatly expanded their aero-industry base with unskilled labour, the Germans failed to adopt standardization until 1917 (when arguably it was too late), and were unable to take a firm grip of the entire production system, being too liberal with airframe output and too narrow and restrictive over engine production.65 However, one can be too critical over these failings, and it must be noted that the Germans were forced into a defensiv
