argued that the spearheading of ground offensives by aerial artillery was the key to ending campaignsand wars quickly. Thirdly, the development of maritime air power was seen by some as being the key to maintaining or seizing the initiative in naval warfare. The use of aircraft to command the world’s seaways was considered fundamental to the future ofthe maritime powers such as Japan, Britain and the USA. In all of these areas, progression of thinking and doctrine continued apace throughout the interwar years and often caused inter- and intra-service friction. Partof this resulted from the characters and personalities involved in the disputes and from the degree of the public interest in aerial matters.

The proponents of air power were, in the eyes of the masses, railing against excessive military conservatism and this lent them considerablepopular support, much to the chagrin of their leaders.
