shed, which meant that the enemy’s air fleet would have been neutralized and thus would give the victorious air force free rein to do what they  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 84 --- THE DEVELOPMENT OF AIR POWER DOCTRINE AND THEORY 73would.3 The subsequent objectives would be the enemy’s urban centres, and notably the capital city.4 Bombing attacks, it was argued by some, should attempt to defeat the enemy’s morale by directly attacking civilian populations. It was considered that only military personnel could withstand such bombardment and not the general public.Others shied away from proposing these brutal strategies and pressed for bombing campaigns to target industrial and political centres to cause as much disruption to the enemy state as possible. 5 The French writer Clement Ader was one of the most notable of the early air power advocates, speculating that Britain had most to lose from the rise of air fleets due to her particular geographical vulnerability to air attack. He also claimed that airforces should constitute an entirely new third service, rather than an auxiliary weapon to aid the infantry, artillery and cavalry. 6 In Britain, Sir Frederick Lanchester was probably the most significant air power theorist, publishing his ideas in Aircraft in warfare: the dawn of the fourth arm  (London, 1916), although the ideas themselves dated back to a series of articles from 1914 and 1915. Some of Lanchester’s mathematical calculations were similar to those used by the US RAND corporation in the Cold War era indicatingthe perspicacity of his thinking. In many other ways Lanchester was also remarkably prescient, for example stating long before it was proven that airships were too vulnerable for front-line use (Higham suggests that Lanchester’s writing may have decided Churchillagainst naval airships in 1914). He also notably claimed that bombers would require escort fighters to protect them during bombing missions over hostile territory, a tactic that was to
