ngs as they had in 1915 and 1917 and were to continue to do so throughout the Second World War. Post-war thinking nevertheless began to build on pre-war theorizing and on some of the lessons of the Great War, though of course only those lessons which supported strategic bombing. The US Army Air Corps set up a tactical school at Maxwell Air Force base in Alabama to consider the applications of air power, in a strategic and tactical sense, while in Britain the RAF also began thinking about the best use of massed bombing. As early as 1918, Sir Frederick Sykes, the then Chief of Air Staff of the RAF , had officially proposed a major plan for the creation of a massed bombing force capable of delivering severe blows to an enemy.7 The plan was rejected by the British government on the grounds of cost and strategic necessity. However, it was in aeronautical journals such as the French Revue de L’Aeronautique Militaire  set up in 1921, and the Italian Rivista Aeronautica  (1925) that air power discussions really developed and it was from this latter journal that the much debated Douhet legend may well have begun. The Douhet myth Guilio Douhet remains the doyen of the air power “theorists”, especially in the USA where he is considered the father of air power even more so than the native Billy Mitchell. It was notable that in the aftermath of the Gulf War of 1991 many air power advocates were claiming that the air campaign which had preceded Desert Storm had proved Douhet (and Mitchell) correct – air power, if used poperly, was the final arbiter of military success. Of course this was a very selective and partial reading of events, but the willingness to extol the virtues and righteousness of Douhet’s philosophy without careful consideration of reality demonstrates how various myths and legends have grown and been fostered by generations of air power thinkers, writers and practitioners. Nevertheless, no matter how mythical their influence now appears to be, there is no denying
