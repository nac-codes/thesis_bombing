bombing technology would, but in the environmentof the 1920s there did not really appear to be an answer to the surprise bombing raid. However, Douhet’s most important contribution to the development of air power lies in the perception of his influence rather than the reality. It is clear that Douhetwas not a pioneering theorist. Others were or had already outlined the potential of airpower in much the same way. Nor was he a clear strategist. Although the essence ofhis thinking can be found in The command of the air,  a complete view can only be obtained by piecing together a picture from many sources. As Claudio Segre hasargued, the most fitting epithet for Douhet, like Mitchell, may well be prophet. 19 His impact on defining and crystallizing bombing theory was at best peripheral but inencapsulating the essence of strategic bombing for those pressing for a greater role forair power in the period leading up to and during the Second World War, Douhet’sprophesying was well suited. 20 The development of strategic bombing theory and doctrine Strategic bombing theory in the interwar era took root in a number of air forces, butonly in Britain and the USA was it to have a major influence in shaping air powerpolicy, although its influence in Germany and the USSR is often too readily overlooked.However, as was to be demonstrated in the Second World War, it was predominantlythe RAF and the USAAF which sought to fulfil the notions of strategic bombing.Interwar theory was to be shaped by a number of considerations, often little relatedto the prevailing realities of air power. Clearly, air forces were acting against a backdropof political pressure to ensure that the attritional slaughter of the trenches was avoidedin future wars, and in an environment of burgeoning fear and interest in air warfare,the so-called growth in “air mindedness”. Moreover, air forces had to wrestle withmore mundane matters, such as inter-service squabbles with the RAF defending itshard won independenc
