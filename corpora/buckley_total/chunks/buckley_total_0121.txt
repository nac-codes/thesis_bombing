ther by the reports of the Britishbombing survey teams, which had struggled to find much physical evidence of bomb damage in World War I and had thus emphasized what they perceived or hoped were the effects on German morale. In addition, the panic and chaos caused by Germany’smodest bombing of London indicated what might be achieved by a concerted and sustained offensive. By the end of the 1920s, the emphasis on targeting morale was well established, and Trenchard’s influence lingered throughout the 1930s and intothe Second World War, long after his retirement in 1929. 21 Paradoxically, despite the acceptance of strategic bombing in principle the practicalities were never properly investigated. Although RAF theory rested on deliveringa “knockout blow”, little time and effort was devoted to how this strategy was to be carried out. Fighters, either as escorts or as interceptors were dismissed as either sops to public concerns at their own defencelessness or as a dangerous dissipation of scantresources. Problems of navigation and bombing were largely glossed over and, indeed, it was not until the late 1930s that the RAF really began to investigate the problems of locating and then hitting a target – even one as large as a city. It wasn’t until 1937 thatthe RAF set up a “Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Offence” under the direction of Sir Henry Tizard, in the hope that this would do for Bomber Command what similar initiatives had yielded for Fighter Command. However, even this newapproach was partly instigated by Bomber Command’s grudging acceptance that fighter technology had improved, and that if they did not react to this, and indeed to Sir Thomas Inskip’s review of defence (1937), they could be at risk.
