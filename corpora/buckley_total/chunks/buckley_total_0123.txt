e distinction between the “moral” and “material” effects of heavy bombing. 23 Whereas the aggressive “morale targeting” notions of the RAF partially reflected the offensive and combative British aerial experience of the Great War, and also reflected Trenchard’s personality, the US Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) based at Langley,Virginia, adopted a more measured approach. Initially, air power interest divided between pursuit, attack and bombardment aircraft but by the late 1920s the emphasis was shifting. 24 During the 1930s when the Norden bomb sight and new faster bomber aircraft designs became available, the belief of theorists based at the ACTS (by then at Maxwell Airbase, Alabama), such as Kenneth Walker, Donald Wilson, Laurence Kutter and Haywood Hansell, began to take shape and was to influence many World War IIcommanders, such as Curtis LeMay, Carl Spaatz and Ira Eaker. The new thinking was also prompted by the MacArthur–Pratt agreement between the US Navy and the US Army which delineated spheres of air power influence within the armed forces, andthe USAAC was now to be responsible for defending American shores with land  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 91 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 80based bombers. This of course required the army aircraft to be able to hit a moving target at sea and thus a premium was to be placed on bombing accuracy.25 Essentially, unlike the British, the Americans took a particularly industrial-economic view of bombing. T o their thinking, the key to bringing about success was to identify “key nodes” in the enemy economy and to target these for destruction by precision bombing. What these so called “key nodes” were and exactly how they would be destroyed remained to be developed, but the essence of US doctrine was already different to that of the RAF . This was reflected in intent, if not always in practice, in World War II. However, like the British, the US Air Corps believed slavishly in the ability of the bomber to by
