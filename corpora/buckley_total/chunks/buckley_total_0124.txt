fferent to that of the RAF . This was reflected in intent, if not always in practice, in World War II. However, like the British, the US Air Corps believed slavishly in the ability of the bomber to by-pass defences, despite the protestations and arguments of Captain Claire Chennault, who taught pursuit aviation at Maxwell in the early 1930s.26 Moreover, and again reflecting the British experience, the USAAC chose to disregardany empirical evidence from the Spanish Civil War and from the war in Europe prior to US entry. The ACTS preferred to rely on their statistical and scientific approach to strategic bombing and the bombing campaigns in Europe were dismissed as being partial, poorly organized and lacking in the correct doctrine and equipment. 27 Although the American air forces endured a steeper learning curve than the British in World War II, they too suffered from an unwillingness to deal with the practicalities of prosecuting a strategic bombing campaign and it was to take until 1943 for the US air forces to come to terms with the implications. The development of strategic bombing theory in other major powers foundered not because of lack of prescience or stultifying military conservatism, as is often argued by the arch-advocates of bombing, but simply because it did not fit with national strategic aims or it was considered technically unattainable in the foreseeable future without an unwarranted investment of scarce resources. In addition, the legacy of the failed strategic bombing campaigns against Britain between 1916 and 1918 continued to shape thinking throughout the interwar era.28 The Germans, though always adopting a more sceptical and pragmatic view, did seriously consider and study strategic bombing, especially when the Nazis came to power, but it never became properly established largely on the grounds that the limited available air power resources would be required to support ground operations more directly.29 Unlike Britain and the USA who were pro
