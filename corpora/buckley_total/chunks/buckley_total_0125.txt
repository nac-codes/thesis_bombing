ecame properly established largely on the grounds that the limited available air power resources would be required to support ground operations more directly.29 Unlike Britain and the USA who were protected from land based assault by geography, Germany would have to confront many hostile armies immediately on the outbreak of war. In addition, the German military were unconvinced by the claims of the air power advocates, including a number from within the Luftwaffe,  and this view was supported by German airmen’s experiences in the Spanish Civil War 1936–9.30 Nevertheless, in the early stages of German rearmament from 1933 onwards, the political and deterrent effects of bombers were  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 92 --- THE DEVELOPMENT OF AIR POWER DOCTRINE AND THEORY 81recognized in the creation of the “risk fleet”, a force intended to deter enemies from interfering in German affairs until the Wehrmacht  was ready for war.31 However, the technical practicalities of creating a strategic bombing force continually undermined efforts, and plans for a four-engined heavy-bomber were abandoned in the mid-1930s in favour of the ill-fated Heinkel He 177 long-range bomber. Nevertheless, on the outbreak of war, the Germans, thanks to their pragmatic approach to war, had in the Luftwaffe  the most effective short-to-medium range bombing fleet in the world and, unlike the RAF , German air forces had solved many navigational and bomb aiming problems. Paradoxically, although the Luftwaffe  was less inclined to strategic bombing, it was a more effective force for carrying it out than the RAF , certainly until 1941.32 What the Luftwaffe  lacked throughout were the resources to create a heavy-bomber fleet and, after 1940, they had no pressing need to do so.33 Nevertheless, planning for a strategic bombing offensive against the USSR was in place in the summer of 1941, only to be abandoned when the demands of army support took over.34 French attitudes to strategic bombing were a
