ely, a strong industrial, scientific and military structure needs to have been established with clearly defined national strategic goals. This was not achieved in Italy and consequently strategic bombing was never fully investigated because it was not a viable option.36  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 93 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 82Strategic bombing in the USSR also looked to have distinct theoretical possibilities, once the chaos of the civil and Polish wars had subsided. Both Germany and Japan, the Soviet Union’s two most likely opponents in future wars, were potentially vulnerable to strategic bombing, with their major cities being within reach of Soviet heavy- bombers. Kenneth Whiting argues that Soviet thinking on strategic bombing may have been influenced by Douhet’s writing but the ideas proposed by A.N. Lapchinsky in the mid-1920s and Khirpin in the 1930s only held with the more general aims of Douhet’s ideas and rejected the more extreme notions. In particular, and understandably considering the USSR’s requirement for a large standing army, Douhet’s claim that air power alone would be the central and decisive factor in future wars was discarded. Ultimately, and like the German experience, the VVS (the Red Air Force) abandoned its strategic bombing ideas in the wake of disappointing experiences in the Spanish Civil War and as a result of the Red Army purges.37 As can be seen therefore, strategic bombing as a means of winning wars was largely rejected by the armed forces of the world during the interwar period. Those who examined the possibilities came to the conclusion either that massed bombing did not fit with national strategy, or that it was not viable in the technological climate of the interwar era. Only in Britain and the USA, as a result of certain geographical, armed service and political circumstances, did strategic bombing really take root. Moreover, the nature of the doctrinal ideas codified in the RAF and the USAAF varied a goo
