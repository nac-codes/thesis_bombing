Even though Germany was not allowed any military air power by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, surreptitious  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 96 --- THE DEVELOPMENT OF AIR POWER DOCTRINE AND THEORY 85analysis continued, conducted by Major Helmuth Wilberg, who was to become the most significant contributor to German air doctrine in the interwar period. These discussions concluded that Germany’s defensive air strategy in World War I had been ill-founded and that, in future conflicts, fighters should be used to gain air superiority as an essential precursor to the effective deployment of Germany’s own bomber and ground attack arm. Von Seeckt himself was an ardent supporter of air power, although he took a more pragmatic line than contemporary overseas advocates. This reflected general German policy towards the employment of air power, as indeed did von Seeckt’s favouring of the use of air forces on deep interdiction duties rather than close air support operations.39 By 1926, air power doctrine had been codified by Wilberg into a single document entitled Guidelines for the conduct of the operational air war.  The employment of air power in future wars was outlined in some detail. The use of the term “operational” was significant because it emphasized a flexible and non-doctrinaire approach. Although only a small number of aircraft and air support units were to be placed directly under the control of the army, the bulk of the air forces would still support the ground forces in a wide variety of interdiction duties once air superiority had been achieved.40 Thus, German air doctrine did not tie the future Luftwaffe  to a simple role of army support, but offered a doctrine based on widespread and general support for German armed forces at an operational and campaign level. Notably, however, strategic bombingwas not emphasized. German rearmament was transparent by 1935, and the considered doctrine of the newly created Luftwaffe
