ces at an operational and campaign level. Notably, however, strategic bombingwas not emphasized. German rearmament was transparent by 1935, and the considered doctrine of the newly created Luftwaffe  was set down in another document, Air force regulation on the conduct of the air war.  This was effectively to determine the employment of air power throughout the Second World War. Again, General Wilberg was involved as editor and joint author, although General Walther Wever, a late convert to the benefits of air power, was arguably the major contributor. In a very similar vein to the 1926 appraisal, the 1935 document argued that gaining air supremacy was a crucial first stage in the prosecution of a campaign. This, in effect, meant attacking the enemy air force with a series of knockout blows. Once the enemy air force had been eliminated, German airspace would be safe and the Luftwaffe  would be able to concentrate on attacking the enemyâ€™s ground forces and on causing disruption and chaos in the enemy state. However, it was once again argued that the Luftwaffe  could not win the war independently, in marked contrast to the doctrine of the RAF . 41 It is also important to note that the subjugation of air power to the immediate needs of the army in a series of close support operations was also rejected. As Michel Forget argues, German air doctrine fell between the two concepts of close air support  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 97 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 86and strategic bombardment. Close support of the army was to take place, but the Luftwaffe  would make a more operational or even campaign level contribution to a conflict. This would allow a flexible approach to the use of air power, although clearlythe ultimate aim was to provide the right conditions for the ground forces to win thecampaign. 42 Luftwaffe  doctrine crystallized during the Spanish Civil War, as much valuable experience and practical learning was added to the theory developed since
