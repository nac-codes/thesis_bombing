for the ground forces to win thecampaign. 42 Luftwaffe  doctrine crystallized during the Spanish Civil War, as much valuable experience and practical learning was added to the theory developed since 1918. The Germans maintained a force of 100 aircraft and 5,000 personnel in the Condor Legion which contributed significantly to Franco’s victory. Close air support operations,previously eschewed by the Luftwaffe,  grew in importance following the Condor Legion’s experiences in Spain and a special unit was established to develop the means ofsupporting Germany’s armoured forces in a concerted manner. 43 However, problems persisted and the delay between the call for air support and the actual raid remained at some hours. Generally, Luftwaffe  aircraft were ill-suited to close air support operations.44 Moreover, it is worth noting that on the outbreak of the Second World War only some 15 per cent of the Luftwaffe  had been designated to offer close support to the army, thus undermining the frequently quoted myth that the German air forces werespecifically designed and constructed to support armoured warfare. 45 It can be seen that the operational requirements of the German state were to be met and supported by the Luftwaffe  in any future war in an attempt to win decisive and rapid campaigns. The rejection of massed bombing was in part driven by thegeostrategic position of Germany and the place of the army at the head of the armedforces. It would seem logical therefore that France would follow a similar pattern inplacing the need to succeed at an operational level first and foremost, even if thedesire to change the nature of modern battle was not a priority following the victory of World War I. However, French army/air force planning failed to meet this challenge and, by the Second World War, the French air forces had not developed an effectivedoctrine for the employment of aircraft to support the land war or, more importantly,the forces to prosecute such a strategy.
