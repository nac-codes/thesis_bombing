econd World War, the French air forces had not developed an effectivedoctrine for the employment of aircraft to support the land war or, more importantly,the forces to prosecute such a strategy. Doctrinal wrangling was the major cause of the failure of the air forces in World War II. Throughout the interwar period, especially after the creation of the independent Armee de l’Air  (the French Air Force) in 1933, the army and the air force leaders squabbled over the use of air power in support of the land war. The army emphasizedthe use of aircraft to cover reconnaissance and observation and the screening ofFrench ground forces from air attack. It was in essence a World War I formula, althoughit must be stated that by the mid–1930s the importance of bombing operations was  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 98 --- THE DEVELOPMENT OF AIR POWER DOCTRINE AND THEORY 87also being considered. The air force attempted to emphasize the importance of the air battle to gain air superiority, and in this the bomber would be the key, they claimed. The strategy was to eliminate the enemy air force by bombing raids and offensive action, and the potential was there for strategic bombing raids, even though it seemsunlikely that this was ever seriously considered. However, the spirit of consensus was lacking and views rapidly polarized. 46 French air power doctrine was confused throughout much of the 1930s, a by- product being the disastrous BCR ( Bombardement Combat Reconnaissance ) aircraft, which was supposed to meet a wide variety of air power requirements but instead resulted in French air power planning and design being led down a blind alley.47 The adage that a horse designed by committee would turn out as a camel is particularly apposite, and the BCR has been described as a “two-engine, eight-ton, underarmed and underpowered dinosaur”.48 In wider terms, without a clear goal and with an aero- industry still steeped in the practices and thinking of the past, the French were left
