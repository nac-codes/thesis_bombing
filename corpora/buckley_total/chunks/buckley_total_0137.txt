perception of the role of air power was particularly outdated and conservative. Moreover, whereas the Luftwaffe  and even the Armee de l’Air  investigated close operational level co-operation between the army and the air force, in Britain  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 99 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 88this was not the case to any significant degree, especially after the dabblings with offensive armoured warfare had faded in the early 1930s.51 Nevertheless, some rudimentary doctrine was formed though not in a coherent and co-ordinated fashion. The RAF was anxious not to get drawn into expensive and wasteful ground-support operations of the type carried out in World War I, where loss rates had been excessive to say the least. Where artillery and machine-guns could do the job then aircraft should not be employed, it was argued by official manuals. The role of the fighter was to gain and maintain air superiority.52 Only when the enemy army was in retreat, or was close to a breakthrough, should air forces be deployed on hazardous close air support operations. The problems of co-ordinating aircraft and ground forces were remarked upon by some, such as John Slessor, following imperial air policing operations, but empirical learning of this type was never really formulated into a true doctrine.53 The US Army’s Air Corps (USAAC) followed a similar pattern of doctrinal development to the RAF in its attitudes to land warfare. In much the same manner that strategic bombing theory dominated thinking in the RAF to the detriment of all other forms of air power (until the British government enforced a shift towards air defence in 1937), so too was thinking and doctrinal development at the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell, certainly from the late 1920s. Some even argued, as they did in Britain, that the use of air power to support the army, and indeed the navy, wasa dangerous diversion of limited resources. The lessons of World War I, limited as they were for t
