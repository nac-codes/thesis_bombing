rgued, as they did in Britain, that the use of air power to support the army, and indeed the navy, wasa dangerous diversion of limited resources. The lessons of World War I, limited as they were for the US Air Service, had little impact and the Third Attack Group (formed in 1921 to examine close air support) drifted away from the role during the interwar period. Airmen posted to ground support units worked in virtual isolation, spread out across the USA as they were, and there was no cohesive policy towards the employment of air forces to support the army nor indeed which aircraft would be best suited to such duties. The development of doctrine and theory did not really get underway until the lessons of the German blitzkrieg  began to filter back to the USA from Europe in 1939. 54 However, in spite of this, the technological advances in the USAAC were significant and, although the doctrine did not exist for their effective use, new types of aircraft such as the A-20 were being procured in the late 1930s. In addition, the US Marine Corps, free from the desire to establish independence, developed more considered and pragmatic theories on the use of close air support, and were able to hone them in Haiti and Nicaragua. Importantly, dive-bombing was established as an accurate and effective technique.55 (See Chapter Five.) The Soviet Union was again a state which could have been expected to develop a system of army co-operation air forces of some note in the interwar era, especially  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 100 --- THE DEVELOPMENT OF AIR POWER DOCTRINE AND THEORY 89under the general influence of the armoured warfare theorist Mikhail Tukhachevski, prior to his apparently pointless execution in the Red Army purges of the late 1930s. In fact, by that time, doctrine in the Voyenno-vozdushnyye sily  (VVS – the USSR’s air force) did emphasize army co-operation and support but was undermined by a lack applied thinking and technological development, failings which we
