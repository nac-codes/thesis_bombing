tacking the enemy air force were not uppermost in his thinking. In addition, Frunze was saddled with revolutionary ideology, which led to contradictions in his philosophy of air power. While he claimed that too much reliance on the technological aspects of war was overly bourgeois, he also stated that an army without air support could not function. 57 Doctrinal thinking was clearly muddled, though the basic tenet that the air forces should more or less directly support the army was accepted. The approach to how this was to be achieved was less than sophisticated or properly thought out, and was moreover undermined by the purges of the late 1930s. Unlike the French, who could not make their minds up, the Soviets failed to develop an effective doctrine and an air force to support it because they were unable to manage their resources effectively. The USSR failed the organizational test of air power prior to the Second World War, although the purges were also a major factor, and the VVS was to take until 1943 to  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 101 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 90create an effective ground support air force, much the same length of doctrinal learning time as the RAF and the USAAF . In contrast to strategic bombing, air support for armies was determined by levels of developed doctrine and training rather than prevailing levels of technology. The Luftwaffe had few if any high quality close air support aircraft, yet by 1939 it was a potentground attack force owing to its carefully honed doctrine. In contrast the US airforces had many new and technologically advanced aircraft, but lacked the doctrine to apply them successfully. In addition, the debate concerning procuring dedicated ground attack aircraft, or using swing-role aircraft such as fighter-bombers, as in WorldWar I, had yet to be resolved.. On the outbreak of war only the pragmatic, and thanks to the Spanish Civil War, experienced Germans were in a fit state to conduct ground support
