long term collision course and any future confrontation would of course take place over the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. As such, air power had the potential to be highly effective, initially as a reconnaissance and scouting force and ultimately as an aggressive arm. Speed, mobility and the offensive aspects of air power eventually came to predominate, leading ultimately to fast carrier groups, where the aircraft carriers had little armour in order to increase aircraft handling capacity, speed and endurance. It was expected that such forces would operate beyond the range of land based bombers and would be able to evade surface vessels. The Royal Navy, however, had other priorities. It was expected that their emerging carrier forces would have to operate in and around Europe and the Mediterranean, as well as in the Far East, and consequently would have to operate with the very real threat of surface attack and land based air assault. This duality was in part to result in the Royal Navy developing armoured carriers with smaller complements of aircraft. These were of limited value in long-range oceanic operations, in which they were tobecome embroiled in 1942. However, the development of air power doctrine in the British forces was hindered in other ways. While the USA and Japan had dedicated naval air arms, the Royal Navy had to rely on the RAF to provide its aircraft and aircrew, even on board carriers. The RAF , however, was little interested in any form of maritime air power, save using its larger flying boats for imperial duties. Consequently, and despite protestations from the Royal Navy, the maritime air force suffered from a distinct lack of interest on the part of its parent body, and the so-called “dual control” problem emerged. It was not until 1937 that this curious situation changed and the fleet air arm was put under the direct control and ownership of the navy. This was much too late to have a marked effect on British carrier based aviation by the
