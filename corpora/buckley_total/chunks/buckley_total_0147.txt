as his unremitting pressure prompted the Chief of Naval Operations, William Benson, to create a Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer), dedicated to naval aviation, in 1921. 64 However, the most influential figure in the development of maritime air power in this period was Admiral  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 105 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 94William Moffett, the Chief of the BuAer until his death in 1933. Moffett forced the pace of maritime air power development and ensured that the air faction in the navy made its voice heard. Japan was already regarded by the USA as the most likely future enemy and it was expected that US forces would have to carry out an offensive strategy to take the warto Japan. 65 The role of air power in such planning grew throughout the interwar period. It was expected that the US fleet would have to operate against land-based Japanese air forces and thus would require carrier based aircraft to counter this threat. Even the battleship minded “Gun Club” in the US Navy was infiltrated by admiralswho recognized the value of air power, even if only in a supportive role. In 1927, aninvestigative board was set up to examine the place carriers should hold within thefleet, made all the more urgent with the arrival by the end of that year of two fastcarriers, the Saratoga  and the Lexington. As the interwar period went on, tactics were developed for the combined use of carrier-borne dive and torpedo bombers. In particular, a series of Fleet Problems(naval manoeuvres) identified that, in order to make the most of their advantages ofspeed and mobility, the carriers should operate almost independently of the battleshipline. This caused considerable debate throughout the navy with the traditional battleshipofficers arguing that the carriers should act as the scouts and reconnaissance units of the navy, and that ultimately it would be the big guns of the battleships which would decide the outcome of a battle. However, the weight of evidence be
