a US threat to further Japanese activity in southeast Asia. The Japanese had had their own carrier fleet founded on the Akagi  and Kaga of later World War II fame since the late 1920s, but when more expansionist ideas began to take root in the Japanese military from the early 1930s, then the problem of confronting the USA’s offensive carrier aviation became a real issue. The IJN fearedthe potential of the US carrier fleet: it was on offensive operations that carrier aviationcame into its own. However, it was perceived that Japan would have to fight anessentially defensive war against the USA, once initial gains had been made, and it wasin this early phase that the Japanese aircraft carriers could prove their worth. Moreover, as the future commander of naval operations, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, concluded in 1933 Japanese careers would offer the best means of blunting US fleet operations. However, the doctrine that had been developed by the mid-1930s placed the Japanese carrier arm firmly in a subsidiary role to the main battleship line which stilldominated the IJN’s thinking. Initially, Japanese planning had centred on a defensiveattritional strategy which aimed to weaken a US fleet advancing across the Pacific with submarines and land- and carrier-launched air strikes. When sufficiently damaged, the US fleet would be attacked and destroyed by the Japanese surface fleet. This wasconsidered to be the only way to even the odds in light of the US fleet’s 30–40 percent superiority in tonnage in the mid-1930s. By the late 1930s, under the direction ofAdmiral Yamamoto, the IJN altered its strategy to include a knockout air strike againstthe US fleet to buy time for Japan to seize the initiative in the resource rich southeast Asia. However, even in this scenario, carriers would only prepare the ground for the Japanese surface fleet and once again the war would end with a Jutland styleshowdown. 67 The doctrine, so effective in the early stages of World War II, really began
