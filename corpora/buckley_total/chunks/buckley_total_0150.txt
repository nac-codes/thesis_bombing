d only prepare the ground for the Japanese surface fleet and once again the war would end with a Jutland styleshowdown. 67 The doctrine, so effective in the early stages of World War II, really began to crystallize under the tutelage of the prescient Commander Minoru Genda, who can be identifiedas the true doctrinal father of Japanese naval aviation. Genda had been arguing since the mid-to-late 1930s for a major expansion of Japanese land and sea based air power, even at the expense of surface fleet construction. However, the Naval Staff’s ThirdReplenishment Plan for the period of 1937 to 1942 effectively rejected his calls,placing first priority on matching the US Navy’s battleship strength. 68 Genda persisted and in 1940 he formulated the plan that a large group of carriers operating together  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 107 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 96would offer more effective fighter protection (though in fact each carrier would only be operating fewer fighters) and a greater volume of anti-aircraft fire. Moreover, the offensive punch of such a carrier group would be considerable indeed, increased by the need for fewer fighters. Genda’s ideas caused a rethink in the IJN and in April 1941 the First Air Fleet was formed comprising all the fleet carriers then available. Under the leadership of Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, with Genda in a prominent role, manoeuvres were carried out to test the capability of the fast carrier fleet. The principles of Genda’s doctrine formed the basis of the Pearl Harbor operation, a raid intended to destroy the American carrier fleet, rather than the battleships, symbolizing the importance attributed to the US Navy’s carrier force.69 However, although Japan’s carrier fleet was the most effective force of its kind by 1941, equipped with superior aircraft and better trained aircrew than even the US Naval air forces, the place of aviation in Japanese strategy, even naval strategy, was not central. Despite what they were
