equipped with superior aircraft and better trained aircrew than even the US Naval air forces, the place of aviation in Japanese strategy, even naval strategy, was not central. Despite what they were to achieve at Pearl Harbor and in the first few months of 1942, the Japanese navy at an institutional level never truly accepted the predominant nature of aviation in maritime warfare. Battleship mentality still ruled in the IJN, precipitating the wasteful construction of the super battleships Yamato  and Musashi, and more importantly leading to the fruitless and vain search for the decisive battleship confrontation with the US fleet, which the Japanese navy expected right up until 1945 to decide the war either way. The IJN was still clinging to the idea that a Jutlandstyle battle would be the culmination of a Pacific campaign. What the majority in the Japanese fleet failed to realize was that the fast carrier strike force they had pioneered had relegated the battleship to a subservient position of supporting and protecting the carrier. 70 The emphasis on the decisive battle also hindered the other crucial role of maritime air power for Japan – trade defence. The British experience of World War I, which had reinforced the IJN’s desire for a Jutland style showdown, did not also lead to the Japanese seriously considering how to defeat a commerce raiding threat to their sea communications. For a nation as equally dependent on seaborne trade as Britain, the lesson of the U-boat offensive in 1917 and 1918 should have been a chastening one. Y et the important role of aircraft in defeating this menace was not acknowledged by the battle-oriented IJN. Such duties were considered unfitting for the airmen of the navy and, consequently, by World War II no doctrine of aerial trade defence had been formulated. The real disaster occurred when the IJN continued to do little about this problem as the Second World War went on.71 (See Chapter Seven.) On the outbreak of war, maritime aviat
