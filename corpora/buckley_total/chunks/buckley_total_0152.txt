ce had been formulated. The real disaster occurred when the IJN continued to do little about this problem as the Second World War went on.71 (See Chapter Seven.) On the outbreak of war, maritime aviation doctrine in the major naval powers was not fully formed. The US Navy understood most about the nature and potential of  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 108 --- THE DEVELOPMENT OF AIR POWER DOCTRINE AND THEORY 97maritime air power, especially carrier aviation, but was still developing the means with which to carry out its thinking. In addition, the place of the fast carriers was still partly linked to the battleship line, a duty only finally abandoned courtesy of the Japanese Pearl Harbor attack. It is also worth noting that the US Army, like Bomber Commandin the RAF , believed that large formations of heavy-bombers could destroy naval forces. This notion was to be swept away by repeated failures in Europe and the Pacific, where throughout the war not a single active major naval vessel was sunk byhigh altitude bombing. The Japanese had developed the most effective carrier strike force and the air doctrine to use it, but the rule of battleship based strategy persisted. In essence, the maritime air force and its supporting doctrine had been developed butthe direction and long-term strategy for its use had not. The Royal Navy was in the most parlous state by the end of the 1930s in terms of equipment, but its doctrine was also underdeveloped. Though the RN was to carry out the famous carrier strike onthe Italian fleet at Taranto in 1940 (which greatly impressed both the Japanese and the Americans) the geographical and strategic constraints of fighting a continental based power such as Germany, and a second rate naval power such as Italy, resulted in aconservative outlook. It should be stated that the British did not require a fast carrier force to fight Germany and the resources were not available until very late into the 1930s to construct such a force to operate
