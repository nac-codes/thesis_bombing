of radar in the mid-1930s precipitated Britain’s advanced air defence system,which served them well in 1940, and the doctrine for its use came in its wake. Incontrast, US aircraft designs were highly advanced in a number of areas, yet the doctrinedid not exist or was flawed. More often than not, however, doctrine lagged some way behind contemporary technology. In many ways, air power advocates recognized the potential of air forcesand were prescient in their claims. Where they went astray was in arguing that theirtheories were immediately attainable. Air forces and their supporters continuallymiscalculated what was realistically achievable, especially in the field of strategic bombing,and this more than anything has fuelled the notion that air power failed in the SecondWorld War. This is because it has usually been measured against the hopes of theinterwar theorists. Nevertheless, the formulation of theory by the world’s air forces , if not always coupled with the doctrine to support it, opened up political and strategic opportunitiesin the 1930s as the world lurched back towards war. Effective air support for groundforces appeared to make war look more decisive and acceptable again, clouding thememories of World War I, while both Britain and Germany went on to use the fear ofstrategic bombing for political and diplomatic ends in the 1930s. Such policies werebrought about by the perception of what air power could achieve in modern war, alegacy of theoretical thinking from the end of World War I, and even before, rather than an acknowledgement of what was technically possible.

In the years 1914–18, sizeable aero-industries had emerged, air power had become an integral partof military operations and, perhaps most importantly, the aeroplane had becomecommonplace to many, especially in Europe and North America
