Versailles, officers sent to the Soviet Union for air training were temporarily retired from the German army, only to be reactivated on their return. 2 Therefore, under the shrewd stewardship of General Hans von Seeckt, the Reichswehr  cleverly maintained a vestige of air power throughout the period prior to the advent of Hitler, thanks to the combination of links with the USSR and the civil air sector in Germany.3 Although the Germans benefited greatly from the USSR deal, the Soviets were not so happy. In the aftermath of their civil war and the struggle against Poland, in both of which air power played only a limited role, the USSR was determined to expand its air forces. The Western Allies had sent limited air support to the White Russian rebels and volunteer pilots and aircrew, from the USA and Britain in particular, had aided the Poles with some success against the Soviets.4 From the links formed with the German military in 1922 the Soviet air force wanted modern training for its aircrew as well as technical and industrial help. The former was a fair success, but the attempt to aid  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 112 --- GLOBAL AIR POWER, 1918â€“39 101new Soviet air production floundered following the economic downturn in Europe and the hyperinflation suffered by Germany. However, aircraft production did get underway under the direction of Mikhail Frunze who was an ardent supporter of the growth of a Soviet military industry to compete with the West. In spite of this, the Soviets still had to buy aero-engines from German companies. Indeed, by 1925, although the USSR no longer needed to go abroad for its aircraft, home based engine production had reached only 10 per cent of requirements.5 The inability of the Soviet economy to provide enough aero-engines was one of many factors which prompted the much greater emphasis on rapid industrialization in the USSR from the mid-1920s onwards. The victorious powers of World War I were also confronted with many proble
