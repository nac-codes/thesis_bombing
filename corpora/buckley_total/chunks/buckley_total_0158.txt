e of many factors which prompted the much greater emphasis on rapid industrialization in the USSR from the mid-1920s onwards. The victorious powers of World War I were also confronted with many problems in the years after 1918. Demobilization was far reaching and swift. In the USA the air service contracted from 190,000 in November 1918, to just over 10,000 by 1920 and, by 1919, 90 per cent of the aero-industrial plant had been discarded resulting in huge war surpluses. Moreover, aircraft production fell by almost 98 per cent inside two years of the armistice.6 France also saw a marked decline in its air forces, although with prevailing international uncertainty, it was not as excessive as in the USA. In 1918 the French air arm had 90,000 officers and men which shrank to 39,055 by October 1920; 11,023 aircraft in November 1918 to 3,940 in March 1920, although 3,050 were in storage; and the aero-industry contracted from 183,000 workers to 3,700 by 1921.7 The RAF also rapidly diminished from 293,532 officers and men in November 1918 to 37,981 by October of the following year.8 However, while the powers of Central and Eastern Europe and the USA virtually disappeared from the international air power scene for the 1920s, the French and British, with greatly increased imperial responsibilities and a climate of financial stringency, were forced to adapt to a wholly new strategical and political situation. In fact it was Anglo-French hostility which caused the first “air scare” of the interwar period, when concern grew in London at the threat posed to British security by the larger French air and submarine forces. Although France did have a larger air force than Britain in the 1920s, the reality was that no threat was ever posed to British security. The French were far more concerned about Germany, still in their eyes the major factor in determining long-term European stability. In Britain, however, the perceived French air threat was skilfully used by Sir Hugh Trenchard, t
