cerned about Germany, still in their eyes the major factor in determining long-term European stability. In Britain, however, the perceived French air threat was skilfully used by Sir Hugh Trenchard, the RAF’s Chief of Air Staff (CAS), to help maintain air force independence at a time when the threat of reabsorption into the army and the navy was still on the political agenda. Although it is usually argued that strategic bombing was kept in reserve by the RAF during the 1920s until a more politically opportune moment arrived, John Ferris has argued that Trenchard displayed the RAF’s true attitudes  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 113 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 102towards massed bombing during this French air crisis. The CAS argued that the French air threat was very real, of considerable potential, and that the only way to deter it wasto build a bomber fleet of roughly equal capability. These were very similar to thearguments used in the 1930s against Germany and had considerable impact on thinkingin the RAF . 9 The link between the new air weapon and political strategy was also already forming. The British government was concerned not to allow any foreign power a potentialhold over Britain. In much the same way that Germany could not be allowed tothreaten Britain with naval power in the years leading up to World War I, so Francecould not be allowed to hold an air power advantage that might in the future forceBritain into a diplomatically compromizing position. The belief that the bomber couldnot be defended against, and that the destructive potential of massed bombing washuge, became embedded in government thinking during the early 1920s, even thoughTrenchard had exaggerated considerably merely to gain political and financial advantagesfor the RAF . Moreover, although the expansion of the RAF’s home defence force wasundertaken with sporadic success, many of the industrial and technical problemsencountered in the expansion of the 1930s were uncovered
