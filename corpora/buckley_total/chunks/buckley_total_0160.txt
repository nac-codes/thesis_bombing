over, although the expansion of the RAF’s home defence force wasundertaken with sporadic success, many of the industrial and technical problemsencountered in the expansion of the 1930s were uncovered during the 1920s butwere conveniently forgotten. 10 Air power and the wider world Although strategic bombing was a cornerstone of RAF philosophy by the early 1920s,it alone was not enough to ensure the survival of the world’s first independent airforce. The second and arguably the most important policy adopted by the RAF tothis end was that of “substitution”, which involved using aircraft as replacements forthe navy and the army in imperial policing and control duties across the globe. In anera of financial stringency, the RAF was able to make itself immensely popular withthe British government by carrying out such operations at considerably less cost thanthe other services. Trenchard coupled the imperial card with the potential threat ofFrench aerial aggression and hence ensured the survival of the RAF . 11 Air power proved to be an effective arm in imperial operations and duties and was introduced into many overseas territories and campaigns by western powers, thusemphasizing the effect that air power, the most technologically based of weapons,could have on populations totally unused to it. Once again it was clear that the gap  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 114 --- GLOBAL AIR POWER, 1918–39 103between the respective military capacities of modern western industrial states and the rest of the world had widened significantly, a trend noticeable in imperial expansiondating back to the mid-to-late nineteenth century. 12 The British were faced with a number of imperial problems in the immediate post-war era and the RAF was soon being utilized in control and policing duties, atmuch lower cost than the army, which hitherto would have been expected to carry out such operations. The first such campaign was carried out in Afghanistan in 1919 in the so-called “Third Afghan
