of these imperial policing and control duties on British air power was probably mixed. While the substitution policy ensured the survival of the RAF during a difficult period, it contributed little to the growth of the RAF as a modern air force.Indeed, although it can be argued quite effectively that the methods developed for imperial control and policing had no real effect on RAF doctrine. There were lessons to be learned, notably that bombing of populations did not have the psychologicalimpact envisaged and certainly not once counter-measures were developed, however rudimentary these may have been. Moreover, for the maritime air forces, used to conduct long-range flying boat cruises during the interwar era, the effects of theimperial role were quite damaging. Trade defence duties were jettisoned to concentrate on long-range flying boat operations and thus the lessons of the Great War concerning the value of air power in anti-U-boat operations were lost, with serious repercussionsin World War II. 18 The French and Spanish were also involved in imperial air power operations during the interwar era. In 1921, Abd al-Karim led a rebellion in Morocco against Spanishrule, the so-called Rif War 1921–6, with considerable early success. The Spanish force used aircraft sporadically and ineffectively until the air forces were concentrated and directed to pursue a plan of systematic bombing of crops, villages and livestock, evenresorting to the use of poison gas. However, the tactics did not bring about the decisive victory expected and, after 1924, the Spanish returned to orthodox tactical support operations. Like the British, they realized that attacks on the civilian populationswere ineffective and possibly even counter-productive. Direct tactical support, however, was viable and often very effective as there was no realistic way for the rebels to hit back. 19  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 116 --- GLOBAL AIR POWER, 1918–39 105The French were to show greater aptitud
