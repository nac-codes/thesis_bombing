and often very effective as there was no realistic way for the rebels to hit back. 19  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 116 --- GLOBAL AIR POWER, 1918–39 105The French were to show greater aptitude for organizing their air effort when they too confronted al-Karim in 1925 when he led his forces from Spanish to French Morocco. The French air forces developed Groups Mobile  consisting of armoured cars, motorized infantry, light tanks and air support. These anti-rebel units proved remarkablyeffective, surpassing even the RAF’s achievements in their imperial activities. It wasreadily accepted by the French, and by al-Karim himself, that the rebels’ inability todefend themselves against air attack was a significant factor in the success of the air forces deployed against them. The tactics used emphasized tactical level support duties: reconnaissance, observation, bombing and strafing. Long-range bombing did take placeon occasion when fighting lulled, but even then it was concentrated on encampmentsand fortifications, there being no evident recourse to the “terror” style tactics of theSpanish. 20 The USA also deployed air power in imperial style operations between 1927 and 1933 when US forces were deployed in support of the Nicaraguan regime during the Sandino War. Marine Corps aircraft were used for reconnaissance, observation, closetactical support, communication, supply and medical evacuation duties against theSandanista  rebels. During these operations the marines pioneered the first systematic use of dive-bombers, eschewed by the US Army Air Service and by the RAF . Partly asa consequence of the work of the marines in the Sandino War, the dive-bomber was adopted by the US Navy during the 1930s. The air operations in Nicaragua were considered largely successful, most notably in two battles, at Ocotal and on El Saraguazcamountain. Again, it was demonstrated that enemy forces incapable of properly defendingthemselves were especially vulnerable to air attack, even in
