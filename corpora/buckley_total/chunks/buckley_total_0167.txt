of effectiveness against modern armed forces. However, the strategy of deploying air forces in imperial roles did lead to a few minor distortions. The RAF’s maritime air force concentrated on long-range flying boat cruises at the expense of anti-submarine warfare, but the development of British air power in general continued unaffected by its imperial duties. Indeed, although it was retrospectively perceived that the bombing of native rebels had fallaciously proven the value of aerial bombing, there is little evidence of any direct link. Doctrinally, the imperial experience merely reiterated lessons already learnt in World War I, and it was on a wider political scale that these campaigns had their impact.

However, many of these innovations came about, not as a result of military efforts, but of civil aviation. In a period when government expenditure on the military was severely curtailed – certainly until the mid-1930s – many of the most significant advances were the result of private funding and the development of airlines and air-mail routes. Germany in particular, despite restrictions imposed by Versailles, worked hard to build a civil aviation industry to maintain some form of military aero-industry in the post- war years. With the aero-industries suffering from post-war contraction and the likelihood of military investment almost non-existent, the survival of aviation rested with other fields of development. The end of the Great War yielded a considerable surplus of material, and many of the first airlines relied heavily on ex-military aircraft, such as Breguet 14s and De Havilland DH4s, but as safety measures and controls were introduced and as the ex-military aircraft began to reach the end of their
