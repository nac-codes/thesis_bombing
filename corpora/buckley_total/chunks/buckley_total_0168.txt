relied heavily on ex-military aircraft, such as Breguet 14s and De Havilland DH4s, but as safety measures and controls were introduced and as the ex-military aircraft began to reach the end of their serviceable lives, so new and more specialized aircraft began to be introduced. The first airlines were set up in the immediate aftermath of the Great War linking many of Europe’s major cities. The ex-military connection was illustrated by the French Farman Company beginning operations between Paris and London with converted Goliath bombers, and many other early airlines were similarly built on the backs of military designs, that at times were less than ideal for their purpose. The Dutch airline company KLM was set up in 1919 as was Britain’s Imperial Airways and a whole host of other more ephemeral companies came and went during the first few years.23 International rivalry, especially between imperial powers, grew fierce and notions ofnational prestige often led to significant government involvement. 24 Routes were developed across the globe and as competition grew fiercer and operating laws and practices became more stringent, the strongest airlines with the best services survived, while those unable to raise new capital or meet the requirements fell by the wayside. In Europe, the German civil aviation industry, backed by the Weimar government in an attempt to compensate for the lack of a military air arm, prospered greatly and by 1927 German airlines covered greater distances with more passengers than their British, French and Italian competitors combined.25 By 1930, many of today’s current airlines had become established: KLM was flying to the East Indies; Air France to Indochina and Africa; Lufthansa across Europe and the USSR; Pan-American across the Pacific, the Atlantic and South America; and  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 119 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 108Imperial Airways throughout the British Empire.
