efficiency, speed and performance dictated that airlines had to offer more to stay profitable. Many features later to be crucial to the development of military air power in the late-1930s were developed bycivil aviation: cantilever wings (i.e. without rigging and struts); metal based construction; retractable undercarriages; navigation equipment; pressurized cabins – to name but a few. The design philosophy of the aircraft that emerged, such as the Junkers G-23 andthe Fokker F .VIIa, was to have a direct influence on military aircraft design and development in the build up to war. 28 In addition to the advances made in aviation technology, thanks to the civil sector, innovation came as a result of the variety of air races and contests much in evidence in the 1920s and early 1930s. The most famous of these were the Gordon Bennett Trophy and the Schneider Trophy, the latter being a competition for aerial speedracing which was eventually awarded to Supermarines of Britain after being won for the third successive time in 1931. The winning design was the direct forerunner of the Spitfire fighter of World War II. Many other competitions were held, testing aircraft distance and altitude endurance, with much of the development experience feeding  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 120 --- GLOBAL AIR POWER, 1918–39 109Table 5.1 – Average fighter performance, 1915–55 into civil and military designs at a later date. The record-breaking tests and competitions of the interwar era pushed the limits of aviation still further. In 1920 the USA held the altitude endurance record at 33,000 feet, increased it to 43,000 by 1930 and surrendered it to Italy in 1938 at 56,000. T o coincide with these advances came cold-weathertechnology, pressure suits, oxygen systems, pressurized cabins and so forth. All of thesecontributed to fighter, photographic reconnaissance, and high-altitude bombingtechnology in World War II. 29 The period of the mid-to-late 1930s saw a remarkable acceleration i
