d so forth. All of thesecontributed to fighter, photographic reconnaissance, and high-altitude bombingtechnology in World War II. 29 The period of the mid-to-late 1930s saw a remarkable acceleration in aviation technology as the results of the design work of the 1920s began to come to fruition.The wooden based bi-plane models which had become established in air forcesaround the world as a result of the Great War began to disappear to be replaced by all-metal cantilever-wing monoplanes with high-performance engines and dramaticallyimproved navigation and flight control systems. The basic fighter of early 1930s vintagewas little removed from its World War I predecessor in terms of basic design and armament. Between 1918 and 1935 engines had improved from around 225 hp giving  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 121 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 110Table 5.2 – Average bomber performance, 1915–55 speeds of 125 mph, to 500 hp producing speeds in excess of 200 mph. Y et within three years the Messerschmitt Bf109 and the Supermarine Spitfire had horsepower of over 1,000, speeds measured at around 350 mph, significantly increased operating ranges and, perhaps most importantly, between three and four times the armament of the older bi-plane fighters.30 The dramatic improvements in aviation design and technology from the mid-1930s onwards helped to create, in the era of the Second World War (from 1935 to 1950), a period in which air forces were technologically advanced enough to make a telling contribution to the war effort, but not so advanced that the aero-industries could not mass-produce in vast quantities. As Richard Overy has stated, a war fought five years sooner would have resembled the limited air combat of the First World War; a war fought ten years later would have produced aircraft that were so technically complex and expensive that “mass-production” air power would have been almost impossible.31 Nevertheless, the air power demands being made of economies
