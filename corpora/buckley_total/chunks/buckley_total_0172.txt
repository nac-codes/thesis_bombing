have produced aircraft that were so technically complex and expensive that “mass-production” air power would have been almost impossible.31 Nevertheless, the air power demands being made of economies after the technological advances of the mid-1930s were still sufficient to drain between 40 and 50 per cent of war production during World War II.32  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 122 --- GLOBAL AIR POWER, 1918–39 111Rearmament – air power and strategy By the early 1930s, it was becoming clear that the world situation was deteriorating. Both in Europe with the advent of Hitler and in the Far East with the increasingbelligerency of Imperial Japan, international security was again in jeopardy. The failureof a variety of arms elimination and reduction talks and the effective disintegration ofthe League of Nations combined to create a world order quite different to that of the1920s. The threat of war, while not immediate, was increasing and in order to confront this new situation the major powers began rearmament programmes, abandoning the retrenchment of the 1920s. Air power was to play a significant role not only in shaping and determining rearmament policy but also in developing national strategies. In Britain and Germanythe dominance of strategic air power was considerable, although there were significantdifferences in the approaches of the two powers, approaches which were to become increasingly divergent as the decade progressed. Both states, but especially Britain, were to place great faith in the political and diplomatic power of the bomber – faiththat was quite out of proportion to the weapon’s real capability. However, this was thekey to the place of the massed bombing force in strategic planning. It was not whatit could achieve, but what it appeared to be capable of. It was the beginning ofdeterrent theory being a basis of national strategy, a trend that was to come to fruition in the nuclear era. The influence of bombing on strategic planning was clear b
