eling was mutual and, in any case, the rise of Nazi Germany, French insecurity and the generally deteriorating international situation swept away the likelihood of any air disarmament agreement succeeding. The second response, that of air deterrence, although in the short term damagingly expensive to economies recovering from the 1929 financial crash, and in the medium term inadequate as a means of containing German aggression, ultimately laid the foundations for Allied survival in World War II by creating a significant and sound air power base. Indeed, if the Allies had not adopted deterrence and rearmament as a means of dealing with Hitler in 1933, the consequences could well have been catastrophic once the Second World War had broken out.36 Germany also subscribed to the deterrent effect of air power, although for different reasons to Britain. In the early stages of rearmament, there was considerable fear of  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 124 --- GLOBAL AIR POWER, 1918–39 113French or Polish invasion should it become obvious that Germany was intent on a programme of military rebuilding. Erhard Milch, the Secretary of State of the RLM (State Air Ministry), requested a new study of Germany’s air power needs in the wakeof Hitler’s accession to power. Dr Robert Knauss, a future commander at the Air WarAcademy, offered a deterrent plan based very much on the theories of strategic bombingas a supposedly cost-effective means of providing Germany with a viable defence.Aerial defence was not practical, Knauss argued, and only a large fleet of bombers would provide a true deterrent effect as all states feared massed aerial bombing. 37 The plan was initially accepted by Hitler and Goering and a bold programme of expansionwas initiated. However, although support persisted for strategic bombing in Germany, economic practicality and strategic necessity precluded the creation of a strategic bombing force.The German aero-industry and the economic resources available did n
