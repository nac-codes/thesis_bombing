for strategic bombing in Germany, economic practicality and strategic necessity precluded the creation of a strategic bombing force.The German aero-industry and the economic resources available did not allow for a major heavy-bomber construction programme, and more importantly, such a plan did not fit with developing national strategy. Air deterrence diminished the prospects ofwar, while the Nazi state was ultimately determined to change the face of Europe,through force if necessary. The two concepts clearly did not work together, and by1936 the more broadly based Wever doctrine of air power, which emphasized theconcentrated use of air forces on an operational and campaign level to support ground offensives, had been more or less adopted. 38 Moreover, the experience of German air forces in Spain during the Civil War further underpinned the contentions of the Wehrmacht,  and indeed many within the Luftwaffe,  that massed bombing was not the decisive factor the air power advocates claimed it to be. Nevertheless, the diplomatic and political power of strategic bombingand its effect on Britain in particular was understood by the German government and used in the strategic and diplomatic decision making process. Ultimately, however, deterrence relies on credibility, both in a technical and a political sense. First, a deterrent must be considered technically practical and viable by all sidesand this was not the case in the interwar era. Many air power advocates believed airpower could act in the apocalyptic manner envisaged, but many did not and certainlyif doubt persisted to any degree in the minds of policy makers then the deterrent was undermined. The deterrent also had to be backed up with a credible diplomatic policy that emphasized the willingness of the “deterrers” to use their air weapon if necessary.Although Germany clearly had an aggressive foreign policy and was apparently willing to use force, the Western Allies did not paint themselves in the same way.
