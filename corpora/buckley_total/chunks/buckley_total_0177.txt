use their air weapon if necessary.Although Germany clearly had an aggressive foreign policy and was apparently willing to use force, the Western Allies did not paint themselves in the same way. The policy  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 125 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 114of appeasement totally undermined the deterrent effect that the RAF’s bomber fleet might have had. The repeated willingness of the British to compromise in the face ofGerman aggression proved two things: first, that they were unwilling to use theirbomber force because they were fearful of going to war, or secondly, that they did notbelieve that their bomber fleet was effective as a weapon of war and therefore couldnot risk calling Hitler’s bluff. 39 In either case, the deterrent effect of strategic bombing was compromised. The theory of deterrence had run ahead of technological capability,and the latter was not able to catch up until the nuclear age. 40 Nevertheless, the deterrent effect of air power was to play a significant role in shaping air and nationalstrategic policies in the age of rearmament. Munich stands out as the most obvious example of air power, or more pointedly the fear of air power, influencing foreign policy. Allied rearmament was barely underwayby 1938, while the perception of German air power was one of fear and intimidation.Whatever the realities of German air strength, or indeed the true capabilities of aerialbombing in the late 1930s, the apparent helplessness of the British and French in theface of a Luftwaffe  “knockout blow”, undermined the resolve of Chamberlain and Daladier to stand firm. Both the British Chiefs of Staff and the French Chief of AirForce General Staff argued that an air war in 1938 would be disastrous. They neededmore time to deal with the larger numbers of aircraft required and with thetechnological revolution which had rendered large parts of the world’s air fleetsobsolete. 41 The French air force considered that 80 per cent of its 1,35
