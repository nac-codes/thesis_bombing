rger numbers of aircraft required and with thetechnological revolution which had rendered large parts of the world’s air fleetsobsolete. 41 The French air force considered that 80 per cent of its 1,350 aircraft was inadequate for a modern war in 1938, while the RAF had only 100 Hawker Hurricanesand 3 Supermarine Spitfires to meet the German air threat, a force considered totallyinadequate. It would be wrong to argue that perceived air power inferiority was thedeciding factor in the adoption of appeasement at Munich, but it was certainly acontributing factor. As President Roosevelt’s ambassador in Paris reported after Munich,“If you have enough airplanes you don’t have to go to Berchtesgaden”. 42 Air rearmament – building for war With the slow but inexorable breakdown of the international scene, and with thefailure of attempts to eliminate bombers, so the pressure grew for military rearmamenton a scale unknown for 20 years. The expansion of air forces, be it for deterrent purposes or otherwise was shaped and defined by a number of influences which  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 126 --- GLOBAL AIR POWER, 1918–39 115brought about the types and nature of air forces which fought the early stages of the Second World War. The place of air power in national strategy was quite naturally crucial to the level of development and expenditure on air power in respective nations. Establishing likely threats and the required counter-measures necessary, or indeed in identifying long- term goals and building air power resources to meet such aims, were all part of the difficult process of aerial rearmament. Germany sought a broadly based and comprehensive military programme into which air power fitted at both diplomatic and military levels – the former to provide a threat to intimidate opponents, the latter to support the possible land based conflict. Britain, with limited financial resources, was desperate to avoid another continental commitment on the scale of World War I and
