ght have been considered the correct path of aerial development. However, a crucially important influence on air power rearmament was the ability of states to build what was eventually decided upon. The aero-industries of the early- to-mid-1930s were in no fit state to meet the ever increasing demands of military expansion. Only the USSR had been embarked upon a programme of aerial expansion since the 1920s. All the other states had seen drastic reductions throughout the period,  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 127 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 116and Germany, despite the efforts of the Reichswehr  to hide its air power base in the USSR and amongst the civil aviation industry, had to build its military aero-industry virtually from scratch. Aircraft, especially modern military aircraft, were expensive and complex pieces of kit and the resources needed to produce them en masse  were for the most part lacking. Quite simply, the aero-industries were unable to deliver what their governments wanted in anything like the quantities desired. Both the British and German air expansion programmes hit snags and production always lagged behind orders and, with the pressure of the growing air arms race that developed from 1935 onwards, the failings of industry were received in states of near panic.43 The effects of the arms race were at times quite marked and, in the long-term, of considerable significance. The increasing pressure to build vast numbers of bombers to maintain huge air fleets for essentially political and diplomatic reasons, especially when Britain and to a lesser degree Germany were subscribing to notions of deterrence, created “shop window” air forces with little in the way of substantial reserves. By the late 1930s concern was growing in British circles that the RAF was merely a facade with little depth and in Germany, likewise, there was concern that the Luftwaffe  had been swollen for purposes of deterrence by the continued construction of aircraft
