that the RAF was merely a facade with little depth and in Germany, likewise, there was concern that the Luftwaffe  had been swollen for purposes of deterrence by the continued construction of aircraft totally unsuited to front-line operations.44 The problem of estimating the opposition’s true air strength remained a considerable problem throughout the air arms race. Curiously, German intelligence persistentlyunderestimated the strength of the British aero-industry and its output, while the Allies overestimated the capacity of the German aviation industry. In Britain this was in a part because of the excessive concern over bombing and the public statements of politicians such as Churchill, who were attempting to turn British attention towards the threat of German expansion. In reality, German air strength was based on large numbers of training and ex-civil transport aircraft and overall aircraft production in Germany was never as high as the British believed. Conversely, German military intelligence gathering proved inadequate, at times believing British aircraft production to have reached only a third of its actual output. 45 Arguably, the most significant impact on the air arms race occurred with the rapid advances made in aviation technology from the mid-1930s onwards. The technical leap, especially in high-performance monoplane fighters, shifted the balance of air power considerably. The bomber began to be viewed as being vulnerable and in consequence the British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin’s claim that “the bomber will always get through” no longer seemed so certain.46 While the advocates of strategic bombing in the RAF and in the US Army Air Corps still believed in the strength of the bomber fleet, others began to question the whole validity of the strategy.
