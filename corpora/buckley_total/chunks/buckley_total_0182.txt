Moreover, with advances being made in earlywarning radio direction finding equipment, most notably in Britain from 1935 onwards,the probability emerged that a bombing offensive could be defeated. The British government, never convinced by the bomber as a means of waging war in the first place, began a significant shift in policy in 1937. It was clear that the deterrent effect of their bomber fleet was negligible, as Hitler was still pursuing aggressive foreign policies. Y et it was still costing the British government a great deal of money,more than the National Government was willing to pay. In 1937, Sir Thomas Inskipwas appointed Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence and he effectively abandonedthe previous policy of threatening Germany with a large RAF bomber force. Heargued that the role of the RAF was to defend British airspace, not to bomb Germany into submission, although that role may have value should a war develop. 47 Essentially, British foreign policy, in conjunction with the French, was defensively oriented. Bothwestern European powers expected any future war with Germany to be a refight ofthe Great War and thus they should fight to their strengths. They recognized that theirown initial military strength was weak compared with Germany, but they also believedthat the Nazi state was economically vulnerable and thus could be undermined by a blockade as it had been in 1914–18. Anglo-French strategic planning called for a defensive war, to throw up a wall behind which the Allies could capitalize on theireconomic superiority and defeat Germany in a long haul war. The French army andthe Maginot Line would occupy the Wehrmacht,  while the RAF would keep the Luftwaffe  away from th
