uld capitalize on theireconomic superiority and defeat Germany in a long haul war. The French army andthe Maginot Line would occupy the Wehrmacht,  while the RAF would keep the Luftwaffe  away from the British Isles. It can be seen that the emphasis in British air power policy had altered towards air defence, now considered feasible thanks to early warning radar, high-speed monoplane fighters and properly organized civil defence. Inskip and the British government rejectedthe claims of the RAF that there was no viable defence to aerial bombardment, butquite apart from the fact that Britain could no longer afford to continue the air armsrace with Germany, the switch to air defence fitted more naturally into British foreignpolicy. The high point of the bomber based expansion plans called for the creation of a 90 squadron fleet with 1,659 bombers, but in the wake of Inskip’s report this was reducedto 77 and 1,360 respectively, while fighter strength was to be increased from 476 to 532. 48 The importance of air power and in particular air defence to British planning was emphasized during the Munich crisis when the Chiefs of Staff informed  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 129 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 118Chamberlain that the British air forces were simply not ready for war and nor would they be in a fit state until mid-1939 at the earliest.49 On the outbreak of war, British air power was still in a state of flux, with increasing and highly sophisticated air defence forces, principally based around the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire, at least equal if not superior to anything the Luftwaffe  could deploy. However, most other elements of the RAF were equipped with obsolete or unsuitable aircraft. Indeed, RAF Bomber Command was to suffer badly in the early stages of the war, having to fight with aircraft unfit for the grand designs of its senior officers. Britain’s most notable achievement in the years leading up to World War II was the transformat
