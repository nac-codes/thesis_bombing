te Secretary at the Air Ministry. Milch, an able andwell-connected, if abrasive organizer, was able to keep German aircraft productionroughly on target until the major expansion schemes of the late 1930s emerged. Bythis time, however, he had been sidelined by Goering’s appointment of Ernst Udet asT echnical Director of the Luftwaffe.  Udet was a colourful and energetic character, but his disruptive input merely served to fragment control and direction in aircraft procurement. His fascination with dive-bombing led to the redesign of the Junkers Ju88 which increased its weight from seven to twelve tons, resulted in a decrease inspeed from 500 kmh to 300 kmh, and delayed production for a year. 55 Hitler’s scheme to expand the Luftwaffe  five-fold after 1938 was completely unrealistic and would have taken the equivalent of the entire German defence budget from 1933–9, 85 per cent of the world’s aviation fuel production and bankrupted the nation.56 Nevertheless, in spite of the reality, the future Luftwaffe  Chief of Staff, Hans Jeschonnek, argued that Hitler should be supported in his plan as its intention wassound, if not entirely practical 57 Whereas production targets had been met until 1936, after that date expansion stagnated and central direction evaporated, thanks to theinterference of Udet, Wever’s death ( Luftwaffe  Chief of Staff), Goering’s empire building and sloth and the simple economic constraints of the German aero-industry. Much of this was hidden both from the outside world and from Hitler who was constantly fed what he wanted to know by Goering. Under the pressures of war, the inherent flawsand failings in the German aircraft procurement and production process were eventually to lead to the collapse of German air power in the face of concerted Allied attack.
