In stark contrast, Soviet rearmament policies prior to the German invasion in June 1941 laid the foundations for rapid growth in the VVS (Soviet Air Force) after theinvasion ( Operation Barbarossa ), but left it open to the initial German onslaught. The five-year plans and the emphasis on heavy industrial expansion in the 1930s served to put the VVS in a strong position by the end of the decade. Modern aircraft had been introduced, such as the I-15 and I-16 fighters and the SB-2 and TB-3 bombers, andthe total frontline strength of the VVS (some 2,500 aircraft in 1937) dwarfed that ofother powers. 58 Soviet fighters were a match for anything other than the latest German designs as indicated by the experiences of the Spanish Civil War. It was clear that as aresult of the five-year plans, deficiencies in aircraft and aero-engine design as well as production techniques had for the most part been eliminated. The crisis in the VVS, as with the rest of the Soviet military, occurred as a result of the purges of the late 1930s, a process in which the officers and leaders of the VVSsuffered disproportionately. Alksnis, commander of the VVS since 1931, along withKhripin, his deputy, were eliminated in 1937 and many other leading airmen wentwith them. Around 75 per cent of the VVS’s senior officers were victims of the purges. In addition, the aero-industry also suffered, with research organizations and design bureaux also coming under scrutiny. 59 The impact of the purges fused with a major reorganization of the VVS as a result of the poor showing in the Winter War against Finland in 1939–40. This was stillunderway when Germany invaded. Nevertheless, with a strength of some 10,000aircraft in June 1941, the
