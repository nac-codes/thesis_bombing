ts learned a great deal, the Italians were protected from their own inadequacies by German efficiency and know-how and by the failings of the aircrew they faced.Thus, the fact that they were confronted by technically superior aircraft did not filterthrough to the upper echelons of the Italian armed forces. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, in the 1920s the Italians split their aircraft procurement procedures into two distinct political and technical camps. The former, the Direzione Generale del Genio e delle Costruzioni Aeronautiche  (DGCA), held the final say on aircraft procurement but repeatedly ignored the advice of the Direzione Superiore Studi Esperienze  (DSSE), where the scientific and technical know-how was lodged. Consequently, when the DSSE wanted to purchase Caproni RE2000, F5 and Ca 165aircraft in 1938, the DGCA ignored them and ordered Macchi Castoldi MC 200 andFiat G50 and CR42 models. All of the latter types were to be considered inadequate and obsolete during the Second World War. When war came to Italy in 1940, the RA was totally unprepared, equipped as it was with outdated arms and with no overallcentral doctrine of operations. Notably, even the newer monoplane fighters beingintroduced were outclassed by their opponents. 60 Japanese air power, in effect protected from the concerns of overseas bombing, and with considerable learning experience gained from the many conflicts undertaken by the Imperial Japanese forces in the 1930s, was able to develop a fairly high combat effectiveness and proficiency â€“ as the Western Allies were to discover in 1941/2. Designsof aircraft and training were well established, and in the latter case considerably superiorto their western counterparts. Of the major air powers of World War II, Japan developedlast and it was not until after the First World War, with French and British help, that theImperial Japanese air forces began to emerge. Steady increases in aircraft production and development continued throughout
