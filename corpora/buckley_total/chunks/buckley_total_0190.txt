s not until after the First World War, with French and British help, that theImperial Japanese air forces began to emerge. Steady increases in aircraft production and development continued throughout the turbulent 1930s (445 in 1930 to 5,000 in 1941) and the experiences of actions against Chinese and Soviet forces in particular proved invaluable. The aero-industry in Japan, however, followed a similar pattern to that found in the other Axis powers. Co-operation between the navy and the army was already slight  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 133 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 122and fierce competition continued to foul relations throughout the war. This spilled over into aircraft procurement and production and there was no attempt to co- ordinate aircraft development between either services, or indeed between the major manufacturers (Mitsubishi, Nakajima and Kawasaki). With an economic base already weak and underdeveloped in comparison with the US, this lack of homogeneity and single-mindedness in pulling the aero-industry together compounded with no overall direction and control in the aircraft development and production process to fragment the sector and to dissipate effort, with serious consequences in World War II.61 Moreover, the harsh and brutal training programme used by the Japanese for pilot and aircrew training, the navy especially, sowed the seeds for rapid decline once the war with the West had broken out. No strength in depth was created and once the admittedly superb front-line aircrew had been lost in the battles of 1942 the Japanese were completely unable to rebuild and expand their air forces. Although the USA was the last of the major belligerents of World War II to become embroiled in war, the foundations of the rapid growth in aircraft production which dwarfed the output of all other nations after 1940, had already been layed. The mass- industrial base, and more importantly its use of technological innovation to create a sophisticated
