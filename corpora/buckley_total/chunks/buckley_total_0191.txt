oduction which dwarfed the output of all other nations after 1940, had already been layed. The mass- industrial base, and more importantly its use of technological innovation to create a sophisticated and responsive economy gave the US aero-industry a major advantage over its contemporaries and was the cornerstone of Allied air power superiority during World War II. As the world situation deteriorated from the mid-1930s onwards, theadministration began a series of rearmament programmes to bolster US defence. Research establishments set up to guide and administer aviation science switched the emphasis of their work to applied military research and development. 62 In the aftermath of the Munich crisis and the importance of air power in the strategic bargaining that had gone on, the Roosevelt government began the process which would see a whole new generation of aircraft emerge just as the USA went to war in 1941. The US Army Air Corps saw a 90 per cent officer and 140 per cent enlisted men personnel expansion, while a target of 5,500 aircraft was set to be achieved as soon as was practicable.63 Already being equipped with the famous Boeing B-17 heavy-bomber, the procurement of new modern aircraft types such as the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, Curtiss P-40, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, Consolidated B-24 Liberator and the Douglas A-20 Havoc demonstrated the depth of the US aero-industry and its ability to meet the demands and needs of the armed forces on an unrivalled scale. The US Navy also saw the expansion of its naval air arm in the mid-to-late 1930s, with a range of new aircraft carriers being constructed, such as the Yorktown, Enterprise, Wasp and Hornet,  to add to the veteran Lexington  and Saratoga  and, prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, a major programme based around the Essex class of carrier had already  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 134 --- GLOBAL AIR POWER, 1918â€“39 123been initiated. A congressional bill of 1935 called for a naval air reserve of 6,000
