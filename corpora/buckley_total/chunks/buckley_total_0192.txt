A congressional bill of 1935 called for a naval air reserve of 6,000 pilots to support the regular naval aircrew, and priority was being given to naval aircraft development to close the gap on Japanese models.64 Nevertheless, on the outbreak of war, of the US Navy’s front-line carrier aircraft, only the Douglas Dauntless dive- bomber could be considered acceptable. The massive plans for the expansion of US air power were still to a large extent beyond the capability of the US aero-industry, certainly in peacetime, but after Pearl Harbor the capacity of the US economy, and its modern, sophisticated approach to mass-production was to pay dividends. Conclusions Between 1918 and 1939 the role of air power in world affairs expanded considerably, influencing national strategies and foreign policies alike, especially in the 1930s. The 1920s had witnessed the permanent foundations of air strength, in spite of the massive demobilization following the Great War. The roots of air power were laid by carefully considered service policies and equally by the emergence of civil aviation. This non- military market was the force behind technological advancement during the 1920s and early 1930s as military forces, in the West at least, endured the so-called “locust years”. Much of what was to shape aircraft development in the mid-1930s dated back to the development of civil aviation in the preceding years. By the 1930s, as war loomed again, the importance of air power to strategic thinking was marked, and on occasion, perceived technical capability drove policy in certain directions. The “shadow of the bomber” was a major influence in the formulation of state policy, particularly in Britain and to a lesser degree in Germany, but also across much of the industrial world. At Munich, deficiencies in air power strength played an important part in shaping Briti
