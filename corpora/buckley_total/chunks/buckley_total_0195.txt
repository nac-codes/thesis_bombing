he foundations of the later massive expansion of the aero-industries began. Aircraft production and development was a microcosm of the war as a whole. TheGermans, at a higher state of front-line military readiness in 1939, made their advantagestell, sweeping away inferior powers with bold and risky offensives against which therearming and ill-prepared British and French could not react quickly enough. However,those that survived such as Britain and the USSR, and those beyond the range of direct German aggression, such as the USA, were able to muster their superior economic strengths and go over to the offensive. While Germany initially proved unwilling andlatterly unable to expand its air forces sufficiently, if at all, their opponents, with long-term air expansion and re-equipment programmes already underway, surged ahead ofthe Nazi state and its diminishing and haemorrhaging air power strength. Confrontedwith a series of punishing air offensives, over Germany itself, over the Atlantic, and finally in support of the massive land forces which from late 1942 onwards began the inexorable advance on the Nazi state, German strength and power was crushed. Land warfare – blitzkrieg It is all too often assumed that German air power in World War II was largely deployedin close support of the army, contributing considerably to the success of the armouredoffensives which epitomized blitzkrieg. 1 However, as has already been indicated, the Luftwaffe  was a broadly based force with no constricting central doctrine, other than that its resources should be used generally to support national strategy. Dabblings with strategic bombing, which many in the Luftwaffe  itself continued to support, persisted, although limited resources, the lessons of the Spanish Civil War and the demands ofwar reduced such efforts to the periphery. Nevertheless, in the 1939–41 period, thetechnical and doctrinal efficiency of the Luftwaffe  was such that it was far more capable of carrying out a strategi
