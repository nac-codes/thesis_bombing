war reduced such efforts to the periphery. Nevertheless, in the 1939–41 period, thetechnical and doctrinal efficiency of the Luftwaffe  was such that it was far more capable of carrying out a strategic bombing campaign than the British. 2  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 138 --- THE WAR IN EUROPE, 1939–45 127The flexibility of German air power was, in the early stages of the war, its very strength and, paradoxically from 1941 onwards, a fundamental weakness. While theArmee de l’Air,  and to a lesser extent the Soviet VVS, were tied to close support of the army, the Luftwaffe  was able to deploy its air resources in more general “operational” level support of the Wehrmacht,  shifting from air superiority efforts to medium-range interdiction of enemy rear zones, then to psychological city bombing raids, and finallyto close air-support duties. The disparate and multi-purpose Luftwaffe  was well suited to such activities, and the technological advantage it held in operational aircraft andtraining, as well as superior numbers, were the cornerstones of early success. Far from being the dedicated spearhead of the panzers, less than 15 per cent of the Luftwaffe  was designed as a close support force for the army in 1939, 3 and the level of importance given to aerial bombing of cities, even in an operational sense, was illustratedby plans for the heavy bombing of Warsaw during the Polish campaign of September1939, plans only abandoned due to the inclement weather. 4 However, the Luftwaffe carried out a general campaign of mostly indirect, but also close and direct air supportof the army with considerable success, even though much still had to be learnt. Such was the level of improvization in the Luftwaffe ’s support of the Wehrmacht  that a whole host of co-ordination, liaison and communication problems emerged that had to besolved as the Polish campaign progressed and it was testament to the efficiency of theGerman military that such glitches were relatively easily neg
