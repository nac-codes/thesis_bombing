son and communication problems emerged that had to besolved as the Polish campaign progressed and it was testament to the efficiency of theGerman military that such glitches were relatively easily negotiated. In part, this successwas down to the work of Generalmajor Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen, a veteranof the Spanish Civil War, in establishing lines of communication between ground units and air forces. For much of the war, Richthofen’s Fliegerkorps VIII acted as the primary close air support force and found itself moved from sector to sector as required. 5 Nevertheless, response times between calls for close air support and air attack stillstood at some hours. 6 The early stages of the air campaign were marked by the Luftwaffe ’s efforts to gain air superiority over the Poles, considered essential in pre-war planning. The Polish air force could only muster some 800 aircraft, of which just 463 were frontline types, to meet the Luftwaffe ’s near 2,000 aeroplanes.7 Moreover, the German aircraft were predominantly modern whilst the Polish types were obsolete, best illustrated by thedisparity between the PZL P-IIc and the Messerschmitt Bf109 air superiority fighters(over 100 mph difference in top speeds). However, contrary to popular belief (fuelledby the claims of the Germans themselves 8) the Pohsh air force was not destroyed on the ground during early German bombing raids and kept on fighting until shot out of the sky by superior German fighters and highly effective ground based anti-aircraft  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 139 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 128firepower.9 By September 17, over two weeks into the war, having lost over 75 per cent of its frontline force, the Polish air force withdrew to Romania giving total air supremacy to the Luftwaffe.10 Thus, the Polish air force was never able to intervene in any serious manner with the efforts of the German ground forces, while the Luftwaffe  was able to conduct highly effective army support ope
