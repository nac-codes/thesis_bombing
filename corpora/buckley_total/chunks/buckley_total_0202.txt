ent. 15) The attempt to spearhead the invasion of the British Isles with the Luftwaffe  was a plan that had already been discussed and rejected by the German Air Ministry in 1939.16 Nevertheless, in view of the overwhelming naval superiority of the British, control of the air was considered essential. In the same way that the Luftwaffe  conducted any other campaign, the suppression of the enemy air force was the first step to victory. Unfortunately, the Luftwaffe  was confronted by a number of significant problems on a scale it had not yet encountered and arguably the lack of a dedicated purpose was in part to be its undoing. The Luftwaffe  failed for a number of reasons, many indicative of the German air force’s inherent shortcomings. A series of tactical failings only partly exposed by the Polish, Scandinavian and French campaigns were ruthlessly exposed during the Battle of Britain, emphasizing that the Luftwaffe,  although broadly capable, was not actually particularly proficient at anything. Its mainstay air superiority fighter, the Bf109, had too limited a radius of operations to act effectively over the British Isles, thus exposing the German bomber fleet to the RAF’s high performance fighters, against which theywere hopelessly vulnerable. Notably, the campaign over Britain was the first time the Luftwaffe  had encountered a properly organized air defence system specifically designed to meet the challenge of an air war. Crucially, the Luftwaffe  had, in no particular way, been developed to conduct such a focused offensive. In the intelligence gathering war the Germans continued to follow their pre-war predilection for underestimating their enemies’ resources and capabilities.
