rom withdrawing its fighters north, out of range of the Luftwaffe,  and conserving its resources for countering the attempted German invasion. With German naval and invasion forces at a premium,to risk landings with the threat of RAF fighters screening the Royal Navy from the Luftwaffe  as it attacked the German fleet was probably too much of a gamble, even for Hitler. The problem of forcing an enemy air force to come out and fight and thusexpose itself to attrition was one faced by the Allies in 1942 and 1943. Until USbombers forced the Luftwaffe ’s hand and made it fight for control of the airspace over Germany, there was no real way of crippling German air power in a drawn out“imposed” attritional struggle. 18 In 1943 the Allies had the capacity and wherewithal to deal with the situation; in 1940 the Luftwaffe  did not. Ultimately, the Luftwaffe  was simply not up to dealing with the problem of Britain in 1940 and the losses inflictedby the RAF at the crucial times of the battle were enough to break the nerve ofGoering and Kesselring, who were all too aware of their air force’s true incapacity to withstand much pain.

The Luftwaffe  was afforded just enough time before the launching of Operation Barbarossa  in June 1941 to make good the losses suffered over the British Isles and in France. However, the quality of its pilots and aircrew was already declining as the experienced personnel of Spain, Poland, Scandinavia and France had been whittled away by the very high rates of attrition endured even by victorious air forces. Clearly, the Luftwaffe which prepared for the invasion of the USSR was not the force it had once been.19 In spite of t
