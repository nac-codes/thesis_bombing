n, for the VVS (the Red Air Force) had some 8,000–10,000 aircraft in all in June 1941 with around 6,000 initially deployed in Europe. Once again the German plan adopted the tried and tested methods, beginning with a major attack on the VVS on 22 June. Despite warnings, the Soviet armed forces were surprised and some 1,200 VVS aircraft were eliminated by the Luftwaffe  in the first eight-and-a-half hours of operations, 1,800 by the end of the first day, 4,000 after a week’s fighting, and by September a staggering 7,500 VVS aircraft had been accounted for. 21 The rout of the VVS mirrored the near collapse of the Red Army as a whole, but despite the spectacular success of the  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 144 --- THE WAR IN EUROPE, 1939–45 133German armed forces they were unable to secure the total victory they required. The VVS was able to survive and, in contrast, serious shortcomings in the Luftwaffe ’s capabilities were starting to become all too apparent. The most basic problem, and one largely glossed over in the planning of Operation Barbarossa,  was the sheer scale and size of operations that the Luftwaffe  was being called upon to perform. Although only a crude indicator, the aircraft per square mile ratio on the Eastern Front in 1941 was around 2, whereas in the West it had been between 10 and 15.22 Quite simply, there was physically only so much the Luftwaffe  could achieve as the campaign wore on into the autumn and winter, constrained as it was by the vicissitudes of the Russian climate and, importantly, by the burgeoning demands of the Wehrmacht ’s ground offensives. Moreover, the logistical crisis was already a cause for serious concern. Supply lines stretched back for hundreds of miles, and the active units were having to operate from dirt tracks and muddy fields. Operational ready rates in front-line units slipped to just 40 per cent by the time of the Moscow offensive, and the sortie rate fell by almost 50 per cent.23 In previous campaigns dir
