d muddy fields. Operational ready rates in front-line units slipped to just 40 per cent by the time of the Moscow offensive, and the sortie rate fell by almost 50 per cent.23 In previous campaigns direct close support operations for the army had taken up some 25 per cent of the Luftwaffe ’s sortie effort. In the Russian offensive this figure hovered around 60 per cent, a trend not welcomed by Goering’s staff in view of the excessively high attritional rates suffered on such duties.24 The significance of this shift in combat effort was that less offensive action could be taken against the VVS directly, or againstoperational, rather than tactical, level targets. Indeed, sophisticated plans for a strategic bombing campaign against Soviet industry had to be abandoned because resources were being diverted to more pressing duties. 25 The Luftwaffe  was clearly successful in carrying out this expanded role, but its equipment was no better suited or designed for such operations. The Ju 87 Stukas and Henschel Hs 123 bi-planes were the only dedicated close support aircraft and, although they were later bolstered by the modification of Bf 109s and FW 190s into swing-role fighter-bombers, the only purposely designed ground-attack aircraft introduced by the Luftwaffe  throughout the war was the Henschel Hs 129 and this proved to be a profound disappointment. The logical outcome of having to deploy more resources to army support was the allocation of twin-engined medium bombers, such as Heinkel He 111s, Junkers Ju 88s and the rapidly obsolescing Dornier Do 17s to such duties, duties for which they were clearly ill-suited. By the end of 1941 the true extent of the task facing the German armed forces was clear. The blitzkrieg  had proven to have limitations, and now once embroiled in an exhausting attritional war the failure of German industrial and economic planning and management prior to 1941 became all too apparent.
