notable operations were carried out, particularly the Royal Navyâ€™s raid on Taranto in 1940, but for the most part even this campaign was decided by land based confrontation. However, the Battle of the Atlantic was one of the pivotal campaigns of the European theatre. On two occasions the German U-boat fleet threatened to close down theAllied shipping lanes into and out of the British Isles, first in 1940/41 and subsequently in 1942/43. The first crisis came in the second winter of the war when Commonwealth  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 147 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 136trade protection forces alone had to endeavour to keep the transatlantic supply routes open in the face of a determined submarine offensive that came very close to forcingBritain out of the war. Once the German U-boats had access to the French Atlantic ports from the summer of 1940 onwards they were able to operate much further out into the Atlantic and stretch the trade protection forces to near breaking point. The British survived the crisis by organizing and increasing their trade protection forces and one of the most significant roles was played by the aircraft of RAF Coastal Command. Long-range aircraft patrolling ahead and around merchant ship convoyswere able to force German U-boats to dive to avoid detection. Once underwater the submarines were unable to keep up with, let alone close, with Allied convoys. While the Allied aircraft lacked the ability to attack and sink U-boats, certainly until 1942/43,their deterrent effect was absolutely crucial to British survival. It did not matter how many U-boats were sunk, the Atlantic campaign was decided by how many merchant ships could be safely escorted across the Atlantic and back again. The role of air powerin gaining victory in this first serious attempt by the German U-boats to blockade Britain into surrender was crucial and is often underestimated. 28 The value of sufficient air cover was often disputed by advocates of the bom
