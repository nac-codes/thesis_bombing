first serious attempt by the German U-boats to blockade Britain into surrender was crucial and is often underestimated. 28 The value of sufficient air cover was often disputed by advocates of the bomber offensive who wanted allavailable long-range bomber aircraft used to attack Germany directly. This left Coastal Command short of the resources it needed to secure the shipping lanes. The fact that defeat in the Atlantic would in fact have meant defeat in the war as a whole curiouslyevaded the minds of those who saw no value in the redeployment of a small fraction of the Allied air forces to keep the U-boat menace at bay. 29 The second U-boat crisis to face the Allies came in 1942 and 1943, first when German submarines had free rein over the eastern seaboard of the USA prior to the Americans properly organizing their anti-submarine defences, and then latterly during the mid-Atlantic air gap fiasco. This second issue arose due to a lack of “very-long-range” Liberator aircraft being allocated to mid-Atlantic air patrols. Other shorter range aircraft simply did not have the range to cover the passage of convoys right across the Atlantic, and consequently German U-boats took to attacking Allied convoysin this so-called mid-Atlantic air gap. That it took until April/May of 1943 for this gap to be closed when the resources were available over a year before again seems mystifying, but such aircraft as were available were earmarked for the Pacific by an unhelpful USNavy, and for the bombing offensive by the RAF and the USAAF . Undoubtedly the lack of central direction for the Atlantic air forces and the determined and single- minded approach of the “bomber barons” were the root causes, but the overall strategicdirection of the Allied forces must be open to criticism.
