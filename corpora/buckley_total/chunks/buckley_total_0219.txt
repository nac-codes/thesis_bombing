ty, or more precisely, what was considered “capacity” by a slack and inefficient planning administration. 32 The willingness to accept the status quo  was in part caused by Goering’s attempts to demonstrate to Hitler that he was doing his utmost and that everything possible was being squeezed out of the German aero-industry, and partly caused by the continuingunderestimation of British aircraft production. There were no major plans for realistic expansion in the German aero-industry until the mid-war period, and by then it was much too late. Clearly, the Axis powers did not match strategic requirements witheconomic demands and by not even attempting to reach high production targets until 1942 they undoubtedly hindered their efforts. 33 Planning and administration were yet more areas where the Allies held considerable advantages and the development of an integrated approach to aircraft procurement and production was something the Germans could not match, despite considerable effort. The British created the Ministry of Aircraft Production under the tutelage ofLord Beaverbrook, the Americans had the Aircraft Production Board and the Soviets the Commissariat for Aviation directed by Kaganovich and Yakovlev, all bodies which for the most part were effective and willing to wield power as necessary.

In contrast, in Germany the central planning process was disparate, confused and severely hindered by Nazi ideology and the nature of the German state and itscorresponding parts. Essentially, Germany was a fragmented society with manycompeting interests and struggling power groups. Debate will continue as to whetherthis was deliberately engineered by Hitler in order to retain power, or as seems morelikely, that such confusion reigned
