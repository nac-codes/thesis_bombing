ere able to standardize around modern aircraft that were either in the early stages ofprocurement on the outbreak of war, or were able to improve and develop existingdesigns to a greater degree than the Germans and then mass-produce them quickly. In part this came as a result of the close integration of military and civilian personnel in the production process, a fusing which proved far smoother and easier than in Germany.Importantly, the sophisticated mass-production processes, eschewed by the Germansas capable of producing only cars and refrigerators, enabled a two way process bywhich new ideas and innovations could be introduced without fouling up productionto a detrimental level. The procurement and introduction of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine equipped Mustang in 1943 was a classic example of the responsive nature of the Allied production process. 40 The second cornerstone of Allied success lay in the field of science and technology, an area in which the Axis were slowly but surely emasculated as the war went on. Theintegration of technology and science into the air war was critical because, more thanany other arm, aircraft required protection from obsolescence to remain viable. The Allies again mobilized their scientific communities to considerable effect, indeed to a level the Germans could not match. T echnology was crucial in areas such as radar,navigation and bombing in particular, but in most aspects of the air war the need toharness scientific developments was crucial. The British were effective in getting themost out of a weaker scientific base, aided by the enthusiastic support of Churchill(through Professor Lindemann) and indeed the RAF itself, which recognized the vital nature of scientific research and development. In particular, the RAF developed operational research units in each command and these shaped the strategic bombing offensive and the Battle of the Atlantic markedly. 41 The USA started from a much stronger base, but in many ways followed
