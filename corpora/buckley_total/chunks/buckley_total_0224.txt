research, Germany was equally lax, not creating a central body until 1944, and in the organization of scientific development, effort was sporadic at best and riddled with party sycophancy. Actual design and research continued to be of a high standard but the poor co-ordination and imbalancein the relationship between state, military and science bodies resulted in dissipation and duplication of effort. 44 In contrast to the Germans, the Allies took a particularly pragmatic approach to research, emphasizing applied rather than pure research. The harnessing of scientific innovation in a functional military context was the key in the West, whereas Germany’s tradition of pure research and invention was more time consuming and restricted rapid application in the military. The contrast in these approaches resulted in short-to- medium term Allied superiority, but in long term developments in jet and rocket technologies, the advantages lay with the Germans, although they would probably have been made redundant by the inadequacies of their mass-production techniques. Ultimately, the pattern of German failings in scientific development and research mirrored the shortcomings evident in most aspects of the Axis air war effort. Whereas the Western Allies with their pragmatic, flexible and more sophisticated capitalist economies could cope with most of the demands of the air war, the German model could not. Inadequate in central organization and long term planning, prone to political interference and wracked with petty squabbling, it was as much as could probably beexpected that Speer and Milch got out of the German economy what they did.
