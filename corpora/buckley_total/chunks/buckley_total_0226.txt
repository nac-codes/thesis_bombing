g, aided the expansion of the aircraftindustry considerably. Standardization around certain rugged and dependable aircraftdesigns simplified production matters, although more advanced models were introducedfrom the mid-war onwards. Despite the chaos and privations caused by the Germaninvasion, Soviet aircraft production increased dramatically from late 1941 onwards,from 1,630 per month in 1941 to 2,907 by 1943. 46 The arrival of lend-lease aircraft from the USA aided the Soviet recovery, but too much is often made of this, for the bulk of the 14,000 deliveries came much later in the war, and only amounted to some 12 per cent of Soviet combat aircraft used in the war.47  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 157 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 146However, the increase in quantity was matched by simultaneous qualitative progression. The design bureaux expanded significantly during the months leading up to and after 22 June 1941, incorporating new designers such as Yakovlev, Lavochkin and Ilyushin to add to the long established Tupolev and Polikarpov. Obsolescent I-16 fighters weresuperseded by new Yakovlev and Lavochkin fighter variants. Early Yaks resembled French models, but by 1942/43 Yak-9 and Yak-3 models rivalled the Spitfire and Mustang in performance. The Lavochkin types did not have the same effect as theYaks but nevertheless, the La-5 and La-7 were capable air superiority fighters. Notably, the VVS mirrored the RAF and the USAAF in using fighter designs as swing-role, fighter-bomber, ground-attack aircraft. However, dedicated heavy ground-attack aircraftsuch as the Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmovik and the Petlyakov Pe-2 bombers dominated on the Eastern Front where enemy fighters were never available in enough concentration to make their deployment too costly. Notably, the famous Shturmovik was quitevulnerable to high-performance fighters, but its heavy armour gave it excellent protection against anti-aircraft gunfire. As the land offensives swung backwards and
