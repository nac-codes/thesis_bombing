VVS’s strategy, or more accurately the Red Army’s strategy, should not be criticized unduly. The scale of operations over the Eastern Front was vast, a factor  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 158 --- THE WAR IN EUROPE, 1939–45 147identified by the Luftwaffe  during and after Operation Barbarossa,  and the size of force required to mount an air supremacy campaign akin to that in the West would have been beyond even the capacity of the Soviet economy. Moreover, unlike westernarmies, which used air power to make good the deficiencies in their ground forces,and to keep casualty rates as low as possible, the Red Army was quite effective as itwas. Far from being a technically backward mass infantry army as is often perceived inthe West, the Soviet forces were a highly effective mass-firepower force, which itself, like its western counterparts, became concerned with diminishing manpower resources by 1944. 48 Air power was a major factor in the increase in effectiveness of Soviet forces from 1943 onwards especially, but they were never as dependent on it as the armies ofthe Western Allies. Land warfare – the Allied recovery in the West For the RAF and the USAAF , the importance of the Mediterranean campaign in theformulation of an effective army support air doctrine was crucial. Whereas the VVSwas thrown in at the deep end, the western air forces were able to develop their tactical air forces against much more limited opposition in North Africa and Italy, before applying the lessons en masse  in the invasion of northwest Europe in 1944. In the aftermath of their rout from the continent in 1940 the British Army and the RAF began a long debate as to the true role of air power. The RAF , with its moreindependent background, was able to maintain that air power should be used on a much broader scale than that adopted by the VVS, with the result that air–ground support operations were integrated into a broader air power strategy, which includedstrategic bombing and, from 19
