on a much broader scale than that adopted by the VVS, with the result that air–ground support operations were integrated into a broader air power strategy, which includedstrategic bombing and, from 1943 onwards, a general air supremacy campaign acrossEurope. It was in the Western Desert from 1941 onwards that Air Vice Marshal Arthur “Mary” Coningham (the sobriquet being a corruption of his New Zealand Maori roots) began the formulation of British tactical air doctrine. Coningham’s influence on this process was considerable, to such an extent that his model was adopted forthe rest of the war, and copied by the USAAF once their own tactical air commandstructures had been found wanting. British failings in co-ordinating air power withground offensives in operations up to Crusader,  General Claude Auchinleck’s major offensive of 1941, were largely resolved during the new operation thanks to a new  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 159 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 148system of air/ground co-ordination. While the ground offensive stalled, the Western Desert Air Force seized local air superiority and allowed effective air interdiction andclose air support operations to be carried out. However, Commonwealth air strength was not enough to gain control of the air, and the Luftwaffe  was still capable of contesting air superiority to such an extent that air support was not enough to save Operation Crusader  and, ultimately, Auchinleck’s job. Nevertheless, the expanding desert air force continued to improve its tactical capability,reducing response time for air support (radioed request to air strike) from Operation Crusader’ s two to three hours to Alamein’s 35 minutes. 49 In these early days, the Allies utilized the Hurricane and the US Curtiss P-40, or T omahawk as it was known in the RAF , as swing-role fighter-bombers.50 The fighter-bomber in World War II had in fact been pioneered by the Luftwaffe,  but RAF Fighter Command saw bomb equipped Hurricanes and Spitf
