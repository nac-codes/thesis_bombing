was known in the RAF , as swing-role fighter-bombers.50 The fighter-bomber in World War II had in fact been pioneered by the Luftwaffe,  but RAF Fighter Command saw bomb equipped Hurricanes and Spitfires as a means of provoking the Luftwaffe  to engage in aerial combat over France. This strategy produced only limited results, but the fighter-bomber,which was to dominate ground-support operations for the rest of the war, was nevertheless a logical progression from the air superiority campaign over Europe. 51 The fighter-bomber was an effective air superiority aircraft, quite capable of looking after itself against enemy fighters, while being rugged and fast enough to absorb lightflak damage and being too nimble to be hit by heavier anti-aircraft gunnery. TheHurricane and T omahawk were eventually superseded in 1944 by Hawker T yphoonsand Republic P-47 Thunderbolts, the latter being powered by an air-cooled engine which made it less susceptible to flak damage, probably making it the most effective swing-role fighter-bomber of the war. With a frantic air superiority battle raging formuch of the 1942–3 period the advantages of the dual-purpose fighter-bomber wereapparent. The dedicated ground-attack aircraft were less successful, being vulnerableto heavy flak and to enemy fighters which until 1944 remained a serious threat. Inmany ways, the success of the Shturmovik on the Eastern Front bucked the trend, but it survived because the density of fighter cover and flak defences was never high enough. It is difficult to imagine the VVS aeroplane surviving for long in the westerntheatre. Rommel’s final push towards Alexandria and Cairo ground to a halt for a variety of reasons but he was quick to note the value of Allied air power in Montgomery’seventual victory in North Africa. The RAF had gained effective air superiority, eventually attaining air supremacy, and Rommel’s supply lines, rear zone and ground forces were attacked constantly. He stated,  File: --- buckley_total.
