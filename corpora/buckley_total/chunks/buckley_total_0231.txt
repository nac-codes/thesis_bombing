The RAF had gained effective air superiority, eventually attaining air supremacy, and Rommel’s supply lines, rear zone and ground forces were attacked constantly. He stated,  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 160 --- THE WAR IN EUROPE, 1939–45 149The fact of British air superiority threw to the winds all the tactical rules which we had hitherto applied with such success. In every battle to come the strength of the Anglo-American air force was to be the deciding factor.52 While the RAF was finding its feet, the USAAF had to endure a similar learning curve. In April 1942 the USAAF had issued its Field Manual FM 31–35, Aviation in Support of Ground Forces.  Unfortunately it proved to be a cumbersome and ineffective model. In essence it fell into the dispersed penny-packet approach to air support which had hamstrung the French in 1940. As Hallion has stated it was “. . . the kind of system that the British Army had wanted in 1939–41, until experience in the Western Desert taught otherwise”.53 The Battle of Kasserine Pass in Tunisia in 1943 was a dog’s breakfast of an operation on the part of the US Army, and its attendant air forces. Each US “mini-air force” was distributed at corps level (too low) and thus was unable, and at times unwilling, to co-ordinate effort to gain air superiority, allowing the Luftwaffe to dominate. The Kasserine fiasco resulted in FM 31–35 being abandoned in favour of FM 100– 20, Command and Employment of Air Power,  perhaps the most clearly laid out model of army air support operations of the war. Its basic three point plan consisted: first of gaining air superiority; secondly, conducting air interdiction operations against the enemy’s rear zones to hinder reinforcement and resupply; and thirdly, attacking directly, in conjunction with ground forces, the enemy army itself.54 The Allied tactical air forces largely stuck to these principles, which Coningham had already established in the RAF , and fine tuned them over Sicily and Italy.
