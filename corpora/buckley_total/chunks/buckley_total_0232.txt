forces, the enemy army itself.54 The Allied tactical air forces largely stuck to these principles, which Coningham had already established in the RAF , and fine tuned them over Sicily and Italy. The most significant problems concerned communications, identification of friendly forces and ground–air liaison, and remedies were sought for them. Radio equipped jeeps aided rapid communication between air strikes and ground forces, and light spotter aircraft were adopted for artillery direction, a throwback to the Great War. Later these aircraft were used to control and direct close support and battlefield air-interdiction strikes.55 The essential precursor to such army support operations was, at the very least, air superiority and, in the best circumstances, air supremacy. By the time of the Italian campaign in 1943 the Luftwaffe  had been greatly reduced in numbers and the Allied air forces for the most part enjoyed free rein over the theatre of operations. Additionally, new aircraft were appearing to open up a marked technological gap between Allied and Luftwaffe  types for the first time. While Kesselring’s forces soldiered on with the same models, perhaps slightly improved, such as Bf 109s, FW 190s and Ju 88s, the RAF and the USAAF enjoyed the arrival of P-47 Thunderbolts and P-51 Mustangs to attain  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 161 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 150air supremacy. As USAAF General Ira Eaker described it, the Mediterranean Campaign was the crucible for the development of Allied tactical air power.56 By the time of Operation Overlord  in June 1944, Allied tactical air forces were able to do as they pleased as the air superiority war over Europe had been won thanks to thedecimation of the Luftwaffe  during Operation Pointblank,  and especially by the US 8th Air Force following the introduction of the long-range escort, the P-51 Mustang. Thefighter losses suffered by the Luftwaffe  between January and June 1944 were immense: 2,262 pilots w
