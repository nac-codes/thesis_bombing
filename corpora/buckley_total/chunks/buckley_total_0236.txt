out attempts from Normandy illustrated decided shortcomings and problems, although they ultimately proved successful. There was already considerable resentment from  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 163 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 152the strategic air force commanders that their aircraft were being used in this tactical role, for which they were unsuited. There had been no intention of using the heavy- bomber fleets to aid the ground offensives directly but the situation in Normandydemanded it. Certainly, in the case of the crippling blow dealt to the Panzer Lehrdivision prior to the US Cobra  breakout the use of four-engined heavy bombers as “super-heavy airborne artillery” could and did work. The carpet-bombing of Germanforces and defensive units caused stunning paralysis, albeit for a limited period, and rapidly advancing Allied ground troops quickly overran forces subjected to such attacks. Momentum was all too often lost, however. British armour was too slow to follow upthe heavy bombing used to prepare Operation Goodwood  and, as Ian Gooderson argues, fighter-bomber tactical air support would probably have continued to suppress Germanforces for longer had it been used properly during the battle. 66 During Cobra  it was and the results were better.67 Considering that the Allied forces had to learn how to use heavy-bomber support “in harness” during the campaigns across northwest Europe in 1944–5, the effectiveness was considerable. Mistakes and miscalculations were madebut the ability of heavy-bombers to demolish and paralyse prepared defensive positionswas clear. 68 Tactical air support of ground operations in World War II developed into a fully fledged doctrine in the western Allied air forces by 1944. The RAF and the USAAF followed similar lines of operational level battlefield support to that pioneered by the Luftwaffe,  the significant difference being in the resources employed and the application of technology and industry to meet the needs
