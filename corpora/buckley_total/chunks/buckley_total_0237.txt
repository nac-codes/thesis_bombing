operational level battlefield support to that pioneered by the Luftwaffe,  the significant difference being in the resources employed and the application of technology and industry to meet the needs of the armed forces. The Luftwaffe ’s almost anti-doctrine approach to the air war, which emerged for a variety of reasons, allowed great operational flexibility, but ultimately undermined itsefforts when confronted by a single-minded doctrine such as that of the Soviet VVS and the technical and numerically superior Allied air forces. The VVS, tied more closely to the direct needs of the army, took a narrower view of air operations thanthe western forces taking little interest in long-range air superiority operations.Consequently, while the Luftwaffe  simply could not survive in the West by the middle of 1944, it still operated sporadically in the East. This, however, cannot detract from theeffectiveness of the VVS in adding to and supporting the general superiority of Red Army operations from 1943 onwards. The attaining of air supremacy was both unnecessary and physically beyond them. Local air superiority was sufficient. For the West, any measure capable of easing the pain of assaulting German occupied Europe was to be embraced and air power was just such a measure. The combined air offensive against the Axis powers gave the Allies massive superiority.

Operation Overlord and the rout of the German armies back to the Franco-German border, the destruction of the German Ardennes offensive in December/January 1944/5 and the eventualcrossing of the Rhine in 1945 were all made possible by the overwhelming superiorityof the Allied air forces. German accounts and reports of the war in the West from 1943onwards repeatedly claim that air power was the key to Allied success. Even thoughcasualty rates in the ground
