become enthusiastic supporters of air power, and althoughthe USAAF had been planning to conduct a strategic bombing campaign since the 1920s, there was no necessity for it to succeed. Nevertheless, Churchill, repeated scaremongering stories from Europe and US army intelligence reports, had effectivelysold the idea of strategic bombing to Roosevelt, who along with Stimson, at the veryleast considered it a vital precursor to the invasion of northwest Europe. 75 Being particularly conscious of public opinion, the notion that bombing would prepare theway and make the job of the ground forces much easier and less costly in lives, also made the US administration firm supporters of the bombing offensive. Some in the USAAF , like the RAF , believed that bombing alone could win the war, but thecombined resources of the USA, the USSR and Britain and the Commonwealthmeant that it was no longer pivotal to Allied success. The war was to be won by acombined offensive of land, air and sea forces. Thus, the place of strategic bombing in Allied strategy became less distinct after 1941 and it was not until the middle of 1943 that the combined bombing offensive became fully integrated into grand strategy, when, in addition to the more general aimof crippling the German economy, the destruction of the Luftwaffe  and its attendant industries was cited as a main priority. The early years of the bombing offensive seemed to indicate that the British strategy of 1940 was wholly unrealistic. Although the RAF had been pressing for the acceptance of strategic bombing as a viable method of prosecuting war since the 1920s, little of real value had been done to deal with the practicalities of conducting such a campaign.Navigation, aerial defence, bomb aiming and doctrinal development in general hadbeen neglected, in part resulting in inflated expectations on the outbreak of war.Indeed, it is paradoxical that the nation which developed a highly sophisticated airdefence system, and demonstrated its
