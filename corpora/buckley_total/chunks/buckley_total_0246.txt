f war on the USA brought the Americans into the war. Agreed Allied strategy waspredicated on the “Germany first” principle, and the USAAF was a firm and ardentsupporter of strategic bombing and the potential of a joint offensive offered possibilities that it would have been foolish to ignore. USAAF plan AWPD-1 (Air War Plans Division) called principally for the targeting of electrical power, transportation, oil and the German aero-industry, although incertain circumstances a final psychological morale-cracking knockout blow was to beconsidered. 78 The USAAF’s plan was in essence to try just what the RAF had abandoned and was now telling its American cousins was unworkable: precision, daylight raids over Europe. Vicarious learning is difficult at the best of times and despite warnings from the RAF , the Americans were determined to test the capabilitiesof the B-17 Flying Fortress bomber and their own air battle doctrine. 79 Early efforts were often restricted to targets in northern France and within range of Allied fighterescorts, but when the US 8th Air Force (the strategic air force in Britain) beganoperating over Germany itself and started to encounter the Luftwaffe  in strength, losses mounted and faith in the US techniques began to be questioned. The German fighters rapidly developed new tactics for dealing with the higher defensive firepower of theUS bombers, which in any case proved somewhat less effective than pre-war USdoctrine had presumed. 80 Both bombing offensives were slowly improving and the learning curve of the US forces was much steeper than its British counterpart, but bythe end of 1942 little had been achieved that could be said to have noticeably influenced the course of the war, even including the much publicized 1,000 bomber raid on Cologne. The Casablanca Conference of January 1943 sought to put the bomber offensive to the forefront of Allied strategy, but its directive was a fudge because Harris wantedto persist with the area strategy while I
