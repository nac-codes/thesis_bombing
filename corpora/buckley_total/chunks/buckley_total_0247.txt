sablanca Conference of January 1943 sought to put the bomber offensive to the forefront of Allied strategy, but its directive was a fudge because Harris wantedto persist with the area strategy while Ira Eaker, the commander of the 8th Air Force,wanted to pursue the precision bombing policy. The conference, in effect, allowed both to go their own way, opaquely mentioning both morale and industry as the prime targets of the newly named combined bombing offensive. 81 Efforts in 1943 again demonstrated an up-turn in the campaign. In July the RAF launched a major raid on Hamburg in which a high proportion of incendiary bombs (designed to burn rather than blast) were deployed. Due to the hot weather and dry  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 170 --- THE WAR IN EUROPE, 1939–45 159conditions parts of Hamburg burned with such ferocity, possibly reaching temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius, that all the oxygen was used up and more was sucked in from outlying areas creating what became known as a “firestorm”. The consequenceswere appalling with asphyxiation and incineration accounting for many of the 30,000–40,000 dead. The firebombing of Hamburg caused considerable consternation inGermany, with Albert Speer’s comment that six more raids of that nature and the warwould have been over being the most interesting, though he was later to moderate his statement. 82 The RAF was improving its accuracy and navigational prowess with the introduction of the latest electronic technology such as Oboe, Gee,  and H 2S, while the excellent Avro Lancaster heavy-bomber began to constitute the backbone of thecommand’s strength. Short term advantages were also gained by the deployment ofaids such as window,  which consisted merely of metal foil strips cut to the appropriate length to blind German radar. However, Harris’ greatest effort, the attempted destruction of Berlin over the winter of 1943–4, resulted in excessive casualties to his command and failed to cripple Germany as he had hoped
