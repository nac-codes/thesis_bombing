e introduction of the long-range escort brought the Combined Bomber Offensivemore into line with Allied grand strategy. By attacking the Luftwaffe  systematically, the USAAF’s policy brought huge advantages in other areas of the war, such as theelimination of the Luftwaffe  in France. This was because Goering had had to deploy what was left of the Luftwaffe ’s fighter strength to defend Germany itself, thus depriving Rundstedt and Rommel of any kind of credible air support in the crucial campaign in Normandy in 1944.

First, Allied policy in the autumn of 1944 emphasized the value and importance of targeting oil production in Germany, which was viewed as a critical chokepoint in the German war machine. Considerable success was achieved in thisarea, but criticism was and has been levelled at Arthur Harris that he did not prosecute the campaign as fully as he might have because he did not believe it to be effective. Throughout the war he had argued that “panacea-mongering” would not solve anything.The only way to achieve results was to concentrate on area bombing. On many occasions he had been proved right, not least over the USAAF’s Schweinfurt disaster, but on the oil offensive even Harris accepted after the war that he may haveunderestimated the effectiveness of the campaign. 89 At the time, although he opposed the principle of the policy, he did grudgingly carry it out, contrary to the popular perception that he ignored direct orders from above. Recent research has shown thatRAF Bomber Command could have contributed little more than it actually did in the winter of 1944–5 to the oil offensive. 90 However, the controversy that has overshadowed all others concerning the bomber offensive in World War II in Europe was that surrounding the Dresden raid of February 1945.
