e controversy that has overshadowed all others concerning the bomber offensive in World War II in Europe was that surrounding the Dresden raid of February 1945. The firebombing of the city by the RAF and the USAAF in which tens of thousands, perhaps as many as 100,000, perished in a firestorm akin to that which hadgutted Hamburg in 1943 and was later to devastate T okyo, caused a storm of protest then and has continued to do so ever since. Whatever the justification for area bombing in the war hitherto, the destruction of a city with little industrial plant, filled withfleeing refugees, at a time when the war was all but over, seemed little more than senseless slaughter. Many arguments have been offered, including: that the raid was a warning to demonstrate to the Soviets the strength of Allied air power; or that Harriswas determined to prove that area bombing could have won the war; or that the military technology was available so had to be used to justify the investment. None of these are in themselves an explanation. For example, far from being a purely political act, the Dresden raid was requested by the Soviets to cause the more rapid collapse of German resistance on the Eastern Front, though indeed some in Allied command may have considered the psychological value of a massive raid on theadvancing Red Army. Again, although Harris still firmly believed in the area bombing policy, he was not directly responsible for the Dresden raid: this was merely the continuation of a policy in place for three years and which had been reaffirmed bythe chiefs of staff only weeks before the attack on Dresden itself. The strategy remained what it had been since 1942 and the issue is not whether an active decision should have been made to destroy Dresden, but whether and if, there should have been a  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 175 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 164decision not to. Nobody in power considered such a revision of policy necessary until after the raid
