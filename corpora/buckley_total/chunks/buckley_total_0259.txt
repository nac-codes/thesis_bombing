d their air power resources in other more effective ways. The defeat of the U-boats for example,could have been achieved much earlier than it was, if long-range bombers had been diverted to such operations in early 1942. This is certainly true, but the numbers required to close the mid-Atlantic air gap were tiny, and it was more single-mindedmyopia that allowed the air gap to remain open until Spring 1943. In addition, although the Atlantic could have been made secure a year earlier, this would have had little effect on the outcome of the war. The US had little else to ship across to Europe until1943 anyway, by which time the Atlantic campaign had been won. 98 Y et another argument is that significant damage could have been done to the German economy by fast precision raids by large numbers of smaller accurate bombers,such as the Mosquito. This is flawed on two counts. First, it is simply not logical to assume that the Germans would or could not mount an effective defence against such attack in the same way that they blocked the four-engined bombers for so long.Secondly, these bombing tactics would never have crippled the Luftwaffe ’s fighter strength and, as has been argued, this was one of the most significant contributions to Allied victory. Finally, it has been stated that the resources allocated to the strategic force would have been better employed in the tactical role, supporting ground offensives. Again this is open to question, as the Allies had complete air supremacy over northwestEurope from the spring/summer of 1944, and there was little else it could contribute – there were still limits to the capabilities of aircraft to intervene in the ground war. Generally, it was an example of the resource advantage enjoyed by the Allies that theywere able to provide tactical air supremacy over Europe as well as conducting a major  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 179 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 168strategic bombing campaign and creating ground forces
