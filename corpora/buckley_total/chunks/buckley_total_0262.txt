er, in the strategic air war over Germany, the Allied victory by spring of 1944 brought not only tremendous military advantage, but also perhaps the pinnacle, if it can be called that, of total war. War had reached a new level: with the ability to destroy almost at will, not only the enemy’s military capability, but also the enemy state itself, had come deep ethical problems. T o Clausewitz, the guru of modern western military thought, restraint in war was both dangerous and counterproductive.

Moreover, the strategic bombing offensivesand the depth of mobilization required to maintain air power effectiveness reachedsuch proportions that if total war ever truly existed, many would argue it was duringthe war against Germany. However, the war that broke out between the Allies andJapan in the Far East and raged for almost four years could in many ways be said tohave epitomized some aspects of total war even more, displaying such extremes askamikaze suicide attacks and the atomic bombings. More than the war in Europe, thePacific War, as it is often known, demonstrated an even
