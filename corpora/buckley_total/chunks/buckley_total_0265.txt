The Pacific War was also another clear indication of the growing divide between the first rate and thesecondary air powers. Japan failed, not only because of organizational problems, but because she simply did not have the capacity and resource base to match the USA. The sophisticated and modern economy of the Americans dwarfed the Japaneseindustrial base both in size and prevailing levels of technology. It was a gap that could have been narrowed by more effective use and husbanding of resources, but ultimately, Japan was simply not capable of meeting the demands of a protracted air powercampaign against a foe the size of the USA.

However, the scope and scale of technological and industrial war, of which air power was the most obvious manifestation, was such that Japan was even less well equipped to deal with it than Germany, and thus the limits and excesses of total war were ruthlessly demonstrated by the Allies as they swept away Japanese resistance from 1942 onwards. Air power and the Far East, 1937â€“41 Japan had been the pace-setter of Asian air power since the earliest days of flight and both the army and navy air arms were considerable forces by the era of Japanese expansion in the 1930s. Japan had sought to create its own aero-industry in order to abandon reliance on western powers and, by the 1930s, both the army and navy air forces were operating capable indigenous designs.
