to create its own aero-industry in order to abandon reliance on western powers and, by the 1930s, both the army and navy air forces were operating capable indigenous designs. In 1931, with no other serious native aerial opposition the Japanese air forces were quickly able to establish air superiority over the Chinese air forces, such as there were, in the invasion of Manchuria. In the wake of this success, Japan began a major expansion and re-equipment programme for its air forces and, when the war with China broke out proper in 1937, both army and naval air units were relatively well prepared.1 The next four years proved to be a training ground for the Japanese air forces, and they honed their capabilities against the Chinese, while enduring difficulties against the Soviets. The conflict between China and Japan illustrated much of what was to come in the Second World War with long-range trans-oceanic strategic operations between mainland China and Japan, battlefield air support and air strikes launched from Japanese carriers against mainland targets.2 The Japanese endeavoured to eliminate Chinese air forces both in northern and southern China with the army taking responsibility for the former and the navy for the latter. The Japanese were able to call upon 451 aircraft to support the invasion of China, with the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) carrying the brunt of the early fighting and the early losses. The lessons of the China Incident (as it was euphemistically labelled in T okyo) were applied in aircraft design and organization by Japan, as the advocates of fast monoplane aircraft prevailed over the supporters of slower but more manoeuvrable biplanes,3 and began a programme to procure a fast attack aircraft, the Ki-51.4  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 184 --- THE WAR IN THE FAR EAST, 1937â€“45 173However, limitations on Japanese aerial capabilities were soon illustrated and, despite the propaganda, the Chinese air forces were never eliminated or put to the sw
