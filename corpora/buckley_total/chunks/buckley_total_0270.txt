students considering the Pacific War after the passing of over five decades, Japan’s decision to attack the USA, China, Britain and the Commonwealth simultaneously seems tantamount to strategic suicide. How could Japan hope to prevail against such  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 186 --- THE WAR IN THE FAR EAST, 1937–45 175combined strength, even if early seizures of territory and resources were possible? Indeed, whatever the outcome of events in the Pacific in 1942, with the eventualcollapse of Germany three years later, Japan’s fate would have been sealed in any but the most extreme of circumstances as the combined resources of the western world would have been turned against her. However, Japanese strategy for the conduct of the war against the USA was the subject of much debate and conjecture in the period leading up to Pearl Harbor. Traditional Japanese thinking, based on a long established defensive strategy, was infact abandoned by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto in favour of more offensive planning in the years leading up to the war, and some regard this as being a principal reason for Japan’s defeat. Since the Washington Naval Treaty of 1921–2 which had set a ratio often to six on naval strength in favour of the USA and Britain, Japan had been forced to plan for “defensive” war against the US Navy because of the imposed 40 per cent degree of material inferiority. 7 The only way to defeat the larger US Navy was, therefore, to lure it into a place of the IJN’s choosing, weaken it with submarine attack, exhaust it, and only when the balance had swung more evenly in Japan’s favour would the crushing of the US Navy take place in a massive set piece battle, dominated bybattleships. Again, to make up the deficiency in numbers the IJN would rely heavily on tactical superiority forged from drill and training. As air power came to prominence in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the defensive plan was updated and air strikes wereincluded as a means of weakening the US fl
