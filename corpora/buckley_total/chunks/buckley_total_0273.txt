resolved the issue. Yamamoto could not afford to riskthe continued exposure of his fleet to surprise carrier strikes. Midway was therefore essential. Further criticism of Yamamoto has been levelled because of the nature of the Midway plan which separated the Japanese fleet into small groups and effectively used the IJN’s carrier force (temporarily reduced from six to four carriers because of the Coral Sea battle) as bait. The plan degenerated into disaster for many reasons butthe basic principle of Yamamoto’s thinking was sound. Indeed, victory at Midway and the destruction of three US carriers would have given the IJN air supremacy and a free hand for operations for one, possibly two years. This would probably not havesaved Japan from ultimate defeat but it did demonstrate the crucial and decisive  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 188 --- THE WAR IN THE FAR EAST, 1937–45 177nature of air power to the conduct of operations in the Pacific campaign. Arguably, the loss of all four carriers at Midway merely hastened Japan’s defeat. Japan enjoyedmassive success in the wake of the Pearl Harbor raid until the catastrophe at Midway but, as has been suggested, the roots of Japan’s decline were already embedded. The essence of the IJN’s decisive battle philosophy illustrated all too clearly a fundamental weakness of the Japanese war machine. The Great War had demonstrated to the world that modern war made heavy and exhausting demands of modern societies and economies, especially in air power terms, and that the much sought afterdecisive battle, both on land and at sea, had proved frustratingly elusive. Y et Japan’s entire strategy for war against the USA was predicated on achieving just such a decisive victory. Concepts of long attritional war, although acknowledged by pre-war planners,took second place to tactical and operational considerations, that is making the Pearl Harbor raid and the subsequent battle of annihilation feasible. 10 For example, rather than creating
