ar planners,took second place to tactical and operational considerations, that is making the Pearl Harbor raid and the subsequent battle of annihilation feasible. 10 For example, rather than creating a reserve in depth for the IJN’s aviators as preparation for the expected long war, the training programme used by the Japanese navy centred on the pursuit of excellence in very small numbers. The IJN’s aircrew were drilled ruthlessly in the years leading up to Pearl Harbor and were without doubt the finestexamples of naval aviators in the world in 1941. However, the drop-out and attrition rates in achieving such quality were enormously wasteful. In 1937, only 70 out of 1,500 applicants were accepted at Tsuchiura naval air training school near T okyo. Afterthe ten month programme only 25 remained. Indeed, as few as 100 pilots per year completed their training for the IJN, which simply did not allow for the creation of a trained reserve. 11 The naval air crew proved their worth in the early stages of the Pacific Campaign but, once they were lost in the carrier battles over Coral Sea, Midway and the Solomons, the effectiveness of the Japanese naval air arm diminished rapidly. By the final carrier battles of the war in 1944, the IJN’s aircrew were poorly trained,suffering from 50 per cent operational loss rates. 12 Another crucial factor in the demise of Japan was a lack of attention paid to trade defence. Once the resource rich areas of southeast Asia had been seized it was essentialfor Japan’s long-term viability that the newly acquired raw materials be shipped back to Japan to facilitate the necessary increase in military output to compete with the USA. However, although such a task was crucial to Japan’s war effort, it did not takeplace to any significant degree. The importance of trade defence to an island nation had been illustrated all too dramatically during the First World War when Britain had come close to defeat at the hands of the German U-boat fleet.
