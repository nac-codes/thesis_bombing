tance of trade defence to an island nation had been illustrated all too dramatically during the First World War when Britain had come close to defeat at the hands of the German U-boat fleet. Although the Britishwere to repeat many of the mistakes of 1914–18 in the Second World War they, and  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 189 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 178their Allies, realized that success against the submarine was the first step on the road to victory. Japan’s real failing was in not establishing such a priority. Trade defence operations were considered “defensive” and not fitting for warriors. The aeroplane, a key component in trade defence, was never deployed in any large numbers to defend thesea communications route from southeast Asia to Japan, and between 1942 and 1945 the American submarine fleet devastated the Japanese merchant marine. In total some 8,000,000 tons of Japanese shipping were lost in combat during World War II, of which4,765,000 were destroyed by Allied submarines. 13 Perhaps the most significant consequence of this was that, of the 19,165,000 tons of oil produced in occupied territories less than 25 per cent ever got back to Japan. One of the most importantreasons for the decline in Japan’s fighting ability was its lack of fuel oil for operations and training, a crippling disadvantage in the latter half of the war, and always a concern throughout. 14 The British had proved that air power was arguably the most important factor in defeating submarine based merchant raiding, but the Japanese, wanting to concentrate on front-line battle effectiveness, allowed the life blood of the Japanese economy to haemorrhage in favour of a concentration on “offensive” aerial duties.15 The decisive battle philosophy, one deliberately eschewed by the US Navy once the war had broken out, continued to plague Japanese thinking, even Yamamoto’s. The perception that the IJN was a true air power navy does not stand close scrutiny.Even as they were cr
