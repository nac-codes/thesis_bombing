he US Navy once the war had broken out, continued to plague Japanese thinking, even Yamamoto’s. The perception that the IJN was a true air power navy does not stand close scrutiny.Even as they were creating a highly efficient carrier arm they were also producing the largest battleships ever built in preparation for the expected decisive surface engagement with the US battlefleet. Moreover, Japanese destroyers were designed for fleet actions,not escort and trade defence duties, and Japanese submarines were expected to act in direct support of the battlefleet. Even Yamamoto’s Midway plan was to culminate in a major surface action in which the remnants of the US fleet would be annihilated bythe battlewagons of the IJN. Nevertheless, in the early stages of the war the IJN enjoyed staggering success and seemed to be demonstrating a clear and prescient understanding of maritime air powerphilosophy. Following on from the Pearl Harbor raid, Japanese air forces quickly suppressed aerial resistance over the US, held Philippines preparatory to invasion, sank the Royal Navy’s token Asian force of the battleship Prince of Wales  and the battlecruiser Repulse  with air strikes alone, this time while the ships were at sea, and spearheaded the occupation of the Dutch East Indies. In the Pacific itself, Japanese air power was the key to the seizure of many vital US and Allied island bases such as Guam andWake. It is true that the air forces arrayed against them were largely obsolete and inadequate, but the remorseless efficiency of the Japanese assault stunned the Allies.

However, once the carrier fleet had been crippled at Midway, the IJN demonstrated its lack of understanding of the t
