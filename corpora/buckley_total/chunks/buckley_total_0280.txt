eral the Japanese military eschewed the “boffin” and technical war much loved by the western powers. The lack of radar in the early stages of the war was a serious disadvantage and was largely responsible for the IJN carrier fleet being caught unawares at Midway. The failure of Japanese cipher technology was again acause of defeat and poor radio security plagued air power efforts throughout the war, most notably at the Battle of the Philippine Sea when US radio operators listened in as the Japanese attack co-ordinator directed the doomed assault on Task Force 58. 21 Duties such as radar and intelligence operations were considered unworthy of true  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 192 --- THE WAR IN THE FAR EAST, 1937–45 181fighting men and thus, only those unfit for much else were placed in backroom duties, and such activities suffered from inadequate and incapable personnel. It is clear that Japanese air power strategy failed in World War II, and not just because the war was lost. Although the IJN had illustrated all too graphically what maritime airforces were capable of, they did not fully understand the implications of their discovery.In contrast to the European theatre, the defensive capability of air power was severelylimited by the strictures of the geography of the Pacific campaign. Mobile, not static, air power was the key to victory in the campaign and Japan’s carrier fleet was simply not up to the task once it had been fatally compromised in the battles of 1942. Islandgroups were easily isolated and had their small pockets of static air power reduced bysurprise raids, such as those conducted by US Task Force 58 prior to the PhilippineSea engagement. Y et Japan continued to rely on such penny packets of dispersed airforces to support their mobile fleet because they still expected the war to be decided by a surface engagement, and also because their own carrier force was, after 1942, inadequate in terms of training and numbers. The whole basis of Japan’
