lack of central planning and organization in the Japanese aero-industry. Demonstrating once again the lack of understanding ofthe demands and nature of modern industrial war, the Japanese had no considered plan for the expansion and organization of aircraft production after 1941. Only steady expansion of aircraft output had been underway during the 1930s with a 300 per centincrease between 1931 and 1936, and a 400 per cent increase between 1936 and 1940, and was slowing down. 24 Levels of aircraft production in 1940 for the navy and the army combined were 4,768, while by 1941 the figure was 5,088.25 However, these levels of increased output, where the concentration had been on the quality of the air forces through training rather than accelerated production, failed to lay the foundations for wartime expansion. In the years 1939 to 1941, US aircraft production had increasedby approximately 500 per cent and British by 250 per cent, whereas Japan, supposedly  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 194 --- THE WAR IN THE FAR EAST, 1937–45 183Table 7.1 – Available air strength, 1943–5 Source:  Cohen, Japan’s economy,  p. 233. preparing for war of some kind against the USA and the West, saw a rise of a little over 10 per cent.26 Once the war had degenerated into a long attritional affair by 1942, Japan’s inadequacies in long-term planning and pre-war mobilization became clear. Japanese industry was primitive by western standards being based on many small scale operations which hindered co-ordination and organization. T o make matters worse, for over a year little was done to adapt the Japanese aero-industry to the demands of war. The military remained too powerful and the civilian government too weak until as late as November 1943 when the Ministry of Munitions was established to try and pull the disparate parts of the Japanese economy together.27 It was determined that the aero- industry was capable of producing 53,000 aircraft per year, although the raw materialsdid not e
