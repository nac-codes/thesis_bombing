to try and pull the disparate parts of the Japanese economy together.27 It was determined that the aero- industry was capable of producing 53,000 aircraft per year, although the raw materialsdid not exist to reach such a figure. 28 Therefore, it was considered that increased efficiency was of paramount importance, not expanded plant, thus illustrating theunderlying problems of the sector. By 1943 it was clear that US air power was starting to swamp Japanese front-line air strength and levels of attrition were threatening to hand air supremacy to the Americans. The Munitions Ministry set in motion plans to increase output to 97,000 aircraft  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 195 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 184between January 1944 and August 1945, although this was reduced on reflection to 66,000 and only some 40,000 were actually constructed.29 With front-line casualties increasing, Japanese output barely covered losses and, with no reserves and little or no effective training, Japanese air strength fell qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, inthe same way that the Luftwaffe  had been distorted in Europe by the increasing need for fighters at the expense of bombers, so too were the Japanese air forces obliged to abandon their army and navy support operations in favour of contesting air superiority.In 1941 fighters made up 21 per cent of output while bombers constituted 29 per cent. By 1945, these figures had shifted to 49 per cent and 17 per cent respectively, severely restricting the ability of Japan’s air forces to intervene in an effective mannerin front-line operations. The problem was compounded by the growing need in late 1944 to deploy fighters in Japan itself to combat the menace presented by the US 20th’s strategic bombing campaign, and in the last year of the war the number offighters deployed as strategic interceptors doubled. 30 Attempts to introduce new types of aircraft designs into front-line service repeatedly failed and new models
