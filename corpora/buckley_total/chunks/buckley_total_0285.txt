last year of the war the number offighters deployed as strategic interceptors doubled. 30 Attempts to introduce new types of aircraft designs into front-line service repeatedly failed and new models were often little better than their predecessors. Squabblingpermeated even this area and the replacement for the famous Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter, the A7M Reppu, was continually delayed because the navy and the designer could not agree on the best engine for the aircraft. 31 Other new designs, such as the Raiden and the Shiden, which came to be respected by Allied pilots, also suffered from production failings and latterly from the exigencies of the blockade and the bombing campaign. Problems persisted for much of the war in a number of areas of production. First, Japanese capitalists and businessmen were unwilling to switch production en masse  to less profitable military output, while central government maintained surprisingly lowlevels of taxation on private income and wealth. 32 Labour mobilization was also a significant area of confusion. Initially, manufacturers had to find their own workers, with no help from the navy or the army.33 Labour dilution did take place on a massive scale as the war progressed but the armed services repeatedly drafted even senior skilled workers into the army and the navy and by 1945 the ratio of skilled to non- skilled labour was one to two thousand. Such low levels of supervision and expertiseresulted in around 33 per cent of engine parts output being unusable, further hindering serviceability and production levels. 34 However, the two most important factors in the attrition of Japan’s aero-industry in the latter half of the war were the submarine blockade and the bombing offensive. US submarines took a heavy toll of Japanese merchant shipping severely restricting production, training and combat effectiveness.
