The engine to airframe ratio fell from 2.3:1 in 1941 to 1:1 by 1945 resulting in there being no reserve of engines or spare parts, thus curtailing operational readiness and training.37 By the closing stages of the war, airframes were lying about unused because there were no engines to power them. The effects of the bombing of Japan were also profound and seriously undermined all the efforts of the Munitions Ministry to increase production. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS), conducted after the war, estimated that some 43 per cent of engine production and 18 per cent of airframe construction was lost inJapan between December 1944 and July 1945 as a direct result of the bombing campaign. Absenteeism increased dramatically as workers fled to the countryside to escape the bombing and to search for food. Spring 1945 saw the loss of some 20–25 per cent ofproductive personnel hours. 38 One of the counters to the US bombardment was the dispersal of Japanese industry away from easily targetable cities to underground plants – mines, quarries, railwaytunnels and so forth – and into the countryside. New tunnels were dug and by the end of the war some 100 underground plants were in various stages of construction and the expectation was that aircraft production would have been totally subterraneanby December 1945. However, the dispersal programme came too l
