rground plants were in various stages of construction and the expectation was that aircraft production would have been totally subterraneanby December 1945. However, the dispersal programme came too late, its introduction being postponed in 1944 so as not to interfere with production levels. The navy and army claimed that maximum output was required to fight the expected decisivebattles of that summer and autumn, the campaigns which were to become the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf. Only if production would not be compromised would they agree to the dispersal programme, and it could not. The emphasis on output at all costs upto October 1944 resulted in the wearing out of production tools and jigs and stalled the introduction of dispersal, thus making the aero-industry highly susceptible to sustained heavy bombing which began in November. Panic dispersal began as a resultand the passing of the “Urgent Dispersal of Plants Act” only partly alleviated the problem. 39 By the last six months of the war, production was falling away under the weight of aerial bombardment and blockade. It was in many ways a remarkable achievement that, from a much weaker base than their Axis partners in Germany, the Japanese managed to maintain the levels of production that they did. In 1944, the first full year of mobilization, production of  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 197 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 186airframes, engines and propellers increased by 69 per cent, 63 per cent and 70 per cent respectively and overall Japan manufactured 28,180 aircraft, approximately 75 per cent of Germany’s output from an industrial base one-third the pre-war size.40 Nevertheless, Japan suffered from many problems similar to those encountered in the expansion of the German aero-industry. Lack of co-ordination, poor planning, and military interference all undermined Japanese efforts which were further damaged by the highly effective blockade and the increasing ferocity of the bombing offensiv
