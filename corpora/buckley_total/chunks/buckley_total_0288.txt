co-ordination, poor planning, and military interference all undermined Japanese efforts which were further damaged by the highly effective blockade and the increasing ferocity of the bombing offensive in the last year of the war. Ultimately, like Germany, Japan was ill-equipped and in many ways unwilling to adapt her economy and industry to “total” industrial war, and when confronted by an enemy such as the USA whose style epitomized the productivist approach to war, both in economic mobilization and strategic thinking and planning, the Japanese could not hope to prevail for any length of time. US/Allied air strategy and the conduct of the Pacific War The importance of air power to the USA in the conduct of any future war had already been established prior to 1941 and the Roosevelt administration had invested heavily in the development of the American air forces since the Munich crisis (see Chapter Five). Well before the Pearl Harbor raid, it was considered that air power would be a crucial element in any war against Japan, and indeed the Pacific War proved that air superiority and even air supremacy were not only crucial but indeed decisive and fundamental to US victory. Louis Allen has even gone so far as to state that the only campaign which really mattered in the war against Japan was the US Navy’s drive across the Central Pacific to the island bases such as Saipan which allowed the USAAF systematically to flatten all but one of Japan’s cities in the most ferocious and one-sided strategic bombing offensive ever seen.41 This view can be refined by adding the submarine offensive which throttled Japan’s industrial production, but the pivotal nature of the aeroplane to US strategy in the war against Japan is irrefutable. Clearly the aircraft was the only weapon capable of covering the vast expanses of the Pacific effectively. It was the US Navy’s attainment of air superiority over the Central Pacific which spearheaded America’s war effort, and ultimately it was air
