of covering the vast expanses of the Pacific effectively. It was the US Navy’s attainment of air superiority over the Central Pacific which spearheaded America’s war effort, and ultimately it was air power which delivered the final coup de grâce  to Japan in August 1945. The USA’s view of the nature of air war was more refined and in line with the demands of modern war. The attainment of air superiority was, by necessity, to be a long drawn out campaign of attrition in which Japanese air power would be whittled away preparatory to the US  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 198 --- THE WAR IN THE FAR EAST, 1937–45 187offensive. Notably, and in stark contrast to the Japanese plan of war, the USA never expected a single battle to be decisive. The war against Japan was to be a remorseless series of engagements on a variety of fronts and media, supported by a massive mobilization of industrial capacity. The European powers however, had little answer to the Japanese onslaught in the first few months of the war and were quickly driven back to India and Australia. In what was essentially a ground war, air power played only a limited and supportive role,and the Allied air forces struggled to assert themselves in southeast Asia due to a lack of resources and strategic necessity. The attainment of air superiority allowed innovatory measures to be undertaken, notably the air supply of Chinese forces now cut off bythe loss of the Burma road, and later, by the use of Orde Wingate’s chindits – troops airlifted behind enemy lines and supplied by air drops. These were partially successful and, like other airborne operations, had limited flexibility, but they illustrated whatcould be possible with air-mobile troops if air superiority could be seized. 42 The resupply of troops operating in China was also limited in impact. A little over 300,000 tons of equipment and fuel was flown “over the hump” into China prior to 1945 andmost of this went to Chennault’s US air units or to suppor
