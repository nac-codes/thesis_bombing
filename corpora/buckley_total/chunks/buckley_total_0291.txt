With only small numbers of carriers and no other offensive potential the US fleet would not be ready for anything else until late 1943, and the first priority in 1942 was to blunt the Japanese offensive and grind down its carrier air arm wherever possible. The crushing victory at Midway in June1942 evened up the carrier fleets and severely restricted Japanese offensive capability and the attritional battles of late 1942 and early 1943 saw the Pacific naval campaign reduced to a virtual stalemate. That is, until the output of the US economy started topour forth carriers, aircraft and supplies in mid-1943. The outpost of US power in Asia and the Pacific, the Philippines, had for much of the interwar period been identified as indefensible. War Plan Orange,  America’s long- standing strategy for war with Japan, had until the late 1930s worked on the assumption that the Japanese would be able to seize the Philippines in the early stages of a war. 45 This was tacitly accepted in the Rainbow 5  plan, which superseded Orange,  and was to form the basis of US strategy in World War II, along with agreement with the Britishthat Germany was a greater threat than Japan and that a “Germany first policy” was to be adopted on the outbreak of any global war. 46 The only alteration to the US plan was the move by General Douglas MacArthur to offer a viable defence of the Philippines by the expansion of the Filipino army and with the allocation of extra US support, principally increased numbers of aircraft, in the period leading up to theoutbreak of war. A force of B-17 four engined heavy-bombers, the US Army’s great hope, was to be sent to the Philippines where, it was hoped and believed, it would be able to drive off any enemy naval force. 47 However, on the outbreak of war, MacArthur’s  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 200
