In any case the performance of the B-17 in maritime operations was to be a profound disappointment throughout the war and even a much greater force of such aircraft would probably have been unable to intervene decisively against the Japanese invasion.Surprise Japanese air raids quickly reduced American air strength and MacArthur’s whole plan soon unravelled. The US Army and the Marines Corps were driven back to Australia and the South Pacific as the Philippines and a variety of island basesrapidly fell to the Japanese offensive. However, with the defeat of the Japanese carrier fleet at Midway, the US Army was able to halt the Japanese advance through the Solomons at Guadalcanal, and by early 1943, along with the navy, the US Army andthe marines were ready to go onto the offensive. It is testament to the mismatch in resources between the USA and Japan that the Americans were able to turn the tide in the Pacific as early as 1943 with only some 15per cent of their war effort given over to the task. 48 Moreover, US resources were further divided by the two-pronged strategy adopted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the re-conquest of the Pacific and the defeat of Japan. In an effort to placate both thearmy and the navy lobbies, the US Navy under Admiral Nimitz was to drive across the Central Pacific towards the Marianas and southern Japan, while MacArthur and the army were to advance along the islands of the south Pacific, with the aim of re-capturing the Philippines and Formosa. The fact that the Americans were able to support both of these offensives again demonstrated the odds the Japanese were up against. T o support the expanding resources at their
