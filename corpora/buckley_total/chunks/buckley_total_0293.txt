T o support the expanding resources at their disposal the US forces now had to develop the means with which to prosecute their largely air oriented strategies. US air support for ground operations in the Pacific was forged in the fierce fighting atGuadalcanal and later at Bougainville where, once again, the importance of first gaining air superiority was proven to be crucial in facilitating the effective use of ground support air forces. In the fighting in New Guinea, Japanese forces feared artillery andmortar attack far more than air assault, but by Bougainville in December 1943 this had changed and air power posed the greater threat. The experience in the southern Pacific formed the basis of air support for US amphibious and marine ground forcesfor the rest of the war and into the post-war era. 49 US Naval air doctrine and capability quickly developed after Midway, although the carrier fleet endured a difficult learning experience in and around the Solomonsduring 1942 and 1943, which saw the loss of two fleet carriers, the Hornet  and the Wasp.

With them came vast numbers of new Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and TBF Avenger torpedo-bombers, while the Curtiss SBC Helldiverdive-bomber offered an alternative to the ageing but popular Douglas SBD Dauntless. All of these aircraft, along with new land-based types, were superior to their Japanese adversaries and were of course available in much larger numbers. Perhaps equallyimportantly, during the period after Pearl Harbor, the direction of Pacific naval operations had fallen to the air
