I Bomber Command, burned out dozens of Japanese cities in a series of ferocious and arguably barbaric firebombing raids. Against little or no opposition, the Americans razed city after city to the ground killing hundreds of thousands of Japanese and concluded with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Without doubt, the ability of air power to inflict a punishing degree of industrial and machine war was proven in the months of the so-called “torching” of Japan and the apogee of total war had been reached. Such was the destruction and indeed the revulsion in many quarters that although the bombing offensive ended the war against Japan without the need for an amphibious invasion, the cost in ethical and moral terms had been heavy and quite possibly excessive. Curiously, the USA had been particularly critical of indiscriminate bombing in the years leading up to World War II and in Europe had attempted, certainly until the closing stages of the war against Germany, to pursue a policy of precision bombing of industrial and military targets. Not for them was the indiscriminate area bombing adopted by the RAF’s Bomber Command, or so they claimed.52 In fact, the desire to end the war quickly in the winter of 1944–5 when weather and operating conditions precluded precision raids, led the US 8th Air Force to move towards more area bombing (although they euphemistically called it bombing of “marshalling yards”). The new tactics improved efficiency and clearly contributed to the collapse of the German state in 1945, but it was at the cost of lingering qualms about surrendering the moral and ethical high ground that the US had tried to stake out for itself.53 In the Far East,  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 203 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 192with racism and barbarity on both sides, there were far fewer concerns about killing Japanese civilians in the first place, but with the USAAF following an incrementalpath towards “total war” the final
