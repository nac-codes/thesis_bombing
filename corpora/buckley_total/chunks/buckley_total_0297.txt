ith racism and barbarity on both sides, there were far fewer concerns about killing Japanese civilians in the first place, but with the USAAF following an incrementalpath towards “total war” the final step to indiscriminate area bombing in March 1945,although there were still reservations, was a small one. Planning for the bombing of Japan had begun back in the 1930s when it had been agreed that the USA would need a very-long-range bomber for any campaign against the Japanese homelands owing to the vast distances involved. Planning for the bomberdated back to 1937, but design work on the aircraft which became the B-29 Superfortressbegan in 1940. 54 The USAAF had already ordered 250 straight off the drawing board while the aircraft was still in development but, after testing in September 1942, a majorcrash programme was initiated to mass produce the B-29, which it was now recognized could outperform by some distance any other bomber then in existence. 55 The B-29 was considerably faster than its contemporaries and importantly for the vast distancesinvolved in Pacific operations, had a range double that of the B-17 and the Lancaster.The bomber also had remote controlled gun turrets and pressurized cabins, both ofwhich represented yet further leaps forward in the technology of air power and massdestruction. However, the earliest bombing campaigns launched from China and India against a variety of targets in southern Japan and southeast Asia respectively, enjoyed only limitedsuccess. Even when the Marianas were occupied in June 1944, allowing the US 20thAir Force to begin operating B-29s against Japan’s major cities and industrial centresby November, difficulties were still encountered. Brigadier-General H. Hansell, anadvocate of precision bombing with European experience, was appointed to the XXI Bomber Command in the Marianas to launch the final aerial assault on Japan. Many had staked their reputations on the success of the offensive, General Arnoldincluded, but they
