could also be judged that what the US 20th air force achieved in the spring and summer of 1945 was exactly what had been considered before the war by theorists and air poweradvocates â€“ surely this was Douhetism at its most intense? Such was the impact of the atomic bombings that many post-war analysts have attributed, without question, a higher degree of decision making than was apparent atthe time to those who decided to drop the bomb. Contemporary reservations were voiced, but such qualms had been aired over the fire bombings and rejected by those seeking to end the war as quickly as possible. Moreover, there were many who simplyconsidered the atomic bomb to be just another, if more extreme, air weapon. As in the case of the Dresden raid, it was more of a question of why the USAAF should not drop the atomic bomb, rather than why they should. Moreover, the critical argumentof those in power in 1945 was how they were to end the war as quickly as possible. However, it would be disingenuous to argue that the atomic bombs did not represent something new, even though the T okyo firebombing raid killed similar numbers toHiroshima and considerably more than Nagasaki. In both cases vast numbers of people died and whether it was by one bomb or hundreds of bombs is to a certain degree a moot point. Y et somehow there is a difference in the minds of many and this has beenexaggerated to such an extent that the firebombing of Japan has receded into the background.

In thepost-war years nuclear weapons became political and diplomatic tools and many have viewed the atomic bombs, retrospectively, in the same way. The revisionist school of historians, principa
