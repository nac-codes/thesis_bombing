pped. In thepost-war years nuclear weapons became political and diplomatic tools and many have viewed the atomic bombs, retrospectively, in the same way. The revisionist school of historians, principally spearheaded by Gar Alperovitz, has argued that the bombs weredropped for political reasons, primarily to intimidate the Soviets, and as such can be viewed as the first major act of the Cold War. The argument rests on the point that the political aspects of the decision to drop the bomb predominated over militaryconsiderations. It is claimed that Japan was about to surrender anyway, that the bombs were unnecessary to end the war and indeed that the US government prolonged the war in order to use the weapon to wring concessions out of Stalin. 59 While these arguments probably attest a level of significance to the atomic bombs that was not so obvious at the time, it is clear that some in power did consider the bombs to be a new extreme in war and as such they could be used for broader  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 207 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 196political aims. However, this does not support the argument that such considerations predominated. The most significant argument revolves around whether or not Japan was about to surrender and, although there is evidence that the Japanese government was looking to end the war, it was on nothing approaching terms acceptable to the USA.60 The fact that the Japanese were still vacillating after Nagasaki suggests that prior to the events of 6–9 August there was little likelihood of a realistic surrender being negotiated. Consequently the USA was liable to use all reasonable methods to end the war. The atomic bombings can therefore be viewed as another measure, following on from the fire bombings, towards forcing the Japanese surrender and as such in the context of the time can be viewed as “necessary”, especially with the spectre of thousands of US casualties looming if Operation Olympic  had to be carried thro
