e Japanese surrender and as such in the context of the time can be viewed as “necessary”, especially with the spectre of thousands of US casualties looming if Operation Olympic  had to be carried through. Much of the post-war debate has been fuelled by US army generals and navy admirals claiming, largely for political reasons, that the bombs were unnecessary to end the war.61 The USSBS (Unites States Strategic Bombing Survey) claimed that Japan would have surrendered by November 1945 anyway, without the atomic bombings, the Soviet declaration of war or the intended Operation Olympic.  This view has been recently questioned, however, as the basis of the survey’s assumptions were founded on flawed post-war interviews. Moreover, the USSBS had certain institutional views, most notably that the conventional bombing campaign had been the key to USsuccess. 62 However, it is difficult to accept that conventional methods could have ended the war with fewer casualties than the atomic bombings and certainly not with less Allied loss of life. Perhaps the most obvious point is that the US forces and the US government wanted to end the war as quickly as possible, that they desperately wanted to avoid the carnage of invading Japan itself, and that this more than anything convinced the Americans to carry on the policy of pummelling Japan into surrender. This is not to argue that political considerations did not flow from that decision, but there is no effective evidence to support the contention that it prompted it.63 Conclusion The war against Japan demonstrated more forcefully than ever that the ability to wagemodern war rested on industrial capability and mobilization and that such utilizationof resources was necessary for the deployment of effective air forces more than for  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 208 --- THE WAR IN THE FAR EAST, 1937–45 197other arms.
