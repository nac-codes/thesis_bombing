TheSoviet Union was exhausted by four years of savage conflict, Britain though wishingto pursue a world role was economically crippled and the USA had yet to develop afully fledged international profile. The incremental slide into the Cold War was ofcourse eventually to result in superpower confrontation, although never in open military conflict, and for this many have claimed that the fear of nuclear warfare was crucial. Politicians, especially when deflecting the arguments of the nuclear disarmament lobby,all too readily argued that nuclear weapons had kept the peace in Europe for decadesand that an era of almost “total peace” had superseded the age of total war. Could itbe therefore, that air power, the ultimate embodiment of total war had, when coupledwith nuclear weaponry, attained such a level of sophistication and potential that full scale war was no longer a viable political option? Whereas direct military confrontation between the superpowers was to be rendered highly unlikely by the late 1950s and1960s with the acceptance, if only implicitly by the USSR, of deterrence and mutuallyassured destruction (MAD), it was certainly not the case in the 1940s and early 1950sthat strategic atomic weapons had that power. Moreover, the impact of the determination to develop such capability in strategic air power was to have serious repercussions on  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 210 --- AIR POWER AND THE POST -WAR WORLD 199tactical and conventional air power, which consequently quickly declined in the post- war era, only to re-emerge in the 1980s as an important strategic level weapon. The nature of modern air power Many of the trends established in the interwar period continued into the post-1945 era, most notably air power’s impact on the wider world. The creation of the globalvillage, begun back in the 1930s, accelerated in t
