ds established in the interwar period continued into the post-1945 era, most notably air powerâ€™s impact on the wider world. The creation of the globalvillage, begun back in the 1930s, accelerated in the years after 1945 to the extent thatby the late 1950s and early 1960s jet air travel had become readily accessible to masspopulations in the industrial world. The development of jet airliners and a fully integratedworld air travel network owed much to military advances in the wake of World War II, and jet technology, which supplanted piston-engined aircraft in the decade following 1945, built on the pioneering work of the wartime German scientists in particular.New developments and the pushing back of the boundaries of speed and endurancein air travel, fired by military activity, also filtered through to civil aviation. Notably, andin contrast to the interwar period, it was military aviation which led the way in thedevelopment of aero-technology. Moreover, this trend manifested itself in other ways, the most important example being the input of the military into the early stages of space exploration. The rate and level of technical advancement accelerated dramatically after 1945, raising unit costs and further dividing the dwindling band of first rate air powers fromthe rest. The post-war period has seen the development, for example, of V/STOL (vertical or short take-off and landing) aircraft, supersonic fighters, radar technology and missile systems (guided, surface-to-air, precision guided munitions and heat seeking,to name but a few). Indeed, some innovations have changed the nature of conflictquite significantly. The helicopter has offered tremendous flexibility to ground andlogistical support operations, while perhaps the most revolutionary change to commandand control of air war has come through the creation of AWACS (airborne warning and control system) aircraft, such as the Boeing E-3. Moreover, mid-air refuelling and stealth technology have provided the USA w
