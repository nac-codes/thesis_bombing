ol of air war has come through the creation of AWACS (airborne warning and control system) aircraft, such as the Boeing E-3. Moreover, mid-air refuelling and stealth technology have provided the USA with enormous superiority over rival powersand an almost unchallenged capability to intervene anywhere on the planet. Theincreasing accuracy and ability to avoid euphemistically titled “collateral damage” hasalso enhanced the acceptability of intervention. One estimation of growing capability has argued that during the Gulf War, to destroy a target which previously took 4,500  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 211 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 200B-17 or 95 F-105 sorties, now required just one F-117 (stealth bomber).1 The political advantages of such “clean” actions, however artificial the circumstances may have appeared in the war against Iraq, are clear. Although the development of ballistic missile technology by the late 1950s and early 1960s (ICBMs and SLBMs for example) seemed to undermine the developmentand role of air power, by taking away the strategic aspect of air forces, the importanceof air power to military strategy and thinking remained. Indeed, during the arms reduction and limitation talks of the 1970s and 1980s, the respective levels of certain types of aircraft (the “Backfire” bomber for example) stayed at the forefront ofnegotiations. Moreover, in the post-Cold War world, where the tactical and operationalaspects of conflict have, temporarily at least, eclipsed intercontinental strategic power,air forces have returned to prominence in military thinking. Clearly the importance of“cutting edge” military technology to major powers has resulted in new developments in the relationship between government, industry and the military. The growth of powerful aero-industries and the formation of the so-called “military-industrial” complexhas been a source of much debate. The issue has arisen that governments have beenforced or persuaded to buy the late
