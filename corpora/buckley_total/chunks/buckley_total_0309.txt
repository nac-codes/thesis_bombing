ful aero-industries and the formation of the so-called “military-industrial” complexhas been a source of much debate. The issue has arisen that governments have beenforced or persuaded to buy the latest military technology by a combination of industrialprofiteers and rampant militarists. Undoubtedly, the desire to maintain parity or tobetter the enemy was a major aim during the Cold War, and the demands of air power were at the forefront of this drive, but it is arguably the case that the heads of the aero-industries in the aftermath of the Second World War did not want to becometoo entangled and reliant on government financing. Circumstances dictated otherwise,and the perception that the USA and the USSR constantly had to compete witheach other was one predicated on many beliefs and policies. 2 Nevertheless, it is clear that the demands of technological improvement and refinement have played a major part, more so than in the interwar era, in shaping the development of air power in the post-war world. The end of totality The impact of air power on the development of total war was profound, as has beenexplored, but, in the post-war world, certain aspects of this interaction have obviouslyaltered significantly. With the emergence of potential nuclear destruction, the likelihood of long, drawn out attritional wars between major powers has all but been eliminated,  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 212 --- AIR POWER AND THE POST -WAR WORLD 201certainly since the middle of the 1950s, and thus the widespread mobilization of national resources and the concomitant demands made by air power during wartimehas, for the major powers, ceased to be an issue. However, the depth of technological mobilization, even in peace time, has been maintained and almost certainly increased, with critical repercussions. Whereas theinvestment in new technology, in the USA prior to 1941, was in profitable capitalgoods, after 1945, it has been argued, the military persisted in focusing the dev
