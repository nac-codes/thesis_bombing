th critical repercussions. Whereas theinvestment in new technology, in the USA prior to 1941, was in profitable capitalgoods, after 1945, it has been argued, the military persisted in focusing the developmentof new technology on the arms race and in particular on nuclear and air powerweapons. The impact of this has been lower levels of investment in non-military high technology and the surrendering of the lead in this field to nations such as Japan. 3 Ultimately, the need to maintain technological parity and, if possible, superiority, has become vital and, arguably in the closing stages of the Cold War, decisive. Moreover, ithas been argued that the inability of the Soviet Union to meet the technologicaldemands of NATO’s 1980s policy of the air-land battle and Follow-On Forces Attack(FOFA), which appeared to undermine significantly the Warsaw Pact’s superiority in ground forces, was a key reason in the shift and ultimate collapse of Soviet defence policy. 4 Therefore, air power in the post-war era, and certainly in the past 20 years, has made a more focused and specific demand on aero-industries, but in its way it isarguably more total. Consequently, both superpowers, and to a lesser extent the mediumpowers, have made continuing and strenuous efforts to maintain the heavy technologicalcommitment to air power, be it manned or missile based. The totality of air power’s impact on civilian populations has also developed in the post-war world. Although nuclear weapons arguably reduced the likelihood ofArmageddon being visited upon them, populations have had to accept that they havebecome priority targets and if war did come it would almost certainly be total in itsimpact and destruction. Unlike the popular perceptions prior to World War II, whenit was expected that air bombardment would take days or even weeks to bring about the destruction of urban life, in the age of the four minute warning and when nuclear holocaust threatened civilization itself, the totality of the
