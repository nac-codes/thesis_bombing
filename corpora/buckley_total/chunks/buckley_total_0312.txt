and the USSR continued to be embroiled in indirect confrontation and, moreover, it was to become apparent that in anything other thandirect confrontation, nuclear attack was neither credible nor realistic. The threat of nuclear annihilation, which was to be largely responsible for the obsolescence of total war by the late 1950s, did not prevent the Cold War from breaking out in other areas of the globe and on different levels and thus the notion that strategic air power hadbrought in an era of total peace cannot be accepted. Conventional air power was also rendered relatively ineffective in the post-war world and this was perhaps more surprising. In no serious conflict were the westernpowers able to deploy conventional or tactical air power with any degree of decisiveness, that is, until Saddam Hussein offered an obliging target in 1991. Indeed, the predilection with strategic air power and the move to non-conventional forms of conflict repeatedlyundermined the role air power could play in the post-war era. Clearly, the development and trends in air power since 1945, certainly on the largest scale, have been away from total war and towards maintenance of peace and low-levelconflict, and in the former case strategic nuclear air power has been successful. Not only has major war become politically unacceptable and hence unlikely, the speed with which it has been widely accepted that full scale war would escalate into anuclear confrontation has meant that mobilization of industries and economies onto  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 214 --- AIR POWER AND THE POST -WAR WORLD 203a total war footing has equally become unthinkable and pointless. The war would be over long before this was possible or indeed necessary. In addition, the deployment of conventional air power on a scale large enough and total enough to reach levels similar to World War II has not occurred, for a number of reasons. First, western air powers have been confronted with non-conventional orlow-in
