n a scale large enough and total enough to reach levels similar to World War II has not occurred, for a number of reasons. First, western air powers have been confronted with non-conventional orlow-intensity wars, such as Vietnam and Afghanistan, in which the full array of airpower has not, and could not, be used for political reasons and was, in any case, foundto be wanting when employed in peoples’ wars. Moreover, unless an enemy power hasbeen willing to fight an open, full scale conflict the effectiveness of air power has fallen away dramatically. The Gulf War proved what air power is technically capable of, but in confrontations in Afghanistan, Somalia and Bosnia, major powers were eitherunwilling or unable to utilize air power to the full. However, where air power has been utilized by minor powers, further restraints have become apparent, underlining trends in the development of the nature of air power.Minor powers, unless backed by client superpowers, as in the case of Israel and the USA, have been unable to deploy air power with any degree of decisiveness because of the huge demands made of them by sustained air conflict. The Iran–Iraq war forexample, illustrated that neither state was capable of maintaining a credible air poweroffensive because of the costs and levels of attrition involved. This resulted in thelowering of the level of technology deployed to reduce costs and maintain belligerency,thus decreasing effectiveness. The ability of a state to sustain air war probably now only rests with the major powers, and possibly only with the USA. Clearly the gap between the first rate military powers and the others has grown steadily since the latenineteenth century and, as we move into the new millennium, the rise in individualunit costs of aircraft has reached such levels that for the first time medium powerssuch as Britain and France, previously considered first rate air powers, have begun toadopt new methods of maintaining leading air power status, such as
