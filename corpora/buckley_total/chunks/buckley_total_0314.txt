uch levels that for the first time medium powerssuch as Britain and France, previously considered first rate air powers, have begun toadopt new methods of maintaining leading air power status, such as collaborative international development programmes and the possibility of accepting lower levels of technical proficiency to increase available numbers. Therefore, far from emerging from the ruins of World War II as the supreme and omniscient force, air power has struggled to assert itself and its impact has been patchyand far short of what many in 1945 might have expected. It could be argued that airpower as a pivotal weapon of total war had clearly proved its case during the Second World War, but from 1945 onwards, in many ways, it has failed to adapt to an age when total war has become less and less likely.

The emergence of a force with the capacity to raze cities to the ground with one bomb elevated, or degenerated, waronto a different level. The management and handling of this new weapon was todominate not just air power but theories and strategies for the conduct of war as awhole in the post-war period. Ultimately, air theorists and strategists were to spendthe next 40 years considering how to use nuclear weapons on a variety of levels, such as political, diplomatic and strategic, to the detriment of most other forms of air power and rarely with any degree of major success. Curiously however, less consideration wasgiven to how to use nuclear weapons in a military sense. A sophisticated approach totargeting and planning was often lacking. The primary concern of air power strategists, and indeed most military thinkers between 1945 and the early 1990s, was the confrontation between the USA and the USSR, wi
