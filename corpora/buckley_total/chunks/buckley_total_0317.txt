e stockpile of atomic bombs numbered nine and the assembling of more would take three days with yet more time required to transport them to the operationalbases. 11 Moreover, in early 1947 the US Strategic Air Command (SAC) had only six technicians available to arm such bombs and only ten B-29 bombers and 20 trained aircrews to deliver them. Still further, no air force A-bomb assembly teams would beavailable until the end of 1947 to replace their civilian predecessors. 12 Nevertheless, the strategic aim of US atomic forces was in theory already crystallizing and was based around the notion that 80 per cent of the USSR’s industrial centres were within rangeof B-29s based in western Europe and the Middle East. 13 Clearly however, SAC was in no fit state to carry out such a plan and, in any case, the fusing of air power potential and national strategy was yet to occur. Clearly Harry Borowski’s claim that US strategicair power in the late 1940s was merely a hollow threat rings true. 14 The rise to prominence of nuclear based strategy occurred over the period between 1947 and 1954 when the USA’s world position clarified and certain key events propelledthe US government in the direction of deterrence and a defence policy reliant on nuclear arms. Although atomic bombing had been included in US strategic thinking since 1947, it was never central, partly because Truman had grave reservations about  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 217 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 206deploying them.15 Moreover, by the time the Korean War broke out in 1950, the USSR had surprised the US by exploding its own atomic bomb, and the political scenario effectively precluded the early use of nuclear weapons by the Americans. Despite the calls by MacArthur for the use of atomic bombs, it took until the closingstages of the war for the US government to go as far as intimating that they might be used, and even then, it has been argued, the impact of the threat on the North Koreans and their
