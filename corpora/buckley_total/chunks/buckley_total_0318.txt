until the closingstages of the war for the US government to go as far as intimating that they might be used, and even then, it has been argued, the impact of the threat on the North Koreans and their supporters was overestimated. 16 However, the Korean War was a key turning point. The success of the UN operation was tempered by the prohibitive cost of deploying large scale conventional forces, and ultimately, or so it seemed, the issue had been decided by the threat of nuclear force.Moreover, although the supremacy of the USAF’s nuclear forces had been undermined by the arrival of the Soviet atomic bomb, new developments were already underway to strengthen the American position and regain temporary nuclear superiority. 17 Most notably this included the development of the hydrogen bomb, which was viewed by the US government as a measure to create a short term defensive deterrent which would allow the USA to build the expanded conventional forces required for thenew world role the Americans had created for themselves, and which the Korean War had clearly demonstrated the West was lacking. 18 For SAC, the war was timely to say the least. General Curtis LeMay’s appointment as commander of SAC in 1948 had seen the beginning of a process of change and modernization, with LeMay determined not to allow the strategic air force to be caught unprepared and unawares as it was in 1942 over Germany.19 Clearly much had to be accomplished and the USAF was horrified by its inability to offer an alternative during the Berlin Crisis of 1948–9, as the European based atomic forces were inadequate and effectively ignored by the Soviets.20 The Korean War proved to be a major boost, therefore, by precipitating the injection of resources to allow the USAF to carry out a nuclear role if need be, something that clearly did not exist prior to 1950. T o prevent this impotence occurring again it was accepted that a standing ready force for use incrisis situations was necessary. It was not accep
