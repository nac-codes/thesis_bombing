ions, and clearly the aspiration of the Truman administration, as stated in the NATO Lisbon goals, of wanting to create new conventional forces to make the western world defensible without recourse to nuclear arms, was financially ruinousand untenable. 23 Eisenhower was also convinced that any war in Europe would rapidly escalate to a nuclear war, and thus such weapons were a viable and acceptable part of the strategic environment in which the USA was situated. The best way to preventsuch a war was to base defence on a clear and solid policy of deterrence through strong nuclear forces. During the summer of 1953 Project Solarium  was carried out to establish the USA’s new defensive thinking, eventually being formalized in NSC (National Security Council) 162/2 in October 1953. In this so-called “New Look” strategy, future emphasis was to be placed on the use of nuclear weapons to deter further Soviet aggression, and SAC’scapability was to be the cornerstone of the policy. Any major act of Soviet aggression was to be met with the threat of a massive nuclear attack by the USA’s strategic air forces. However, SAC was still in no fit state to meet this demand and would not beuntil the middle of the 1950s, and therefore USAF’s slice of the defence budget was to be increased to 46 per cent, considerably more than either the navy or the army, clearly emphasizing the status of air power in US defence planning. 24 Moreover, to make good continuing deficiencies in conventional forces in Europe it was accepted that tactical nuclear weapons would be used to supplement conventional NATO forces in order to defeat the superior Eastern Bloc ground forces.25 Eisenhower’s long-haul strategy of creating a solid defence policy based on lower costs resulted in $8.4 billion dollars being shaved off the defence budget – clearly a “bigger bang for a buck” as was stated by one defence secretary.26 The policy was underpinned by a speech made by Secretary of State John F . Dulles in January 195
