kened Soviet economy in the post-war era is testimony to the importance attached to the acquisition of a comparable device to the Americanbomb. The demands made on Soviet investment at a time when reconstruction was urgently required fused with espionage to produce a plutonium atomic device by 1949, although it appears that the USSR would have had a bomb by 1951/52 withoutoutside input anyway. Stalin was conscious that a world where the USA had atomic weapons, and the USSR did not, would be unacceptable and a clear symbol of the superiority of thecapitalist West over the communist East. Before the USSR had acquired atomic weapons, Stalin’s policy was one of bluff, in which he pursued a belligerent foreign policy that belied his concern over the American atomic monopoly. By conducting the policieshe did, for example over the Berlin crisis, Stalin attempted to convince the West that atomic weapons mattered little in foreign policy. Despite the heavy burden, Stalin determined to pursue the policy, even when others counselled a more conciliatoryapproach to East–West relations. The long term cost was the acceptance of a ruinous arms race with the USA, first to attain atomic capability, then thermonuclear weapons, followed by ballistic missiles, and ultimately the capacity for mutually assured destruction.Although Stalin died in 1953, he had already set in motion a policy that successive Soviet leaders could do little about. With the Cold War already deep and hostility and rivalry endemic, the moment to avert the arms race and the age of nuclear plenty hadpassed long before the middle of the 1950s. It must also be stated that the cost of conciliation with the USA in the late 1940s was one that few Soviets, and certainly not Stalin, would have been willing to accept. 30 By the middle of the 1950s, the course and nature of the development of strategic air power in the era of the Cold War was set and, although manned bombers were to be replaced by intercontinental ballistic
