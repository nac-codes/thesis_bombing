middle of the 1950s, the course and nature of the development of strategic air power in the era of the Cold War was set and, although manned bombers were to be replaced by intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launchedballistic missiles (SLBMs), the essence remained much the same, despite being intensified in the 1960s with the emergence of mutually assured destruction. One sideâ€™s developments resulted in a counter by the opposition and a general unwillingness toaccept any perceived vulnerability led to mistrust and antipathy. The arms race epitomizedthe perceived place strategic nuclear air power, be it bomber or missile based, had to  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 221 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 210play in international politics and strategy. The newly elected President Kennedy came to believe that a budget deficit would not cripple the US economy and thus, in contrast to Eisenhower, was happy to expand the US defence programme along the lines urged by his military advisor, Maxwell Taylor. By the early 1960s, the USA held1,000 Minuteman and 54 Titan ICBMs, 41 Polaris submarines, each with 16 SLBMs and a force of nuclear bombers, largely created in an effort to eradicate a perceived technological inferiority to the Soviet Union following the launch of Sputnik in1957. 31 Soon after, the USSR launched a new expansion and development programme to make good a perceived deficiency supposedly exposed during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. Still further, in the late 1960s, the USA developed multiple independentlytargetable re-entry vehicles (MIR V) to make up for an apparent inferiority in the respective numbers of missiles held by the superpowers. 32 Indeed, although US missile levels stayed at 1,750 from 1967 onwards the number of warheads carried expandedto a staggering 7,000, more than enough to destroy all Soviet cities many times over. 33 Wholly new strategies were developed to control or deploy such weapons of mass destructio
