and development of Cold War strategies. Little of advantage was ever gained out of the possession of nuclear weapons, other than theavoidance of suffering the disadvantage of not possessing them. Even in the latter case,  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 222 --- AIR POWER AND THE POST -WAR WORLD 211as existed in the late 1940s, the use of such power, even if the Americans had actually possessed it, was effectively unthinkable without considerable and direct military provocation. The use of military force has invariably rested on notions of proportionality and it would have been, and still would be, unthinkable for a state to respond to a minor skirmish or low intensity conflict with nuclear retaliation. It has been argued that the fire bombings of Dresden and Hamburg were disproportionately destructive when measured against the strategic and political benefits gained. That is an arguable case but a nuclear strike against Vietnam in 1968 by the USA, or by Britain against Buenos Aires in 1982, were not: both would have been politically unacceptable and both demonstrated the impotence of nuclear arms in confrontations with lesser powers, or indeed against any power in a low or medium threat scenario. This latter case was always the concern of NATO, for the nagging doubt remained that the USA would not risk, or offer a viable and credible threat of, strategic nuclear escalation to “save” Europe from a conventional Soviet attack. Tactical and conventional air power Therefore, by the early 1960s, strategic nuclear air power had reached an impasse and, since that time, the more interesting and far reaching air power developments have come in the tactical and, for the most part, conventional field. Ultimately, the perceived growth in the effectiveness of tactical air power in the 1980s was to have pivotal strategic consequences. However, in the two decades after World War II the decline in tactical air power capability was remarkable and, perhaps until the 1980s, only
