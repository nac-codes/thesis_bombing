in the 1980s was to have pivotal strategic consequences. However, in the two decades after World War II the decline in tactical air power capability was remarkable and, perhaps until the 1980s, only Israel, in peculiar circumstances, was able to marry air power to strategic national goals in an effective manner. The Korean War exposed many failings in the tactical air forces of even the USA and the emphasis on strategic air power in the years after World War II had led to the clear neglect of other areas of air capability. General Weyland, the air officer commanding US Far East air forces, famously stated that what was remembered from World War II was not written down, or if written down was not disseminated, or if disseminated was not read or properly understood.35 Tactical air power equipment had not moved on since 1945, and indeed was less plentiful, while more importantly the air forces lacked direction. Air superiority was roughly maintained throughout the conflict by the western forces but because there was no overall integration of air power into offensive land operations, tactical air forces achieved only a minimal impact.

Such thinking was to have a deleterious effect on the ability of US air power in Vietnam. In other ways Korea was to be a watershed in the founding of the western alliance and NATO. The Westâ€™s limitations were exposed in the Far East and plans were put in hand to remedy the situation with attention naturally be
