World War had supposedly proven that an enemy with no or little air support was at the mercy of astate with strong air capability and determined ground units. However, Vietnam wasnot the kind of conflict the USAF and the other US air forces had trained for, nor didthey relish it. Indeed, both the limited nature and style of the war confronting theUSA combined to dissipate the advantages air power might have brought. Perhaps most importantly, the air forces were never allowed to impose themselves as they had in World War II, but in addition the terrain and the existing force structure ofthe US air forces helped to hinder their activities still further.

US air power losses to enemy action amounted to an incredible 2,561 aeroplanes and 3,587 helicopters.43 In essence, US air forces were deployed as political and diplomatic weapons and were only used in a stuttering and limited fashion, which in effect forced both Vietnam and the western forces to suffer a slow and lingering period of death and destruction.US B-52 bombers dropped around 3,750,000 tons of bombs on southeast Asia duringUS involvement in the region, but only some six per cent on the source of Americanconcerns, North Vietnam. When finally unleashed in 1972, during Operation Linebacker, the US air forces were able to demonstrate their military effectiveness, in particular during Linebacker II,  with over 700 B-52 sorties being undertaken over an 11 day period in December 1972. 44 However, the notion that the North Vietnamese were “bombed” back to the negotiating table is something of a myth. They were looking totalk anyway, aware as they were of the Americans’ weakening resolve. Even if are
