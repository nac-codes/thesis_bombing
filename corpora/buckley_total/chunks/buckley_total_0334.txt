were eventually able to deployair power to questionable strategic effect in 1972, the USSR did not have that option owing to the nature of the campaign. Air power was able to deliver a stalemate in Afghanistan but without recourse to a brutal and protracted ground campaign in  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 227 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 216which heavy losses would naturally have been incurred, outright military victory for either side was an unlikely option.46 The inability of air forces to impose themselves on non-standard conflicts has been illustrated many times in the post-war era, but Vietnam and latterly Afghanistan have been the most vivid examples. The attention paid to nuclear options in Europe hasbeen partly responsible, but the most obvious reason for their failing has been the fact that air forces, by their very nature, can have only a limited impact in less than full scale war. Moreover, in the post-war world, actions have often taken place in the full glareof world attention and the acceptability of tactics used by the colonial powers was thus greatly reduced. In what amounted to policing or containment operations in the post-war era, air forces could play only a supportive role (for example, transport,reconnaissance and logistics). There are clear political and physical constraints on what air forces can do in such circumstances as was the case in Bosnia or Somalia, for example. Maritime air power has suffered in the post-war world from the lack of a clearly identifiable enemy. The US Navy ended World War II as the most powerful, but maritime opponents have not emerged since 1945 to offer a viable threat. Only in the late 1960sdid the USSR begin to develop significant surface naval power, but it was never even close to being a major threat, and nor was it particularly important to Soviet strategy. The dominance of air power in maritime strategy provoked questions in the post-waryears over the validity of maintaining large carrier ba
