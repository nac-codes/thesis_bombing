eat, and nor was it particularly important to Soviet strategy. The dominance of air power in maritime strategy provoked questions in the post-waryears over the validity of maintaining large carrier battle groups akin to those used to defeat Japan, as the peculiar circumstances which led to the nature of fighting witnessed in the Pacific War were highly unlikely to be repeated. Moreover, in the 1950s and1960s, with nuclear considerations dominating, the value of investment in conventional carrier forces was seriously questioned, and indeed continues to be so. In the context of the Cold War, and in a strategic sense, the US Navy’s air-maritime forces played a limited role but, as a means of dominating a given area in a conventional manner, carrier battle groups and their air forces have proven effective, for example offering sustained support during the USA’s involvement in Korea and Vietnam. Theargument that such fleets are expensive white elephants has not really been sustained, especially when carriers offer a high degree of flexibility in a supportive, policing or low-intensity conflict scenario. Even medium powers such as France and Britain havemaintained greater world roles by their ability to offer air support in a flexible manner from sea-based platforms. However, the US Navy considers that its carrier groups are not suited to full scale war environments and are best deployed as symbols of intent inlow intensity situations. If so, questions regarding the returns on investments in such  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 228 --- AIR POWER AND THE POST -WAR WORLD 217forces emerge if they are so limited. However, while it remains unlikely that an air- naval war between two major powers will occur, the real role of carrier groups has andwill continue to be to offer a relatively secure, mobile and flexible military capability, as well as providing an important political and diplomatic weapon amid the confusion of threats and problems likely to emerge in the twent
