a relatively secure, mobile and flexible military capability, as well as providing an important political and diplomatic weapon amid the confusion of threats and problems likely to emerge in the twenty-first century. 47 Perhaps the most successful linking of conventional air power to national strategic goals occurred away from the superpower confrontation, in Israel, although as with all international affairs in the Cold War period the USSR–USA struggle had a peripheralinfluence. The survival of Israel in the post-1945 world has perhaps been the nearest approximation to a total war, though actual conflict has been sporadic and since the late-1970s the level of direct threat to Israel has receded. Nevertheless, Israel used airpower to great effect to defeat her Arab adversaries and in doing so demonstrated what air power, in a true international war situation, was capable of. However, caveats must be noted and not least the fact that these were conventional conflicts between states fought over open terrain. Moreover, although air power was crucially effective in 1967, it was less so in 1973 and in the Lebanon campaign of the 1980s the limits of an air force’s ability to intervene in non-standard operations wereagain illustrated. In addition, although Israel has been able to link air power to clear national goals and strategies in a more effective manner than others, it must also be remembered that they have had a forgiving and generous sponsor in the USA fromwhom considerable resources have flowed to allow Israel to be aggressive with her air forces. Arguably, without such support and in a long and protracted campaign, Israeli air power would have declined in a similar manner to the air forces deployed by Iranand Iraq in the war of the 1980s. 48 With the collapse of the Soviet Union, contemporary air power has been confronted with a radically altered environment and one in which two extremes of operationshave been illustrated. First, throughout most of the 1990s, air
