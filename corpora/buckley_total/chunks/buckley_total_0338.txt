there is little evidence to support the notion that air power would be as decisive. Future air power forces are clearly going to need a high degree of flexibility to meet requirements for operations as varied as Bosnia and the Gulf – both are possibilities in the twenty-first century. Moreover, strategic level nuclear forces have not been made redundant with the collapse of the Soviet Union, although their holdon military thinking and strategic thought has largely been broken. Conclusions There have been a number of changes in the relationship of air power to war, strategyand peace in the post-1945 era. Most notable has been the loosening of the grip oftotal war as the manner in which conflicts between major powers are ultimately resolved. The likely levels of destruction which would accrue from such a conflict in the age of nuclear weapons have meant that in many ways the links between air warand mobilization of economies and mass industries have been broken. The apogee of total war between 1939 and 1945 demonstrated that mass mobilization of a nation’s, indeed many nations’, resources were required to sustain an effective air war campaign.However, the post-1945 world has been very different. Not only did the spectre of nuclear holocaust emerge, but the technology of aircraft increased dramatically to such levels that mass mobilization and attritional campaigns were untenable. Whatbecame necessary in the Cold War world was not mass mobilization, but harnessing of specific parts of industry and the economy to meet the needs of air power. The technological aspects of this “war without fighting” made huge demands, however,and ultimately the USSR was unable to maintain parity. In contrast, the USA arguablydevoted such resources to this war that by the late-1980s the industrial and  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 230 --- AIR POWER AND THE POST -WAR WORLD 219technological lead forged out the Second World War had been frittered away in profligate and highly focused
