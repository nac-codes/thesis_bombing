Clearly, although in many ways the age of total war had passed, the demands of air power on a nationâ€™s material and psychological resources remained. The threat ofnuclear destruction hung constantly over the world for decades in a manner more intense than the fear of massed bombing attack in the 1930s, and while open war between the superpowers never broke out, conflict by proxy, through client states,continued right up to the collapse of the Soviet Union. In these instances air power was a key factor, initially being the sole instrument of deterrent, and ultimately being a key factor in the technological escalation that precipitated the disintegration of theEastern Bloc. As the twentieth century draws to a close, the influence air power continues to exert over military activity, now more likely to be conventional and limited in aims andlevels of intensity, remains crucial. Although the post-war years have again reiterated the point that air power cannot act alone and nor can it be the sole determining factor in the development of strategies, it has become abundantly clear that operationsmust be supported by effective and efficient air power. Even in confused scenarios such as Bosnia, air forces have a key role to play in offering flexibility and supporting firepower, and with the receding threat of nuclear war it is in the conventional fieldthat air power will continue to play its most significant role.

In just 50 years or so, air power developed from the first controlled flight to the level of destroying cities and whole societies with, by the 1950s at least, r
