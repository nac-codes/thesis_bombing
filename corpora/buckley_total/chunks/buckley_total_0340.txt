wer: a cause and measure of total war? In just 50 years or so, air power developed from the first controlled flight to the level of destroying cities and whole societies with, by the 1950s at least, remarkably little effort. During this revolutionary period, the age of total war came and went as did, quite possibly, the apogee of air power. Certainly the kind of mass air power and total mobilization of effort seen in World War II will not be witnessed again in anything like the same manner: far too many economic, technological and political factors would preclude it. However, this is not to state that air power no longer exerts significant influence over military and political activity as it quite evidently does. But the nature and extent of air power born in the Great War, which struggled to assert itself in the interwar years, and then ultimately which played a crucial and arguably pivotal role in World War II, is now a phenomenon of the past. Air power in the age of total war, as has been seen, changed both the “face” and the “body” of war. For those involved in the fighting, the harnessing of air power became fundamental to survival. Even in the Great War, failure to utilize air strength effectively could result in disaster and, by the Second World War, air power was critical to success. Indeed, much of Germany’s achievement in the 1939–42 period rested on air superiority and the effective implementation of air doctrine developed in the interwar era. Although not the sole cause of Germany’s defeat, it is no surprise that the Luftwaffe ’s sharp decline coincided with Germany’s failure and collapse from 1942 onwards, notably even when German ground forces maintained their unit-for-unit superiority over  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 232 --- CONCLUSIONS 221both Soviet and western Allied forces. Japan, similarly, slid to defeat: as initial air superiority was frittered away or sacrificed in attritional battles, so effective and sustained belligerency drained
