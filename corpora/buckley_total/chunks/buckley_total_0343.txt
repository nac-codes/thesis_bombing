made obsolete by nuclear armed air forces, as some have argued, but it had become so potentially destructive that war had to beconducted by other means. When so constrained, air power has been less effective. Airstrength is still crucial to traditional military success, but in order to be fully effective,restraints have to be removed and in limited war environments this cannot be the case.Moreover, new modes of conflict such as terrorism and guerrilla activity, to say nothing of peace enforcement and anti-drug trafficking duties, have offered new challenges to which air power has only slowly adapted. In the post-Cold War world these are thechallenges which air power must now confront in a manner which arguably it did notin the period between 1945 and 1991. There is little doubt that air power transformed warfare in the most revolutionary manner, quite possibly, since humankind first started organizing itself into antipathetic tribal groupings. The escalation of war into the skies was a culmination of the drive towards mass industrial war, a trend begun a century before as western civilization firststarted linking economic strength with military capability on an ever increasing scale.In addition, the impact on society was significant indeed, shaping and changingperceptions of the role and place of war in the modern world. By the 1914–1945 era,war had become “total” indeed, and the emergence of air power as a decisive force, and one which required vast economic resources, was a critical multiplying factor in this transformation. Thus, air power and total war were linked as both causes andconsequences of each other, shaping and deepening the experience of war in thetwentieth century to a degree unknown in modern history.
