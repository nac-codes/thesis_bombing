If the organization sends out mixed signals about its mission or its dedication to its mission, it can hardly complain if professionalism and commitment to the mission falter among its people. Thus, I think that both the heart and soul have failed each other in the Air Force. It is kind of like the mutual failure of loyalty, up and down, at CBS, as described  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 19 --- xviii The Icarus Syndrome by Peggy Noonan in What I Saw at the Revolution (pp. 37,38). Obviously, I think that dedication has to start at the top and flow downward until people gain confidence and faith that the organization is worthy of commitment.2 General Ford's reaction was immediate and positive; he thought these ideas were worth pursuing with a wider audience at the Air University. At the end of May, General Ford sponsored my briefing (which I titled, "In Search of the Air Force Soul, Take II") to the senior leadership of the Air University, including its commander, Lieutenant General Charles Boyd. In that briefing, I advanced the thesis of this analysis: Many of the Air Force's current institutional problems could be laid at the doorstep of its neglect of air power theory as the basis for its mission or purpose. General Boyd thought that the thesis was worthy of further investigaÂ­ tion to see if it could be supported by evidence. He asked me what I would propose to do next in the absence of instructions from him. I asked for time to think about his question and get back to him, which he granted. It became clear that there was more than one essay here; and I started listing them by topic and argument. When the list quickly exceeded five, I knew that there was a book-length analysis lurking in the thesis. And that is what I proposed to General Ford a week later. By early June, I had my marching orders from General Boyd; and this analysis is a direct consequence. A first draft was available by the
