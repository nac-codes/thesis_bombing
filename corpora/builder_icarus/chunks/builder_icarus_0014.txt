proud theory of air power, even though, for most, The affection was really, if truth be known, for the airplane. They wielded the theory as a sword to gain their independence And to claim primacy in military power, Demonstrating it with a stunning monument to Armageddon. But there were other dreamers abroad who looked to the stars And made robots that might take them there, Only to find their tickets had been taken by other robots. The aviators accepted the robots, as servants, into their house, Not because they liked them or even understood them, But because neighbors had eagerly bid for their ownership. The robots, however, kept challenging the boundaries of the theory With which the aviators had won their freedom, Built their house, and enshrined their monument to Armageddon. The aviators, alas, instead of expanding their theory to the stars And extending the house to include its new domains, Revealed by every decision their true affection, the airplane. Throughout years of plenty, it became accepted throughout the house, That there was more than enough for all, Whatever their particular affection for vehicle or trade or domain. And in those separate devotions, the unity of the house slowly fractured; To be sure, the aviators continued to own the house, But no longer the loyalty of its occupants. For in the absence of the aviator's dedication to the theory, There was no household commitment to mission And, ultimately, inevitably, no profession of arms. Thus, the house is now besieged, from without and within; The world, once owned, has become hostile; And both occupants and neighbors are pulling their shades. â€”Carl Builder xxii  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 24 --- PARTI TAKING BEARINGS  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 26 --- 1 A View of the Air Force Today The United States has not won a war since the Air Force was established as a separate service in 1947. We ought to do away with the Air Force and give the aircraft back to the Army and Navy.' Th
