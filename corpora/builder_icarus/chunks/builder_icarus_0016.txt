A View of the Air Force Today is a collection of symptoms, partial diagnoses, and tentative prescriptions; and along with other frequently heard complaints, it represents prima facie evidence of a problem, like the complaints and speculations of a patient in pain, real or imagined, worthy of being heard and considered.

For those reasons, A View of the Air Force Today deserves careful examination. What are the specific charges in the indictment? Do the diagnoses reflect the symptoms? Will the prescriptions match the diag­ noses? To answer those kinds of questions, I prefer to resort to analysis rather than summary judgments of the paper. Hence, I have undertaken a content analysis of the paper identical to those I have also made for two other landmark policy papers, The Maritime Strategy4 and Global Reach —Global Power.5 Those analyses begin with methodical abstracting of the document. The abstract is designed to capture the ideas and arguments with minimum words, shorn of supporting evidence or examples except where those are, themselves, the ideas and arguments.

The headings are as found in the original. The compression achieved in this process is about four-to-one with respect to the original. With much of the obligatory rhetoric and supporting
