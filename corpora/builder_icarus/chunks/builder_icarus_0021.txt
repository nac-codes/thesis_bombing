of the Maritime Strategy. The Air Force is more likely to be reacting rather than taking the initiative in roles and missions debates. The air power school of thought has not kept pace with events. For an institution on the leading edge of technology, the reactionary posture of the Air Force seems surprising. But what should be more surprising is the vacuum of thought about the promising roles and future of air power. Consensus within the Air Force may not come easily. Some in the Air Force don't even believe that air power should any longer claim to be independently decisive.

Air Force spending, as a percentage of the DoD total, has dropped to about two thirds of its 1958 high. During the last half of the 1980s, the Air Force funding cuts were larger than those for the other services. These cuts may not seem large, but they are cumulative and get magnified in their effects. For example, the National Foreign Intelligence Program accounts are concentrated in the Air Force and are growing, accounting for more than ten percent of Air Force spending. At the same time, Air Force strategic forces spending was down, while Navy strategic forces spending was up. Air Force spending on general purpose forces and on research, development, test, and engineering (RDT&E) has not tracked favorably against the DoD changes in these program areas. All these trends combine to paint a dismal fiscal picture for the Air Force, as compared with the other services during this time of growing fiscal constraints. During the last half of the 1980s, cuts in the Air Force budget exceeded the combined cuts in the Army and Navy. Worse, because of mandated and protected programs, what was hurt most was the Air Force investments in the future. The Air Force lost $46 billion, while the other two services each lost less than $22
