in favor of management. Egalitarianism has gutted the elites. But shifting the demographics of the Air Force won't ensure a vision. The complexity of Air Force systems and operations demands specialists and specialized training. What is needed is thinking beyond those demands. Even if there were more operators, they wouldn't necessarily be thinking about broader strategic issues because current senior Air Force operators see themselves mainly as the suppliers of sorties—unlike their Army and Navy counterparts. This doesn't deny that operators could or should be the source of the needed vision, only that having more operators will automatically provide it. The vision must come from a larger process within the institution and from those who hold power in it. The following guidelines for a vision are suggested: 1. The needed vision must find the unifying thread in all Air Force tasks. Perhaps it will be found in the third dimension which air power brings to surface warfare. Perhaps that would free the Air Force from measuring its capabilities in terms of the surface battle and to accept all forms or types of Air Force capabilities, whether manned or not, combat as well as support, and regardless of trajectory or penetration. 2. The focus should be on air power as a tool at the operational or theater level of war. Just as the Maritime Strategy focuses on controlling access and the continental strategy focuses on controlling location, perhaps air power can do both. 3. The Air Force heritage should be mined, particularly the work of Kenney in the Southwest Pacific, where air power was used as an integrated whole. All elements— strategic, tactical and transport—were used against the enemy. 4. Jointness, properly interpreted, should be exploited. Kenney, working jointly, brought air power from almost nothing to the dominant instrument in the theater campaign.
