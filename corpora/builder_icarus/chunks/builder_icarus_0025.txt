Force fell silent. So did the critics of complex and costly, high-technology weaponry. The "defense reformers" turned their attacks away from what the American military was doing wrong and focused, instead, on how fast the "threat" was evaporating and how fast defense expenditures should be reduced to keep pace.9 Moreover, not all the lessons of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm are so heartening.
