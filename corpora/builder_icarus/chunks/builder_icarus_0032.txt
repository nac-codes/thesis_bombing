of government. While there were still others with views in between these extremes, the distance between these two was so great as to beg some understanding of their coexistence by people who had access to the same information. After the first few interviews revealed these extremes, we began collect­ ing the evidence offered in support of these views. Surely, if a person of one extreme view was confronted with all the evidence and arguments collected from those at the other extreme, we should be able to see some movement or adjustment; perhaps, (a naive thought) we could even draw these disparate views closer together. After collecting evidence and arguments from both extreme views, we were ready to test our theory. When we found, during the course of an interview, a person holding views close to one of the extremes, we would explain that our interviews had, of course, exposed us to people who held quite different views of the problem. Would they be willing to comment on some of the evidence and arguments offered by those who differed? Without exception, they were most willing, even eager to take on the opposition. Since many of these interviews were conducted in homes or in gracious office settings, I have the visual recollection of the evidence or arguments being laid out on or over coffee tables. We would lay out on the table from  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 42 --- Is There a Problem? 19 our collection what we thought was the best case for the opposing view in the form of a dozen pieces of evidence or argumentation. These pieces might include clinical evidence, research experiments, tests, compara­ tive data, analyses, and closely reasoned theories. Then, the person being interviewed would rise to the challenge and paw through to the collection on the table. Piece by piece, each item would be picked up, examined, and demolished or dismissed. Not one piece would be left. When the table had been figuratively cleared, we would ask the person being intervi
