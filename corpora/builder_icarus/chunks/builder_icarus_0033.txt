e. Piece by piece, each item would be picked up, examined, and demolished or dismissed. Not one piece would be left. When the table had been figuratively cleared, we would ask the person being interviewed to fill the coffee table with their evidence and arguments. Again, they would do so with alacrity. Not only did it give them an opportunity to make their case, but it also gave us the pieces of evidence and argumentation that we needed to fill the coffee table for someone of the opposing view. What we took from one coffee table, we put in our figurative wheelbarrow, to be trundled to the next coffee table, where it was dumped out, only to be dismissed and demolished with ease. This clearing of the coffee table was repeated so many times, by so many reasonable and well-informed people, that it had to be taken into account in the design of strategies for air pollution control. The lesson I learned from these interviews was not that people could be polarized in their views; I knew that going in. What I learned is that people of differing views could look at precisely the same evidence, including considerable amounts of scientific evidence, and come reason­ ably to completely different conclusions. Clearly, more scientific evi­ dence was not going to change these views; the views could be sustained by the ways in which the ample evidence could be interpreted—accepted or dismissed. We have found.. .different views of the problem held and articulated by very well informed, intelligent, and responsible people.... When we see how they interpret and reconcile the commonly available data and arguments with their individual convictions and values, we see little prospect that those views will change simply because of additional data or arguments of like kind. Their views seem to be driven as much by privately held values as by the ambiguous evidence.4 However both sides in this controversy were calling for more scientific tests and analyses. What they were able to do with the
