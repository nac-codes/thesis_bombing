y institutions, is a reflection of the American society and its values. Those are changing, not always and everywhere for the best, and some of the problems of the American society are manifested in the Air Force today in such complaints as careerism, selfishness, impatience, self-gratification over altruism,  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 45 --- 22 The Icarus Syndrome etc. They will get better or change, if and when the American society gets better or changes. I find elements of truth in these and other arguments or viewpoints. They have plausibility and they point in the direction of the obvious; they are not counterintuitive. The same can be said for the polarized arguments about air pollution in the Los Angeles air basin: For some, air pollution is a nuisance; for others it is a hazard. The pertinent question is not which argument is right—several may have truth—but what are the implica­ tions if they were right? Most of the alternative hypotheses listed above imply leaving the institution alone because there is nothing wrong with it, it can only be made worse by meddling, it is already better, it will get better on its own, or it will get better along with the American society or economy. In other words, their implications for intervention are modest, passive, or proscriptive. The premises of The Icarus Syndrome, by contrast, are that the problems of the institution are serious, unique only to the Air Force among the American military institutions, and need to be understood if they are to be wisely corrected. If accepted, they urge informed interven­ tion. Thus, what separates the Icarus premises from the alternative views is not the certainty about which premises are right or wrong, but which premises will require affirmative, informed intervention. Intervention is not necessarily to be preferred; but, if required, it needs to be planned and executed competently like surgery. This analysis is offered in that spirit—not so much to prove which diagnosis
