Force officers may not be any more academically tolerant or broad as those in other services, but I have found them to be intensely intellectual about their business. I define an intellectual as one who likes to play with ideas, who is comfortable with ideas, even radical ideas. Indeed, I have previously observed that the Air Force, consistent with its reverence for technology, has always been the most comfortable of the three services with analysis. The Air Force has relied on analysts from its inception to support operational, developmental, and acquisition decision making at high levels. The airplane, the focal instrument of the theory of air power and independent air forces, was itself conceived and born by means of.. .analyses .... What separates the Air Force from its sister services is how it regards analysis. Air Force officers, as members of an institution whose faith rests on theory and technology, are accustomed to dealing with analysis on every aspect of flight and the application of air power; supporting decisions with analysis is quite natural. Most senior Air Force officers are consumers of, even participants in, the analyses that support internal decision making. Thus, analysis.. .is often regarded as the most effective medium for debate within the Air Force itself.. ..6 I am optimistic because I think this analytical culture—and the intellectual culture it fosters—gives the Air Force a medium to efficiently exchange ideas about the Air Force's institutional problems and their resolution. Whatever the nature and severity of the Air Force's institu­ tional problems may be, it is better equipped with the intellectual tools it needs to expose and resolve them than any of its sister services.
