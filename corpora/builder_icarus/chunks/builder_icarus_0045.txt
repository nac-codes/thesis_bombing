the ghastly carnage of stalemated trench warfare on the grounds; and 2. the terrifying bombing of England from the air, first by zeppelins and then by Gotha bombers. The idea was that air power could be employed, not just as an adjunct to land or sea warfare as conceived by the armies and navies, but as an independent force to bypass bloody, costly and often indecisive engage­ ments by striking directly, quickly, and decisively at the strategic heart of the enemy—the enemy's war-making capabilities. To do that, two additional things loomed as prerequisites: 1. wresting control of the air from the enemy; and 2. wresting control of the airplanes from the land or sea warfare commanders. Both the control of the air and the use of the air to strike at the heart of the enemy would require fleets of superior airplanes. These prospects presented an opportunity for military aviators, and this idea became their cause. Whether or not the theory was correct or valid has been in dispute from the very beginning—particularly its claim to decisiveness in war. Even among the military aviators, there were those who doubted that air power could always be used with decisive effect. Even among those who subscribed to the decisiveness of air power, there were some who argued that control of the air could not be achieved quickly by bombers alone but would require a prior battle among opposing fighter or "pursuit" planes. These arguments continue to reverberate today and cannot be disposed of here. One can be skeptical of the validity of the theory or its claims and still marvel at the role it played in history and, more generally, at the power of theories in the evolution of human institutions. Darwin's theory of natural selection and the evolution of species remains disputed; but its significance in the development of the natural sciences and some religions can not be doubted. The validity of air power theory is not the issue examined here; it is how a theory of air power evolved and wa
