rms of their capabilities. The major threats to the theory were challenges to its basic tenets: that air power could be decisive if wielded independently. Just as the advocates of the theory implicitly challenged the utility and necessity of conven­ tional army and naval forces, its skeptics challenged its claim to decisive­ ness and, hence, its need for independence. The experience of World War II did not resolve these differences, even though the protagonists and antagonists claimed that it proved the correctness of their original arguments or positions. But the advent of the atomic bomb at the end of World War II made the debate academic; the validity of the theory was accepted as undeniable in the destructiveness of a few airplanes and their bombs: Air power with such enormous destructive capabilities could obviously be wielded decisively. There­ fore, it deserved the stature of an independently wielded force. What the aviators had struggled so hard to achieve had been won for them by the nuclear physicists. Indeed, the atomic bomb went so far in its destructive capabilities as to alarm the aviators by undermining their arguments for maintaining large fleets of airplanes. Competitive Means for Common Ends The concept of air power gave aviators and those who supported them—technically, logistically, financially and politically—a unifying sense of purpose and a cause far more noble or altruistic than the aviator's abiding love of flight and flying machines. That concept worked to the advantage of all involved so long as the airplane was the only means for fulfilling that concept. But when other means such as unmanned aircraft, guided missiles, and spacecraft became available, it was the aviators who revealed, by deeds more than words, that their real affection was for their airplanes and not the concept of air power.
