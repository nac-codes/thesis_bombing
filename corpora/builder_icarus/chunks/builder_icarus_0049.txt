their airplanes and not the concept of air power.  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 56 --- The Icarus Syndrome 33 The first real challenges to the air power theory, as originally con­ ceived by the aviators, with the airplane as its unique means for fulfillment, came out of World War II in the form of Hitler' s "vengeance" weapons, the V-l cruise missile and the V-2 ballistic missile. The Navy and Army immediately began to explore the potentials of these weapons from captured samples after the war. Significantly, the Air Force did not; it saw its future in manned jet aircraft carrying the atomic bomb. Guided missile enthusiasts collected together within each of the three services, just as the aviators had in the Army and Navy almost a half century earlier. And just as the aviators had been treated as rambunctious minorities outside the mainstream of their parent services, the guided missile factions, too, with their often exaggerated claims of the coming revolution, were tolerated more than accepted within their services. With German rocket scientists as its eager vanguard, the Army pursued the development of ballistic missiles, although the Germans still had one eye on going into space—as they had from their beginnings at Peenemunde. The Navy pursued cruise and ballistic missile applications for subma­ rines and surface ships before discovering a most felicitous marriage of the solid-propellant ballistic missile and the nuclear-powered submarine. The Air Force missile enthusiasts explored a number of applications for cruise and ballistic missiles, but found nothing so revolutionary or effective as to threaten the mainstream of the Air Force in their perception of the primacy of the airplane. Soviet rocket developments, particularly the orbiting of the first space satellite changed everything. What had been a side show for the three services suddenly became the main arena. The Army, by virtue of the space orientation of its German scientists, had the initial a
