satellite changed everything. What had been a side show for the three services suddenly became the main arena. The Army, by virtue of the space orientation of its German scientists, had the initial advantage in launching the first American satellite and subsequently provided the cadres who formed the American space program. Under urgent demands to develop medium range ballistic missiles, the Navy found a home for its Polaris program, while the Army and Air Force battled each other for the land-based missile, with their Jupiter and Thor programs. The Air Force Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile program went from the back burner to the front. The next ten years would see the guided missile revolution. The advents of guided missiles—cruise and ballistic—and space satellites posed significant new capabilities to displace the airplane as the principal means to fulfill many of the ends of air power. Indeed, many of  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 57 --- 34 The Icarus Syndrome those outside aviation, in polities and the public, who had previously embraced the air power theory for its ends rather than its means, seized upon guided missiles as potentially superior to the airplane for the pursuit of many of the ends they sought. The concept of air power had, from the beginning, been a means to ends; but it offered different ends for different interests. For its political supporters, it was a means promising to avoid the hideous casualties of stalemated land warfare. For the aviators, those perceived political ends provided the means for securing the fleets of aircraft they wanted so much as ends in themselves. These were symbiotic interests, joined in the means and pursuing high ends that could be comfortably shared in words, even though the aviator's deepest, unexpressed affections were for the means more than the political ends. The symbiosis ended when compet­ itive means for the same high ends appeared; and the aviators were forced to choose between means th
