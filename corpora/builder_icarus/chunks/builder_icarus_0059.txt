Air power theory would  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 67 --- 44 The Icarus Syndrome eventually become one of the war's fractious offsprings, but only a dozen years after the first flight at Kittyhawk, the technology for air power was still too young to make it one of the war's determinants: Greater than the impact of air power upon the war was the influence of the war itself on the subsequent development of air power.... During the course of the fighting virtually every theory, attitude, ideal, hope, dream and debate that would mark the course of air warfare a quarter century later had been foreshadowed.6 One of the consistent themes to emerge in air power theory was the offensive as opposed to defensive use of aircraft. The importance of the concept of the offensive came early to the Allied airmen, perhaps first to Hugh Trenchard who took over command of the Royal Air Corps in August of 1915. Impressed with the military potential of the airplane, Trenchard began formulating the offensive air doctrines that would win him recognition as one of three prophets of air power, with Douhet and Mitchell.7 In the fall of 1915, soon after Trenchard took command in France, the Germans effectively challenged the British and French use of the air for reconnaissance over German lines. The German instrument for gaining air superiority was the Fokker M5 Eindecker, which incorporated the first successful adaptation of the machine gun synchronized to fire forward through the propeller.8 After the German Fokkers bested them in the air, Trenchard and the French conferred on how they might react. They came at last to the conclusion that the corps aeroplanes could best be protected by what one might call the strategic offensive, that is, by fighting and subduing the enemy airmen far away from the aeroplanes flying in direct cooperation with the army.9 The early proponents of air power and, later, air power theoryâ€”Hugh Trenchard and Billy Mitch
