ng and subduing the enemy airmen far away from the aeroplanes flying in direct cooperation with the army.9 The early proponents of air power and, later, air power theory—Hugh Trenchard and Billy Mitchell—were caught up in the idea of the offensive use of air power to break the bloody stalemate of trench warfare. That idea appealed not just to the airmen, but also to statesmen and politicians such as Jan Christiaan Smuts (1870-1950), because it was they who were ultimately accountable to their publics for the costs of the war in treasure and blood. Trenchard was the first of the theorists given the opportunity to convert the idea into practice. The commander of the British forces in France, Douglas Haig (1861-1928) supported Trenchard' s  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 68 --- The Precursors 45 ideas for the offensive use of the Royal Air Corps. "One reason why Trenchard enjoyed this support was doubtless his own determination to assist Haig in winning the war by achieving a breakthrough on the western front."10 Trenchard's intense belief in the air offensive was his trademark. He insisted that command of the air over the battlefield was possible only through a "relentless and incessant offensive." He thought it best "to exploit the moral effect of the airplane on the enemy, but not to let him exploit it on ourselves.... [T]his can only be done by attacking and continuing to attack." Ground commanders who wanted the RFC merely to hover over their positions, in order to protect them from aerial observation and attack, had taken strong exception to Trenchard's views. General Haig quickly overruled them, and the air offensive became established RFC policy.11 The connection between this thinking in Britain and its subsequent appearance in America is not obscure. According to Alfred Hurley, the influence of Trenchard on America's first prophet of air power, Billy Mitchell, began during the war: The first meeting between Trenchard and Mitchell set the tone for their
