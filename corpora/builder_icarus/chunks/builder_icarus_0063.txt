ess period in 1915 had brought enemy raiders to London and the east coast. Militarily ineffective the zeppelins might be, but their nuisance value could not be ignored. About two hundred people were killed; over one million pounds of damage was caused. It needed only a lengthy bomb- free lull of three months followed by one long night of scattered bombing over the Midlands to alarm the public seriously. This happened...on 31st January, 1916.16 If the strategic bombardment had remained limited to the night attacks by zeppelins, its effects might have been soon forgotten, but the Gotha bombers picked up where the zeppelins left off: The raid [of 13 June 1917] caused minor damage to property, major havoc to morale; nearly 600 people were killed or maimed; none of the fourteen raiders  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 70 --- The Precursors 47 was brought down; and the manifest ineffectiveness of the anti-aircraft defences, to say nothing of the ensuing public outcry, led the Government to react vigorously. Not since early 1916 had this unpleasant aspect of the developing air war been rammed so crudely home.17 The psychological shock of this second daylight attack [on 7 July 1917] within a month was prodigious. Alarm and anger re-echoed in the Press, affecting public and politicians alike.. ..'8 These experiences were to have a profound effect on the way air power would be developed and applied by the British over the next several decades. Because of this "psychological shock" on the British public (and hence the politicians who served it), the perceived effectiveness of aerial bombardment upon cities became exaggerated; and Britain would subseÂ­ quently emphasize the development of an offensive bomber force rather than a defensive fighter force. However the diverse experiences of World War I may have inspired the military aviation enthusiasts about their future, two aspects of air power theory had taken firm root in the minds of the British and American leaderships
