riences of World War I may have inspired the military aviation enthusiasts about their future, two aspects of air power theory had taken firm root in the minds of the British and American leaderships who would build their military aviation establishments after the war: 1. The importance or primacy of the offense in the use of military aviation; and 2. The bombing of cities could have a demoralizing effect upon the populations supporting modern warfare. Although these two ideas would never become explicit axioms of air power theory, they would lurk behind almost everything the air power prophets and their disciples would do and say for the next four decades.

Clearly, they were members of a common cohort, all born within the span of a decade. 3. Michael S.
