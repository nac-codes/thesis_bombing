ely after World War I, the Italians played a dominant role in the development of military aviation and in the theory of air power, in part "because their war with the Turks in 1911-12 accelerated their aviation program."2 More importantly, the Italian 49  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 73 --- 50 The Icarus Syndrome aviation program emphasized offensive force through aerial bombard­ ment.

His design, manufacture and marketing of effective bombardment airplanes over a period of more than a quarter of a century earned him great distinction as well as access to high level officials in Italy and abroad, including the United States.... He was the first to supply planes to the Italian Army in 1911-12. During World War I he built the first true bombing airplanes.... From 1916 on, influenced by Douhet and on his own, Caproni initiated contact with influential members of the Italian High Command, the Boiling Commission and other allied groups to advance the cause of strategic bombardment.3 Although the prophesy of air power was not singular—there was remarkable intercourse among the prophets in Italy, Britain, and America—it was Douhet who first turned the prophesy into explicit theory and put it into forceful, vivid writing. "Much of what Douhet propounded was not original with him, but his were perhaps the most coherent, the most systematic, and the most prophetic airpower writings of the era."4 All of the major tenets of air power theory could be found there: At the very least Douhet's arguments in favor of the decisiveness of air attack as a means of winning a war, for the establishment of command of the air by air attacks against an enemy's airdromes, for "battle cruiser" aircraft that would not require fighter escort, and for the development of commercial air transport aviation as an adjunct to military aviation proved useful [later] as a corroboration of the Air Corps ideas.5 This cor
