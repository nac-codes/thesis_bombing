But that is what the last war proved, and it will be verified in future wars with even more evidence.9 More pertinently, the geographically intimate position of Italy with respect to her adversaries was clearly a part of Douhet's concerns—quite unlike the relative isolation enjoyed by the United States. The brutal but inescapable conclusion we must draw is this: in face of the technical development of aviation today, in case of war the strongest army we can deploy in the Alps and the strongest navy we can dispose on our seas will prove no effective defense against determined efforts of the enemy to bomb our cities.10 Douhet's language was lurid and graphic: Tragic, too, to think that the decision in this kind of war must depend upon smashing the material and moral resources of a people caught up in a frightful cataclysm which haunts them everywhere without cease until the final collapse of all social organization.

Both were institution builders, not just advocates. Trenchard, an army major general before he was appointed the first Chief of the RAF, was not only convinced that national security required a centralized and independent air arm but he also s
