Mitchell, U.S. Army Air's top commander in France, managed to achieve aerial unity if not independence when he organized the scattered Air Service units into a single striking force late in 1918. Its cumbersome title, setting an important precedent, was the General Headquarters Air Service Reserve.14 But, if Trenchard and Mitchell were concerned about how to organize air power most effectively in those early days, Jan Smuts had lept ahead to what air power would become/The Smuts Committee in [Britain] found that 'air predominance' would become equally important to sea domi­ nance in the 'defence of the Empire.'
