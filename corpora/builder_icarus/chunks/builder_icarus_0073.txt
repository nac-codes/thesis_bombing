From the beginning, the military aviators were mavericks: In August 1919 the War Department invited from all its general officers comments on the Congressional proposal to create an independent department of Aeronautics. The responses that came in echoed and re-echoed the fundamental propositions set forth by.. .Pershing.. .and the other top military brass.

The air-going people have a spirit, language and customs of their own. These
