emselves."' The Beginnings of Theory The basic premises of the original air power theory were about the ends of war more than its means. James Fechet, who succeeded Mitchell as assistant chief of the Air Service in 1925, and went on to be chief of the Air Corps (1927-1931), made the distinction between means and ends— and their relative importance—quite clear: The objective of war is to overcome the enemy's will to resist, and the defeat of his army, his fleet or the occupation of his territory is merely a means to this end and none of them is the true objective...? By separating ends from means and focusing on the ends, air power theory provided the intellectual opportunity to approach the means of 59  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 83 --- 60 The Icarus Syndrome warfare from logic rather than tradition. Air power wasn't just a new means for waging war, it could be seen as the most effective means for getting directly to the central objective of war. Giulio Douhet is generally acknowledged to be the first to advance the air power theory in what he called "command of the air."3 He posed the first and central premise of the air strategy as an axiom: To conquer the command of the air means victory; to be beaten in the air means defeat and acceptance of whatever terms the enemy may be pleased to impose.4 To this axiom, he added two corollaries: 1. In order to assure an adequate national defense, it is necessary—and sufficient— to be in a position in case of war to conquer the command of the air. 2. All that a nation does to assure her own defense should have as its aim procuring for herself those means which, in case of war, are most effective for the conquest of the command of the air.5 The significance of military aviation in war was not in its enhancement of surface military forces—although it could do that—it was to become the dominant force in war. To have command of the air means to be in a position to wield offensive power so great it defies human imaginat
