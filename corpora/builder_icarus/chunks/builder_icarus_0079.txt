e, than to strafe or bomb a trench. The results are immeasurably greater in breaking morale, in disorganizing badly disciplined organizations, in spreading terror and panic, than in dashing against more solid resistance.8 Mitchell joined Douhet by arguing that the defense against aircraft was best waged through offense: The only defense against aircraft [said Mitchell] is by hitting the enemy first, just as far away from home as possible.9 But to bring military aviation to bear effectively in war, aircraft would first have to battle for control of the sky, said the prophets from Italy, Britain, and America: The purpose of aerial warfare [said Douhet] is the conquest of the command of the air.10 [Trenchard's] contention from the beginning had been that air supremacy would sooner or later have to be fought for.... There could be no "standing on the defensive" in the skies. Survival in three-dimensional warfare depended on maintaining the offensive, whatever the odds or the cost." The principal mission of aviation [said Mitchell] is fighting hostile aviation.... If we give up the air to a foreign power it has been proved during the war that they can cause incalculable damage with their air service alone.. ..'2 Control of the sky couldn't be accomplished by an "air service" supporting and subordinated to the ground forces. Again, the Italian, British, and American prophets were of one view: [Douhet said that the] Air Force to do this must be independent.. ..,3 He [Trenchard] was at one with the joint authors [of the Smuts memorandum which urged a separate Air Force], in accepting without reservation the "almost boundless" potentialities of aircraft as future weapons. Where he disagreed with them was on the expediency of forcing development prematurely, above all through a separate Ministry, at such an hour of acute danger [during World War I].14 Therefore [said Mitchell], in order to unite and bring your greatest effect to bear in any one place it is necessary to unite
