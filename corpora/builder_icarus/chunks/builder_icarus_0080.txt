eparate Ministry, at such an hour of acute danger [during World War I].14 Therefore [said Mitchell], in order to unite and bring your greatest effect to bear in any one place it is necessary to unite all elements of your aviation at one place where the decision is called for....15  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 85 --- 62 The Icarus Syndrome And that was exactly what Mitchell had tried to do when he had set up his "General Headquarters Air Service Reserve" force during the war. Yet the prophets realized that independence did not deny the need for joint operations. Douhet argued: To make one [military service] dependent on the other would restrict the freedom of action of the one or the other, and thus diminish their total effectiveness. Similarly, an air force should at all times cooperate with the army and the navy; but it must be independent of them both.16 Mitchell used different words, but with the same reasoning: [T]he mission of each branch of the national defense must be clearly stated and its powers and limitations thoroughly understood in order to combine its action with the other branches to insure the maximum effect.17 The uniqueness of air power in striking at the heart of the enemy through the new, third dimension is consistently evident in the theory: [F]or now it is possible to go far behind the fortified lines of defense without first breaking through them. It is air power which makes this possible.18 [T]he air has introduced a third dimension into warfare.... Aircraft enables us to jump over the army which shields the enemy government, industry, and people, and so strike direct and immediately at the seat of the opposing will and policy. A nation's nerve system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops, is now laid bare to attack....19 All these arguments were only facets of the air power theory, dressed in the forceful, sometimes lurid rhetoric of the day. What, then, was the essence of the theory in today's language? Air power theory pr
