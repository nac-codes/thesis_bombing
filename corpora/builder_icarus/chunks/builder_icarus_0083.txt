y favored creation of a [centrally controlled] GHQ Air Force. First, however, they wanted to assess the effect it might have. They felt that once  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 87 --- 64 The Icarus Syndrome established, GHQ Air Force would claim the complete attention of the airmen to the neglect of aviation for direct support of ground forces.23 The camel' s nose beneath the tent flap was the acceptance by the Army General Staff of the distinction between air service (assigned to ground commanders) and air force (assigned to the command of airmen): The composition of [army aviation] changed significantly as emphasis shifted from "air service" (auxiliary to ground forces) to "air force" (a separate element with a separate mission). No one in a position of responsibility in the twenties and thirties—not even Mitchell—challenged the proposition that military aviation consisted of both forms of aviation and.. .that both were essential. But no consensus existed as to the mission of each, the types of aviation each needed, how total resources should be apportioned between the two, and what form organization should take. In the army reorganization of 1920, the War Department assigned observation, pursuit, and attack [aviation] to ground forces for "air service" in direct support of ground operations. It allocated bombardment aviation to "air force" to work with ground forces or operate as a separate striking force, as directed by the commander in chief in the field. Airmen insisted only observation be designated "air service," and all combat aviation (bombardment, pursuit, and attack) be designated "air force" for independent operations. As a corollary, they would cut back on observation aviation and enlarge the combat air force. By the beginning of World War II, the airmen had gained all these objectives save complete independence.24 Once the intellectual separation between air service and air force had been accepted, the rapid evolution of aircraft technologies
