That theory took hold in Britain and America. It didn't need to be sold in Britain because that nation had been doubly hurt—by the loss of a generation of young men in the trenches and by experiencing the terror of aerial bombardment. But it would have to be sold to the American public. Douhet's writings were too tragic and barbaric to do that job, while Mitchell appealed to the dreams and altruism of the American public. The air power theory of the prophets contained all the seeds for the fruit that was to be harvested over the next several decades: the emphasis on the offensive use of air power, on the battleplane or big bomber, and the drive for institutional independence. Its advocates already exhibited attitudes which would remain its scourge right up to the present: a certitude in the universal decisiveness of air power, a disdain for air defense capabilities,30 and an elitism among pilots. From the very beginning, as air power theory first emerged from the minds of its prophets, it seems to have attracted different people for different reasons. It attracted: • some military professionals who conceived the theory as a more effective way to wage war and to organize its means (Smuts, Douhet, and Trenchard); • military aviators because it gave a higher purpose to their love of airplanes and flying (Mitchell and his disciples, Spaatz and Eaker); • many in the public who were dismayed by the bloody stalemate of trench warfare in World War I and who hoped to avoid its repetition; and • some of those politicians who had to raise the public funds for military forces and who saw in the theory a way to buy defense on the cheap (Roosevelt and Churchill). These different interests all found a common focus in air power theory—the idea of striking at the heart of the enemy through the third dimension, thereby avoiding the carnage and cost of surface warfare— even though some were attracted by its ends and others mostly by its means.
