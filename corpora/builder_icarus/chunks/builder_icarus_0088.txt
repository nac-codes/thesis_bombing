ginning of air power theory, during the 1920s and 1930s, the disdain was for all forms of air defense capabilities, whether from the ground or in the airâ€”the self-defended bomber was sufficient for the offensive. Today, the disdain for air defenses is more discriminating: Surface-to- air defenses are not as highly regarded as enemy fighter or interceptor aircraft; and bombers may require assistance in suppressing enemy air defenses. Nevertheless, the air offense remains much more highly regarded than air defenses.  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 92 --- 7 Prophesy Dcedalus set to work immediately. With great skill and artistry he fitted all together [feathers brought to him by Pasiphae, King Monos' wife], using wax to hold each feather in place. The work was delicate and needed both time and patience, but within a few days the wings had taken shape. There were four of them, like a bird's wings in every respect, but very much larger, and so beautifully made that even the gods would have envied them. Using leather straps, Dcedalus fastened one pair onto Icarus' arms and shoulders, and then he put on his own. The time to test the wings had come. Beating his arms up and down, Dcedalus rose effortlessly into the air. Icarus did the same, and his wings, too, bore him upwards. All was ready!1 Selling Air Power The airmen had a theory, but little more than that. Plausible and attractive as it might be to them, they had no evidence with which to confront their skeptics. Chief among the many factors preventing airmen from attaining the type of organization they sought was their inability to marshal convincing evidence supporting their views. Neither the World War I experience nor the existing state of technology bore out their assertions concerning air power. So the airmen based their arguments on hopes and wishes, and took their stand on conjecture as to the future capabilities of aeronautical equipment and techniques.2 Unfortunately, the audience they had to convince
