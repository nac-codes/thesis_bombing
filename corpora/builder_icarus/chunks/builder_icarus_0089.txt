based their arguments on hopes and wishes, and took their stand on conjecture as to the future capabilities of aeronautical equipment and techniques.2 Unfortunately, the audience they had to convince was the Army; and to overcome its skepticism, the airmen would need more than a small measure of public support. 69  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 93 --- 70 The Icarus Syndrome Time and again, the War Department General Staff turned aside the airmen's claims as to the effectiveness of air power by pointing out that "this had not yet been demonstrated." The airmen's efforts to win overwhelming public support proved futile.3 The airmen needed resources, but .. .working against the airmen was their inability to produce convincing facts to support their views fully.... [W]ith no enemy in sight, and needing proof of efficacy of air power—the nation would not support a powerful United States air force.4 In the absence of evidence of the correctness of their theory, the airmen needed some impetus for sponsorship—a desire to believe in the theory despite the absence of evidence—and that would come only when the war clouds gathering over Europe and East Asia could no longer be ignored. Then, many would want to believe air power theory, including the most important sponsor of all, the nation's president. General Jimmy Doolittle put it directly: "Basically, the trouble was that we had to talk about air power in terms of promise and prophecy instead of in terms of demon­ stration and experience."5 What the airmen lacked in evidence, they made up for with tantalizing promises of what could be just ahead. Here is how Hap Arnold and Ira Eaker described the future of war in the air from their vantage point in the mid-1930s: More and more war in the air is becoming a constant threat throughout the world. The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans will shrink in "air-travel size" and present the same flying time and hazard that the Mediterranean Sea and Gulf of Mexico do today. No nation wi
