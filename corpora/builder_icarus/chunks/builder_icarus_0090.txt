throughout the world. The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans will shrink in "air-travel size" and present the same flying time and hazard that the Mediterranean Sea and Gulf of Mexico do today. No nation will have but one frontier to guard, for hostile aircraft may approach from any or all directions. Death rays, electric rays for stopping airplane engines, barrages of steel netting, automatically operated anti-air- machine torpedoes, radio-controlled manless fighting planes, gas projectors, all may take their place in the anti-aircraft defenses. The attacking air force may be equipped with planes bearing Diesel engines and thus be unaffected by the electric ray; they may be equipped with radio-controlled bombing planes not influenced by any gas which may be projected into the air; with aerial torpedoes which can be launched from the ground and sent accurately toward their predetermined destinations; or with planes so silent that they cannot be seen or heard on the ground and so will pass overhead at high altitudes and go undetected.6 With today's hindsight, some of these visions border on flights of fancy; yet, in them one can see the barest outlines of what we have come to know as air-to-air missiles, surface-to-air missiles, cruise missiles, and stealth aircraft.

American security had never been effortless, and especially since the 1890s prominent Americans such as Theodore Roosevelt, moved by visions of empire abroad and unity at home, had forged a stronger army and navy. Mitchell, however, promised something more comforting. Air power, as he usually described it, would provide inexpensive
