visions of empire abroad and unity at home, had forged a stronger army and navy. Mitchell, however, promised something more comforting. Air power, as he usually described it, would provide inexpensive security for a new generation of Americans, leaving them free from militarism and its accompanying evils—taxation, conscription, and tyranny.7 The public was clearly drawn into the arguments of the air power advocates and their skeptics. Will Rogers became an early advocate and voice for air power, speaking directly to the public: I tell you, any experiment that is being made in the air is not a waste of time or money. Our defense, offense, and all, have got to come from the air.8 Or more stridently: When we nearly lose the next war, as we probably will, we can lay it onto one thing—the jealousy of the army and navy toward aviation. They have belittled it since it started and will keep on doing it till they have something dropped on them from one, and even then say it wasn't a success.9 Rogers was probably making an oblique reference to the Navy' s reactions to Billy Mitchell's several demonstrations (1921-1923) of air power against Navy ships, which the Navy had predictably belittled. The uniqueness of air power—its ability to strike through the third dimension—was a central aspect of its theory and its marketing. Operat­ ing through the third dimension was not just novel—a new and strange dimension for military operations—it promised to transform the concept of national frontiers and the security they had heretofore provided. In a trice, aircraft have set aside all ideas of frontiers. The whole country now becomes the frontier and, in case of war, one place is just as exposed to attack as another place.10 This uniqueness of air power posed special significance for Ameri­ cans, who, for the first time would be vulnerable even within their vast interior spaces.
