As Will Rogers put it:  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 95 --- 72 The Icarus Syndrome In the next war, you don't want to look out, you want to look UP. When you look up and see a cloud during the next "War to end Wars," don't you be staring to admire its silver lining till you find out how many enemy planes are hiding behind it.11 Isolationism, a strong theme in American politics following World War I, would soon become untenable because of air power, Mitchell argued: The coming of aircraft has greatly modified this isolation [of the United States] on account of the great range and speed which these agents of communications are developing.... The vulnerability of the whole country to aircraft as distinguished from the old conditions that obtained when the frontiers or the coast had to be penetrated before an invasion of the country could be made, has greatly interested the people of the nation.12 Mitchell stated the obvious, if not the relevant, when he asserted the vast dominions of the airâ€”a theme that the Navy would echo 60 years later in advancing its "maritime strategy." [A]s air covers the whole world there is no place that is immune from influence by aircraft.13 Moreover, it might not take much of that unique power to paralyze an enemy nation and, therefore, by implication, a nation like the United States. As Mitchell put it: For attacking cities that are producing great quantities of war munitions that are necessary for the maintenance of an enemy army and country in case of war, the air force offers an entirely new method of subduing them. Heretofore, to reach the heart of a country and gain victory in war, the land armies always had to be defeated in the field and a long process of successive military advances made against it. Broken railroad lines, blown up bridges, and destroyed roads, necessitated months of hardships, the loss of thousands of lives, and unto
