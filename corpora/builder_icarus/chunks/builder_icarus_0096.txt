s slow speed, poor maneuverability, and high vulnerability to both enemy action and natural elements offset advantages of range and carrying capacity. The lighter- than-air enthusiasts found little support from other Air Service members, from elsewhere in the Army (except in the artillery which wanted it's observation balloons), from members of Congress, or from the general public. Officers of the heavier-than-air branch occupied key positions in the air arm. And with the money, men, and materiel available for Army aviation severely limited, the tendency was toward building up the heavier-than-air branch. A number of  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 98 --- Prophesy 75 dirigible disasters, including the Navy's loss of the Shenandoah, Akron, and Macon, retarded and then halted airship programs in both the Army and the Navy. So the Army's lighter-than-air branch declined and virtually disappeared, eclipsed and consumed by heavier-than-air aviation.20 Even those Army airmen, like William E. Kepner, who started out in LTA and devoted years to their development, were likely to have much preferred duty in the heavier-than-air craft. When Kepner was first assigned to balloons rather than airplanes for flight training, "He wired an urgent message to the Army's adjutant general pleading that a mistake had been made in his assignment." Despite his subsequent record-setting accomplishments in balloons, Kepner was relieved and delighted when, "At last, he pinned on the coveted airplane pilot wings that had eluded him for some twelve years."21 It would probably be fair to say that the majority of the aviators favored winged airplanes over the dirigibles, increasingly as time and events proved the technological limits and relative vulnerabilities of both. Even today, one can find a small group of civil airmen who cling to expansive dreams of LTA ships, but the faction seems to grow smaller with time as the continuing LTA experiments founder, one after the other, on techniÂ­ c
