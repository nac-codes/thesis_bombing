d a small group of civil airmen who cling to expansive dreams of LTA ships, but the faction seems to grow smaller with time as the continuing LTA experiments founder, one after the other, on techni­ cal and fiscal rocks.22 The Battleplane Emerges The long-range, self-defended, heavy bomber—which was destined to become the centerpiece of so much controversy over the next several decades—had been described early in Douhet's concept of the "battleplane." The battleplane would have all the qualities it needed for command of the air—to carry the attack (the offensive) to the enemy and to defend itself from attack by enemy aircraft (control of the air). This type of [battle]plane should have the radius of action, speed, and armor protection as described; but should have armament sufficient both for aerial combat and for offensives against the surface.... If the Air Force were made up entirely of battleplanes, all the planes could take part in the engagement, with full freedom of action. Therefore, from all points of view it is best that the bulk of an Independent Air Force be made up entirely of battleplanes designed for aerial combat and for bombing offensives against the surface.23 The early efforts of the Air Corps to acquire battleplanes in the form of long-range bombers met heavy opposition from inside and outside of the  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 99 --- 76 The Icarus Syndrome Army. An important impediment was the offensive orientation of bombers at a time when the nation's military was supposed to be devoted to defense: "The Air Corps hoped to use the long-range reconnaissance mission to procure long-range bombers. It wanted them for strategic operations but could not say so when military policy rested on defense."24 Coastal defense was the only mission available at the time to the Army Air Corps that might justify long-range bombers. A short-lived agree­ ment between the Army and Navy chiefs (General MacArthur and Admiral Pratt) offered a "plausible jus
