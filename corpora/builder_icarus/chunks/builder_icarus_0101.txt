his in the absence of demonstration. As the War Plans Division put it: "So far, well- organized nations have surrendered only when occupied by the enemy's army or when such occupation could no longer be opposed." Aviation could assist but could not itself achieve victory. The Tactical School responded by asserting that the advent of air power gave for the first time in history the ability to bring war immediately to the internal structure of an enemy nation.. ..30 This was unadulterated air power theory from the Tactical School; but the War Plans Division exacted a compromise from the airmen in the form of the following "watered-down" statement for publication: The power of air forces has not yet been fully tested. The effect which they are capable of producing and the extent to which they will influence warfare is still undetermined. But it appears certain that skillful use of air forces will greatly affect operations in future wars.31 Despite the headwinds provided by the Army General Staff, a sudden wind shift was anticipated by the air power advocates: The Japanese were gobbling up East Asia after invading Manchuria in 1931. Hitler came to power two years later, and now he and Mussolini posed a clear danger to the European democracies. Unless they were stopped, another world war was likely. If America became involved, the air advocates, rebelling against the military status quo, did not want another American Expeditionary Force bogged down overseas in the carnage of static trench warfare. They envisioned the long-range strategic bomber as the technological breakthrough that could win such a war in less time, with fewer casualties.32 The efficiency of air power applied to the enemy's critical economic targets appealed to the Americans. The British were still transfixed by the terror of air power applied against cities as a deterrent or a breaker of civilian morale.
