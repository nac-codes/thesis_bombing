eir most ambitious dreams. War would ultimately demonstrate serious flaws in their doctrine, but that wasn't their concern then. What mattered to them as war clouds gathered was the impetus to develop and build an air armada of battleplanes. If that impetus set a course that was slightly off its stated mark, the airmen thought that the error, like wind drift, could and would be corrected with observations over time. Notes 1.
