o construct their own curriculum and dogma. The leisurely pace of life in the peacetime army gave them plenty of time to do so. By the 1930s, both the airmen and their institutions were also mature enough to carry on their struggle in more sophisticated ways. A cohort of officers had a decade or two of experience in aviation and had passed beyond the youthful stage of infatuation with the joys of flying. The Air Corps Tactical School had established a body of literature and a tradition of theorizing about aviation. Mitchell's fate had taught airmen that glamorous stunts and daring pronouncements were insufficient to achieve recognition of air power. The new doctrine of precision bombing was the product of their efforts and the vehicle of their ambitions. Briefly, airmen, especially at the tactical school, argued that strategic air power could contribute to victory or secure it by attacks on the enemy state, especially its economic institutions. These attacks need not be indiscriminate, indeed should be targeted at only a few key components whose destruction would disrupt the functioning of the entire state. The enemy's will or capacity to fight would then collapse.2 This American concept of strategic bombardment rested on a logistical concept of war fighting: [At the Tactical School, they] "sought to define what Mitchell and others called the 'vital centers'; that is they planned to discover and then to destroy by determined bombardment those elements in the economic structure of an enemy that were essential to his war making power."3 The quick, simple solution offered by precision bomÂ­ bardment appealed to American proclivities: Precision bombing.. .promised victory independent of the other branches of the armed forces, with minimal demands on and risks for Americans, by employing  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 108 --- The Apostles 85 the bomber as an instrument of surgical precision rather than indiscriminate horror, laying its high explosives (not gas or
