The invincibility of the unescorted bomber formation was an article of faith; Flying Fortress was no idle choice of name for the B-17. In theory, bombing by daylight permitted the necessary precision, while the bomber's speed, thick skin, bristling armament, and high altitude provided the requisite defense.5 The airmen's faith in technological progress obscured the lessons in combat which even then were emerging: The swift pace of technological progress in the 1930s also minimized doubts; if the full potential of precision bombing was not immediately realizable, some imminent development would surely close the gap between dream and reality. And of course opportunities for reality-testing were few, and when they arose, air officers thought the uses of air power in Ethiopia, Spain, and China were too primitive in technology and tactics to tell them much.6 The moral superiority of precision bombing was not an explicit issue, but it served to wall off moral concerns until the heat of war further obscured the slippery slope to terror bombing. [F]or the airmen, a measure of moral validity adhered to methods of war that achieved quick victory and minimized prolonged suffering.... [T]he historical significance of the doctrine of precision bombing was not its repudiation of moral concerns but its role in quieting consciences anxious about the future of air war. Proponents of precision bombing believed that it would reap the long­ standing promise of air
