s repudiation of moral concerns but its role in quieting consciences anxious about the future of air war. Proponents of precision bombing believed that it would reap the long­ standing promise of air power without inflicting unreasonable harm to humanity. Of course, the promise of air power had always inhered in its capacity to bring terror. Precision bombing did not entirely divorce the two, but it pushed terror so far into the background, placed so much distance between the act and the result, that it had much the same effect. Like the strategy of economic blockade practiced by both English and Germans in World War I, it proposed to attack the enemy population indirectly, by disrupting and starving it rather than by blasting and burning. But if no quick victory came and the enemy's will remained the objective, then airmen might have to strike at it through systematic rather than selective destruction, that is, by direct attacks on the civilian population.8  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 109 --- 86 The Icarus Syndrome Where Were the Dissenting Views? Perry McCoy Smith speculates on why the American airmen were not affected by contrary evidence and arguments about the primacy of the offense and self-defended bombers: Intraservice (as opposed to interservice) rivalry and debate, which were present within the army as a whole in the twenties and thirties and which served the useful purpose of questioning the doctrine of various service arms, were largely absent with the AAF. In the 1930s intraservice rivalry did bring into serious question the efficacy of coast artillery and horse-mounted cavalry and, in turn, inspired the Coast Artillery and the Cavalry to turn to weapons systems which they could more easily justify—the anti-aircraft artillery gun and the tank. In the twenties and thirties, the infantry questioned the efficacy of the horse, the air corps questioned the value of the coast artillery gun, and neither cavalry nor coast artillery modified their wea
