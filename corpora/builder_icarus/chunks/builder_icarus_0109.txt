the twenties and thirties, the infantry questioned the efficacy of the horse, the air corps questioned the value of the coast artillery gun, and neither cavalry nor coast artillery modified their weapons systems until they felt threatened by outside forces within the Army.... As the Army Air Corps slowly developed separateness, it did not at the same time develop the intraservice debate that was to blossom in the period following formal autonomy. In this period of un­ formalized autonomy, the only voices questioning the dominant AAF doctrine came from outside the Air Force.9 The narrowness of the focus—no longer so much on air power as on precision bombardment—tended to draw the debate onto means more than ends: [The Air Force doctrinal] focus both before and during World War II was narrow, so that only ideas and weaponry which favored the offensive role of aviation were given thorough consideration. The doctrine developed in the Air Corps Tactical School from 1926 through 1940 was not airpower doctrine in its broadest sense of the word "airpower." It was strategic, daylight, precision bombardment, a very important part, but only a part, of military aviation.10 The principal ends of the airmen—autonomy and the big bombers—had become entangled with the concept of precision bombardment. The effect would be to suppress ideas and capabilities which would eventu­ ally come to haunt the AAF in war. Air Corps leaders had reached a doctrinal decision by 1935 as to the efficacy of unescorted long-range strategic bombardment and were unwilling either to question that decision or even to observe technological advances that might cause them to modify this doctrine until 1943 when the whole concept of strategic bombardment was endangered by the horrendous losses over Germany. It is paradoxical that their total acceptance of the doctrine prevented them from  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 110 --- The Apostles 87 observing the technological advances that would have been th
