must have had to lie through gritted teeth when he was forced to argue that the big bombers were intended solely for coastal defense purposes: Despite the creation in March 1935 of general Headquarters Air Force as an offensive striking force, the army still saw the arm's function as tactical support of ground forces. Obviously, the big bomber would play little part in such a role. In December 1936 Embick [of the Army's General Staff] flatly asked Andrews if the bombers were not intended for an offensive role. Andrews, just as flatly, denied such intention. The weapons under development were purely defensive: "It is utterly absurd to consider them as anything else and I think we should emphasize this point on all occasions.16 The excuses for the airplanes the airmen needed took them through some logical labyrinths: Coastal defense and overseas reinforcement were the only missions requiring long-range bombers left to the Air Corps by mid-1937. And the coastal defense mission was still in debate with the Navy.... Within the next year Hap Arnold again asked for a clearer delineation of responsibility for coastal defense. To justify larger aircraft, the Army had to have the coastal defense mission. If the Navy were to have the task, then the Army had no need for long-range aircraft as the Air Corps aviation mission would be limited to close support.... Air Corps maneuvers in the North-East during the spring [of 1938] led to a direct confrontation between the Army and the Navy. The Air Corps was the loser. On 12 May, to prove the capabilities of long-range aircraft, a flight of three B-17s took off from Mitchel Field, New York, to intercept the Italian liner Rex at sea. Despite lack of information on the ship's location and heavy cloud cover, the three aircraft made the interception 725 miles out, dropped a note to the liner, and returned to base.. J1 The Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Malin C. Craig, immediately telephoned General Andrews and ordered that the Air Corps henc
