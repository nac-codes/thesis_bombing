theory and the institutional Air Force: If the Air Force were a church, Arnold would be its founder, its Saint Paul. If it were a country, Arnold would be its father, its George Washington or Simon Bolivar. None of the other giants of the Air Force did so much over such a long period as Arnold in building the Air Force as an institution. General of the Air Force Henry H.

He commanded it as the Air Service during World War I, devoted his life to its arduous and difficult development between the wars, and commanded it through the challenging years of World War II.2 Organizing and building an Air Force was hardly new to Arnold: Arnold was responsible for supervising the extraordinary expansion of an Air Force that in April 1917 had only 35 pilots to a force of 10,000 pilots when the  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 122 --- Founding the Church 99 Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918!

Hap Arnold, as Assistant Chief of the Air Corps in 1936, and two years later as Chief when Gen. Oscar Westover was killed in a plane crash, was cast as a compromiser and obstructionist by Andrews and Knerr. That view was shared by many of their contemporaries who believed that air power independence was essential immediately for national security. But Arnold had learned his own lesson in military politics in the decade following the Mitchell court martial. He had been exiled to a cavalry post at Fort Riley, Kansas, and served his penance. Now, as Assistant Chief, he counseled a gradual approach in the matter of procuring B-17s and of seeking a separate air
