immediate increase in the production capability of the U.S. aircraft industry to 10,000 planes per year. Arnold would later convince him that the build-up should be based on quality rather than quantity but agreed that this number could be doubled with proper preparation. The Chief of the Air Corps was most happy with one point which Roosevelt stressed: [Roosevelt] stated "long range bombing is now the duty of the Army" and it was up to the Air Corps to keep anyone from landing in North or South America. The United States must be prepared to resist attack on all the Western Hemisphere and to deter landing in either North or South America. We must not be caught napping again as in 1917.

For the first time, the air arm had a program and could shoot toward a definite goal of planes and men. Arnold believed that the battle won at that time in the White House led to all the later victories in combat.7  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 124 --- Founding the Chureh 101 Arnold's Air Force The scale of Arnold's task in building the World War II Army Air Forces is evident from the statistics: At the time Arnold was appointed Chief of Staff of the Air Corps in 1938 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the entire Air Corps consisted of 3,900 airplanes, most of them obsolete, and 22,000 officers and men in the combined services of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. At the end of World War II, there were two and one-half million people and 80,000 aircraft in the Army Air Forces alone.8 More impressive, however, were his views about the kind of air force he was trying to build. Early in the war, with Eaker, he laid out his thoughts about who airmen were and what they were about to a general audience. He began with praise for the airmen, in a style reminiscent of Mitchell talking about the new class of people who were taking to the a
