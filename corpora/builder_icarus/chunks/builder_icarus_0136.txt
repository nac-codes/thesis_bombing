einforced the bleak impression of the aerial bombardment of cities: After the indiscriminate bombing of civilians at Guernica during the Spanish civil war, it was widely believed that aerial warfare would be so terrible that future wars would be over in a few weeks.2 Trenchard and then Harris offered a solution through long-range bombing aircraft: The threat of aerial bombardment might deter war and, if not, the execution of that threat could circumvent the stalemate of trench warfare.3 The war, if it came, might very well be resolved in a test of civilian morale when cities inevitably came under aerial attack. The American concept of strategic bombardment focused on the enemy's war-making potentials and infrastructures, not on breaking civilian morale, even though that might suffer as the enemy's industry and transportation were systematically destroyed. Americans saw strateÂ­ gic bombardment as a more efficient way to wage war decisively and quickly. Although the concept of strategic bombardment was recognized elsewhere in the world, it flourished as a major military effort only in Britain and America during World War II. The German Luftwaffe had been conceived to support the army in the pursuit of its objectives, not as an independent means for defeating an enemy. "The Luftwaffe' s creators had envisioned it as an adjunct to the German Army, primarily providing offensive support for ground troops."4 The wide-scale bombing of cities during World War II was more deliberately undertaken by the British (and eventually by the Americans) than by their German and Japanese enemies or even by their Russian ally.5 Although Germany bombed London before Britain bombed Berlin, Germany stumbled its way into the bombing of London, whereas Britain had been preparing for just such an exchange for years.
