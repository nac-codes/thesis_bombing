recognized, and all comment on guided missiles reflected a belief that in the future they would contribute to the supremacy of the offensive in airpower.17 The planning failure was not an inability to recognize the problem; it was myopia about possible solutions: It is unfair to say that... Air Force leaders completely ignored the vulnerability of long-range bombardment aircraft to defensive fighter attack, or that they were totally unaware of the lessons of the Battle of Britain regarding the technological advances in pursuit aviation. What was ignored or overlooked was the possibility of building a long-range escort fighter which would be essentially a pursuit aircraft and not a heavily armed bomber. While the Air Force leaders understood the value of the four-engine bomber.. .these same leaders almost totally ignored the advances being made in pursuit aviationâ€”advances that were even greater than those made in bombardment aviation.... The neglect by the Air Corps leaders of technological developments in pursuit aviation, from 1935 to 1943, provides an interesting case study of the relationship between doctrine and force structure.18 The roots of the myopia went back to the 1930s birth of air power doctrine in the U.S. Army Air Corps: Ironically, the Air Corps Tactical School arguments of the 1930s about pursuit versus bomber employment had persisted, and now (in 1942) the bomber people still were very much in the doctrinal driver's seat. Bomber preeminence had not been materially affected even by the air lessons of Spain's civil war and the Battle of Britain, which clearly showed the limited effect of strategic bombing on civilian morale and the essentiality of fighter escort to keep bomber losses at an acceptable level.19  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 136 --- The Test of Fire 113 The American strategic bombing campaign over Germany soon turned into a campaign for air superiority: In these complex and shifting aerial campaigns carried on from February t
