gns crucial to Air Force success. One of these was with top figures in the Royal Air Force who sought to switch the American effort to nighttime bombing of cities. Another was the U.S. Navy, which sought to switch Army Air's effort to anti-submarine attacks, either in coastal patrol or on the U-boat pens on the French coast. A third battle was with American public opinion, which had yet to be convinced that daylight, precision bombing of strategic targets would really work.21 Apart from the arguments about the most efficient use of war resources, the American airmen were simply not prepared to consider alternatives to the approach they had designed and followed for more than a decade. Both British and German bombing had already shown how strategic air war might degenerate into futile barbarism. Supremely confident in their day bombers, the American air planners did not address this danger or the possibility that even successful precision strikes might fail to paralyze the German economy. True, they did not rule out "heavy and sustained bombing of cities" as  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 137 --- 114 The Icarus Syndrome a kind of coup de grace climaxing the success of economic attacks or decisive German setback in ground fighting. But throughout the 1930s their strategic arguments had rested on the moral assumption that precision bombing would bring swift, economical, and humane victory. The justification for strategic bombing was the alternative it offered to the carnage of ground warfare. In 1941 the air strategists saw no reason to challenge that assumption. Brushing aside the English and German experiences in 1940 and 1941, they felt no need to review the moral issue. Their pressing concerns were neither strategic nor moral but political and economic. Their attention flowed to threading AWPD/1 [the AAF war plan] through the channels of the conservative general staff and to mobilizing industry for the war. To the air planners' relief, Marshall gave AWPD/1
