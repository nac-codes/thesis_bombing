rking them by fire for British attack at night. Together they would engage the German air force and cause German war weariness by round-the-clock bombing. Twenty-four hour operations would also head off the hopeless congestion in Britain's airfields and air space sure to result if both British and American bombers were squeezed into the same schedule. Arguing from operational necessity just as the British had in defending their switch to night bombing, Eaker also asserted that his bombers had to strike by day because they were built to do so and the crews were trained only in that method; to switch to the dark would halt the AAF's offensive altogether for months. Too, only the daylight bomber could engage the German fighter force, depleting it so as to facilitate further bombing as well as ground operations.

Arguments from operational necessity allowed means to dictate endsâ€”bombing forces, British or American, did what they could do best, not necessarily what it was best to do. Shooting down German fighters became a major achievement of the American bombers, but the initial intention had been to destroy the German air force in its factories and on its airfields. If now it was to be done substantially through the attrition of combat, the task could be grim indeed, especially without long-range fighter escort.23 Although the British may have had their doubts about the effectiveness of the American precision daylight raids, Joseph Goebbels, who was in a better position to judge, did not: [T]he day raids on Bremen by American bombers.. .were very hard indeed. The Americans drop their bombs with extraordinary precision from an altitude of eight to nine thousand meters. The population has the paralyzing feeling that there really is no protection against such daylight attacks.24 The American daylight raiders were apparently doing precisely what the British had been trying
