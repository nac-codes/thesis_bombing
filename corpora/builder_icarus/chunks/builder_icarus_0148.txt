American implementation of strategic bombardment had come full circle and coincided with the British ideas that the Americans had so vigorously resisted. Daylight precision bombing of military targets from self-defended bomber formations over Japan had finally been fully transformed to nighttime saturation bombing of cities from undefended bombers streaming independently on their missions. The transformation came at the hands of the civilian operations analysts who supported General Curtis LeMay in the conduct of his bombing campaign against Japan.28 The initial results with the new B-29 bombers operating from the Marianas Islands were disappointing. Compared to the size of the effort being mounted, the number of targets destroyed was embarrassingly small. The operational problems included long over-water flights, mod­ est bomb loads, aircraft and engine unreliabilities, high winds, and a new and cranky airplane flown by uneasy crews. But LeMay's bosses also faced an institutional problem: The AAF had fought hard in its battles with the Navy and the rest of the Army over the allocation of the available war resources and won its case for the B-29 bomber program. But the B-29 program had turned out to be much more difficult and costly than expected; its costs even exceeded those of the secret Manhattan Project to develop the first atomic bombs.29 With such a large and contended investment riding on the AAF claims for the decisiveness of strategic bombing and the B-29, LeMay had to deliver what his institution had so publicly promised. True to its strategic bombardment theories of the time, the AAF sought the heavy bomber it had always wanted in the B-29 program: a long-range airplane specifically designed for high-altitude, daylight, precision bom­ bardment with high-explosive bombs dropped from self-defended for­ mations. Of course, that is precisely how AAF initially used the airplane over Japan. The bombers formed up over the Marianas and then flew in formation to
