osive bombs dropped from self-defended for­ mations. Of course, that is precisely how AAF initially used the airplane over Japan. The bombers formed up over the Marianas and then flew in formation to Japan where they bombed from high altitude in daylight. The Japanese defenses against such attacks were much less effective than the German defenses over Europe, partly because of the state of Japanese defensive resources at that point in the war, and partly because of the high altitude from which the attacks were made. However, the results of the bombing were disappointing too, partly because of weather (on naviga-  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 140 --- The Test of Fire 117 tion and bombing accuracy), but mostly because the bomb loads in the airplanes were being sacrificed to accommodate the weight of the fuel required to fly in formation and at high altitudes and to the weight of the bomber's defensive armament (automated gun turrets)—the very things that were designed to ensure its penetration of the Japanese defenses. After finally succeeding in acquiring the airplane that could penetrate Japanese air defenses in daylight with acceptable losses, the AAF found that it was not very effective at accomplishing its purpose: destroying Japan's capacity and will to fight. LeMay posed the problem to his small staff of operations analysts; their answers turned the B-29 bombing campaign over Japan inside out. They recommended area or carpet bombing of Japanese cities with incendiaries instead of precision bomb­ ing of the Japanese aircraft industry with high explosive bombs.30 They recommended flying the bombers independently at medium altitudes and stripping the planes of their guns instead of sacrificing bomb-carrying capacity for high-altitude and formation flying and for defensive arma­ ments. They recommended flying at night in order to reduce the effective­ ness of the Japanese air defenses.31 The flight crews considered the analysts' proposal that they simply "
