for defensive arma­ ments. They recommended flying at night in order to reduce the effective­ ness of the Japanese air defenses.31 The flight crews considered the analysts' proposal that they simply "straggle" in over the target at night to be suicidal. They envisaged many of their airplanes colliding in the dark with hundreds of airplanes going to and from a single target. The analysts calmly demonstrated, with irrefutable mathematics, that the crews' chances of a collision were significantly less than their odds of landing in the "drink" because of multiple mechanical failures of their airplane's engines. The crews could appreciate this statistic, since engine failures on the long over-water flights were one of their several concerns with the new B-29 and something they had to confront daily. LeMay adopted all the analysts' recommendations. Careful definition and analysis of the operational problem had overturned almost every design precept of the B-29 program and the AAF theory of strategic bombardment. The analysts' recommendations were counter to the intuition and doctrine of those they served, and it is unlikely that the AAF would have slowly come around to such a drastic approach to their operations. It is certainly to LeMay's credit that he had confidence in his analysts and the courage to fly in the face of AAF doctrine. The B-29 bombing campaign proceeded to become so highly effective in accomplishing its realigned purposes, that LeMay, when asked when  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 141 --- 118 The Icarus Syndrome the war would be over, simply counted up the remaining unburned cities and estimated the time for his airplanes to carpet them with incendiaries. In retrospect, whatever the military or legal merits of that bombing campaign, it was important to the AAF aspirations for institutional independence, then within sight. LeMay and his operations analysts, although mostly concerned with making the new bombers more effec­ tive, may have prevented
