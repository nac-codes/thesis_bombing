first 1,000-plane raid of the war (targeted against the heart of Cologne) the British still aren't sure: Historians are sharply divided about the effect of the British bombing campaign. At this distance from the event, they are never going to agree. It reduced the cities of Germany to rubble and killed some 600,000 Germans, almost all of them civilians, 100,000 of them children under 14. Only by the last year of the war did it begin to reduce Germany' s war production. The effect on morale is incalculable. The Germans continued to fight fiercely for three years after the destruction of Cologne.33 The British seem much more sure about the effect of German bombing on British morale: In the event, the London blitz did not destroy civilian morale so much as increase hatred and a desire for revenge. The only time that British morale appears to have wobbled more than briefly was under the unpredictable new terrors of the V-l flying bomb and the V-2 rocket.34 Yet, on the same day, on the same page of the same newspaper, Sir Bernard Lovell, one of the British scientists who developed radar bombing techniques for Bomber Command, cites a postwar interview with Albert Speer (Hitler's minister for armaments and war production) concerning the effectiveness of the British bombing campaign. With respect to the bombing of Hamburg in the summer of 1943, Speer said: We were of the opinion that a rapid repetition of this type of attack upon another six German towns would inevitably cripple the will to sustain armaments manufacture and war production. It was I who first verbally reported to the Fiihrer at that time that a continuation of these attacks might bring about a rapid end to the war.35  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 143 --- 120 The Icarus Syndrome Were the airmen that close to a positive proof of their theory? Or were they caught up in an escalating cycle of carnageâ€”not in the trenches which they had promised to avoid, but in the cities which they could not? Notes 1.
