the three-billion-dollar gamble," once by Edward Jablonski in AIRWAR: Wings of Fire (Garden City: Doubleday & Company, 1971), 127, and twice by Keith Wheeler in "Bombers Over Japan," World War II, Alexandria, Virginia: Time-Life Books, 1982, 24, and again on 27. The three-billion-dollar figure was probably not a macabre exaggeration, for it can easily be approximated with separate estimates of the cost of each B-29 and the numbers produced. Keith Wheeler estimates that the B-29s "would ultimately cost about $600,000 per plane (in "Bombers Over Japan," 21). Lee Kennett observed: "Only the Americans could afford to offer themselves a bomber like the B-29, which cost over $800,000—a staggering sum for the era...." (in A History of Strategic Bombing, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1982), 181. The numbers of B-29s produced (not including its post-war derivative, the B-50) was 3905, according to Elke C. Weal, et.al, in Combat Aircraft of World War Two (New York: Macmillian Publishing Co., 1977), 191. According to these numbers, the B-29 program could have cost from $2.3B to $3.IB. The numbers get even larger if one takes into account that an additional 5092 B-29s were on order at the war's end, according to Bill Gunston in The Encyclopedia of the Worlds Combat Aircraft, (New York: Chartwell Books, 1976), 26. If those plans had been carried out, the B-29 program might have cost somewhere between $5.4B and $7.2B (assuming that the unit costs remained constant). 30. The rationale given at the time for this indiscriminate form of city bombardment was that the Japanese war industry had, after three years of war, become a cottage industry—almost any home could be involved in the making of aircraft engine components. The validity of that rationale seems dubious today; but at the time it seemed plausible to many; and some such rationale was necessary if the bombing was not to be a violation of the Geneva Conventions, which prohibit indiscriminate attacks upon civilians. 31.
