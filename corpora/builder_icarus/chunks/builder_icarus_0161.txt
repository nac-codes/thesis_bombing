vice rivalry be suppressed in the interest of presenting a united front for autonomy? The habits and the rationale of the 1930's continued throughout the war; that is, the fighter enthusiast was isolated by being placed firmly under the control of a bombardment leader, by being sent to an insignificant (or less significant) theater of operations, or by tacit bribery through the encouragement of long-range fighter development. The fighter enthusiasts' dilemma was the conflicting desire for autonomy and fighter development. At times, the fighter leaders would place autonomy ahead of fighter development; at other times, they would use alliances with ground commanders to push fighter development to the possible detriment of autonomy. Bombardment and autonomy were natural partners, but fighters were antithetical to both except when fighters were used to support the strategic mission.5  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 149 --- 126 The Icarus Syndrome A significant degree of operational autonomy was achieved by the fighter or "tactical" pilots during World War II, but it was not the kind of autonomy that would lay the foundations for institutional autonomy from the ground campaign or the Army. Though Arnold always gave priority in his thinking about the European war to the strategic use of air power, "the ground arm" of course continued to regard "air support" as Army Air's primary responsibilityâ€”a view held not only by Eisenhower, but also by Montgomery The latter, however, was responsible in large measure for a further refinement in the evolution of air command. In the long Desert War campaign against Rommel across North Africa, the RAF's Air Vice Marshall Arthur "Maori" Coningham convinced Monty that air support of ground forces worked better when directed by one airman than by the traditional, scattered, on-call commands from units of foot soldiers. Spaatz quickly convinced Eisenhower likewise, and new AAF regulations were drawn up early in 1943 designating all U.
