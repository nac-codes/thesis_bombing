ble." Duncan's experiment soon grew to be a major (and unauthorized) tactic in VIII Fighter Command.8 In the Pacific theater of operations, the balance between strategic and tactical air operations was almost exactly reversed. George Kenney's tactical operations dominated the theater until the build-up of the B-29 strategic bombardment operations in 1944. If the Japanese had recog­ nized the futility of continuing the war a year earlier—as well they might have under the strangulation of the American submarine campaign—the role of strategic bombardment in the Pacific would have been largely eclipsed. In any event, the supporters of fighter aviation would not be stilled: Col. S. F. Giffin, who prior to the war had been an instructor in the Department of Economics, Government and History at the United States Military Academy, in a lengthy memorandum entitled "Future Trends in Air Fighting" attempted to point out the postwar requirement for tactical aviation. Colonel Giffin thought it unhealthy that there was no voice in the Air Force for fighter aviation. He attempted to fill that gap by arguing that the great unlearned lessons of World War II were the offensive and great range capability of the fighter aircraft, its ability to destroy enemy aviation in the air and on the ground, and its effectiveness  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 151 --- 128 The Icarus Syndrome as an offensive weapon against tactical and strategic targets. He argued that the postwar Air Force should have at least twice as many fighter groups as bomber groups since fighters were needed for escort (on a one-to-one basis with bombers), for air defense, for close support of ground troops, and for strategic sweeps. In Giffin's words: "I believe it to be an unhealthy thing that within the Air Force itself there is presently so little difference of opinion as regards the future course of air warfare and the line which we must take in creating the future Air Force. We are committed to the big bomber
