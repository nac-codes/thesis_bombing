elf there is presently so little difference of opinion as regards the future course of air warfare and the line which we must take in creating the future Air Force. We are committed to the big bomber and the bomber offensive as surely for the future as we have been throughout this war, and with scarcely a dissenting voice." [Laurence] Kuter [then on Arnold's staff] rejected Giffin's analysis in the following manner: I feel that Col. Giffin's points are well taken with reference to the next year or two but do not go along with him on the longer range consideration. I feel sure that the fighter will go into the strategic air offensive in Europe and in Japan, but that a weapon much more similar to our present VHB [Very Heavy Bomber, the new B-29] than to our present fighter is the longer time backbone of air power. Giffin's rather prophetic ideas were dismissed easily for two reasons. First, Kuter realized that strategic bombardment doctrine was so firmly established within the leadership of the AAF that Giffin's comments could be rejected without concern that a high-ranking Air Corps officer might use his arguments to modify the planned postwar Air Force structure. Also, Giffin was a Coast Artillery officer who had only recently transferred to the Air Corpsâ€”he was not a pilot and had not attended the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell AFB; he could be and was ignored since he lacked the qualifications to make his voice heard as an aviation expert. Had he solicited the support of a high-ranking Air Corps officer who was not firmly committed to the doctrine of strategic bombardment, his idea might have received more than the summary dismissal they got. In Washington, during the entire war, there were no high-ranking Air Corps officers who questioned strategic bombardment, and it would have been difficult for Giffin or any other critic of AAF doctrine to use a combat commander with a commitment to tactical aviation, such as Generals Kenney, Quesada, Griswold, or Savill
