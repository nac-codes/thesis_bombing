and it would have been difficult for Giffin or any other critic of AAF doctrine to use a combat commander with a commitment to tactical aviation, such as Generals Kenney, Quesada, Griswold, or Saville, since their influence on postwar planning was minimal.9 The fighter pilots were caught between their desires for an independent Air Force and their convictions about the importance of tactical aviation. If intraservice competition had existed in the 1930's, it probably would have continued into the 1940's, and a voice like that of Colonel Giffin might have been heard. Such competition was essentially non-existent in the interwar period largely because the Army Air Corps leadership did not consider the Army Air Corps a separate service. Those who might have defended pursuit aviation and pointed out the vulnerabilities of bombardment aircraft as well as the deficiencies of daylight precision bombing theory were silent for two reasons. They had no platform and they did not wish to sabotage the greater goalâ€”autonomy.10  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 152 --- The Praetioners 129 In the European theater of World War II, General El wood R.

As commander of the Ninth Tactical Air Command, Quesada went out of his way to build communications and confidence between the ground and air forces. Not surprisingly: Quesada's intimate working relationship with the Army, however, was not without its price. He was criticized by some airmen who felt that his support of the infantry was abetting those who thought the Army should have its own air force." A New Breed The war developed a new breed of airmen who were organizers and operators more than advocates or theorists. Certainly Arnold fit that pattern. LeMay may have been the quintessential example of the new leadership. Michael Sherry has described the two as follows: [What LeMay] prized most was his leadership in getting men read
