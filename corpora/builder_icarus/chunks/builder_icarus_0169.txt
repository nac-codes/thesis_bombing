official sanction in air force policy. Disinterest in military tradition and in strategic doctrine went hand in hand. When LeMay and Arnold wrote their memoirs, neither said much about strategy; their memoirs faithfully reflected the focus of their wartime experience.12 While neither Arnold nor LeMay were theorists, Sherry's description omits the role that theory played in orienting their devotion to getting things done—politically and operationally. Arnold did not invent air power theory, but he exploited it exquisitely in building the Air Force as an institution. LeMay was not a visionary, but he ably executed air power theory as he adapted both his means and ends within the boundaries laid down by Trenchard, Douhet, and Mitchell. Identifying the Enemy Throughout their long quest for autonomy and, ultimately, indepen­ dence, the airmen saw their adversary as the Army, of which they were a restive and unwilling part. For the airmen, the mainstream Army was wedded to weapons and a mode of warfare that the airmen hoped to make obsolete. As World War II drew to a close and AAF planners could once again turn to thoughts of an independent postwar air force, it was nat­ ural for them to think in terms of their prewar jousting against Army parochialism. "Perhaps all parochialism in the military is based on that perceived in others. The records show that despite the tendencies of  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 154 --- The Praetioners 131 certain Army officers, the Army generals demonstrated less parochialism during the war than did the Air Force or Navy officers."13 Indeed, the AAF planners had their sights on the wrong adversary. In large measure, Army parochialism was an illusion of Kuter—Arnold's closest advisor in Washington from 1943 to 1945. Kuter identified the wrong adversary, for it was the Navy that caused the Air Force its greatest postwar problems. This false identification led the Air Force to tilt at windmills, while the Navy was able to organize its
