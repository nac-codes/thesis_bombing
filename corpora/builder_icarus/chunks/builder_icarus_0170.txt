wrong adversary, for it was the Navy that caused the Air Force its greatest postwar problems. This false identification led the Air Force to tilt at windmills, while the Navy was able to organize its forces effectively to battle the AAF on the question of unification.14 If the airmen's prewar claims had disturbed the Army as fancifully preposterous, their postwar claims absolutely terrified the Navy as threatening its future existence. Certainly Colonel William Mitchell had claimed that airpower was the first line of defense and offense, but the Air Corps leaders of the 1920's and 1930's had been much more subtle in their arguments for autonomy. As World War II drew to a close, subtlety had largely disappeared and the obsolescence of navies and armies was pointed out by key AAF commanders such as Lieutenant General James Doolittle and General George Kenney. They claimed that they wanted equality with the Army and Navy, but in making their case before Congress and the press their arguments were such that they could justify not equality but supremacy of the Air Force.15 In the intense intramural battles that would attend the reorganization of the American military services over the first five postwar years, the Air Force would find its fiercest adversary in the Navy, not the Army. The Army would become an advocate for service unification; whereas the Navy would end up fighting against both unification and an independent air forceâ€”the first because it would encroach upon the Navy' s traditional independence and the second because the Air Force was clearly bent on demonstrating that navies had become irrelevant.
