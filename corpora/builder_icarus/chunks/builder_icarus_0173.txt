gh all the new technologies, from radar to jet engines and rockets, were significant, none was more important or represented a potentially more disturbing influence than the atomic bomb. The full implications of a weapon of such tremendous power, cost, and complexity were difficult to comprehend in the uncertain postwar situation. How the Air Force initially responded to the atomic bomb would be crucial not only to its future but to the nation's as well.4 Given the importance of the atomic bomb to the Air Force—to the claims of air power theory, to air forces as the delivery agents and future trustees of this decisive weapon, to the impetus it gave for an independent air force—the airmen found themselves remarkably ignorant about the bomb. Although the Air Force's 509th Composite Bomb Group (Very Heavy) had dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the AAF itself had at best a peripheral involvement in the bomb's development. It had modified the B-29s and trained air and ground personnel of the 509th, but by the war's end, fewer than 20 of the AAF's top officers had even a rudimentary knowledge of the atomic bomb. The terrible damage inflicted on the two Japanese cities forced American air leaders to assess the impact of this powerful new weapon upon warfare in general and the Air Force in particular.5 From the outset, the implications for the needed size of the bomber force were troubling. Jeffrey Record has theorized that: General Curtis LeMay and other top Air Force leaders were less than enthusiastic about the use of the atomic bomb against Japan in 1945 and subsequently pooh- poohed its decisiveness in compelling the Japanese to sue for peace, (a conclusion shared, incidentally, by the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey). One of the reasons for this attitude was fear that atomic weapons, because of their vastly  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 158 --- Breaking Free 135 greater efficiency than conventional bombs, would jeopardize USAF postwar plans fo
