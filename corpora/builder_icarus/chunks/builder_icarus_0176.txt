e great costs associated with facilities and bomb production, which itself was a meticulous and time-consuming process, indicated that the number of bombs on hand for any future conflict would be small. For some time to come, the bombs were expected to remain experimental "special weapons" of great cost and complexity, difficult to build and transport, and of limited availability. Due to the bomb's shape, weight, and peculiar handling requirements, only the few SILVERPLATE B-29s modified during the war for the Manhattan Project could carry the bomb then or for the next several years because appreciable size and weight reductions were not foreseen. The Superfortress' range with this 10,000 pound load meant that strategically located oversea bases would be required for staging until the planned intercontinental B-36s began operating from the U.S. Plans for such "peripheral basing" were already a firm part of American postwar planning.9 Significantly, the experiences of the battle for air superiority over Europe, but not Japan, figured heavily in the deliberations of the Spaatz Board. The AAF had learned during the war that air superiority and suppression of hostile air defenses were crucial for strategic bombing operations to proceed without unacceptable losses. In any future conflict such losses could not be risked with the few atomic bombs, modified B-29s, and trained crews that would be available. As in World War II, the full range of air forces would thus be required to gain and hold the air supremacy necessary to permit effective delivery of the atomic bombs. In the recently ended war, this air supremacy was acquired only after more than two years of steady build-up and bloody attritional aerial fighting; in the future, such time would not be available to the United States.10 This reasoning allowed the Spaatz Board to return to the traditional concepts of strategic bombardment, with large fleets of bombers with conventional bombs despite the advent of the atomic
