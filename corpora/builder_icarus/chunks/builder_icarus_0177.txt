States.10 This reasoning allowed the Spaatz Board to return to the traditional concepts of strategic bombardment, with large fleets of bombers with conventional bombs despite the advent of the atomic bomb. The production and tactical limitations of the atomic bomb meant a continued reliance on conventional bombers and ordnance. By seeding the atomic bomb  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 160 --- Breaking Free 137 carriers among the conventional B-29s, they could be protected during daylight raids, thus lessening the probability of their loss while increasing target identification and bomb delivery. The Spaatz Board saw that the unmodified B-29s had a much more important role to play than simply flying cover or diversions for the atomic bombing aircraftâ€” they would be the backbone for any future strategic air offensive. The many uncertainties surrounding the bomb's employment meant that conventional bombing would remain the AAF's principal weapon of strategic warfare for some years to come. The burden of any future strategic air offensive would fall to the conventional bombers because the relatively few and very expensive atomic bombs had to be saved for large targets where accuracy was not as critical as destructiveness and psychological impact. The best solution, it appeared to the Spaatz Board, was to select targets that were easily identified, visually or on radar, and most vulnerable to the blast, thermal, and radiation effects of the air-burst atomic bomb. Such targets were large urban and industrial areas, not military point targets. The characteristics and limited numbers of the earliest atomic bombs, the small size of the bomber force in the initial stages of any future conflict, tactical requirements, and lack of detailed target information for many parts of the world pushed the airmen even farther from their previous concept of precision attacks against an enemy's war-making capability and toward a doctrine of massive destruction of large population c
