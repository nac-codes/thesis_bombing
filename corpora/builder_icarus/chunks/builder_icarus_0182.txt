meets its commitment to the Army by providing permanent and strong tactical air forces. In part as a result of this promise, Eisenhower and Bradley were won over.17 This was a promise that Quesada knew he could keep because of his outstanding cooperation with the Army ground forces in Europe. Quesada approached his new job [as head of the Tactical Air Command] with the conviction that the best way to keep the tactical air mission from falling back under the Army was to provide such outstanding support that the Army would be totally satisfied and forget about having its own air force.18 In his bid for institutional independence, Spaatz had made promises that were antithetical to air power theory. He was obliged to adopt bureaucratic command arrangements that could not long endure along­ side the intellectual foundations for independence provided through air power theory. Although he knew well the crucial importance that the strategic function would play, Spaatz found that Eisenhower's support had been purchased at the price of establishing a tactical command in the postwar air organization.... So, with the reorganization of March 1946, instead of a single combat command, three functional commands were established—strategic, tactical, and air-defense.19 But the concessions were short-lived: While Quesada battled with elements in both the newly created Air Force, and the Army, which wanted to create its own tactical air arm, worldwide developments were conspiring against his efforts.
