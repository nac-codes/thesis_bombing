could be brought to a halt via the aerial destruction of carefully selected elements of its economic infrastructure, and (2) that there was no truly effective defense, direct or indirect, against aerial bombardment. By deliberate omission, the theory more or less ignored the role and value of tactical air power, which because it was tied to combined operations involving surface forces, provided no firm foundation for independence; until well into the 1960s official USAF doctrine cast the value of tactical fighter aircraft at first largely in terms of their ability to provide long- range escorts for strategic bombardment campaigns to be carried out as subcomponents of Massive Retaliation.21 Air Power Theory Sustained The AAF leadership came out of the Second World War with the air power theory intact, despite considerable evidence that it was flawed and incomplete. It was as though World War II had never occurred and the specter of World War I still haunted its survivors: Spaatz's views on strategic air followed the historical development of the Trenchard-Mitchell-Arnold school: Prolonged ground wars of attrition must be avoided at all costs. "Attritional war," said Spaatz shortly after succeeding Arnold, "might last years...would cost wealth that centuries alone could repay and.. .would take untold millions of lives." The lessons of World War II were writ clear: Strategic bombing is thus the first war instrument of history capable of stopping the heart mechanism of a great industrialized  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 165 --- 142 The Icarus Syndrome enemy. It paralyzes his military power at the core. It has a strategy and tactic of mobility and flexibility which are peculiar to its own medium, the third dimension.22 Those words could have been written 15 years earlier at the Air Corps Tactical School and without the benefit of the experiences of World War II. Perry McCoy Smith provides a clue as to why the lessons went unseen when he describes the euphoria
