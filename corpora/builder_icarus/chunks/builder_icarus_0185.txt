earlier at the Air Corps Tactical School and without the benefit of the experiences of World War II. Perry McCoy Smith provides a clue as to why the lessons went unseen when he describes the euphoria that enveloped the Army airmen at the end of World War II. The coincidence of opinion within the Air Corps on the supreme importance of autonomy can be explained by years of frustrated efforts, the common bond of the joy of aviation, and the crusading attitude of these men. At last the tenuous theoretical arguments of Douhet and Mitchell had been justified in the eyes of the Air Corps leaders and the years of frustration were over. The great joy and overstatement in the period immediately following the successful explosion of the two atomic bombs was well recorded in the press and in the congressional hearings of 1945 and 1946. Airpower would defend this nation; airpower would guarantee the success of a new international security organization; airpower would punish aggression wherever it might manifest itself; airpower would save the world. Salvation had come; all America and the world needed to do was to maintain and support a strong United States Air Forceâ€”a simple, reliable formula. The airplane was not considered just another weapon; it was the ultimate weapon for universal peacekeeping.23 The optimism of the airmen's postwar planning was sufficient to overcome any concerns about the dominance of the offense, despite the brutal lessons of 1943 in the battle for air superiority over Europe. Just as Air Corps leaders in the late 1930's were unwilling to observe technological developments in pursuit aircraft and just as Air Corps leaders in the early 1940's refused to recognize that development in German defensive tactics and technology might proceed at a faster pace than offensive tactics and technology, the postwar planners seemed unable even to contemplate the possibility that air defense might ever gain an ascendancy over air offense.24 But this was consistent with
