offensive tactics and technology, the postwar planners seemed unable even to contemplate the possibility that air defense might ever gain an ascendancy over air offense.24 But this was consistent with the tenacity of air power theory and doctrine because they were means to institutional ends, not just the ends of war. A long-time student of airpower, Professor William R. Emerson, has observed: "Making all due allowances for the difficulties and the genuine accomplishments of our strategists, it should, nevertheless, be perfectly clear that every salient belief of prewar American air doctrine was either overthrown or drastically modified by the experience of war.25  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 166 --- Breaking Free 143 Perry McCoy Smith explains why the paradox could persist: Instead of making the common mistake of planning to fight the next war with weapons and techniques that had been effective in the last, the Air Corps planners were laying plans to conduct the next war using weapons and techniques that had been proven largely ineffective in [World War II]. The reason is quite obvious: the planners were not making detailed plans for fighting the next war but rather were planning for a force that could provide the justification for autonomy. The doctrinal dedication to strategic bombardment at the expense of close air support and interdiction led to difficulties, among them lack of adequate support of ground forces during the Korean conflict, deemphasis of tactical training, and lack of development of tactical weapons systems and tactical munitions (much of the development in these areas was done by the Navy in the two decades following World War II).26 The planners of today, of course, are not "planning for a force that could provide the justification for autonomy" but one that will justify retaining the airplanes, particularly the combat aircraft and most particularly now, the fighters.
