and his freedom to build a professional force to fulfill it. At the same time, the leadership of the Air Force was steadily shifting to the more numerous aviators who were not so much air power theorists as they were World War II fliers and operators. These were people who had come into the war as aviation enthusiasts and for whom air power theory was accepted as proven background, not to be questioned and without any need for development. Fighter pilots might chafe under the dominance of the Air Force by bomber pilots; but that was the way things had always been since the bomber advocates had found the keys to the kingdom of independence at the Air Corps Tactical School. During this period, alternatives to the airplane began to emerge as means for fulfilling the ends of air power theory. Both cruise and ballistic missiles, in the forms of the V-1 and V-2 missiles, had appeared at the end of World War II. The Army and Navy had acquired both models of these captured German missiles for experimentation after the war. The Navy went so far as to fire a V-2 ballistic missile from the deck of one of its new large aircraft carriers. But the Air Force, preoccupied with the develop­ ment of a fleet of jet aircraft, largely ignored these new missiles, perhaps in an unconscious unwillingness to pursue what they saw as potentially competitive means to airplanes and their pilots. But some of those who had originally been attracted to air power theory for its ends rather than its means found themselves attracted to missiles as more effective means than airplanes to the ends of air power. This was a period of fermentation in Cold War strategy and in guided missiles, rockets, and jets. All of the services were involved in experi­ mentation; but the Strategic Air Command (SAC) was being forged into a complex of forces, culture, plans, bases, and doctrine that would dominate the Air Force and strategic thinking for almost two decades, worldwide. LeMay's SAC would own the Air Force;
