rong time. And nearly everybody missed the point. The strategic bombers were then, as they are now, fully able to do their job. The only hitch was that the assumptions did not coincide with reality. The Korean War was real enough; it was the assumptions that were not valid for that particular reality. Whether the reality—i.e., the Korean War—was "right" or "wrong" was irrelevant.5 So air power theory would no longer be held accountable in the only conflicts that the world would now choose to wage—in the world of constraints that nuclear deterrence had wrought, in conflicts less than all- out war. Indeed, it was now easier to associate air power theory with nuclear deterrence than with "police actions" or "brush fire wars"—the only kinds of shooting wars that would be waged during the Cold War. Air power would keep the peace, but not win the wars anyone cared to fight. Airpower theory, as a theory for winning wars quickly and cheaply, was being abandoned for a fleet of nuclear bombers (a nuclear force structure). The soul of the new Air Force had been bought for airplanes. The essence of air power theory—reliance upon the offense instead of defense, striking at the heart of the enemy with decisive effect—was clearly evident in Vandenberg's decision to rebuild the Air Force for the Cold War around SAC and strategic bombardment. One of the most important decisions Vandenberg made was to give primary emphasis to strategic air power as the essential force for the defense of the United States and the free world.... This emphasis on strategic bombing was not an easy decision to stand on. There was disagreement within the Air Force on such a heavy emphasis on SAC. After the Korean War began, some complained about the performance of the Air Force in supporting ground troops. Vandenberg's critics accused him of neglecting tactical aviation. SAC supporters dismissed these charges by pointing to Vandenberg's record before and during World War II as a member of the tactical air
