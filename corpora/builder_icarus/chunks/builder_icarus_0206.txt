till in full stride. Orville Wright, and some of the men in the Aeolian Company who had pioneered with us in the earlier experiments, were  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 183 --- 160 The Icarus Syndrome still active. There was no doubt that the Bug could be put into large-scale production within a very short time. I called a meeting at which only Kettering, Bill Knudsen [Lt. Gen. Knudsen, the US AAF production "czar"] and myself were present. We discussed the availability of bases; of targets; the cost; production; comparison of production between the Bugs and heavy bombers; raw materials needed for the two types of weapons. We finally came to the conclusion, unanimously, that even with the most improved type of Bug, the best we could do from England would be to hit Paris, or some of the other large cities in France, Belgium, or Holland. We could not get at the real heart of our enemyâ€”interior Germany itself.9 The problem with the Bugs was not doctrinal, at least with Arnold, but the geographical asymmetries between the Allies and Germans: Had we been in the position the Germans then were, and had the Germans instead of the English inhabited the British Isles, the story would have been very different. We could, and we would have concentrated the flight of thousands upon thousands of these Bugs on practically all the interior of southern and middle England, including the key industrial areas. We could probably have had this assault in full swing by late 1942, or early 1943, and have used the Bug by the thousands and tens of thousands. The Germans could have done little to stop it. As it was, the first pilotless bomb did not buzz across the English Channel from a German launching site until the night of the 12th of June, 1944, a week after our ground forces had landed in Normandy, and two and a half years after Kettering, Knudsen, and I held this discussion in my office.10 Arnold didn't dismiss the German V-l "buzz" bombs as a mere nuisance weapon, even though
