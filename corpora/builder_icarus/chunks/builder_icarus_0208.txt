n England, and regardless of larger strategic considerations there seemed to me to be quite enough of them." Technology as Threat The Air Force pays a price for its love of technology: Technology shows no reverence for institutional doctrine or structure. In fostering technology, even for its cherished instruments, the Air Force is necessarÂ­ ily instigating new concepts and capabilities that challenge the form and preferences of its institution. Perry McCoy Smith explains why the Air Force has often looked at particular new technological developments with a blind eye: Once a military doctrine is established it is difficult to change, especially if technological advancements in weaponry seriously bring into question a doctrine upon which a specific military service is based. Like policy, doctrine has a gyroscopic effect. And if service doctrine is questioned by members of that service, there is a tendency for the leadership to brand the critics heretics, especially if the doctrine is the basis upon which the primary goals of a service are constructed. In addition, the formulation and articulation of the doctrine is ordinarily designed to justify fully the service's attempt to obtain or maintain exclusive control over certain missions. Criticism usually results in an undermining of the case the service has so carefully made for certain roles and missions in national defense. Dissent is therefore discouraged, and breakthroughs in technology which might bring established doctrine into question are often ignored.12 Richard Hallion suggests that doctrine must be made as dynamic as technology if the Air Force is to fully benefit from its worship of technology: [B]ecause the Air Force as a service is wedded (and rightly so) to technology, there is always the danger that technology will make one's doctrine obsolete, will replace doctrine as the determinant of the future course of the Air Force, and will become merely a convenient shibboleth endowed by advocates with greater
