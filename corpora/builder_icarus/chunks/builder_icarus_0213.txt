of the services were much more concerned with pursing their estab­ lished interests in aircraft carriers or bombers or divisions.' Although pilotless aircraft, rockets, and dreams of space flight found comfortable niches in the growing and confident Air Force of the 1950s, they were treated as harmless fringe elements that came with the scientists and engineers the Air Force needed for its exciting journey into the "jet" age. But in the late 1950s, air power theory was credibly threatened for the first time with alternative means to the airplane for its ends. The threat of alternative means did not come from some wild-eyed advocate advancing theories,2 but from the most serious and dangerous enemy of the Cold War. The Soviet developments in ballistic missiles and space in the late 1950s forced a dramatic change on the Air Force. What had been tolerated, sometimes even resisted, within the Air Force before now gained center stage for budgets, interservice competition, and national security. Unless the Air Force dominated missiles and space, the role of airplanes in the Air Force of the future could be threatened. It was much better for these new means to be in the hands of the Air Force than in the hands of those who might still challenge the legitimacy of the Air Force as a separate institution. 165  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 189 --- 166 The Icarus Syndrome But there were many in the Air Force, such as the technologists attracted to the Air Force because it was at the cutting edge of technology, who found these new means even more attractive and technically demanding than airplanes. Missile and space enthusiasts appeared within the Air Force. Theories about control of space—the high ground— echoed the air power theorizing of 40 years earlier.3 The leadership of the Air Force, however, remained firmly in the hands of the pilots and operators of World War II. When the development of missiles reached the point where their efficacy could no longer be denied
