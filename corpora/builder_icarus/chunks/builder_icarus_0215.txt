should proceed cautiously by way of slower, less revolutionary, air-breathing vehicles. This judgment led to emphasis upon the air-breathing Snark and Navaho—a priority that continued into the 1950s. A June 1947 Air Force report on missile development placed long-range, surface-to-surface missiles at the fourth level of priority and stressed missile types that could increase bomber and fighter  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 190 --- New Dimensions 167 capabilities.

Air Force Research on long-distance ballistic missiles was cancelled in 1947, not to be revived until 1951 and then only at a minimal level and under the influence of Korea induced defense spending increases.4 Without someone like General Arnold to foster technological alterna­ tives to manned aircraft, missile developments in the Air Force after World War II were relegated to those hobbyists who were willing to sacrifice their institutional careers in favor of their technological dreams. For many years after World War II, intercontinental ballistic missiles were neglected and virtually ignored within the Air Force (and consequently more or less within the United States government). After the retirement of General Arnold in 1946, no powerful figure or group within the Air Force gave much consideration to long range ballistic missile potentials until 1953. No important command or agency saw its function as their promotion. On the contrary, the Air Force structure was geared to concentrate on manned aircraft. Furthermore, the research and development arm of the Air Force was, until 1951, subordinated within an airplane-oriented command and thus both naturally and by orders followed that lead. A major American redirection of effort to accelerate ballistic missile development did not occur until 1953-54, some seven years after the Soviet Union had initiated such a program.5 This neglect was not a deliber
