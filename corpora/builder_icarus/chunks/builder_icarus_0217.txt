as no institutional lobby for the competing missiles; even though the Air Research and Development Command—an organization that perceived missiles as a major area of responsibility—had been created in 1951, that agency remained for some years weaker and less influential than its peers. In addition, the ARDC birth was accompanied by friction and bitterness from the parent Air Materiel Command, a problem that persisted for several years.6 Although aircraft and missile technologies were changing rapidly during the first decade after World War II, the Air Force priorities were not. There is little that differs in the Air Force analysis in 1950 from its position in 1946-1947. The strategic bombardment function was still the most important within the Air Force. The chosen means to accomplish the mission remained the manned bomber fleet and would continue to be so with the future deployment of the B-52. Long range surface-to-surface missiles were not important within the relevant future of the Air Force. It was important, however, that other services not develop such weapons which would then compete with the Air Force responsibility and the chosen Air Force vehicles. Air Force distribution of responsibility agreements with the other services were designed to prevent such competition. By June 1950, the Air Force missile program was down to four projects from an immediate postwar high of twenty-six, and there was every indication that the program might be reduced further if budgetary restrictions continued to be imposed.7 If the attitudes and motivations in the Air Force about ballistic missiles in those early postwar years were speculative, the budgets were not: By 1949 the Air Force was spending almost $3 billion annually for the development and procurement of manned airplanes; only $39 million supported their sundry missile projects. Those funds were directed exclusively to aerodynamic missiles, a preference which was perhaps related to the fact that such missiles resembl
