; only $39 million supported their sundry missile projects. Those funds were directed exclusively to aerodynamic missiles, a preference which was perhaps related to the fact that such missiles resembled "their familiar aircraft, flew at comparable speeds, and could be controlled by guidance they understood." Aside from certain component development work, the only funds devoted to long-range ballistic rockets between 1947 and 1951 were those modest sums supplied by Convair Corporation out of their private investment budgets.8 If missile developments were cheap enough to keep the hobbyists in the Air Force entertained, missile production and deployment would have seriously encroached upon manned aircraft force structures. Thus, al­ though several missiles were partially developed, budget pressure trun­ cated their paths toward the mainstream of the Air Force.

By 1953 a number of individual projects had been initiated and were reaching the stage where prototypes had to be constructed if further progress was to be made. Naturally this would entail significant increase in the level of development expenditures. At the same time their jet aircraft program was approaching a similar stage in the development cycle. But rather than being able to anticipate increases in defense spending, the outcome of the 1952 elections and the conclusion of the Korean War brought new pressures for economy. In this atmosphere of retrenchment the Air force chose to defend its embryonic jet combat units by reprogramming funds away from their sundry missile projects.9 The circumstances of the Snark cruise missile development bring Edmund Beard to suspect conspiracy: [A]ir planners consistently predicted that surface-to-air antiaircraft missiles would become available during the earl
