of the Snark cruise missile development bring Edmund Beard to suspect conspiracy: [A]ir planners consistently predicted that surface-to-air antiaircraft missiles would become available during the early 1950s and that these weapons would be particularly effective against subsonic aircraft. These same planners agreed that ballistic missiles were, within any conceivable technology, unstoppable. Yet development of these vehicles was persistently delayed. Enormous efforts were put into developing the B-52 as a follow on to the B-36. In addition, during the 1950s the Air force strongly promoted the B-70, a supersonic long-range heavy bomber designed to follow the B-52. [M]uch money was also invested in the Snark, the least efficient of the contemplated long-range missiles. The Snark and the B-52 were broadly comparable weapons, but the Snark always lacked accuracy and reliability and never developed operational capability. The suspicion remains that the Snark may have been supported in some quarters precisely because it did not constitute a real threat to the B-52 or any follow on bomber. During the same period, the Air Force hierarchy devoted significant efforts to standoff missiles, which were considered vital to the health and effectiveness of the manned bomber fleet. The cultural identification with manned airplanes and the cultural resistance to ballistic missiles seems obvious.10 Jeffrey Record argues that the prejudice against missiles was explicit: As General Thomas D. White, Air Force Chief of Staff from 1957 to 1961, once candidly conceded, "To say there is not a deeply ingrained prejudice in favor of aircraft among flyers would be a stupid statement..1 Whether the stakes did or did not motivate the actions, the actions reflected the stakes of those involved. Robert L. Perry, a perceptive analyst and sympathetic critic of the Air Force, has succinctly stated the bomber-missile issue:  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 193 --- 170 The Icarus Syndrome Without
