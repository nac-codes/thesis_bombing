L. Perry, a perceptive analyst and sympathetic critic of the Air Force, has succinctly stated the bomber-missile issue:  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 193 --- 170 The Icarus Syndrome Without going deeply into the sociology or psychology of the phenomenon, it is plain that the people who had grown with manned bombers before and during World War II and who mostly stayed with them through the next decade developed an abiding affection for them, an affection based in some degree on what aircraft meant as a way of life, a symbol, a means of performing their military assignment. With minor exceptions, those who sought to bring on change had no such commitments; they were primarily engineers and scientists of one sort or another and only secondarily airplane commanders. It is not really important whether the opponents of change, or its supporters, consciously recognized the possibility that the adoption of the ballistic missile as a primary means of delivering nuclear weapons would cause the decline or even the disappearance of the strategic bomber. It is important, however, that they sometimes acted as if they foresaw that possibility.12 The blind eye most often took the form of reasonable skepticism: The impossibility inference appears to have been present in the early history of the ICBM. Most Air Force personnel at the Air Staff level (and probably elsewhere) simply denied that an "accurate" long-range rocket was possible, at least in the foreseeable future. The ballistic rocket was at least implicitly a competitor to the manned strategic bomber. The bomber was.. .the central focus of identification within the Air Force. To conceive of a new weapon that might someday perform its primary task much more efficiently would require great restructuring of beliefs. The literature of cognitive psychology, as well as most people's everyday experience, makes it clear that such restructuring is a difficult, unpleasant task. The normal reaction is to reject the disturbing
