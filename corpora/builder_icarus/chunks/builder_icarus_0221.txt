iterature of cognitive psychology, as well as most people's everyday experience, makes it clear that such restructuring is a difficult, unpleasant task. The normal reaction is to reject the disturbing new element. The Air Force's behavior in the early days of the ICBM followed this pattern.... It is worth remembering that Air Force planners in 1947-48 did not expect even long- range supersonic bombers to be operationally available before 1957. Since the Air Force officers not only understood bombers and knew they worked but often equated their own personal usefulness and well-being with that weapon it is not surprising that long range supersonic missiles were placed even further into the future.13 Michael Terry suggests that the prejudice was not just from flyers towards their airplanes, but also from the institution towards its missions and newly won independence. The "cultural identification" with manned aircraft and the organizational resistance to ballistic missiles was apparent. Without its independence anchored to a bedrock of uncompromising "roles and missions," the Air Force faced an unraveling of their newly established institution. Their resistance to changing their basic functions, or to sharing them with other defense organizations, could be understood. Military institutions are very conservative regarding their missions and attempt to maintain them; at stake is "their autonomy, organizational morale, [and] organizational essence."14  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 194 --- New Dimensions 171 Jeffrey Record provides a nice summary of the "blind eye," including what the loss of Hap Arnold cost the Air Force in terms of breadth of perspective and objectivity. Indeed, during the period 1945 to 1954, an Air Force attitude of "neglect and indifference" toward the development of ICBMs permitted the Soviet Union to gain an early lead in long-range ballistic missile technologies. Until the Office of the Secretary of Defense and other civilian authorities,
