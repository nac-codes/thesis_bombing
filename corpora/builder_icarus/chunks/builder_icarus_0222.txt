rd the development of ICBMs permitted the Soviet Union to gain an early lead in long-range ballistic missile technologies. Until the Office of the Secretary of Defense and other civilian authorities, including President Eisenhower, intervened to impose an accelerated schedule and new management organizations and procedures that in effect removed the ICBM's development from normal USAF channels, "cultural resistance" within the Air Force to a new weapon that promised to displace the manned bomber restricted USAF interest in the ICBM largely to situations in which it "perceived a threat from...a sister service" to acquire them. Though General "Hap" Arnold exhibited great enthusiasm and prescient anticipation of ICBMs, for almost a decade the Air Force's postwar leadership consciously retarded ICBM development by withholding adequate funding and imposing nearly impossible performance requirements.15 Not All Were Blind Was the "blind eye" an inevitable consequence of the Air Force's institutional circumstances? There is too much evidence that the Air Force had leaders who were willing to contemplate and embrace alternaÂ­ tives to manned aircraft. Gen. Carl A. Spaatz, one of the foremost military experts, wrote in 1945: "Lethal rockets will flash through the stratosphere scores of miles above the earth, carrying atomic weapons.. ..",6 Arnold's clear perception of the world, which would unfold decades later is astonishing: In the fall of 1944, Arnold established von Karman as head of a new Scientific Advisory Group for the air force and ordered him to look far into the technological future. According to von Karman's dramatic account, the two rendezvoused at a remote corner of La Guardia airport, Arnold dismissed his chauffeur ("Not another car was in sight"), and the general disclosed his plans. As fleshed out by his staff, Arnold's rationale for a permanent alliance of officers and scientists was both political and strategic. The strategic danger to the United States lay
