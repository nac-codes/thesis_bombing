t."17 Arnold was explicit about the need for dynamism considering internal and external forces on the military institutions: We must stop "shoeing dead horses." We have been doing that far too long. We have, in the United States, been operating this Army station, or that Naval base, or that piece of equipment for years, because—well, because what? Well, any old reason. We did it because of Congressman or Senator "X"—we must have his support; he might lose votes, and so not support the Army, Navy, or Air Force Bill; or we have had this unit ever since the Revolution, and tradition is behind it, so we will keep it in being; or, some time or other there may be a use for this station, or that base, or some obsolete technique or pieces of equipment. There is only one question that should be asked about these things: "Do they fit into the modern war picture?" Not the picture of 1919, nor of 1941, but of the war of the future. If they don't, we should be ruthless, and throw them out. For instance, who knows whether 70 groups of airplanes is the right or wrong number to prevent another war? Was not that number selected in relation to costs and expenditures, rather than with regard to the composition and strength necessary to our armed forces in the world picture? Do 70 groups have any relationship to our new foreign obligations? The proper number may be 47,70, or even 170; but it should be based upon our foreign policy and the part we must take in the operations of the armed forces of the Alliance.... The principles of yesterday no longer apply. Air travel, air power, air trans­ portation of troops and supplies have changed the whole picture. We must think in terms of tomorrow. We must bear in mind that air power itself can become obsolete. Duplications, obsolete construction projects, obsolete techniques and policies, overlapping in the armed services' operations and organizations must go by the boards. There is no place for two air forces today any more than there is for
