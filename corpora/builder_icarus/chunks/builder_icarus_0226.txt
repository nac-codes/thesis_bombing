The AAF must go to guided missiles for the initial heavy casualty phases of future wars.19 Playing Catch-Up When the Air Force was pushed by outside events into the ballistic missile business, it did so in a partnership with the aircraft industry which dated back to the 1930s. Nevertheless, in 1954 in the face of the anticipated obsolescence of manned bombers, the Air Force and its industrial associates accepted the missile era as inevitable and made a major effort to capture the new market.

They also wished to discredit the concept of weapons development implicit in the Army's arsenal system.20 General White tried to find an acceptable path across the chasm that now yawned before the airmen with the advent of missiles: There would be a transition to missiles and thence to space, but airmen would participate at every stage and not be displaced. On November 29,1957, White announced at the National Press Club the decision to speed the United States readiness for combat use of long-range ballistic missiles, placing the missile program with the Strategic Air Command. The intermediate and intercontinental ballistic missiles wer
