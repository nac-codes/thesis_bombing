to twenty miles above the earth's surface and relinquish control of space above that altitude and still survive.... We airmen who have fought to assure that the United States has the capability to control the air are determined that the United States must win the capability to control space." He pledged he would lead the Air Force in the race for control of space.21 At the same time he was trying to placate the airmen, White also tried to warn them against adopting a siege mentality for the changes that would soon be imposed on the Air Force. Even though White believed that "there is no question that SAC, as presently constituted, is the only thing between us and oblivion and will be for a long time  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 198 --- New Dimensions 175 to come," he also believed that the Air Force was late in realizing the potential of missiles and that "the top level of the Air Force does not know enough about missiles."

We cannot afford to ignore the basic precept that all truths change with time."22 White's sugar coating on the bitter pill was that airmen would soon have their own manned space vehicles for fighting wars in space. To General White "almost everything in space" fitted into the Air Force mission. "We foresee," he said, "that we are not only going to have manned bombers and missiles, but that eventually we will have manned space vehicles as combat weapons in the future."23 Michael Terry sums up the position of the Air Force leadership on the "missile crisis" they faced in the last half of the 1950s: Throughout the period from 1955 to 1959, Air Force leadership, although endorsing a struggling missile program, was not committed to supplementing or augmenting the bomber force with ballistic missiles if
