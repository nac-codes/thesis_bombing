ughout the period from 1955 to 1959, Air Force leadership, although endorsing a struggling missile program, was not committed to supplementing or augmenting the bomber force with ballistic missiles if it meant deemphasizing the status of an aerial bombardment strategy, if it undermined the superior position of the manned bomber, or if it denigrated the priority in development of any "follow-on" manned bomber. In addition, a technological parallel to the manned bomber was envisioned by airmen to operate in space and keep the institutional tradition at the forefront of Air Force thinking.24 Then, in the wake of the JSoviet missile and space developments, the Air Force lost control of the pace of transition to a concerned American public and its administration: In 1959, Eisenhower established the nation's highest defense priorities: development of the ICBM and launching the Vanguard satellite to compete in the space race. LeMay's quite different priorities were acquisition of more B-52 bombers, development of the B-70, and development of the nuclear-powered bomber. ICBMs ranked at the bottom of LeMay's list.25 The difference in the reactions of the American military services to the accelerated development of ballistic missiles is revealing: Morton Halperin has observed that "most senior naval officers have tended to view the Polaris missile-firing submarines as a service to the nation extraneous to the Navy's 'essential' tasks." It should be noted, however, that neither the  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 199 --- 176 The Icarus Syndrome Army nor the Navy suffered the internal strains and bitterness that beset the Air Force during the development and introduction of ballistic missiles. The most immediate explanation is simply that the missiles did not threaten any established Army or Navy weapon. Without harming the central purposes of either service, ballistic missiles offered the opportunity of broadening their roles. The Army, indeed, from their earliest days
