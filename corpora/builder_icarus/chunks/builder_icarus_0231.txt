ncerning the decisiveness of air power.... In the dawn of the atomic age, the ability to deliver tremendous firepower on target could have been accomplished by ballistic missiles more efficiently than by manned bombers; ballistic missiles could have been the symbol of the "decisiveness of air power," but the Air Force preferred to advocate their manned bomber over new strategic missile technology.... For the Air Force, 1955 to 1959 was a formative period, integrating improved missile technology into its role and concept of air power. Their myopic view against ballistic technology in the early 1950s gave way to "benign neglect" as the leaders of the Air Force modified their perspective on aerial warfare to include ballistic missiles.. ..28  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 200 --- New Dimensions 177 That modification of perspective was to trade-in air power theory for deterrence theory; and the owners of deterrence theory would be civilian academics more than military airmen.29 Thereafter, air power theory would be given little more than lip service as the guiding basis for the institutional Air Force. Henceforth, the Air Force would be guided by: • accommodating new technical means for the missions it already "owned;" • preserving its roles, missions, and budget slice against the predations of its sister services; and • insuring that its own factions or fiefdoms had their futures secured with the prospect of "follow-on" vehicles, whatever they might be. The fractionation of the Air Force followed more quickly than the vehicles it sought. Notes 1. Builder, The Masks of War, 201. 2. There were those who immediately grasped the significance of the guided missiles, both cruise and ballistic, and became ardent advocates; but they could be dismissed as dreamers by those experienced aviator heroes who had won the war. 3. In the earliest days of the American space program, in the late 1950s, Dandridge Cole of Martin (Denver), advanced what he called A Panama Theory of
