the job, certainly seven hundred won't." Pressed still again for more B-52s, Eisenhower retorted: "I don't know how many times you can kill a man, but about three should be enough." In the fall of 1959, the Pentagon for the third consecutive year requested $10 billion in new arms. Eisenhower examined U.S. retaliatory capacity of the bombers, submarines, and ICBMs in production and concluded that it was more than adequate. In denying the funds, he questioned again, "How many times do we have to destroy the Soviet Union?"5 The quest was nowhere more exaggerated and frustrating than in the Air Force's efforts to acquire a follow-on bomber for the B-52: In the spring of 1960, [Senator Lyndon] Johnson held hearings that highlighted support for the B-70 Valkyrie by Congress and the military. Disputing President Eisenhower, General Twining urged construction of the B-70 to maintain a flexible "mixed force" of bombers and missiles. "What bombers would the United States have in 1967, if the B-70 is not built?" Twining was asked. "None," he repliedâ€”even though the Air Force was then engaged in manufacturing a total of 660 B-52s in addition to 140 B-58 bombers.

The military thought it would take an endless succession of new weapons to stay ahead of the Soviets. No one accurately predicted the success and incredible longevity of the B-52, still a potent weapon almost thirty years later.6 The insatiable appetites for new means would soon be curbed by new theorists who were explicit about the ends: Air Force officers could not match the whiz kids at using their analytic techniques. When Enthoven testified before Congress, he overwhelmed the generals with charts and graphs showing that "the B-70 would add minimal extra firepower at huge cost." Still, the mili
