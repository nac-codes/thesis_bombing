from taking over. In the late 1950s, it was Curtis LeMay, promoted to Air Force vice chief of staff under General Thomas White, who led the Air Force's fight for the new B-70  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 207 --- 184 The Icarus Syndrome bomber, even over the objections of President Eisenhower. It was LeMay who determined that missiles would not displace bombers, and thus reduce the Air Force to being "the silent silo-sitters of the sixties." LeMay was one of the small group of generals who emerged from World War II as genuine fighting heroes. Unlike such legendary figures as Eisenhower and General George Marshall, whose fame came from their managerial ability and leadership finesse, LeMay earned his stars in battle. His experience as a battle- tested bomber pilot shaped his vision of warfare. His entire career was inseparable from the concept of strategic air power. LeMay was both its embodiment and its spokesman.8 The search for rationales to defend the need for new bombers took some turns that reflected desperation more than credibility, directions that remain evident even today: Taking another tack, General Twining, a former Air Force chief of staff, argued that the Air Force needed the B-70 to penetrate the Soviet Union to search out and destroy mobile ICBMs on railroad tracks. "If they [the Air Force] think this, they are crazy," replied Eisenhower. "We are not going to be searching out mobile bases for ICBMs; we are going to be hitting the big industrial and control centers." Finally, General White presented the Air Force's case for the B-70: The nation could not rely wholly on missiles, none of which had ever been fired in combat. Missiles could not be recalled, as airplanes could. Bombers could lift off and remain airborne while awaiting orders, thus giving the president a range of options in a crisis. Bombers would complicate the enemy's problem, forcing it to defend against several different kinds of attack. Finally, bombers as a demonstration of
