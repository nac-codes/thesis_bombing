ary two-engine aircraft—it was an accept­ ably safe practice to operate 727 aircraft temporarily with one generator out until it could be repaired during routine maintenance. If a second generator went out, the aircraft would have to be grounded for repairs even though one generator could provide adequate power through all phases of flight. Flight 226 was operating that night, as it had for the past  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 219 --- 196 The Icarus Syndrome 28 flights (41 flight hours), with the number three generator (on the right engine) out; and the crew was aware of that condition. Standard procedures for operation with two (instead of three) genera­ tors required that the galley (kitchen) power be turned off and that no more than one of the two air conditioners be on during takeoff, approach, and landing. This ensured that the electrical power required during low- speed flight would not exceed the allowable loads for the two remaining generators. If, in flight, a second generator were to fail, then the galley power and both air conditioners would have to be turned off to ensure the availability of sufficient electrical power during low-speed flight.6 It was assumed that the crew was operating according to the standard proce­ dures for two-generator operation. During the climb after takeoff, a fire warning came on for the number one engine, and it was shut down. Under normal conditions, the one remaining generator on the number two engine should have been sufficient for all flight operations, assuming that the procedure for one- generator operation was properly implemented. The cockpit voice re­ corder indicates that the crew was concerned about reducing the electrical load on the remaining generator; but about 45 seconds after the fire warning on the number one engine, the number two generator popped its circuit breaker. Flight 226 had lost all generator power, even though two of its engines continued to provide adequate thrust for flight and hydrau
