Air Force was an institutional crash is stretching the metaphor too far; however, the questions raised in the investigation of a crash are good ones to ask about the causes of  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 221 --- 198 The Icarus Syndrome institutional problems. And the search for a single cause that can account for all of the evidence is a way of getting at the roots rather than the manifestations of the problems. What should the institutional "incident" investigators conclude about the Air Force? What would their incident report say? What was the single human act—of commission or omission—that "doomed" the institution to these problems? What were the adverse circumstances that attended the incident, but were not the ultimate cause? Here is what I think an incident investigation report should say at the end when it must summa­ rize the cause: The Air Force was adequately established and endowed as an indepen­ dent institution by the visionaries that successfully sought to create it.8 Those visionaries advocated air power as a better way to forge and use military power. After three decades of subordination to Army views of air power, those visionaries were convinced, as they had been almost from the beginning, that to be most effective air power had to be wielded independently. Toward the end of their long and uncertain struggle for independence, independence became almost an end in itself.
