Icarus soared upwards to the sun till the wax melted which bound his wings and his flight ended in fiasco.... The classical authorities tell us, of course, that he was only 'doing a stunt'; but I prefer to think of him as the man who brought to light a serious construction defect in the flying machines of his day. So, too, in science, Cautious Daedalus will apply his theories where he feels confident they will safely go; but by his excess of caution their hidden weaknessess remain undiscovered. Icarus will strain his theories to the breaking-point till the weak joints gape. For the mere adventure? Perhaps partly, that is human nature. But if he is destined not yet to reach the sun and solve finally the riddle of its construction, we may at least hope to learn from his journey some hints to build a better machine.1 The thesis of this analysis is that many of the unique institutional problems which now plague the Air Force have their roots in the Air Force's abandonment of air power theory as its source of institutional mission and vision. Major elements of the Army Air Forces had steadily drifted away from air power theory during World War II as the actual demands for military aviation expanded their missions well beyond those originally conceived within air power theory. Although the bomber commands continued to see air power mostly in terms of the theory— striking decisively at the heart of the enemy—the fighter and air transport commands found themselves deeply involved in supporting the needs of 203  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 227 --- 204 The Icarus Syndrome Army ground forces—the very thing which the original air power theorists had seen as the squandering of air power when it was controlled by ground commanders. General George Kenney's centralized control and use of air power in the Southwestern Pacific is regarded by many as the example of the tactical use of air power in effective support of MacArthur's theater campaign objectives. But he was guid
