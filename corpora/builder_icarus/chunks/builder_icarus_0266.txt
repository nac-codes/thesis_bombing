ions were proven, air power was a theory. 2. A mission is a task or function that is assigned or adopted. Missions declare purpose. As originally conceived in airpower theory, the mission of air power was to strike at the heart of the enemy. The theory said that such strikes could be decisive and, thereby, obviate the bloody stalemate of trench warfare. But the mission was to strike at the heart of the enemy. It was the theory that said, to make such strikes, it would be necessary, first, to seize command of the air and to provide for independent control of air power. 3. A vision is an imagined objective, a conception of what can and ought to be. Visions provide a coherent basis for future decisions. The early air power theorists envisioned large fleets of airplanes, like battleships of the sky, commanded by aviators, capable of controlling the air and striking swiftly and decisively at the heart of the enemy, breaking its will and destroying its physical means for fighting. An institutional vision is a conception of what the organization can and ought to be and be about. 4. A strategy is a concept for relating means and ends. Strategies show us how to connect means to ends. As originally conceived in air power theory, the ends were winning wars quickly, without great losses of life, like those sustained in the bloody stalemate of World War I. The means were airplanes. The strategy was to employ airplanes in independently controlled strikes against the heart of the enemy after seizing command of the air. Of these four concepts, theory would seem to be the most fundamental; it supposes how things will or should work—if this, then that—and why we should care. Given a theory of how things might work, it is a much shorter intellectual step to suggest tasks that should be taken up (a  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 230 --- Crash Analysis 207 mission), to conceive what can and ought to be (a vision), and to plan the relationships among means and ends (a strategy).
