John Frisby (in a letter to the author dated 11 March 1992) cautions that just "as the claim of decisiveness should be conditional to certain kinds of war, so should 'independent control' be conditional to certain missions." I would agree, but such conditions are specified in the third axiom of the theory: "7b gain command of the air and to use air power decisively in war, air power must be centrally and independently controlled." Missions other than gaining command of the air or the decisive use of air power might not require central and independent control. 5. See Chapter 8, in the section entitled, "Camouflaging the Bombers."

The Icarus complex, Murray says, reveals itself in fantasies of flying, floating, rising and falling, either directly or through metaphors of success and failure.' Icarians seem to wish to remain children.... Basically, Icarians fear that they are in danger of being destroyed.2 Means and Ends Dilemmas If air power is to be constructively redefined—as a theory and strategy—to guide the Air Force toward its mission and vision as an institution, some of the stark choices concern the means and ends of air power: 1. Should the ends of air power be narrow or broad? Should they be striking at the heart
