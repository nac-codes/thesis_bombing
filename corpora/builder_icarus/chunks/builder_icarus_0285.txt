d have its nose under the tent flap for an expansion of its fixed wing aviation into other roles such as air defense over the battlefield, at the expense of the Air Force claim on the nation's military aircraft assets. • If the close air support role were returned to the Army, it might open up larger questions, such as the Army's control over its own airlift needs. On the other hand, some in the Air Force would also quietly concede several positive consequences: • The Air Force would be released from a role that has become vexing because: —of the subordination of air operations to the coordination and control by ground commanders; —of the susceptibility to fratricide of and by both ground and air force elements; —the aircraft requirements tend to be technically regressive (low, slow, and simple) and limiting in "mission"5 flexibility (i.e., single role); and —the Army is steadily encroaching upon the role with its own helicopter and missile forces.  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 247 --- 224 The Icarus Syndrome • The Air Force would have finally squared the circle on air power by freeing itself from the last vestige of control by surface warfare commanders and their concepts of war—one of the most basic principles or canons of the original air power theorists—leaving the Army, Navy, and Marines to shape aviation to their particular surface warfare ends while the Air Force pursued the independent ends of air power. The same kinds of arguments and counterarguments can be developed around proposals for the Air Force divestiture of the part of the airlift mission6 devoted to the lift of surface (army) forces, although they are not heard as frequently as those for the close air support mission. The divestiture of means rather than missions isn't any easier. If the Air Force had to relinquish one or more of its present means or systems, what would they be and in what order of their priority? Again, here are some that have been suggested, along with their reasons: 1
