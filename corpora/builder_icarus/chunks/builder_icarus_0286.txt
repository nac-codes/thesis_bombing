Force had to relinquish one or more of its present means or systems, what would they be and in what order of their priority? Again, here are some that have been suggested, along with their reasons: 1. Space systems. These have become national assets used to support all of the services. Surveillance, communications, and navigation support from space are essential now for all military operations. Although each of the services has special needs or priorities, these are converging rather than diverging over time. The increasing emphasis on joint service operations demands common frameworks and formats for communications, navigation, and surveillance information. Unless or until military forces are deployed into space—which seems unlikely in the near future—space systems should be treated as a shared infrastructure for all of the military services. 2. Ground-launched missiles, both ballistic and cruise. These Air Force weapons were all designed and deployed as alternative means for the delivery of nuclear weapons. With the virtual evaporation of the nuclear threat so long posed by the Soviet Union, these missiles now face declining prospects. Their original development was predicated upon a major nuclear war; and not only is the prospect for such a war declining, so is their prelaunch survivability in such a war. While these weapons have provided an important diversity in America's nuclear arsenal, that diversity was prized as a deterrent against a massive nuclear surprise attack, which is no longer an overriding national concern. It could be argued that sacrificing one or all of the above two ends and two means would not take the heart out of the Air Force. It could also be argued that their divestiture by the Air Force would bring about a new  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 248 --- Making Painful Choices 225 coherence and focus which is now missing from the institution. Of the interservice and intraservice battles listed earlier, the following would be quieted
