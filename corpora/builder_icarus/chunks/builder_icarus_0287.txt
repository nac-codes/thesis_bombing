Of the interservice and intraservice battles listed earlier, the following would be quieted between: • the Army and the Air Force over the close air support mission; • the Air Force and both the Army and Navy over ballistic missile developments; • transport and combat aviation communities over their relative status within the Air Force; and • the Air Force and the Navy over the targeting and control of strategic nuclear forces.7 The only battles that would be left from the earlier list would be those between: • bomber and fighter aviation communities over leadership of the Air Force; and • pilots and everyone else in the Air Force over their relative status. But those two battles are precisely the ones that have persisted in the Air Force since the beginnings of air power theory; they are the ones that the Air Force has historically dealt with, although obviously not to the satisfaction even of its pilots. Thus, a few hard choices of divestiture—choices that are admittedly too hard for the Air Force to make for itself, but which do not go to the heart of the institution—are beguiling to those who see the current contradictions in the Air Force. Sharing two missions with the Army and cutting the unmanned missile and space systems free could make for an entirely new landscape for the Air Force to consider what it means by air power. However, participating in—let alone initiating—any part of this kind of radical surgery for the sake of coherence in the theory or vision of air power is simply unrealistic. Such amputations would ignore the circum­ stances of history and bureaucratics which have brought about the present predicament. The solution to the dilemma must not only make logical sense but must also be practically feasible.
