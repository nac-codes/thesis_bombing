If a redefinition of air power  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 249 --- 226 The Icarus Syndrome as a theory, mission, vision, or strategy can only be found in divestiture of current Air Force missions and systems, the odds are against its being accepted, no matter how easily it might be found or argued. Who Shall Be the Leaders? However the mission and, hence, the vision of the Air Force may be defined or declared, they will only be words until they are turned into deeds by leaders. Leaders, by their deeds, may make a mockery of the words. It is the deeds, not the words, that ultimately define vision.

The question and implications of leadership interests in the Air Force can be usefully examined in the light of contrasts with the Navy. The Navy leadership faction, like that of the Air Force, has changed during the past 50 years. The Navy, like the Air Force, is composed of many factions and interests, sometimes competing and jostling each other to be heard or to get their way within the institution.

The wrestling over the leadership of the Navy by the carrier aviators, the submariners, and the surface warfare specialists is appropriate: It is about where the future of the Navy lies and, therefore, whose perspective should most influence the future evolution of the Navy. The resolution of that l
