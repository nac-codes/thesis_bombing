ace warfare specialists is appropriate: It is about where the future of the Navy lies and, therefore, whose perspective should most influence the future evolution of the Navy. The resolution of that leadership will not mean that the other dimensions of naval power disappear. Indeed, the Navy leadership—whatever its special interests— will be responsible, as it has in the past, for integrating all elements of the Navy, from carrier aviation to mine warfare, into concepts of naval power and its mission. Similarly, the rivalry between bomber and fighter pilots for leadership of the Air Force (in the name of strategic and tactical air power) would be appropriate if it focused on where the future of the Air Force lies and  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 250 --- Making Painful Choices 227 on whose perspective should most influence its future evolution. But if the rivalry for leadership is restricted, by other institutional factors, to pilots or to combat pilots, then there is a danger that the future of the institution has been cast too narrowly. It would be the same as limiting the leadership rivalry in the Navy to the battleship and carrier admirals. That rivalry was pertinent to an earlier period of Navy evolution; but the future must now admit to other possibilities, such as the submarine, "surface-effects" ships, or the "stealth" cruiser as the cutting edge of the future Navy. If the leadership rivalry of the Air Force has become limited to pilots, for whatever reason, then the Air Force may have tied its fate to one means and not the ends of air power. If the leadership rivalry has been limited to pilots mostly in the belief that the prerogatives or preeminence of pilots must be preserved within the institution, then even greater mischief may result, for such self-serving elitism sows the seeds of discontent among those whose contributions to mission have been denigrated and who have been excluded from any hope of leadership. A symptom of the problem and a co
