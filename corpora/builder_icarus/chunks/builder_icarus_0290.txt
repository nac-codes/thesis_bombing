f-serving elitism sows the seeds of discontent among those whose contributions to mission have been denigrated and who have been excluded from any hope of leadership. A symptom of the problem and a contrast between the Navy and the Air Force are illustrated by the assignments of mission commanders in the two services' surveillance aircraft. An Air Force officer who had served as the radar officer on the E-3 AW ACS observed that the pilot was the mission commander; while on the Navy's E-2 Hawkeye the radar officer was the mission commander. He asked me whether I thought flying or surveillance was the principal mission of these aircraft.8 In a videotape describing the Air Force's organizational restructuring, General Merrill McPeak, Chief of Staff, concluded his briefing with the parting phrase, "See you on the flight line." A serving Air Force officer (and pilot) observed that probably only one in four or five Air Force people would see the flight line as a routine part of their working environment. Although the phrase probably should not be given any more significance than the exhortation to "have a good day," it could be an unfortunate one for those—perhaps a majority—who are already concerned about their status in an institution dominated by flyers and their airplanes. For an analog, one would have to imagine Admiral Kelso, the Chief of Naval Operations and a submariner by his origins, closing his remarks to all Navy personnel with the phrase, "See you in the control room on our next dive." The effect would be a chilling message to most in the Navy.

Moreover, the mine warfare specialist is not excluded from leadership of the Navy because he has chosen the wrong specialty, but because of how his specialty is widely p
