of serving the carrier elites. Moreover, the mine warfare specialist is not excluded from leadership of the Navy because he has chosen the wrong specialty, but because of how his specialty is widely perceived throughout the institution to relate to naval power. If the perception of the importance of mine warfare to naval power changes, so do his chances of participating in Navy leadership. If the leadership rivalry of the Air Force has been largely resolved in favor of fighter pilots over bomber pilots, then the future of the Air Force and its mission had better lie in the future of fighter aviation. If transport or tanker pilots really could not have aspired to the leadership of the institution, then the discrimination is even more than one of favoring pilots; it is in favor of certain kinds of pilots. If those who are not pilots or who are not associated with airplanes (e.g., missiles and space systems and operations) can never hope to assume the most senior leadership positions in the Air Force, then those who have been excluded must assume that one or more of the following apply: • The leadership of the Air Force is reserved for certain kinds of pilots, regardless of the mission of the Air Force. • The mission of the Air Force does not significantly depend on means other than fighters or, perhaps, bombers; and that is not likely to change in the future. • The selection of the leadership of the Air Force has nothing to do with its mission or the future evolution of that mission. None of these possibilities is attractive. One can only hope that none is accurate, although the past is far from reassuring. However the mission of the Air Force may be defined, if the leadership of the Air Force is now in the hands of the fighter pilots then one would hope that the following are true: • Fighter aircraft are presently the most important means for that mission to be fulfilled. • At the beginning of the Cold War, bomber aircraft were the most important means for that same
