d our Navy—the nuclear subma­ rine might have proven itself over carrier aviation, just as carrier aviation proved itself over the battleship 50 years ago. Thus, there is the risk that the dominant faction in the last war may persist in leadership positions, not as representing the true future of the institution, but by the inertia of the power acquired. The question for the Air Force today is whether fighter or tactical aviation is the center of gravity for the Air Force of the future. The inertia of power within the Air Force, gained from three conventional wars over the past 40 years, clearly favors tactical aviation as the dominant means for the application of combat air power. But there are trends, even within the past 40 years, which suggest that even that could change through: • the rising importance of space systems and operations, not only for support air and land operations, but also for offensive and defensive tasks;  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 253 --- 230 The Icarus Syndrome • the wider adoption of missiles by other nations as their primary means of attacking their adversaries;10 • developments in air defense technologies which make manned aircraft less attractive than robotic flight vehicles for most applications of force;11 and • the increasing demands for rapidly projecting infrastructures rather than force to assist allies and friends in a shrinking world of growing aspirations, expectations, and conflicts. Thus, it is not inconceivable that the dominant contributions of air power by America over the next several decades could come from airlift, missiles, or space systems. Would the leadership of the Air Force change in ways that would reflect the dominant means of air power? If not, would the source of Air Force leadership remain fixed because of simple inertia or because the Air Force belongs to the combat pilots? If it is the former, then the institution is only vulnerable to being upset by unexpected events—as the Navy was by Pearl Har
