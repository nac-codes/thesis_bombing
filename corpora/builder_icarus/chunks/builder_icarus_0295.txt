hope to see. Whether my view of the future is correct or incorrect will be less pertinent than demonstrating how important such perspectives of the future can be in reformulating air power theory. My view of the future is clearly evident as I try, in the last three chapters, to formulate statements of mission and vision for the Air Force and then a theory of air power for the future. If the foundations of air power theory for the future are to be found in our perspectives of the future, then the pertinent perspectives are those of buyers and sellers of air power theory. It is not enough that Air Force leaders have a perspective of the future which suits them; if the theory— and all that flows from such a theory—is to be sold, their perspective must be shared by the buyers—those in the American public who must support (and pay for) implementing it.12 Notes 1.

The Navy has vacillated in its rationalization of carrier aviation. During the 1960s, when deterrence theory dominated the design of strategic forces and the Soviet's navy was not a sufficient threat to justify the carrier force, the Navy argued that the principal mission for carrier aviation was to project power over the land from the sea, including strategic (nuclear) strikes at the heart of the enemy. As the Soviets built up their "blue water" navy in the 1970s and 1980s, the principal rationale for carrier aviation returned to support of naval operations—protecting the fleet and striking naval targets. 4.
