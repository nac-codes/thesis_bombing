force. 11. This could come about through a variety of developments in the continuous contest between offense and defense over command of the air. The proliferation of "smart" surface-based air defenses, like the proliferation of small arms in some urban areas, could make an increasingly hostile environment for intrusion by "outsiders." The loss of pilots, particularly if they are captured and turned into hostages, may be increasingly unattractive to political leaderships, even if the risks are acceptable to the military professionals. Manned aircraft could also become cornered for combat operations if the evasion of increasingly agile defenses requires intruders to bear acceleration forces (i.e., g-loads) that go well beyond human endurance. None of these possibilities is certain; and the contest for command of the air could also tip in the favor of the offenseâ€”and the manned aircraft. But the situation is in flux, and the possibility of change needs to be considered since the consequences couJd be profound for the Air Force. 12.
