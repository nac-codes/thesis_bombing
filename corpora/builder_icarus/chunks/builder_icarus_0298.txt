er theory evolved as it did and was widely accepted by the Anglo-American publics because of a vivid perception of how the world worked and what the future might hold. World War I had painfully shown that: • the nation states and their interests could clash on a global scale; • nations could organize and bring to bear enormous industrial resources in their conflicts; • science and technology were providing new and wondrous means for transport and destruction in warfare; and • if allowed to stalemate, these conflicts could wipe out a generation of young men, terrorize the population, and devastate a nation's economy. This perception of the world and the potential future provided a fertile bed for the advocates of air power. If nations were, inevitably, going to clash 233  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 257 --- 234 The Icarus Syndrome and unleash their full resources in "total" war, then air power, one of the premier products of science and technology, could provide the means to a quicker, more decisive end (victory) in war. Air power was the key to unlock the deadly dilemma of the future. Not everything about that perception of the future was correct. Nations would clash again on a global scale and engage in total war; science and technology did continue to expand the means of transport and destruc­ tion, although not just through air power. But the nightmare of stalemates gave way to the fright of "blitzkrieg," lightning warfare, where mobility on land, sea, and air sometimes produced decisive campaigns in weeks or months. The slaughter of young men in battle was supplanted by the butchering of machinery more than men on the battlefield. And civil populations were more resistant than expected to terror from the skies, at least until the advent of the atomic bomb. As they were when air power theory first emerged, our perceptions of the future are still dominated by the past, by the role of the nation-states in war, by the experiences of World War II, the Cold
