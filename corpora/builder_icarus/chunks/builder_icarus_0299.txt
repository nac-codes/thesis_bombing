As they were when air power theory first emerged, our perceptions of the future are still dominated by the past, by the role of the nation-states in war, by the experiences of World War II, the Cold War, and, now, Operation Desert Storm. But, if air power theory is to be reformulated for the future, that formulation can be no better than the perception of the future on which it is based. To the extent that the original air power theorists were wrong in their perceptions of the future, their theory was at risk. Thus, the most important thing that air power theorists can do today is to try to get their perceptions of the future right. The perception of the future presented in this chapter and the next has no claim to stature over others. It is developed in some detail here, not in the certainty that it is right, but to complete the principal argument of this manuscript—that air power theory needs to be redefined. If the original air power theory was rooted in a perception of the nature of the world and the future of conflict, so too will its redefinition. If nothing else, this perception of the future is an illustration of the kind of intellectual foundations needed to formulate and analyze security concepts for the future.

The conventional wisdom is that the world is going through a period of enormous dramatic changes in many dimensions—political, economic,  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 258 --- A Changing World 235 social, and military. The momentous events which have taken place in the former communist bloc over the past several years have caused wide­ spread speculation about a "new world order." These events were especially striking because neither their magnitude nor speed were anticipated by any of the affected governments, east or west. Unfortunately, the enormity of those events is most often seen against the backgrounds of the Cold War (the past 40 years), the Worl
