were anticipated by any of the affected governments, east or west. Unfortunately, the enormity of those events is most often seen against the backgrounds of the Cold War (the past 40 years), the World Wars (75 years), and the Balance of Rower (some 250 years), mostly centered on Europe.3 One can detect those backgrounds as observers express various concerns about regional balances of power, about the balkanization of Europe in the breakups of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and about the rise of a new European economic giant. According to the expressions of these concerns, the future problems of the world are to be found in models drawn from some part of the past 250 years of European-centered political history. To assume, however, that the future of the world will remain rooted in the forces which have shaped Europe and, hence, the world over the past 250 years, while logical, is an important leap of faith. We may be at a break point in history not unlike that which occurred in Europe about 250 years ago—one where the dominant forces shift in their sources of power. In 1750, a projection of the future of Europe rooted in the previous 250 years would have understandably relied upon the histories of the monar­ chies which had dominated European events for centuries. It would, indeed, have required considerable prescience to perceive, then, the rise of nationalism and relative liberalism that would soon sweep Europe and dominate world developments for the next several centuries. These considerations suggest that the recent stunning events in Europe and elsewhere (e.g., China) need to be examined not just in the light of the models which have prevailed for the past 40, 75, or 250 years, but against the possibility that these events are signs of a shift in the dominant forces shaping our world. New models may be required, not so much because the old ones are dead wrong, but because they may no longer describe the most important factors shaping the future: Monarchies d
