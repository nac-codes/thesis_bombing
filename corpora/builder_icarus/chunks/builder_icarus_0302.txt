was a perception, a model, of how the world worked. The prevailing model of political developments—the one which has dominated Western thinking for nearly 250 years—derives from these premises: 1. The most powerful forces shaping the world are those in the hands of national governments. 2. Those forces are manifested mostly in the form of political power, underwritten by economic and military powers. 3. The political, economic, and military powers are largely vested in national governments and wielded (or expressed) through government policies. 4. The leaderships of national governments, as the designers and implementors of government policies, can significantly shape the forces exerted by nations and, hence, the future development of the world order. Those premises have endured for at least two centuries and would not be foreign to 19th or 20th century politicians. But they might have seemed  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 260 --- A Changing World 237 strange—even alarming—to those attending 16th and 17th century courts; and they may come to be seen as dated or anachronistic to 21st- century observers. The model that logically evolves from these premises places great weight on the qualities of national leaderships, their policies, and on the economic and military forces they control. This model says that good or bad leaders can have a profound effect upon the face of the world by the policies they adopt and by the way they employ the economic and military powers at their disposal. Alliances between nations can develop even more powerful forces for good or bad; and national leaderships have looked to them for ways to upset or to restore the balance of power. Since the future tenure or behavior of leaders cannot be assured, the military and economic powers under their control are important measures of future potentials. For at least two centuries, this model has probably been a reasonably reliable guide to the future of the West, if not always for the rest of
