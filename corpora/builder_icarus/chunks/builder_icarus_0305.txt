Bronowski observed that all revolutionary forms of power—the horse, writing, gunpowder, and nuclear energy—initially vest with elites, who are later threatened as that power inevitably escapes their control and  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 262 --- A Changing World 239 diffuses to individuals.4 The horse-drawn chariot conveyed power to early community elites who were subsequently threatened when the horse was saddled by the nomadic raider.

The power of information is now diffusing rapidly to individuals throughout the world, especially in the most highly developed parts of the world such as Europe, North America, and East Asia.
