Coupled with jet transport, space satellites, and the concomitant spread of English as a common language, the electronic information revolution has netted and shrunk the world to the proportion of a village community. One can go almost anywhere in that world, taking videocameras and satellite uplinks, in the matter of hours. As in a village, one can now observe many world events in real time. Exploding volumes of information are exchanged daily through electronic mail, facsimile machines, and computer databases—between individuals who may never have met and whose nationality and location are nearly arbitrary. Global markets are the consequence of abundant telecommunications, which together with computerized means for utilizing voluminous data, have facilitated managing global enterprises. That technology could accomplish such feats is no longer a great surprise to the publics of the developed world. Coming in an age of nuclear power and space travel, modern business and consumer electron­ ic gadgets and their capabilities seem no different from other technical marvels in medicine, travel, and warfare. But unlike most of the other technical wonders, the information gadgets are diffusing power more than they are concentrating it. While the most spectacular technological developments in space, weaponry, and medicine appear to have concen­ trated power, the information technologies during the last 15 years have been marked and measured by the conveyance of capabilities directly into the hands of individuals. Since the introduction of microprocessors in the 1970s, computer and communications technologies have moved rapidly away fro
