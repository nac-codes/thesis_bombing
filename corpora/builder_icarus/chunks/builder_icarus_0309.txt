d by the conveyance of capabilities directly into the hands of individuals. Since the introduction of microprocessors in the 1970s, computer and communications technologies have moved rapidly away from central­ ized facilities and toward the broad distribution of information and computational power. The economic payoff of distributing computation and information resources is an enhancement of the creative productivity of the individuals given access. This economic benefit is proportional to the degree of distribution; cautious adopters of the technology can expect proportionately limited gains. But once the power of information is given to individuals, they will use it to serve their own ends, with little opportunity for effective control by authorities. Because the information technologies are increasingly required for competitiveness in nearly all human activities, the transfer of power to  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 265 --- 242 The Icarus Syndrome individuals, even if unintended, is unavoidable. That transfer is having an effect on all aspects of human affairs: cultural, social, political, military, and economic. Perhaps the development having the greatest impact upon the affairs of nations is the practical networking of individ­ uals through telecommunications. Print and broadcast media have tradi­ tionally allowed a privileged few to communicate to the many. These media have concentrated power in the hands of those who control the printing press or the television station. In contrast, electronic networking of the office, the nation, and then the globe, has for the first time permitted many to freely communicate with many—for almost any individual to be both a broadcaster and a selective receiver. The individual is no longer limited to a single source for information, and can now communicate information to as many as may have interest in that information. Although power elites may control the newspapers and television stations, personal computers and
