But information technology introduced to improve economic perforÂ­ mance ends up being utilized for other purposes. Regimes which once limited access to typewriters and photocopiers must now confront the challenges of computer terminals, printers, and networks. Attempts to limit the availability or use of such devices can only reduce the economic gains which motivate introducing them in the first place. Furthermore, to deny free communications is to be excluded from participation in a global economy that is growing much more rapidly than that of any closed national economy. To accept free communications is to grant the power of information to individuals who are then empowered to challenge the hierarchies which have been built on, and maintained by, the denial and control of information.
