By the 1970s, some had begun to argue that there was no significant military utility to nuclear weapons when confronting a comparably armed oppo­ nent. Any marginal tactical utility was simply swamped by the enormous shadow of the end-game which is inherent in their possession and largely divorced from policy, strategy, weapon numbers, or technical virtuosity.7 When all the arcane technical details of nuclear arms control, deterrence, and strategy were stripped away, nuclear weapons, by their inherent destructive capacity in modern societies, became political instruments of terror, not military instruments of war: ...nuclear weapons serve no military purpose whatsoever. They are totally useless—except to deter one's opponent from using them.8 While that statement flatly denies any military utility for nuclear weapons, it does not assure us about their adequacy for the political purpose of deterring an opponent from using them, because achieving that purpose also rests upon the respective vulnerabilities to nuclear weapons. An opponent cannot be deterred by the threat of nuclear weapons if that opponent has no definable society to threaten. This is the terrifying asymmetry that now yawns ahead: Some who will come to possess nuclear weapons will not be comparably vulnerable to their use. That possibility first surfaced with concerns about civil defense in the Soviet Union, then with primitive societies in Asia and Africa, and now, most ominously, with radical factions distributed throughout several societies. As political instruments for terror against modern societies, nuclear weapons will come to be most effective in the hands of political terrorists  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 275 --- 252 The Icarus Syndrome who do not have a modern society at
