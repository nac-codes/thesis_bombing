power of nation- states. One consequence, but by no means the most important, will be a wider distribution of nuclear weapons in the world, not only among the nation- states, but even to factions and, eventually, to individuals. Although this will result in a larger number of nations seeking to possess nuclear weapons for deterrence, it will also result in some—particularly fac­ tions—possessing nuclear weapons to coerce (terrorize) others, includ­ ing the nuclear-armed nations who are likely to be much more vulnerable to the effects of nuclear weapons. Thus, while the numbers who seek to acquire nuclear capabilities for deterrence will increase, the number who seek them for coercive purposes may increase even faster and become a much more preoccupying concern for the nation-states.

Although nuclear weapons will remain the premier means for nation-states to deter one another, they will not be an effective deterrent to a faction which presents no target for nuclear weapons. If such factions possess nuclear weapons, even in very small numbers, then they may be able, not only to terrorize nation-states, but to deter them as well. Indeed, nuclear weapons in the information era may become the bane rather than the power symbols of the nation-states. At that point, nuclear weapons will finally be recognized, even by the nation-states for what they have always been since the moment of their creation at the zenith of the technology era—political instruments of terror. Their initial use against Hiroshima and Nagasaki may have been justified, at the time, in military terms; but th
