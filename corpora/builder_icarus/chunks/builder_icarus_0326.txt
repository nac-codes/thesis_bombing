flect a fundamental revolution in the global conduct of human affairs as a result of the shrinking, crowding, and netting of the world because of the explosive changes in the information and transportation technol­ ogies. The global mobility of information, commerce, and people has created worldwide markets and communities and is generating new cultural and environmental stresses, and, more importantly, will be changing the nature of conflict. For the developed nations, both the traditional means and ends of international warfare are becoming increasingly impertinent to their political, economic, and social interests. First, the available technical means for destruction (i.e., nuclear weapons) now overwhelm any reasonable ends for the developed nations. Second, the traditional ends of aggressive warfare—national control over territory, natural resources, industry, or people—have become less important in a world where economic power is increasingly derived from the innovation of free peoples with free access to the world markets in commerce and informa­ tion. Thus, the probabilities for international conflict between the most developed nations will decline, even as the frequency and scope of factional conflicts will increase throughout the world, especially (but not exclusively) in the least developed regions. The crowding of peoples and cultures in the world is both actual and virtual. The actual crowding, due to population growth, while substan­ tial, may be less than the virtual crowding now being brought about by the explosive increases in the mobility of information and people associated with the technological revolutions in microelectronics, space, and jet transportation. The shrinking, netting, and, hence, virtual crowd­ ing of the world are exposing long-standing disparities between cultures, bringing long-separated or isolated cultures into collision, and providing a worldwide stage for their conflicts. These conflicts are increasingly about egregious dispar
