disparities between cultures, bringing long-separated or isolated cultures into collision, and providing a worldwide stage for their conflicts. These conflicts are increasingly about egregious disparities in political and economic power and about preserving deep differences in racial, ethnic, and religious practices.

They may involve the interests or concerns of factions in other nations, forcing their political leaderships into taking sides when they would just as soon stay out and avoid widening the conflict. Such conflicts may not be resolvable by the application of any reasonable amount of force; and the intercession of the developed nations will often be predicated on ways that do not make them parties to the conflict. The need for the developed nations to retain traditional military forces for nuclear deterrence, strategic, tactical, and combat support missions will not disappear; but the size of the active forces retained for those missions will almost certainly decrease as the prospects for large-scale, regular international wars requiring those forces recede. At the same time, the conflicts and missions involving the rapid projection of infrastructures (transport, communications, surveillance, rescue, medi­ cal, humanitarian assistance, civil emergency and security) are likely to increase disproportionately. Evidence of that can be seen in the three largest theater or tactical airl
