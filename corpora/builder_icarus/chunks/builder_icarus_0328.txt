Evidence of that can be seen in the three largest theater or tactical airlifts conducted during 1991, one of them being an integral part of Operation Desert Storm. As shown in the accompanying table, two USAF humanitarian and relief operations in 1991 were comparable, by any measure, to the tactical airlift required to support the "left hook" of Desert Storm.9 Three Theater Airlifts During 1991 Airlift Operation Sorties Passengers Cargo (tons) "Left Hook" 1,175 13,843 9,395 in DESERT STORM Kurdish relief 1,100 14,421 40,000 in PROVIDE COMFORT Mt.

Security infrastruc­ tures will include the enforcement of civil order, such as imposing curfews, separating adversaries, and deterring the casual resort to force by the presence of obviously superior force. While the existing Air Force capabilities for projecting infrastructures are significant and will be increasingly exploited in the future, the eventual demands for these capabilities may call for changes in Air Force structure, organization, equipment, and training. However, as the Air Force is compelled in the near future to reduce its force structure under the pressure of budget reductions, there will be a strong tendency to preserve those forces which have dominated the mission spectrum in the past rather than those which might dominate in the future. To be explicit, there will be a nat
