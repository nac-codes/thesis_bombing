The constants or boundaries of that mission are rooted in history and law: It must be consistent with the heritages of the Air Force, the American military services, and the American institutions.

Similarly, it would be inconsistent with the heritage of the American military services for the Air Force mission to be defined apart from service to the nation as that service may be defined by duly constituted civilian authorities. The trick is to define the mission broadly enough to captu
