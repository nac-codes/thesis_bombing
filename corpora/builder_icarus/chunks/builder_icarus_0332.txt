the Air Force mission to be defined apart from service to the nation as that service may be defined by duly constituted civilian authorities. The trick is to define the mission broadly enough to capture the scope of the institution's greatest aspirations without losing the focus and reality essential for incisiveness and credibility. If the mission of the Air Force is to remain centered on air power, then air power must somehow be defined as more than force, airplanes or pilots: • Air power must be more than force because the problems of the world must increasingly be addressed by the military with more than force. Many of the crises and conflicts in our shrinking world are no longer highly susceptible to resolution through the projection of force, but—as in protection of the Kurds in the wake of Operation Desert Storm—will require the projection of infrastructures such as security, medical care, communications, and transportation. • Air power must be more than airplanes because the power to be projected through the third dimension is also increasingly derived from critical space and ground support systems. • Air power must be more than pilots because the power to be projected through the third dimension can often be more effectively derived from self-guided missiles, remotely-piloted vehicles, and unmanned platforms. • Air power must be defined as more than combat, since the nature of conflict is changing worldwide. Regular warfare between nations is  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 286 --- Mission Desiderata 263 becoming less attractive, while irregular warfare between factions— ignoring national boundaries—is becoming more so. Indeed, the precise destructiveness of modern weapons supported by modern infrastructures—as demonstrated in Operation Desert Storm— may accelerate the shift from regular to irregular warfare. If grievances cannot be resolved by resorting to conventional military force, frustrated causes will be resolved through other, less convention
