accelerate the shift from regular to irregular warfare. If grievances cannot be resolved by resorting to conventional military force, frustrated causes will be resolved through other, less conventional means. Dealing with conflict may increasingly require Air Force provision of infrastruc­ tures to friends or allies to help them deal with unrest, riot, insurrection, insurgencies, terrorism, and subversion. Lieutenant General Charles Boyd, commander of the Air University, has described this broader conception of air power with these words: .. .1 use the term air power in its most comprehensive sense of air and space power. Such inclusive air power values every role and mission, as well as all the support, services, and—most importantly—all the people the Air Force needs to be a fully capable service.4 If air power is what the Air Force is about, then air power must be defined inclusively—to include every person in the Air Force and every one of their diverse contributions to air power. If air power is a spear, then the point of that spear is the strike systems which deliver the "fire and steel" (i.e., the bombs, missiles, and gunfire); and the shaft of the spear is all those support systems (i.e., the surveil­ lance, communications, navigation, jamming, refueling, logistics, trans­ port, medical, weather, security, etc.). The point of the spear is getting sharper, better aimed, and more deadly every day because of technology; but the shaft is getting longer and more important as well. With every passing year, with every advance in technology, the point of the spear gets smaller, while the shaft of the spear gets bigger. Significantly, it is not the point of the spear that has become the measure of global reach and global power, but the shaft that carries the point. The long-term trend in the balance between spear point and shaft is obvious; and the shift is not limited to the Air Force: When the principal form of firepower was musketry, and soldiers could live off t
