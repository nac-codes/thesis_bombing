nature of the land wars that were fought there; air power limited the enemy's means and therefore the pace of those conflicts. In Operation Desert Storm, air power dominated the entire conflict and defined the ground war on very favorable military terms; but it may not have been possible to make air power independently decisive in that war on terms acceptable to the American or world's publics—to be independently decisive, air power might have had to be more destructive than the war's audience would tolerate for the goals at hand. Candidate Mission Statements How might the early advocates and practitioners of air power have defined the mission of the Air Force? Douhet, Mitchell, or Arnold might have put it this way: The mission of air power and, hence, the Air Force is to strike decisively at the heart of the enemy through the third dimension. With hindsight 60 years later, it can be argued that this statement neglects the other important uses of air power besides striking the enemy, other places and things to strike besides the heart of the enemy, and other important outcomes beside decisiveness in war. This statement may have been the right one in the 1930s when airmen were struggling for recognition and independence, but not the 1990s. It is too narrow for what the Air Force has become and for what 60 years of air power history have revealed. During the apogee of air power theory in the 1950s, the Strategic Air Command (SAC), as the centerpiece of the Air Force, adopted the slogan, "Peace is our profession." It was a way of saying that SAC considered its mission to be successful if its terrible instruments of destruction did not have to be employed—if it kept the peace. It was a means for addressing  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 289 --- 266 The Icarus Syndrome the dilemma for SAC and its people that for the first time in the air power history, its full employment against an enemy signified the nation's worst nightmare.
