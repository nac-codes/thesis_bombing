Merrill McPeak was interrogated by the press on the implications of the Air Force reorganization for the career prospects of non-rated (non-pilot) officers, he noted that: The Air Force does not exist for any other purpose except to defend the United States.8  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 290 --- Mission Desiderata 267 From the context and negative structure of his observation, it is clear that General McPeak was not providing a mission statement for the Air Force.
