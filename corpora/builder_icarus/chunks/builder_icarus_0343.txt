in a world where weapons are proliferating and becoming more sophisticated. Thus, the prospects for U.S. military forces to be employed in a lethal environment is high, but the time and place are highly uncertain. U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY The U.S. security objectives, the instruments to support them, and the elements of our defense strategy remain unchanged.

Quality Forces: Quality forces, particularly quality people, are our first priority. Advanced technology rather than large forces has been the hallmark of American military forces; we will continue to exploit technology to maintain our decisive advantage, reduce our casualties, and avoid being surprised.

The focus on a European conflict during the past 40 years may have obscured how the Air Force contributes across the spectrum of conflict. Across the spectrum of conflict, from wartime to peacetime, the Air Force works independently and in concert with the other se
