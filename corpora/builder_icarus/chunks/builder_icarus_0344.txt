e obscured how the Air Force contributes across the spectrum of conflict. Across the spectrum of conflict, from wartime to peacetime, the Air Force works independently and in concert with the other services, allied forces, and security partners. The strengths of the Air Force are its inherent speed, range, flexibility, precision, and lethality, which will be drawn upon and exploited to support the following objectives as a planning framework: • sustain deterrence, • provide versatile combat force, • supply rapid global mobility, • control the high ground, and • build U.S. influence. SUSTAIN DETERRENCE—NUCLEAR FORCES Although strategic nuclear forces will be limited in size by treaty, the Soviets are vigorously modernizing theirs, so we must continue to develop and deploy forces that can sustain our confidence in deterrence into the future. A balanced and modernized triad of strategic nuclear forces is fundamental to effective deterrence because of the unique and complementary character of each leg. A fundamental goal is stability against first strike; therefore, we are modernizing our bomber force, reducing the warhead densities for our fixed base missiles, and pursuing strategic defenses. Theater nuclear forces extend nuclear deterrence and provide for flexible response and air launched capabilities. PROVIDE VERSATILE COMBAT FORCE Our objectives in the conventional conflict arena will increasingly require that our forces be fast, flexible, and powerful so that we can deal with regional conflicts effectively. Although the threat of a major European conflict with the Warsaw Pact is diminished, the instabilities in Europe could produce other kinds of conflicts which will argue for our continued involvement in the European security framework.
