ay be the only means for projecting power or enhancing presence quickly in many places on the globe. Forward-based tactical air forces are also capable of providing a day-to-day presence and projecting power anywhere in the world on short notice. Although land-based tactical fighters require forward bases to sustain power projection, such bases have historically been made available by our allies in crises. The rapid response capabilities of the Air Force also enable other forces to respond quickly, as in the movement of airborne troops, contributing to their success and reducing casualties. Complementary Air Force and Naval Operations: The Navy and Air Force can complement each other in establishing presence and projecting power—with respect to relative advantages in responsiveness and endurance or in the provision of air defense capabilities. They can also complement each other in providing defense suppression, air superiority, and offensive strike capabilities. Land-based air provides unique capabilities in maritime operations in the form of long range surveillance and mine delivery. History has shown that land-based air has a significant potential to contribute to sea control. Special Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict: The Air Force is committed to supporting special operations and providing certain specialized assets; many Air Force conventional capabilities are essential to special operations and low-  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 296 --- From Mission to Vision 273 intensity conflict. The Air Force is committed to supporting the anti-drug effort with a variety of assets and capabilities. SUPPLY RAPID GLOBAL MOBILITY—AIRLIFT AND TANKERS As forward-based forces decline but global interests remain, the importance of airlift will grow. Airlift and sealift are complementary, not competitive. When operations must be carried out quickly, airlift will be the key player, as exemplified by OPERATION JUST CAUSE. The importance of timeliness is illustrated by the
