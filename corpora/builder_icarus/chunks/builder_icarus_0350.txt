and routine global reach—not just through the aerial refueling of bombers, fighters, and airlifters, but also through the reach of intercontinental ballistic missiles and global nets of spacecraft. And the desire to apply such power anywhere on the globe, if not simulta­ neously globally, seems to be independent of the uncertainties about the changing world and the nation's interests. The Quest for an Air Force Vision Just as a theory can be the basis for a mission; a mission can be the basis for a vision. The original institutional vision of the Air Force—evolving from air power theory and the mission of forging air power according to that theory—was that an intrepid band of aviators could control the decisive weapons of war—the airplane and the atomic bomb—in a force that would eclipse all other military forces, in importance, size, funding, and esteem. That vision fractured with the advent of alternative means (missile and space systems) to provide decisive weapons of war and with the realization that the atomic bomb was not, after all, a politically usable weapon short of Armageddon. Recognizing the importance of a vision to the institutional health of the Air Force, its Chief of Staff, General Merrill McPeak, addressed the subject at a meeting of the Air Force's senior leadership (i.e., the "CORONA" conference) in November 1991. General McPeak defined a vision as "a compelling image of the future.. .advanced by leaders," who share it with the community they expect to support it, with the purpose of determining direction. Such a vision, he argued, should answer three questions:  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 299 --- 276 The Icarus Syndrome 1. What is the purpose and meaning of our efforts? 2.

General McPeak argued that "It is not enough to have a vision. You must intend to carry it through. In
