Intention involves having the stomach to bring a vision into reality. Intention is a sheer act of will." He then proposed the following statement for an Air Force vision: Air Force people building the world's most respected air and space force.. .global power and reach for America.7 Secretary of the Air Force, Donald B.

The unique sense of identity and shared sense of purpose are both to be found in the same phrase, "people building the world's most respected air and space force."
