best, then beat it and define it anew. If we are to stay the best, we must keep striving for new ways of becoming the best, most respected Air Force. We must continually improve and innovate because we know potential adversaries are doing the same thing." In the above quote, if one replaced the words, "Air Force," with "computer company," it would sound even more appropriate as an exhortation to the company's employees. This sounds like a fill-in-the- blank business manager's speech, not one from the leader of a military institution to military professionals. The call is to be better, do better, at what we already are and have done. This is a call for workers to do the best possible job against the competition, not a call for an altruistic devotion or commitment to the profession of arms which transcends the institution. This is a businessman's vision of the Air Force. The deeper problem with the vision advanced by Secretary Rice and General McPeak is that it focuses on internal purposes more than external or altruistic purposes. Being the world's most respected air and space force may serve the ambitions of the Air Force more than the American public which must support it. Contrast that ambition with the one offered by the original air power theory—to strike decisively at the enemy through the third dimension—thereby avoiding the public's nightmare of a bloody, stalemated ground war. That was a noble purpose which might justify risking an airman's life—the ultimate sacrifice of the profession of arms. Should we, would we, ask Air Force people to risk their lives to build "the world's most respected air and space force.. .global power and reach for America"? Possessing global power and reach, while appealing to the Air Force, may or may not always be what America wants most from its Air Force or wants to pay for. There may be times when the American public will want to be protected or to protect a nearby friend much more than it wants the global power or reach alre
