singly, in the future; but, interpreted broadly, General McPeak's statement can be helpful to the profession of arms within the Air Force and, hence, to the institution.) A Proposed Vision Would my mission statement—the military control and exploitation of the aerospace continuum in support of the national interests—provide a  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 309 --- 286 The Icarus Syndrome better basis for an Air Force vision? The essential elements of a vision for a high-performing organization—i.e., a unique sense of identity and a shared sense of purpose—can both be found within this mission statement: • As to the sense of unique identity as an institution, the Air Force is the only American military institution exclusively devoted to military operations in the aerospace continuum. The other military services may indeed conduct operations in the air environment while pursuing their surface-oriented missions, but only the Air Force is devoted to controlling and exploiting the aerospace continuum for the nation's interests— where those interests can best or only be pursued through the aerospace continuum. • As to the sense of shared purpose within the institution, the purpose of the Air Force is to provide the nation with an unsurpassed spectrum and quality of capabilities it may need to pursue its interests through the military control and exploitation of the aerospace continuum. It is as this point that the Air Force's white paper, Global Power- Global Reach, could contribute to the vision by describing the spectrum and quality of Air Force capabilities. To be complete, however, it should also include some statement of mission or purpose. Military control and exploitation of the aerospace continuum in support of the national interests is not the same as "global power and reach for America." Global power and reach may or may not be necessary to control or exploit the aerospace continuum in support of the nation's interests, depending on what the nation's int
