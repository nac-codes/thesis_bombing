power and reach for America." Global power and reach may or may not be necessary to control or exploit the aerospace continuum in support of the nation's interests, depending on what the nation's interests may be at any point in the future. Some of the nation's interests may require only local power and reach in controlling and exploiting the aerospace continuum. My formulation of the Air Force mission: • allows that the nation's interests may vary over time and region; • ties the Air Force to any degree of control and exploitation of the aerospace environment demanded by its supporters, the American public; and • does not limit the nation's interest in the Air Force to its abilities to exercise global power or reach, neither of which are fundamental to why nations all around the world have air forces. Nations have air forces because they enable those nations to do something they could not do with  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 310 --- A Theory to Fly By 287 any other kind of force—control and exploit their air (if not aerospace) environments to the ends of their governments. This reasoning leads me to a vision statement something like the following: The Air Force is America's only military service exclusively devoted to military operations in the aerospace environment and is, therefore, dedicated to providing unsurpassed capabilities for the nation to pursue its interests through the military control and exploitation of the aerospace continuum. This leaves the question of "Why?" Why should anyone care whether or not the "Air Force is America's only military service exclusively devoted to military operations in the aerospace environment"? Why should anyone care about dedicating themselves "to providing unsurpassed capabilities for the nation to pursue its interests through the military control and exploitation of the aerospace continuum"? It is at this point that theory pays off. Suppose one were to have asked the early air power theorists why anyone should
