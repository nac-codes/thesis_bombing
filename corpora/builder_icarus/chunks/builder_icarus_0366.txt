its vision. A Theory to Fly By If the mission of the Air Force is the military control and exploitation of the aerospace continuum to support the nation's interest, then an air force would seem to need, among several other things, global reach as a means for applying global power to national ends. But it might need much more than that; and the relative importance of "speed, range, flexibility, precision, and lethality" (or other, less frequently cited attributes such as presence, visibility, resolution, capacity, etc.) may vary considerably as world events unfold. The future may or may not unfold as implied by Global Reach— Global Power: a world which changes more than our nation, but still a world dominated by the nation-states in the model of the past two centuries. Even if that were the most probable future, it will probably not be the future. Where there are many possible futures, the most probable future is less likely than the advent of any one of its many alternatives.10 The alternatives include changes in the interests of the American society and nation and in the nature of the world order or disorder now evolving, but not contemplated in Global Reach^-Global Power. The possibilities of great changes in the interests of the American society, in the political structure of the world, in the nation-state as the locus of power in the world, and in the degrees of chaos or order in the world seem too high to ignore in redefining air power at this time. Air power needs to be redefined independently of these uncertainties. It needs to be a truth about the nature of power in the world that transcends the directions of the American society, its nation-state, and the future order of the world. It ought to be a form of power whose attributes become only more valuable as the world becomes more uncertain. Air power should be the most attractive instrument for dealing with a world that could spin off in almost any direction—one that is more orderly or more chaotic, one in
