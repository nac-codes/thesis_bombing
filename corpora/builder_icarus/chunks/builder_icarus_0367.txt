e world becomes more uncertain. Air power should be the most attractive instrument for dealing with a world that could spin off in almost any direction—one that is more orderly or more chaotic, one in which power blocs form or dissolve, one in which wars are more or less likely, and even ones in which the American society's interests are more truculent or pacific than in the past.  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 312 --- A Theory to Fly By 289 If air power were to be redefined on a single perspective of the future, then a wager has been made. If the perspective turns out to have been prescient, then the wager could have a high payoff. History offers many examples of leaders who perceived the future correctly and made their wagers. Those who saw the future incorrectly have largely been lost to history, and their failures relegated to the dustbins of history instead of its pedestals. Air Force leadership, in redefining air power, must adopt a perception of the future. The more narrow and specific that perception, the greater the risks of failure, but the greater the payoffs if they get it right. Hap Arnold was one who got it right for the 40-year Cold War that followed his leadership of the Air Force. My views of the future and its uncertainty have been presented in Chapters 20 and 21. Two aspects of that future stand out for me as realities rooted in the present: Commerce has gone global and nations have lost control of their borders. I would be willing to bet on those aspects—much more than the constancy of American security interests—in redefining air power. I believe that those two aspects will dominate the shape of the future, making a much more disorderly, chaotic world which the United States can neither completely control nor completely avoid. Such worlds, even if not attractive to national leaderships or accepted by them, are likely to make air power the military instrument of choice for those who retain and exercise military power. In a chaotic world,
