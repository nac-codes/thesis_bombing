ven if not attractive to national leaderships or accepted by them, are likely to make air power the military instrument of choice for those who retain and exercise military power. In a chaotic world, the aerospace continuum will offer power elites three unique attributes not available through any other military force: universal access, vantage point, and speed to bring military power—both force and infrastruc­ tures—to bear upon situations and adversaries, both of which may know no borders. This kind of access, vantage point, and speed can not be afforded through either the land or sea media. Controlling and exploiting the aerospace continuum will become the most omnipresent and omnip­ otent means for the exercise of power for peace or war where the imposition of neither is any longer certain. It seems to me that a theory of air power should not rest upon the fate of the nation-state, the preferences of national leaderships, or the attrac­ tiveness of the future to the American (or any other) society.11 To let it so rest would be to mortgage the theory to wishes. It should rest upon the broad outlines of what is evidently happening to the world and what air power will bring to that world in the ways that military power can be wielded in the interests of those who possess it. That theory should appeal  File: --- builder_icarus.pdf --- Page 313 --- 290 The Icarus Syndrome to those who have the resources and courage to convert it into practice— quite irrespective of history or heritage. Thus, my candidate for a theory of air power goes something like this: In the emerging, less controllable world of global commerce and borderless nations, the military medium of dominance and, hence, of choice to power elites will be the aerospace continuum because of its universal, rapid access and unique vantage point. Hence, the control and exploitation of that medium, more than any other, will offer the widest range of military options and the highest degree of military power. Will
