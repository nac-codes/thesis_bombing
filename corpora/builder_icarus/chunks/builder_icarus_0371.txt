The military is constrained by international laws, such as the laws of armed conflict, even though civilian legislators may not be so obligated. See Carl H. Builder and Morlie H. Graubard, The International Law of Armed Conflict: Implications for the Concept of Assured Destruction, RAND R-2804-FF (Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND, January 1982), 45-53. 9. McPeak, Does the Air Force Have a Mission? 9. 10.1 am indebted to my colleague, Jim Dewar, for this observation from his research on futures forecasting for the U.S. Army. The truth of his observation can be seen from the following analog: In the card game of Blackjack, the most probable count of a dealt card is ten (the value of all face cards and the ten-cards). Yet, one is more likely to be dealt something other than a card with value ten because the other cards are more numerous. Thus, the highest probability event (being dealt a card with a value of ten) is not necessarily the most probable outcome (which is being dealt a card with a value other than ten). 11. The original conception of air power theory did not rest on any such limited purviews. It was a universal theory, available for exploitation by any nation or society or government with the foresight and courage to seize upon it. It was an emerging truth about how the world and war would soon work.
