It increased from 1,023 in April 1944 to 1,513 in December and to 1,609 in April 1945. Corresponding with this quantitative expansion there was also a great qualitative improvement. The daily average of operational Lancasters available in the squadrons was 614 in April 1944, 927 in December and 1,087 in April 1945. Stirlings were increasingly, and, in September 1944, completely, withdrawn from bombing operations and by the end of August 1944 the whole of 4 Group had been re- equipped with Mark III Halifaxes which were greatly superior to the earlier versions of that aircraft. In October 1944 the daily average available bomber strength of the front line was composed of 877 Lan- casters, 471 Halifaxes and 120 Mosquitoes.1 Bomber Command, however, was only one of the three allied forces concerned in the strategic air offensive. The United States Eighth Air Force, in terms of aircraft, though not of bomblift, had an even greater strength than Bomber Command. In April 1944 it had a daily average of 1,049 bombers available with crews for operations. In December this average had increased to 1,826 and in April 1945 it was 2,018. In addition, there was the United States Fifteenth Air Force which continued to operate from Italian bases. The available strength of the three forces together amounted in July 1944 to no less than 5,246 bombers. More than five thousand of these were four- engined Lancasters, Halifaxes, Fortresses and Liberators. Fewer than forty were Stirlings and the rest were Mosquitoes.2 Thus, even by the measur
