From the middle of 1944 onwards, it also involved the question of whether area attacks on towns or precision attacks upon specific targets should be made, for by that time Bomber Command had the operational capacity to undertake both tasks not only in darkness but in daylight as well. The competing claims of these alternatives bedevilled the course of the final offensive, but before that the issue of the diversion in con- nection with Overlord had to be settled. Pointblank had, of course, been designed as a strategic air preparation for Overlord. It was intended to produce air superiority, a disruption of German military and in- dustrial production and a decline in German morale, all of which were regarded as indispensable prerequisites to the successful military invasion of the Continent. But these were also the normal objects of the strategic air offensive and for that reason, though it was always related to Overlord, Pointblank had not been much affected by the relationship. In the early months of 1944, however, this situation began to change drastically. It then became apparent that those who were planning Overlord were expecting a massive air campaign of direct air preparation and subsequently of direct air support for the armies. These demands were on such a scale and embraced such a number and variety of targets that they could not be met by the tactical air forces alone. In fact, they called for the virtual cessation of Pointblank so that they could be fulfilled by the strategic air forces. Thus, Over- lord came into conflict with Pointblank, and
