an undoubted triumph. It was not simply that an unprecedentedly large number of bombers were available. It was due also to a complete change in the opera- tional conditions of the offensive. The factors in this change were highly complicated, and, as is shown in section 1 of Chapter XIII, they were also interconnected. Among the most important were the achievement of command of the air first in daylight and eventually in darkness as well, the development of new bombing techniques together with the provision of new and more powerful bombs, and the shortening of penetrations into enemy-defended territory which followed from the advance of General Eisenhower's armies. The effect of these and other developments upon the capacity of Bomber 7 Command was fully reflected in the great variety of operations which were carried out. Among the more notable achievements were the wholesale devastation of many oil plants, the destruction of the Ger- man battleship Tirpitz, the breaching of the Bielefeld viaduct, the draining of the Dortmund-Ems Canal and, in addition, the vast devastation of many great cities in Germany. These operations provide part of the verdict upon the strategic dispute between Sir Charles Portal and Sir Arthur Harris, for the dispute was, to some extent, based upon varying estimates of what Bomber Command could and could not do. The operational triumphs of the final offensive showed that the force had, indeed, attained a greater and, in particular, a more precise operational capacity than Sir Arthur Harris often tended to suppose. But the strategic argu- ment between the latter and Sir Charles Portal also, and to a greater extent, turned upon their different interpretations of the economic intelligence available and their different estimates of the effects which would be produced by the alternative bombing policies. Any estimate of these different points of view must depend on an assessment of the intelligence available to those that held them and the actua
