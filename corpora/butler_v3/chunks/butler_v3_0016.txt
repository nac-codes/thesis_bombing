production and alloca- tion. Moreover, the execution of those preparations, in the shape of the plan for Overlord, had rendered the materialisation of the Rankin situation unnecessary, while the condition of Germany at the begin- ning of 1944 finally banished any immediate hopes of its occurrence. Overlord, Sir Arthur Harris said in a memorandum of January 1944, 'must now presumably be regarded as an inescapable commitment'.1 Whether the aim of the strategic air offensive was taken to be the collapse of Germany which might be exploited by the Rankin occupa- tion plan, or, somewhat less ambitiously, only her wearing down which might be exploited by the Overlord fighting plan had not, how- ever, been an issue which exerted a significant influence upon the bombing policy of Pointblank until the launching of Overlord became imminent. The debates which Pointblank had inspired in 1942 and 1943, and particularly those which had immediately preceded the Casablanca Conference, had pointed to distinctions, which, as far as the selection of targets at those times was concerned, made little difference. The great disputes of 1943 about the merits of general area bombing, selective area bombing and precision selective bomb- ing did not primarily turn upon ultimate objects but upon assess- ments of strategic effectiveness and, above all, of operational capaci- ties. The approach either of Overlord or of Rankin had little immediate bearing upon these problems because it was difficult to discern the difference made to bombing policy by the pursuit of either aim. Even the increasing emphasis accorded to the attack on the Luft- waffe, which, after the middle of 1943, became a preoccupation, arose as much from the immediate needs of Pointblank itself as from the ultimate requirements of Overlord. Nevertheless, the approach of Overlord undoubtedly was a factor in bringing about an awareness of the need for air superiority and, therefore, in giving rise to the plan of attack on the Luftw
