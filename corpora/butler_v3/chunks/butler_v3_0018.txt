Battle of the Ruhr. The connection of the Dams raid with the land battle in Normandy more than a year later was more obscure and arose only from the strategic association of Pointblank and Overlord. Thus, while Pointblank was always a factor in the prospects of Over- lord, even to the possible extent of making the latter operation un- necessary, Overlord was not a significant factor in the conduct of Pointblank until the launching of the invasion became imminent. For that reason and until that time, it had been possible to regard Point- blank as an independent and strategic air offensive related to, but not ruled by, Overlord. The problem of the most effective manner in which the heavy bombers could afford 'all possible support' to the allied armies when they ultimately did invade the Continent, therefore, could be, and actually was, left for future solution. But when, in the early months of 1944, it became evident that the surface invasion was not only inevitable, but also imminent, and that it was certain to in- volve a stiff and, perhaps, a prolonged struggle between large opposing armies this problem had to be faced and solved. The issue was brought to a head in a somewhat haphazard manner by what were regarded by those planning the operation as the indis- pensable air requirements of Overlord. It involved Bomber Command and the United States Strategic Air Forces, because these require- ments greatly exceeded what could be fulfilled by the tactical air  THE STRATEGY OF VICTORY 14 BASES OF VICTORY AND DISSENSION forces specifically allocated to the service of the invasion in its prepara- tion, execution and development. It raised a major clash between Pointblank and Overlord because the bombing policy postulated was primarily, if only temporarily, more of a tactical rather than a stra- tegic nature and the targets indicated were mostly in France and not in Germany. It also produced a crisis in the higher command of the air forces because agreement could not be re
