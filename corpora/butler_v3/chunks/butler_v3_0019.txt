rather than a stra- tegic nature and the targets indicated were mostly in France and not in Germany. It also produced a crisis in the higher command of the air forces because agreement could not be reached by the Com- manders of the tactical and strategic elements. The sense in which these various problems were eventually ad- justed was of fundamental and lasting importance to the strategic air forces, which at this time were approaching the summit of their strength in numbers and of their effectiveness in striking power. This was not simply a question of another diversion like those which had occurred in the Battle of France, the Battle of the Atlantic and on other occasions, though that was involved at various stages and to a varying extent. It was not only a question of aims and methods such as that which had arisen between the British and American Air Staffs and latterly between the Air Staff and Bomber Command, though that also was involved. The arrangements made to ensure the success of Overlord and to maintain the subsequent land battle and the system of command by which they were executed transcended the earlier controversies of bombing strategy as well as embracing many of them. They marked a transition for the heavy bombers from an offensive which, though it had been preparatory, had also been primarily independent and strategic, to one in which their role was as an ele- ment in what the barbarous jargon of the time described as 'tri- phibious' war. Henceforth, the distinctions between 'independent' and 'auxiliary' and between 'strategic' and 'tactical' bombing became more and more confused. The wars in the air, on land and at sea became related to an extent which had been so only in theory at earlier stages and, in the process, the effectiveness of each arm gained immeasurable but undoubted strength. It must not, however, be supposed that this transition was easily achieved or, indeed, that it was ever completely accomplished. A combination of functional
