ained immeasurable but undoubted strength. It must not, however, be supposed that this transition was easily achieved or, indeed, that it was ever completely accomplished. A combination of functional traditions and operational inflexibilities made that impossible and the solutions reached in the spring of 1944 were neither perfect nor final. As it was, they only emerged from a vigorous, and at least partially unresolved, debate between the prin- cipal protagonists, about the most effective means by which the heavy bombers could afford support to the allied armies when they went ashore, and, as proved to be more important and more con- troversial, how they should be employed in the last few months before the landings were attempted. This debate, as has been mentioned, arose from the tactical air requirements of Overlord. The formulation of these requirements had a somewhat curious 15 history to which reference must now be made. At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943 Lieutenant-General Morgan had been appointed Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander and charged with the somewhat unenviable task of planning the greatest amphibious operation in the history of war without the knowledge of who would be the Supreme Commander.1 Already in April 1943, General Morgan had reached the stage at which his plans could scarcely prosper without the co-operation of a responsible air officer. Since it was Sir Charles Portal's view that the most important aspect of the air contribution to Overlord would be the attainment of air superiority over the beachheads, it was decided, with the concurrence of the Americans, that this officer should be a fighter commander and Air Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, who had distinguished himself as a Group Commander in the Battle of Britain, and was now Commander-in-Chief, Fighter Command, gradually began to assume the role. It was, however, not until August 1943 that any official sanction was given to this arrangement. At the Quebec
