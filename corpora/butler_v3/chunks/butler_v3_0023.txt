out the participation of Bomber Command and the United States Strategic Air Forces. Everyone knew that the exercise of air power might well prove to be the decisive factor in Overlord, but the prospect of co-ordinating its various elements in a strategic concentration did not seem to be promising. Certainly, Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory was not yet in a position to resolve the conflict between Pointblank and Overlord. Neither General Spaatz nor Sir Arthur Harris paid much heed to his suggestions. Now that the air contribution to Overlord was seen to be something vastly more comprehensive than mere fighter action over the beachheads, the selection of a fighter commander to direct it began to seem somewhat inappropriate. Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory still had the intention of becoming what Mr. Churchill described as 'a real Commander-in-Chief of the air', but this, the Prime Minister said, was 'not what was meant at all'. The real commander-in-chief of the air ought, Mr. Churchill sug- gested on 6th January 1944, to be Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, who had just been appointed Deputy Supreme Allied Com- 1 The Allied Expeditionary Air Force came into being on 15th November 1943. The Ninth Air Force was transferred to it on 15th December 1943. General Eaker had wished to postpone this transfer until March 1944. 2 The file includes Notes by Portal on Formation of Allied Expeditionary Air Force, 17th Nov. 1943 and 25th Nov. 1943. 17 mander. As such, Mr. Churchill believed, he should not be 'an Officer without portfolio'. He ought to be the 'complete master of all the air operations'. General Spaatz could take his orders from General Eisenhower, there would be no difficulty 'in arranging between Tedder and Harris' and the position of Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory could at last be stabilised. 1 These suggestions which had, no doubt, been much influenced by General Eisenhower, had the appearance of corresponding with the American aim of achieving unified and Supreme Command.
