'com- mand'.1 The doubts which the Americans had felt about the word 'supervision' were evidently justified, for in explaining their objec- tions to the word 'command' the British Chiefs of Staff had said that it was inappropriate because the heavy bombers not actually en- gaged in Overlord operations would continue to function under the direction of the Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Charles Portal.2 Thus, even at this late stage, the British were still seeking to divide the supreme command, and it is hardly surprising that General Marshall was reported to be getting 'very hot under the collar on this subject'. 3 However, on 22nd March a compromise was reached. The British abandoned their attempt to divide the command and the Americans agreed that the word 'Direction' should be used to define General Eisenhower's authority over the strategic air forces.4 This new con- stitution came into effect on 14th April 1944.5 This was an historic event by which a supreme air command was at last created. Though it was intended only as a temporary ex- pedient, its effects on the strategic air attack were enduring. The 'independent' offensive had ended. The so-called 'triphibious' assault was about to begin. The position of power in the direction of the strategic and tactical air forces which was thus officially conferred upon Sir Arthur Tedder was, however, no more than an outward and formal expression of a condition which, informally, had existed for the past six weeks. When Sir Arthur Tedder returned to England from the Mediterranean to assume his position as Deputy Supreme Commander, Allied Ex- peditionary Force, he was, not surprisingly, dismayed by the lack of progress being made with the air plan for Overlord. Sir Trafford Leigh- Mallory had produced an ambitious plan for the disruption of Ger- man rail communications in France which could only be carried out with the co-operation of the strategic air forces.
