prospect of achieving an outright victory. In the meantime, however, General Spaatz con- cluded that a reduction of oil supply would have first an inhibiting and then a crippling effect upon the German armed forces. Thus, the policy which he advocated was also calculated to conform to his third principle and to confer a marked advantage upon the allied military forces. General Spaatz's advice was, in many ways, based upon convincing arguments, and it will presently be seen that his thesis could not be wholly overborne. The extent to which it was based upon a wise and realistic appraisal of the situation will also be seen in due course; but from the point of view of Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expedi- tionary Force, the Spaatz plan appeared to have serious defects. Sir Arthur Harris' views, which also insisted upon the independent role of the heavy bombers, were, however, even more unwelcome. Sir Arthur Harris still believed that Bomber Command should con- tinue with its general area assault upon the major German towns and, in spite of the imminence of Overlord, he saw no reason to depart from the bombing policy which had resulted from his interpretation of the Casablanca directive. As to Overlord itself, he was, by the middle of January 1944, prepared to admit no more than that it 'must now presumably be regarded as an inescapable commitment'. This, however, was a commitment which he clearly believed ought to be discharged with the minimum interference in the development of the Bomber Command area offensive. The two principal arguments by which Sir Arthur Harris sought to fortify his case were firstly, that owing to operational limitations, Bomber Command was still tactically incapable of carrying out any- thing other than a continuing area offensive at night, and secondly, that to depart from this policy at this time would have the effect of neutralising all the achievement of his force in 1942 and 1943 and of allowing Germany a breathing-space in which to effect
