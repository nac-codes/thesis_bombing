ich he knew his force was threatened, and these too were based upon an operational appreciation of the possibilities. The plan to attack a large number of small targets in a relatively short time suggested that Bomber Command might have to divide its effort and operate against a considerable number of different, and perhaps widely separated targets each night. There were, however, in Sir Arthur Harris' view, severe limitations upon the extent to which this could be done. These night attacks, he pointed out, would all have to be initiated by Pathfinder Force marking, using the Oboe technique and the Pathfinder Force could, he said, maintain marking attacks by this means for not more than thirty minutes in the course of each night and, for technical reasons, there would have to be a break of not less than twenty minutes between the marking of two different tar- gets.1 Here, then, was another technical and tactical argument which seemed to favour the mass attack on single targets. As to the direct support of the armies when they were actually in the field, Sir Arthur Harris was even more pessimistic. Bomber Com- mand was, he said, incapable of operating against 'fleeting targets'. This was because, as he put it, 'the objective when once selected can- not be changed at will'. The time required to marshal the force, re- fuel it, bomb it up and brief the crews meant that seven hours were required between the time of the choice of the target at Headquarters and the take-off of the bombers from their bases. If the decision was taken at night, the time required, Sir Arthur Harris said, would be extended to nine or ten hours. 2 A flexibility of this order was not likely to be appropriate to the requirements of the military commanders who were hoping to engage in a war of rapid movement. It led Sir Arthur Harris to con- clude that 'programme bombing' in support of ground troops 'would be extremely unreliable and almost wholly futile'. The only type of operation of this nature
