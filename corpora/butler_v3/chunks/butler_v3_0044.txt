His views upon air power had been developed in a war which had constantly embraced the three elements of land, sea and air. He had directed air operations in two major and victorious invasions against Sicily and Italy. Moreover, he was versed not only in the intricacies of joint-service undertakings, but also in those of coalition war. There was, perhaps, no officer of the Royal Air Force who had a wider and a more fruitful experience of Anglo-American co-operation in the field than Sir Arthur Tedder. His distinguished services to General Eisenhower in the Mediterranean theatre were recognised by all and not least by the Supreme Commander himself. Inter-allied, inter- service and inter-command rivalries and prejudices were foreign to Sir Arthur Tedder's mind. He rightly regarded them as prejudicial to the conduct of the war. His guiding principle was the search for a common object in the pursuit of which all arms could be deployed. Thus, in considering the role of air power in the support of Overlord, Sir Arthur Tedder was primarily concerned with the discovery of a bombing policy which could be applied to the three forces involved, namely, the United States Strategic Air Forces, Bomber Command and the Allied Expeditionary Force, and, in a memorandum of 24th March 1944, he sought to show that a communications attack was the only means of achieving this.

Long-range operations against Germany would, he said, have to continue, so that the Luftwaffe might still be attacked in pro- duction, subjected to attrition in the air and contained in areas far removed from Normandy. But, he pointed out, there would also have to be a plan for the
