which sprang to prominence in the last eighteen months of the war, this particular one had been recognised and given much con- sideration by those responsible for the Western Air Plans. There had been, as will be remembered, a prolonged controversy on the subject before the war between the French General Staff and the British Air Staff. The former, fearful of bringing down retribution from the Luftwaffe but also anxious to find means of delaying a German mili- tary advance, had advocated the use of Bomber Command to secure tactical cuts in particular roads and railways in the immediate vicinity of military operations. The latter, sceptical as to the effective- ness or the possibility of doing this, had favoured a strategic attack upon railway centres, not in the battle zone, but in the Ruhr. When the crisis came in the Battle of France, both types of operation were, as will be recalled, attempted. The strategic operations which were symbolised in the public mind by the many reported attacks on the marshalling yards at Hamm, were not, however, designed only, or perhaps primarily, to delay the German military advance. They were also intended to cause indus- trial dislocation and morale effects. Thus, as a contribution to the independent and strategic air offensive against Germany, they con- tinued to have a relevance after the fall of France had rendered any further tactical operations completely pointless. Indeed, transport bombing formed the central theme of the Air Ministry directive issued on 9th July 1941, and though the aim soon came to be sought mainly as a by-product of general area bombing, it was always much in mind and was from time to time supplemented by selective and precise attacks upon such targets as the Dortmund-Ems Canal or the Anth√©or viaduct. Nevertheless, when communications bombing came once again with the approach of Overlord to be associated with military opera- tions, evil memories of the futile and costly tactical undertakings which had been
