Mr. Lawrence suggested that the Germans had considerable reserves of oil on the Western front and that the results of a strategic offensive against oil production would not have any significant effect upon military operations until four or five months after it had begun. Since it was already almost April and the invasion was due to be launched at the beginning of June, Sir Charles Portal intervened to say that this showed 'conclusively' that the oil plan could not possibly affect the issue of the invasion in its crucial opening phase. When, therefore, General Eisenhower said of Sir Arthur Tedder's suggestion that 'it was only necessary to show that there would be some reduction, how- ever small, (in military traffic) to justify adopting the plan, provided there was no alternative', the decisive words were spoken and the decision had been taken. However much the communications plan 1 Which is dealt with in the forthcoming volumes in this series by Major L. F.

It was also impossible to press the alternative of the oil plan in view of what Mr. Lawrence had said. Thus, the communications plan was adopted more in a spirit of desperation than of optimism.1 This decision seemed to clear the way for the transfer of the direc- tion of the strategic air forces from Sir Charles Portal to General Eisenhower and for the provision by Sir Arthur Tedder of a bombing directive to General Spaatz and Sir Arthur Harris. There were, how- ever, still some important difficulties which continued to delay these transactions. General Spaatz now accepted the conclusion that the French railway plan, as also the continued struggle against the Luft- waffe, might be regarded as among the 'pre-requisites to the success of Overlord'. But, as he showed in identical notes to General Eisenhower and Sir Charles Portal on 31st March 1944, he was n
