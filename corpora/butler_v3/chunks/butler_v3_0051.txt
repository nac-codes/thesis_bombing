But, as he showed in identical notes to General Eisenhower and Sir Charles Portal on 31st March 1944, he was not convinced of the wisdom or the necessity of undertaking an attack on German rail- ways as well. He doubted whether these operations would have much effect on Overlord, and though he admitted that the oil plan might have even less effect upon Overlord, at any rate initially, he thought that the eventual results of the latter plan would be much more disas- trous for Germany than any attack on her railways could be. He, therefore, suggested that the directive for the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces should place the Luftwaffe and ball-bearings plants in the position of first priority. In the second place should come, for the Eighth Air Force, nineteen railway targets in France and other occupied territory, and for the Fifteenth Air Force, railways in Rumania, to isolate Ploesti, and in France to supplement the work of the Eighth Air Force. In the third place he wanted the directive to permit the Eighth Air Force to attack thirteen synthetic oil plants in Germany and the Fifteenth Air Force to take on further similar targets in south-east Germany.2 Thus, while accepting Sir Arthur Tedder's plan as far as it con- cerned railway targets in or near France, General Spaatz continued to resist it and to advocate his own oil plan as far as Germany was concerned.3 This, of course, tended to preserve the conflict between Pointblank and Overlord and it also threatened to divide the objects of allied air power which Sir Arthur Tedder was so anxious to unite. Nevertheless, General Spaatz's persistent and obstinate advocacy of the oil plan did bring its potential value to the notice of General 1 Mins. of the Mtg., 25th March 1944. 2 Memo.
