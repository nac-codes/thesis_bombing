meantime, however, Sir Arthur Tedder had to contend with yet other difficulties before even as much of his plan as had commended itself to General Spaatz could be given the formal expression of a bombing directive. These difficulties arose from the scruples of the Prime Minister about the casualties to French civilians which were likely to be caused by the bombing of the French railway system. The plan which was now put before Mr. Churchill involved the bombing of some seventy-four railway targets in France and Belgium. It had been approved both by General Eisenhower and Sir Charles Portal.

But to Mr. Churchill this was not acceptable and, instead of sanctioning the attack on the seventy-four proposed targets, some of which were in thickly populated areas, he would only extend his authority to the destruction of three.

He relied upon General de Gaulle to e
