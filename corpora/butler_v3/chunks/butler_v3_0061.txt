About seventy per cent of this effort was directed against targets in Germany. In April over ten thousand five hundred sorties were despatched and about thirty-four thousand tons of bombs were dropped, but only just over fourteen thousand tons of these were aimed at German targets. In May, nearly twelve thousand sorties were despatched and over thirty-seven thousand tons of bombs were dropped. Three-quarters of the sorties and more than twenty-eight thousand tons of the bombs were directed to targets in France and other occupied territory out- side Germany. In June, nearly eighteen thousand sorties were des- patched and more than fifty-seven thousand tons of bombs were dropped. Only about five thousand tons of these were aimed at German targets.1 The tremendous effort devoted by Bomber Command in these months to the French railway campaign and also to many other ob- jectives outside Germany was not part of the strategic air offensive against Germany but it did have a profound bearing upon it. The most obvious and the most negative effect of this prodigious diversion was, of course, to reduce the pressure upon the heart of Germany her- self, and this occurred at a time when the striking power of Bomber Command was approaching its zenith both in quantity and in quality. But even this effect was not entirely negative because it also took place when the German air defences were achieving their greatest successes in the night battle over their own territory and the breath- ing space which it afforded to the German towns was also afforded to Bomber Command. Though this breathing space proved to be only temporary, partial and in some ways deceptive, it undoubtedly was, in both cases, a factor of considerable, though not exactly calculable, importance. It was, however, not the only nor the most important consequence which the Overlord diversion had for the strategic air offensive. The commitment of Bomber Command to support the allied armies in the field after June 1944 co
