the final offensive and the earlier campaigns lay in the change of the conditions bearing upon strategic bombing which is generally described as the achievement of air superiority, air suprem- acy or command of the air. As far as the daylight offensive was con- cerned these somewhat vague terms convey the correct meaning for it undoubtedly was the reduction and gradual defeat of the German day fighter force which gave the United States Strategic Air Forces the opportunity to begin in May 1944 the tasks which had been planned for January 1943. In the night offensive of Bomber Command the change of conditions was, however, due to somewhat different and more complex reasons. The defeat of the German day fighter force, the supremacy of the P.51 Mustangs and the relative immunity of the B.17 Flying Fort- resses as also of the Bomber Command aircraft, when they presently began to undertake daylight attacks, did not lead to the defeat of the German night fighter force. No really effective means of engaging night fighters in the air was ever devised. Moreover, relatively small numbers of them could inflict tremendous damage on a night bomber force as had often been shown.1 Nor did the American daylight supremacy contribute in any way to the solution of Bomber Com- mand's old problems of target identification and bomb aiming which, even with the advent of radar, the formation of the Pathfinder Force and the development of specialised techniques by 617 Squadron, still remained formidable. Yet in the final offensive Bomber Command did gradually come to exercise command of the air at night over Ger- many as is shown by the falling and ultimately very slight casualty rate which was sustained after July 1944 and especially after Sep- tember 1944. Bomber Command also developed the ability to strike massive and highly effective blows at relatively small targets such as 1 Sir Arthur Harris had been aware of this at least since the summer of 1942.
