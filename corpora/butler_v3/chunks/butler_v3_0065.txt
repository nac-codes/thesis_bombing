It was bereft of its early warning areas, and another result was that the radar transmitters for the guidance of Bomber Command were pushed for- wards almost to the Rhine. The changes in the conditions of the night bombing offensive corresponded with the geographical advances of General Eisenhower's soldiers and a connection between the efficacy of air power and the exercise of military power was established. The foundations of Bomber Command's contribution to the final offensive were laid in the preparations for, and the execution of, operation Overlord, and it is this which adds an unforseen importance and rele- vance to the decisions which have been discussed in this section.  2. The origins of the final offensive: oil, communications and morale, June-September 1944 The approach of Overlord, it will now be realised, had tended to obscure the distinctions between so-called 'independent' and 'auxili- ary' and even between strategic and tactical bombing, and these dis- tinctions were still further blurred by the actual launching of the invasion on 6th June 1944. Thereafter, the farther the land forces advanced, the more difficult it became to see the difference between them. This was because in the last year of the war the land, sea and air forces were at last deployed in offensive action against Germany itself. In various ways, directly and indirectly, as also both by design and sometimes by chance, they contributed to the success of one another. The 'independent' air offensive became less independent than it had been between the evacuation from Dunkirk and the landing in Normandy. Moreover, as the armies of the grand alliance closed in upon Ger- many from the east, the west and the south, it became increasingly difficult to draw a distinction between strategic and tactical bombing.
