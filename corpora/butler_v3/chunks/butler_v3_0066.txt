closed in upon Ger- many from the east, the west and the south, it became increasingly difficult to draw a distinction between strategic and tactical bombing. In many operations near the fighting lines both roles could clearly be fulfilled by the same operation. Nevertheless, in the final offensive, it is possible to discern not only the continuation but the consummation of the strategic air offensive against Germany, which had been initi- ated by Bomber Command almost exactly four years earlier on the night of 15th May 1940. This is because the action of Bomber Com- mand, now allied to the powerful United States Strategic Air Forces, was still, in one of its roles, designed to exert direct pressure upon the heart of Germany and to bring itself to bear against the sources rather than the manifestations of her armed strength. The fact that the allied armies were on the Continent throughout the final air offensive and were, therefore, often able to turn to their own tactical advantage the consequences of these strategic operations did not destroy the fundamental design of the strategic air offensive, though naturally it exerted much influence upon the bombing policy by which the design was to be accomplished. Quite apart from the many supporting and primarily tactical operations which had to be undertaken by the heavy bombers, the aims and the requirements of the armies were important factors in the making of strategic bombing policy. Thus, in the four years of its activity, the bombing offensive had come full circle, for these were the same considerations as those which had governed the situation in May 1940, when, as in June 1944, a crucial land battle was developing in France. As was to be expected, 42 OIL, COMMUNICATIONS AND MORALE 43 they had somewhat similar consequences. Now, in June 1944, as there had been in May 1940, there was the danger that the strategic poten- tial of the bomber forces might be sacrificed to the need for im- mediate results and, in parti
