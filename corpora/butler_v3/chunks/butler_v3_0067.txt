uences. Now, in June 1944, as there had been in May 1940, there was the danger that the strategic poten- tial of the bomber forces might be sacrificed to the need for im- mediate results and, in particular, to the need for direct army sup- port. Now, as four years earlier, there was a formidable multitude of tasks which seemed appropriate to the heavy bomber force and there was, therefore, the danger that the effort might be dispersed over too wide a range of defensive, offensive, tactical and strategic roles. The danger of dispersal did not, however, arise solely from 'diver- sionary' commitments, such as the support of the army and the Battle of the Atlantic, to which was now added the campaign against V- weapons. It arose also from differing views of how best the force might be directed when it was able to continue the strategic air offensive. In this respect, too, 1944 was like 1940. The solution in both cases had lain in what was now becoming known as the strategy of the common denominator, for, if the force was to be concentrated, it clearly had to be concentrated in the pursuit of some object which would meet, if not all, at least the most important of the requirements of the situa- tion. In 1940, it will be remembered, an oil and a transport plan had vied and then mingled with each other as the principal elements in the offensive strategy of Bomber Command. Both were 'common denominator' target systems, for they were 'independent' in the sense of being thought worth pursuing after the fall of France, but, before that event, both had been designed to make a direct contribution to the land battle. They were offensive in their ultimate aim of bringing Germany to her knees, but they were initially designed to assist defensive operations. The transport plan was also in 1940 partly stra- tegic and partly tactical, not only in the results it was intended to achieve but in its actual conception. In 1944, as has been shown in the previous section, they again emerged
