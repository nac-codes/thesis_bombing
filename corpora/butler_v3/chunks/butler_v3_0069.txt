ever, was not intended simply as a senseless or retaliatory slaughter. On the contrary, its design was to dislocate the German war economy by the destruction of what were regarded as profitable targets in it, namely, the residential centres of the industrial population. The general area offensive was, therefore, a kind of 'panacea', regardless of whether its effect was to be pro- duced primarily either by the physical or the psychological con- sequences.1 In this respect it did not greatly differ in principle from selective attacks upon oil or transport, but in other respects there were, of course, fundamental differences. General area bombing worked almost on the principle that in order to destroy anything it is necessary to destroy everything, and its success had already been shown to depend upon a much greater effort than Bomber Command had been able to make in 1943 and at the beginning of 1944. It was, therefore, as Sir Charles Portal had im- plied in December 1943, an uneconomical form of attack.2 The general area offensive also had a less direct connection with other forms of offensive, and notably with military operations, than did the oil or the communications campaigns, and to this extent it was more an 'independent' and less a 'common denominator' target system than they were. Naturally the success of the general area offensive would, by reducing German morale and war production, make the task of the invading armies easier, but, at any rate while they were still fighting at a considerable distance from the German frontier, few tactical and immediate advantages would accrue for them. The oil and communications plans might equally reduce German war pro- duction and, perhaps, morale as well, and they were also likely to produce great and obvious tactical advantages for the army.3 1 Sir Arthur Harris never used the word 'panacea' to describe the general area offensive. He reserved it for attacks upon 'key points' such as oil production, ball-bearings plants, r
