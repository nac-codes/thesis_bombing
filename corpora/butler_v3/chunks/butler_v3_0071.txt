Eisenhower's armies on the Normandy beachheads in June 1944 and their break-out towards the end of July did not permit Bomber Command and the United States Strategic Air Forces to resume a full-scale strategic air offen- sive against Germany. Great supporting operations by the heavy bombers were still called for and there were other formidable diver- sions from the main air offensive, notable among which was the counter V-weapons campaign, which at times was elevated to the position of first priority. In June, July and August 1944, Bomber Command dropped over 180,000 tons of bombs, but only about 32,000 of them were aimed at targets in Germany.1 This indicates the extent to which, for Bomber Command, the strategic air offensive against Germany had become a marginal effort. Moreover, the situa- tion of the Eighth Air Force was not radically different.2 Neverthe- less, it was at this time and, so far as the Americans were concerned even before it, that the oil campaign began. By September, when France was virtually liberated and General Eisenhower relinquished the direction of the strategic air forces, this 'marginal' oil offensive had already produced the most remarkable results, and had estab- lished a claim for absolute priority in the final offensive. Oil had long been recognised as a strategic target of outstanding importance and attraction and ever since the abortive conclusion of the area attacks became the less likely they were to be hit. But it must also be remem- bered that by no means all area bombing was general area bombing. 1 Monthly reports to the Prime Minister by Portal.
