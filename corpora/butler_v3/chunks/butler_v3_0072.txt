THE STRATEGY OF VICTORY 46 the Bomber Command attack upon it in March 1941 numerous and vigorous attempts had been made to get this target system restored to the bombing directive. These efforts, with which Lord Hankey, Sir Archibald Sinclair and Mr. Attlee were from time to time much con- cerned, all came to nothing for a variety of strategic and operational reasons such as the initial probability of the Germans capturing the Caucasian oil fields, the inaccessibility of the Ploesti plants, which were regarded as fundamental in the German oil position, and the operational limitations of night bombing. Nevertheless, a great volume of oil intelligence was constantly put before those directing the bombing and later the Combined Bomber Offensive. In the Casa- blanca directive, it will be remembered, oil had appeared in the list of selective targets, and in the Pointblank plan it had, if Ploesti could be bombed, been elevated to the status of a 'primary objective'. No specific attacks of any great weight had, however, taken place when, in the spring of 1944, General Spaatz presented the case for an oil offensive not from the point of view of a strategic theorist or an in- telligence expert but from that of an operational commander. Never- theless, in view of the formal decisions reached at the end of March and expressed in the directive of 17th April, it did not seem likely, at least on the face of it, that any such attacks were imminent.1 Formal decisions and official directives were, however, by no means the only ways in which the policy of the combined bomber offensive was made. Indeed, before the issue of the April directive, the oil offensive had already begun, and before the allied soldiers went ashore in Normandy it had already achieved some significant effects.
