fore the issue of the April directive, the oil offensive had already begun, and before the allied soldiers went ashore in Normandy it had already achieved some significant effects. Before the break-out from the beachheads Bomber Command had followed the American initiative and was also embarked upon an oil plan. All this took place without any mention of it in a directive and it was largely the result of the initiative taken by General Spaatz. The campaign began at Ploesti, which had already been the scene of a heroic but inconclusive American attack in August 1943. On 17th March 1944 General Arnold told General Spaatz that the Combined Chiefs of Staff had raised no objection to the employment of the Fifteenth Air Force against this objective, and though it was thought necessary to give out that the targets were marshalling yards, sub- stantial attacks on the oil plants there were, in fact, carried out on 5th, 15th and 24th April 1944. Meanwhile, on 19th April, General Eisenhower had, by word of mouth, authorised General Spaatz to initiate a limited offensive against German oil production with the Eighth Air Force. The beginning was delayed, first by the claims of the campaign against V-weapons and then by a spell of bad weather, 1 Professor Fagg calculates the total percentage of allied bombs aimed at 'petroleum targets' up to Ist May 1944, to be 1.1.
