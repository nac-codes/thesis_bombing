for any official change in bombing policy, Sir Charles Portal endorsed the view at the end of May that '. . . when "'OVERLORD" is firmly established, we should at once consider directing against oil objectives such effort of the strategical air forces as can be spared from the task of continuing the neutralising of the enemy's aircraft production and air forces.' 2 Accordingly, on 3rd June 1944, Sir Norman Bottomley invited Sir Arthur Harris to give an appreciation of the operational possibilities of attacking ten synthetic plants in the Ruhr area as soon as the Over- lord situation might make that possible.3 In his reply, ten days later, Sir Arthur Harris said that attacks on these targets would result in the wastage of many bombs, but he thought they could be destroyed by the expenditure of thirty-two thousand tons of bombs. Rather less effort might be required because, Sir Arthur Harris pointed out, the average aiming error, which he expected to be two thousand yards, might prove to be less than that. The Commander-in-Chief reminded the Air Staff that any plans for the employment of his effort must be submitted for the approval of the Deputy Supreme Commander and he added the somewhat surprising information that, by arrangement with Sir Arthur Tedder, he had already agreed to take on oil plants with his marginal effort.4 Thus, by informal arrangement between General Eisenhower and General Spaatz and between Sir Arthur Tedder and Sir Arthur Harris, oil became an objective of the strategic air offensive. 1 For a fuller account of these developments, upon which the above is mainly based, see The Army Air Forces in World War II, Vol. III, The Beginning of the Campaign against Oil, pp. 172-177. On 7th June 1944 Sir Charles Portal sent a message to General Wilson, which was repeated to General Spaatz and J.S.M., Washington, in which he said that the weakness of the German oil position justified first priority for the bombing of Ploesti and other oil targets in Hungary
