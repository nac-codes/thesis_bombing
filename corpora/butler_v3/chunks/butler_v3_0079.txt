as repeated to General Spaatz and J.S.M., Washington, in which he said that the weakness of the German oil position justified first priority for the bombing of Ploesti and other oil targets in Hungary and Austria, by Air Forces in S.E. Europe. For the moment, he said, communications should have a lower priority. 2 Sir Charles Portal literally endorsed this view with the pencilled word 'Yes' on the Air Staff brief which contained it, and he spoke from this brief, which was dated 29th May, at a C.O.S. meeting held on 30th May 1944. 3 Letter and memo. Bottomley to Harris, 3rd June 1944. The plants mentioned and their estimated annual capacities were: Gelsenkirchen (Nordstern) [400,000 tons], ditto (Scholven) [375,000 tons], Wesseling [200,000 tons], Homberg [190,000 tons], Wanne- Eickel [130,000 tons], Sterkrade-Holten [125,000 tons], Castrop-Rauxel [100,000 tons], Dortmund-Kamen [100,000 tons], Dortmund [90,000 tons] and Bottrop-Welheim [75,000 tons]. 4 Letter and memo. Harris to Bottomley, 13th June 1944.  THE STRATEGY OF VICTORY 48 OIL, COMMUNICATIONS AND MORALE The strategic air offensive was, however, an emasculated affair because of the continuing need to support the army tactically and because of the great effort being made to reduce the V-weapon attack by bombing the launching sites. General Spaatz, indeed, thought that the heavy bombers were being seriously misdirected. Their main con- tribution to the success of Overlord had, he suggested in a letter to General Eisenhower on 28th June 1944, been their effective neu- tralisation of the Luftwaffe and this, he claimed, had been achieved not by operations in France but by attacks on aircraft production in Germany and by the 'bitter air battles over the Reich' which they had produced. Strategic operations against Germany should again, he suggested, have priority, and the only exceptions he would allow were in the event of a major emergency in the land battle, or for attacks upon large rocket-firing installations.
