any should again, he suggested, have priority, and the only exceptions he would allow were in the event of a major emergency in the land battle, or for attacks upon large rocket-firing installations. Normal tactical army support and attacks on the small V-1, or flying bomb, launching sites were not, in his view, justifiable diversions from the main strategic offensive. He allowed, however, for the fact that a high proportion of the bombing effort would in any case be devoted to tactical army support because the weather over Germany was often unsuitable for strategic operations. 1 Though General Eisenhower was not prepared to accept all the implications of this advice, he clearly thought that it had much force. He told Sir Arthur Tedder that Crossbow would have to continue as the first priority, but he thought a new policy might be written for the heavy bombers in which it could be clearly laid down that when they could not all be employed upon Crossbow and when the conditions over Germany were favourable, their objectives should be the aircraft industry, oil production, ball-bearings plants and motor vehicle pro- duction. This was to be subject to an overriding emergency in the land battle and the Supreme Commander thought it would merely confirm what, in any case, was already being done.2 However this may have been, and such a policy scarcely repre- sented the pattern of Bomber Command operations, no new directive was in fact produced, and the effort of the strategic air forces con- tinued to be governed by arrangements which were informal and also sometimes obscure. On 4th July 1944, Sir Charles Portal enquired what oil targets had been allotted to Bomber Command, on what date the directive had been issued and how many of the targets had been attacked.3 Air Commodore Bufton told him that no directive 1 Letter Spaatz to Eisenhower, 28th June 1944.
