Staff than the methods by which it was being directed and the extent to which it was going to be pressed in the future. So far as Air Commodore Bufton could see, the only indication which Sir Arthur Harris had received as to which targets ought to be attacked was that contained in Sir Norman Bottomley's letter of 3rd June which was an enquiry and not a directive.2 Thus, as they read in the reports of the Joint Intelligence Committee of the increasingly desperate position to which the comparatively minor allied attacks had already apparently reduced German oil production, the Air Staff may well have felt a certain frustration at their inability either to control operations or even to know fully the decisions which were being reached at Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force.3 This feeling was, no doubt, responsible for Sir Charles Portal's momentary thought that, perhaps, the time had come for him to re- sume the direction of at least a part of the effort of the strategic bomb- ing forces, but in the event, he did not press this suggestion until Sep- tember.4 In the meantime, however, other courses of action were open.
