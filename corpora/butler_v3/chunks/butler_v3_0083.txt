UNICATIONS AND MORALE to determine the priority of further attacks. 1 Armed with the expert and detailed advice which this committee produced, the Air Staff was in a better position to follow the course of the oil offensive and, there- fore, also to make recommendations about its direction. This was an important development because the oil offensive, though still a purely marginal and even somewhat haphazard affair, was making the most striking progress and, by the end of July, had even produced a situation which seemed to offer the long-range bombers the chance of an imminently decisive contribution to the defeat of Germany. The importance of attacking the correct targets in sufficient force and with adequate frequency, therefore, became greater and greater. This, indeed, clearly emerged from the fort- nightly reports of the Joint Intelligence Committee, but the detailed lines of desirable action were indicated by the Joint Oil Targets Committee. In their report at the end of July, the Joint Intelligence Com- mittee reached the conclusion that 'Germany will be unable to con- tinue the struggle beyond December given intensive fighting on three fronts and the continued success of allied air attacks'. At the begin- ning of August they stated that German consumption had exceeded finished production of oil by about three hundred thousand tons. The Joint Intelligence Committee also, however, noted that the Germans were now giving the highest priority to the repair of damaged oil in- stallations and they recorded the appointment of Geilenberg to direct these efforts. If the bombing ceased in August, they believed that Geilenberg would be able to restore production to the level of con- sumption in that month.2 A further report of 21st August suggested that every hydrogenation plant in Germany had been damaged, that five of the ten known Fischer-Tropsch plants had been damaged and that the recent activities of the Fifteenth Air Force had retarded the recovery of mineral oil
