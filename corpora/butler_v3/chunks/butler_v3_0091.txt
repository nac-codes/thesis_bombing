The memorandum did not suggest that the capital would, 55 in the long run, be incapable of sustaining such a blow. On the con- trary, it was pointed out that essential facilities could be restored and the homeless rehoused 'in a relatively short time', but the plan was not designed to achieve long-term effects. In the short run, it was believed that a blow of this character might cause 'at least a tempor- ary breakdown in the morale of the population of Berlin' and that this might be sufficient to realise the aim of the plan. The admitted fact that forty-eight thousand tons of bombs had already been dropped on Berlin 'with very great, but not with catastrophic destruction' was not held to invalidate the hope because this total had been reached over an extended period and much of it had been delivered in the suburbs and not in the centre of the city. Moreover, 'the general situation' at the times of these earlier attacks 'was such that it could be controlled, and that the High Command was not facing a crisis in which it would be influenced by it. The conditions now postulated', the memorandum stated, 'are different and the weight of attack would be much more concentrated'. The possibility that, as an alternative, similar blows might be struck against other great towns such as Hamburg, Cologne, Frank- furt or Munich was also considered. Though it was thought that this version of the plan would produce somewhat less effect than the con- centration against Berlin, the advantage that it might be cheaper in bomber casualties was stressed. A final suggestion which was ulti- mately to be of the greatest importance was put forward in these words: 'Immense devastation could be produced if the entire attack was concentrated on a single big town other than Berlin and the effect
