eneral area bombing. But the Air Staff, as will have been noticed, had for some time been losing confidence in general area bombing as an efficient means of attack upon industry. As the operational abilities of Bomber Command improved and as the requirement for a 'common denominator' target system became more apparent, so this confidence declined still further. Even while area bombing was regarded as operationally inevitable, the Air Staff had shown an increasing anxiety that it should be selectively applied to towns particularly associated with key points in the German war economy such as ball-bearings, aircraft and latterly oil production. Moreover, their advocacy of the oil plan showed that they no longer 57 regarded area bombing as always, or even generally, operationally inevitable for the main force over German targets. The strategic arguments in favour of general area bombing of Ger- man towns had, therefore, been largely abandoned by the Air Staff, and it appeared that there might be only three principal objects in the final strategic air offensive; the oil campaign, already so strongly supported by the Air Staff, the communications campaign, now being prepared by Sir Arthur Tedder, and the final concentrated and catastrophic blow against morale which had been considered in the Air Staff memorandum of August 1944. There were, of course, sure to be diversions, and, perhaps, large diversions, from these three aims which would be made necessary by the tactical needs of the advancing armies, by the continuing activity of the war at sea and possibly also by other causes. There were also likely to be many occasions when the weather or the condition of the German air defences would make some other form of attack, including, perhaps, general area bomb- ing, inevitable. All the same, it was difficult to see how, if the Air Staff viewpoint endured and prevailed, the main offensive effort of Bomber Command could in the future, as it had been in the past, be largely dev
