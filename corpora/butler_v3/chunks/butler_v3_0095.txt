All the same, it was difficult to see how, if the Air Staff viewpoint endured and prevailed, the main offensive effort of Bomber Command could in the future, as it had been in the past, be largely devoted to the general area bombing campaign. Nevertheless, in the final offensive, the principal effort of Bomber Command was devoted, not only to a resumption, but to a vast expansion of the general area campaign. The Air Staff viewpoint did, on the whole, endure, but at crucial moments it wavered and, therefore, for much of the time, it did not prevail. While the direction of the strategic air forces was vested under General Eisenhower's authority, Sir Charles Portal could in so far as the strategy of Bomber Command was concerned, act only in an advisory capacity but, as a result of arrangements made in Septem- ber, much, though not all, of his previous power was restored.
