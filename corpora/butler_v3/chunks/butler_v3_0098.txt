The psychological moment for this overwhelming blow could, Sir Charles Portal believed, best be determined by the Combined Chiefs of Staff and it could best be implemented if the latter 'exercised direct control of the strategic bomber forces'. Finally, Sir Charles Portal argued, the move of General Eisenhower's headquarters to France, which separated him from the British Air Staff and from the advisory organisations upon which it depended as well as from the operational commanders of the strategic air forces, meant that the Supreme Commander could not 'possibly exercise the fine control of the strategic effort now demanded by the rapid progress of events'. Sir Charles Portal did not overlook the necessity of meeting in full what he evidently expected to be the diminished requirements of the land forces for direct air support. He proposed that the emergency requirements of the land battle should be accorded the first priority in any policy for the heavy bombers and that the control of these sup- porting operations should continue to be exercised by the Supreme Commander under the existing arrangements. The control of all other heavy bomber operations should, however, he submitted, be returned to the authority of the Combined Chiefs of Staff and exer- cised on their behalf by himself and General Arnold jointly.
