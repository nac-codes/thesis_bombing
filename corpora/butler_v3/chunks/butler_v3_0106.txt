In what ways these aims would govern Bomber Command's operations now remained to be seen. 1 Dir. and letter Bottomley to Harris, 25th Sept. 1944, App. 8 (xl). 3. The problem of concentration October-November 1944 The prejudice against communications as a target for heavy bombers died hard and slowly.

Nor had this re- lated merely to tactical operations against communications in sup- port of the land battle. It had related also to strategic operations against them which, as had been the case in France, might be ex- pected to render the tactical operations more effective but which, as had also been the case in France, might have devastating effects upon industry as well, for industry was dependent upon communications.
