orce could not be ignored. For these reasons, which were not in themselves new but only more intense than before, it was decided to establish a new Anglo-American organisation, known as the Combined Strategic Targets Committee.1 The intention was that it should act as a clearing house for submis- sions relating to bombing policy and issue weekly target priority lists for the guidance of Sir Norman Bottomley and General Spaatz. Its ultimate value was considerable, but its initial activities, which were related chiefly to the oil plan, had no immediate or measurable influence upon the course of the air offensive as a whole, though the tendency of Bomber Command to concentrate upon city areas did not pass unnoticed.Âª Among the more complicated items which had been included in the terms of reference of the new committee was the question of how much of the strategic air effort ought to be diverted to the direct support of the armies in the field, but this was a problem which for some time had been attracting the anxious attention of Sir Charles Portal himself, especially since he had heard that General Marshall was thinking of putting forward some new proposals. These were apparently designed to make possible a supreme effort to finish the war with Germany by the end of 1944, but, according to Sir Charles Portal's information, their effect was likely to be a great in- crease of direct air support to the armies and a corresponding re- duction in the scale of the strategic air offensive. This possibility was, as he explained to Sir Arthur Tedder on 22nd October, extremely unwelcome. He recognised that the armies should have 'whatever weight of heavy bomber support may be necessary' when about to undertake either 'an offensive that may be decisive' or 'a smaller attack which is really essential to the land campaign and which would be unlikely to succeed without the help of the strategic bombers', but, apart from these occasions, he thought that 'the proper application of th
