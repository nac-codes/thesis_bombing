The anxiety which beset Sir Charles Portal was: '. . . that the constant application of heavy bomber power to the land battle, when it is not essential and when its only purpose is to save casualties, must eventually lead to the demoralisation of the Army.

On the contrary, Sir Arthur Tedder admitted that the army was 'drugged with bombs'. The demoralisation, to which Sir Charles Portal had referred, was, in his view, already becoming evident.
