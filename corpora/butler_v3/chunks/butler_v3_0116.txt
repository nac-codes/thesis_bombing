contribution of air and land power. It is impossible to know what the effect of such a concentration of this enormous power would have been because it was never achieved. As Sir Arthur Tedder had expected, his views were not everywhere acceptable, but they did, nevertheless, exercise a great influence upon the course which events were about to take. One of the disadvantages of accepting Sir Arthur Tedder's advice, which was apparent both to the members of the Combined Strategic Targets Committee and to the Air Staff, both of whom were, in this matter, much influenced by Air Commodore Bufton, was the effect which it would have upon the oil plan, which had for some time been regarded by the Air Staff as a fundamental and potentially war- winning target system. Sir Arthur Tedder's communications plan was not apparently designed to displace the oil plan, which was to remain the first priority, but it was, all the same, in the view of the Air Staff, likely to compete with it. Sir Arthur Tedder's advice had indi- cated that the oil attacks should be confined mainly to the area of the Ruhr, but there were, of course, many supremely important oil plants, such as those at Leuna and PÃ¶litz to mention only two, which lay far beyond that district. Moreover, as he had specifically made clear in his letter of 25th October to Sir Charles Portal, Sir Arthur Tedder did not envisage these oil attacks as amounting to much more than 'policing' operations. Yet the clear implication of most of the intelligence reports, including those of the Joint Intelligence Com- mittee, was that a really heavy and sustained onslaught was required owing to the ingenuity and the speed with which the Germans, under Geilenberg's direction, could get damaged installations back into at least partial production. 1 In view of the ultimate outcome of the oil offensive, it may be thought that, in his preoccupation with communications bombing, Sir Arthur Tedder had failed fully to appreciate the significance of
