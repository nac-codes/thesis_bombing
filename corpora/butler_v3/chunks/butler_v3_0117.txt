. 1 In view of the ultimate outcome of the oil offensive, it may be thought that, in his preoccupation with communications bombing, Sir Arthur Tedder had failed fully to appreciate the significance of the oil plan. On the other hand, in view of the eventual strategic and tactical achievements of the communications campaign, there can be no doubt that the Air Staff was slow to realise the real force of Sir Arthur Tedder's argument. Oil and communications thus still appeared to be competing target systems and the extent to which this was so was clearly shown in the development of a plan known as 1 A J.I.C. Report of 30th October 1944, for example, made this point again, see App. 26. S.A.O .- VOL. III, Pt. 5-F  THE STRATEGY OF VICTORY 72 THE PROBLEM OF CONCENTRATION Hurricane I. This was designed to deal a crushing blow at the immediate object of the land offensive, namely the Ruhr, and in some respects it corresponded with the viewpoint of Sir Arthur Tedder. It provided, at least geographically, for a concentration of the efforts of Bomber Command, the Eighth Air Force, the Tactical Air Forces and, if pos- sible, also the Fifteenth Air Force. The object was to cause mass havoc, panic and disorganisation in the Ruhr valley, to disrupt the im- mediate German front-line communications by driving the rail heads back east of the Rhine and to demonstrate to the Germans the futility of further resistance. Thus, the plan had a moral as well as a material aim. It was to be executed in daylight with massive fighter cover and the idea was that the Eighth Air Force should aim at oil plants, Bomber Command at built-up areas and the Tactical Air Forces at communications targets. The plan showed that there was no real intention to achieve a functional concentration and it was, perhaps, by more than a coincidence that each of the elements in- volved was to attack targets which corresponded with the wishes of the various Command Headquarters concerned. There was, however, no doubt as
