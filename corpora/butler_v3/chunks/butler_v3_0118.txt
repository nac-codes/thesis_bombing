by more than a coincidence that each of the elements in- volved was to attack targets which corresponded with the wishes of the various Command Headquarters concerned. There was, however, no doubt as to the extent of the concentration in time and space which was intended. Within one or two hours, some two thousand five hundred heavy bombers were intended to appear over the Ruhr with no less than 12,000 tons of bombs, and it is interesting to note that the Bomber Command aircraft were to be armed with high- explosive bombs which it was now thought would, 'as opposed to incendiary attack . . . inflict heavy casualties'.1 This plan owed something to the wishes of the Army Commanders, but it also bore a generic similarity to the blow of catastrophic force which Sir Charles Portal had outlined in the previous August as a possible means of influencing the war-will of the German High Com- mand. Nevertheless, the Air Staff did not regard it as an alternative to the oil plan which they thought should still provide the principal precision target system of the strategic air offensive. Neither the object of shattering German morale nor of disrupting German com- munications should, they thought, be allowed to interfere with the primary task of draining the enemy's oil resources, and communica- tions bombing, they frequently affirmed, should in any case be largely confined to tactical operations near the military front. 2 Such, broadly speaking, was the view of the Air Staff before Sir Arthur Tedder's memorandum of 25th October 1944 was received and such, as will presently be seen, it substantially remained after- wards. But the policy of the Air Staff, or that of Sir Arthur Tedder, or of the compromise between the two which was eventually achieved, 1 Dir. Bottomley to Harris, 13th Oct. 1944, App. 8 (xlii).
