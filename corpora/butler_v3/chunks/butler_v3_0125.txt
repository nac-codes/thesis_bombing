offensive to have been particularly fortunate. The issue between Sir Charles Portal and Sir Arthur Harris was, however, quite different. A certain amount of area bombing was, of course, inevitable if the offensive was to be con- stantly maintained. Moreover, as has been shown, an element of area bombing was included in the communications plan, notably in the case of the Ruhr, and area bombing could, and, in fact, did, make an 1 For this problem of appraisal and the difference of opinion which existed about it, see below, Chap. XIV. 77 important contribution in many other ways both to the oil and com- munications plans. Even so, the general area offensive, because of the scale on which it necessarily had to be waged, was far more of an alternative to the oil and communications plans than either of them were to each other. Nor did general area bombing, which sought its results from a cumulative effect, have any connection with the plan for a sudden and catastrophic blow which, as will be recalled, had been envisaged as a possible coup de gr√¢ce to German morale. Thus, the disagreement between Sir Charles Portal and Sir Arthur Harris was of fundamental importance. The basis of it could, Sir Charles Portal had told the Secretary of State for Air in January 1944, 'be accurately described by the saying that the Air Staff advocate throwing the weight of Bomber Command round about the weak places in the German structure, whereas the A.O.C .- in-C. believes more in piling the maximum on to the struc- ture as a whole'.1 At the time, before the development of precision bombing techniques in the French railway campaign which Sir Arthur Harris found so surprising, before the decline of the German fighter forces and before other developments of almost equal im- portance, this was, perhaps, no more than a slight understatement and over-simplification of the real situation. After all, at that time, the Battle of Berlin was still joined and its outcome, though it could, perhaps, be
