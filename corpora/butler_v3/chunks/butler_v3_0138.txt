Fifteenth Air Force Statistical Summary. 85 The problems and difficulties of the oil campaign had indeed grown much greater than they had been in the summer months. As was to be expected, the weather became worse and the chances of making accurate attacks became less. Also, and for the same reason, it became more difficult to repeat attacks and, owing to the difficulty of obtain- ing photographic reconnaissance in bad weather, to know the most appropriate time at which these repeat attacks should be attempted. Thus, there was the double danger of wasting bombs upon oil plants which were already out of action and of not attacking others which had recovered at least a proportion of their previous production capacity. These factors, which tended to weight the scales of the battle against the forces of destruction and in favour of those of re- construction, were, however, fully apparent to the Air Staff and were constantly impressed upon Sir Arthur Harris by them. They made the case for increasing the amount of destruction to the greatest possible extent in the hope that the damage would last through pos- sibly longer periods of bad weather, and, also, for not missing any possible opportunity for inflicting such damage. These considerations were the underlying reason for Sir Charles Portal's acute anxiety to enlist Sir Arthur Harris' wholehearted support for the plan. He knew well enough that such formidable
