is continuing to run sufficiently for their purpose on producer gas, steam, industrial alcohol, etc., etc. However,' he concluded, 'we should be content if we can deprive them of adequate supplies of aviation fuel. That in itself will take enough doing.' 1 'I am', Sir Charles Portal replied ten days later, 'profoundly dis- appointed that you still appear to feel that the oil plan is just another "panacea". Naturally,' he added, 'while you hold this view you will be unable to put your heart into the attack of oil'. Sir Charles Portal patiently explained that the success of the oil plan did not depend upon the complete destruction of every oil installation down to the smallest benzol plant in Germany. Nor, he pointed out, did it depend upon the unaided efforts of Bomber Command. There were also, he reminded Sir Arthur Harris, the American Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces. 'The essence of the immediate task before the Allied strategic bomber forces is', Sir Charles Portal said, 'to put out and keep out of action the 11 synthetic plants in Central Germany', which, he believed, were pro- ducing seventy per cent of the enemy's surviving supplies of aviation and motor spirit. 'There is no doubt in my mind', Sir Charles Portal continued, 'that their immobilisation and the continued immobilisa- tion of the remaining major producers would represent by far the greatest and most certain contribution that our strategic bombers could make to the achievement of an early decision in the German war.' As to Sir Arthur Harris' strictures upon the Ministry of Economic Warfare, Sir Charles Portal suggested that 'if we had tried harder in our attack on ball-bearings I have little doubt that the full effects forecast by M.E.W. would have been achieved'. In the case of the oil plan, Sir Charles Portal warned Sir Arthur Harris, 'if you allow your obvious doubts in this direction to influence your conduct of opera- tions I very much fear that the prize may yet slip through our fingers.
