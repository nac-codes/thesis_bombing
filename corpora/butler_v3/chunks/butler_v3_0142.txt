This assurance and the challenge which followed it were, however, rendered less convincing by the two examples which Sir Arthur Harris mentioned of tasks which he apparently thought he had car- ried out to the 'utmost' of his ability. He claimed to be unaware 'that we lost any feasible opportunity of prosecuting' the ball-bearings plan and he even suggested that 'nobody could say that every possible effort was not made, and brilliantly executed, in the best of con- ditions, to knock the German fighter forces out on the ground and in their factories' during 1943. These were, indeed, extraordinary statements, but, of course, they found their places in an extraordinary letter.1 Though it might well have been supposed that further arguments would be useless, Sir Charles Portal still persisted with his attempt, if not to convert Sir Arthur Harris to the oil plan, at least to persuade him that there was considerably more to be said for it than he had yet admitted. Indeed, since he was evidently unwilling to replace Sir Arthur Harris, Sir Charles Portal had no alternative but to do this, for he still believed, in spite of the Commander-in-Chief's 'assertions to the contrary', that the oil campaign could 'be pressed home harder and more certainly' if it was backed not only by Sir Arthur Harris' 'sense of loyalty' but by his 'enthusiasm' as well.
