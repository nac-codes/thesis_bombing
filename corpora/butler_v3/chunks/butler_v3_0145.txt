they can make a calculable contribution to the offensive as a whole. Such a policy', he added, 'has been adopted in the attack of oil and communications'. But Sir Charles Portal's objection to the policy of general area bombing as a main aim did not turn only upon his belief that it was unlikely to be decisive in itself. In what may be regarded as the most significant passage of this letter, he said that 'while area bombing, if it could have been continued long enough and in sufficient weight, might in the end have forced the enemy to capitulate, his counter-measures would have pre- vented us from maintaining such a policy to the decisive point. We would have been forced to precision attack to maintain the air situation needed to continue the offensive at all. The Ameri- cans did this for themselves in 1943 /44 with a little help from Bomber Command. Under cover of the favourable air situation which was created "OVERLORD" was launched successfully, and the advance to the German frontier gave night bombing a new lease of life. But for this', Sir Charles Portal concluded 'it is possible that the night blitzing of German cities would by now have been too costly to sustain upon a heavy scale'. This, of course, was not only an argument against general area bomb- ing but it was also one in favour of the oil campaign, for, as Sir Charles Portal explained at the end of his letter, one of the con- sequences of bombing oil would be to continue and extend the im- mobilisation of the Luftwaffe.1 The important judgement, which Sir Charles Portal would, perhaps, have hesitated to make in a wholly official communication, contained an admission that, while the German air defences had been effective, the general area offensive had been a largely self-defeating policy, and that after the German air defences had ceased to be effective, it had been revealed as an uneconomic and even irrelevant policy. The suggestion was that in the pursuit of general area bombing, Bomber Command had be
