German air defences had ceased to be effective, it had been revealed as an uneconomic and even irrelevant policy. The suggestion was that in the pursuit of general area bombing, Bomber Command had been involved in a vicious circle from which escape had been made possible only by the results of the American day offen- sive, the success of Overlord and the development of precision tech- niques by Bomber Command. This was a recognition of the change which had been produced by the achievement of air superiority which, as far as the hours of darkness were concerned, Sir Charles Portal rightly attributed to the chain of events initiated by the neutralisation of the German day fighter force and culminating in the 1 Letter Portal to Harris, 8th Jan. 1945.

It was also, of course, in the oil campaign that, in addition to all the other arguments supporting it, Sir Charles Portal saw the chief means of maintaining and extending this vital air superiority. Though this point of view was utterly unacceptable to Sir Arthur Harris and, as we shall presently see, continued to be so, it did, un- doubtedly, reflect a true and realistic appreciation of the situation. This, nevertheless, did not entirely undermine Sir Arthur Harris' arguments, for in many respects Sir Charles Portal had oversimplified the issue and in some he had misunderstood it. For that reason it requires further analysis. The apparent stalemate in the general area offensive up to the end of the Battle of Berlin, which Sir Charles Portal had mentioned, was due to a kind of balance which had been struck between the destruc- tive power of Bomber Command and the resources of repair, recon- struction and improvisation mobilised by the Germans. It meant, as had long been recognised, that the offensive was necessarily one of attrition in which the cumulative effect over a period of years was the o
