re backed by the provision of scientific devices both of simplicity and also of extraordinary complexity. Sir Arthur Harris had also, on a number of occasions, vigorously appealed for long-range night 91 fighter support on a comprehensive scale.1 By April 1944 it was, how- ever, apparent to Sir Arthur Harris that the measures of evasion were exhausting themselves2 and, in spite of the somewhat limited efforts of Fighter Command to engage the German night fighter force by Serrate and other kinds of operations, no effective means of doing so had been or, for that matter, were ever to be devised. Though the Air Staff had not by any means resisted Sir Arthur Harris' aims in all these directions, they had, perhaps, too readily and for too long con- tinued to accept the primarily defensive role of Fighter Command, nor had they shown adequate zeal in overcoming admittedly power- ful but nevertheless pusillanimous counsels which had often delayed the introduction of radio counter-measures and notably Window. In- deed, the reaction of the Air Staff to the rise of the German night fighter force had been somewhat different from that of Sir Arthur Harris. The Air Staff believed that the solution to the problem was the same as that proposed in the case of the German day fighter force by the intermediate objective of the Pointblank plan, namely, the bombing of German aircraft production sources and supporting industries such as ball-bearings plants. This, as has appeared, was one of the reasons which had led the Air Staff to urge upon Sir Arthur Harris the policy of attacking what, it will be remembered, were called the 'associated towns'.3 This idea, which, as has also appeared, led to the crisis of Pointblank, was, however, based upon a fallacy. The combined bomber forces were no more capable of delivering a 'knock-out blow' against the German aircraft industry than Bomber Command was capable of delivering a 'knock-out blow' against the leading German towns. The targets were no
