These arguments related mainly to what was already history and, though the tendency to repeat rather than to analyse them has since led to a considerable misunderstanding of the events and decisions to which they refer, it may be doubted whether they had much bearing upon the immediate problems of the bombing offensive in 1945 except for the unfortunate but important consequence they had of further embittering the already strained relations between the Air Staff and the Commander-in-Chief, Bomber Command. Indeed, Sir Arthur Harris seems to have been well aware of this, and in a letter of 18th January 1945 he told Sir Charles Portal that he would have pre- ferred 'for reasons of brevity' to have confined his remarks entirely to the oil plan. Nevertheless, he could not be blamed for suggesting that Sir Charles Portal had raised other points which needed 'elucidation or reply'.
