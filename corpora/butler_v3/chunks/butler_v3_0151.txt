claimed that he never questioned official policy except 'when invited, or on grounds of practicability, tactical feasibility or the appropriateness of throwing over the previous strategic policy, which has been 7/10ths implemented at enormous cost in blood and effort, in favour of something entirely different'. Though this last point clearly begged the whole question, it was, equally clearly, the operative reason for which Sir Arthur Harris described the oil plan as 'another attempt to seek a quick, clever, easy and cheap way out'. He once more asserted that its execution would show that it was none of these things and that in adopting it 'we are foresaking a most substantial substance for a most tenuous shadow. ..

Though he still categorically claimed that he had not failed 'in any worth-while efforts to achieve even those things which I knew from the start to be impracticable, once they had been decided upon', Sir Arthur Harris had shown, equally categorically, that there was no prospect what- soever of Sir Charles Portal converting him as to what was worth while and what was practicable.
