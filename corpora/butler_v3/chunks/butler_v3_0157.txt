in his letter to Sir Arthur Harris covering the directive. Sir Norman Bottomley suggested that General Spaatz might do the same in the case of his two commands.2 General Spaatz, however, did not intend to reduce the force with which the directive restored the intermediate objective of the Pointblank plan. On the contrary, in almost identical letters to the Commanding Generals of the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces, he sought to strengthen it. Unless 'adequate measures' were taken promptly, he told his commanders, the Ger- mans would have between four and five hundred jet aircraft 'avail- able for operations against us by early summer . . . ' The production and preparation of this force had, therefore, he told them, been made 'a principal objective for attack'.3 It may seem surprising that General Spaatz thus completely rejected the advice he had received from Sir Norman Bottomley, but it is more surprising to find that the latter did not even act upon his own advice. In his covering letter of 19th January 1945 to Sir Arthur Harris, Sir Norman Bottomley made no mention of any of the points raised by Sir Charles Portal. He merely paraphrased or simply repeated the terms of the directive which was, at the same time, enclosed. The directive also referred to 'the grow- ing menace of the German U-boat developments' and called for a 'marginal' and an 'incidental' bombing effort against them.4 Though oil and communications were still listed, nominally at least, as the first and second priorities in this perplexing directive, most of the rest of it showed the extent to which confidence in an early victory had been shaken by the apparent revival of German military strength. But this frame of mind was rendered obsolete, or at 1 Min. Portal to Bottomley, 14th Jan. 1945. 2 Bottomley to Spaatz, 14th Jan. 1945 3 Memos.
