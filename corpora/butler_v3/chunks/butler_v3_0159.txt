In view of the important part which German tanks might play in stemming the Russian advance, the Joint Intelligence Committee recommended that the bombing of tank factories should 'take precedence second only to oil'. The Committee also thought that attention should be paid to the possibility of prevent- ing or delaying reinforcement of the Eastern front by bombing com- munications. In addition, they referred to the possible effects upon the Russian advance of 'heavy and sustained attacks on Berlin'.1 This matter, it will be remembered, had, in a different connection, been under active consideration since August 1944 when Sir Charles Portal had laid before the Chiefs of Staff an idea for delivering a coup de gr√¢ce to German morale by such a means. Sir Charles Portal had emphasised at the time that this catastrophic blow would be unlikely to achieve important results unless it was delivered at a finely chosen moment between the virtual defeat of Germany and the outbreak of anarchy in that country, accompanied, perhaps, by an underground movement. The idea was, in fact, conceived, not as a means of bring- ing about the defeat of Germany, but of inducing an organised sur- render after that had occurred. Except on that basis, the Air Staff never showed any enthusiasm for the plan which came to be known as Thunderclap. The Joint Planners had reported on 17th August 1944 that they did not think the plan was 'likely to achieve any worth while degree of success' and Air Commodore W. L. Dawson, the 1 J.I.C.
