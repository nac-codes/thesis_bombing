ended that the Joint Intelligence Committee should be invited to report to the Chiefs of Staff whenever they thought that an appropriate situation for the execution of Thunderclap had arisen, and the Chiefs of Staff had subsequently given instructions to that effect.1 Though this recommendation may not have appeared at the time to have much importance, it did, in fact, presently lead to a further examination of the Thunderclap plan, though the objects became very different from those which had originally been envisaged.2 The Director of Bomber Operations, Air Commodore Bufton, had already come to the conclusion that the new Russian advance might present a favourable opportunity for the launching of Thunderclap. 'If', he suggested to Sir Norman Bottomley on 22nd January 1945, 'the operation were launched at a time when there was still no obvious slackening in the momentum of the Russian drive, it might well have the appearance of a close co-ordination in planning between the Russians and ourselves. Such a deduction on the part of the enemy would greatly increase the moral effect of both operations.' Air Commodore Bufton thought that the main attacks on Berlin might be supplemented by simultaneous assaults on Breslau and Munich by bombers based in the Mediterranean theatre, and, since the plan would involve an Anglo-American effort, he thought that Sir Norman Bottomley might wish to discuss it with General Ander- son.3 In this way, the Air Staff began to think of Thunderclap in association with the Russian offensive. At the same time, the Joint Intelligence Committee drew attention to the possibility that the aims of the plan might be modified. Instead of seeking to use Thunderclap in association with the Russian offensive as a means of crushing Ger- man morale, which they did not think could be done, they now sug- gested that the plan might be adopted as a direct means of assisting the Russians in the conduct of their operations.
