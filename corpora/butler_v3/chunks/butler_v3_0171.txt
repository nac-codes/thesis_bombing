that an attempt to cut railways in the middle of Germany to stop troop movements would produce only disappointing results. Marshal Khudyakov, Chief of the Soviet Air Staff, agreed that it would be impossible to cut all German railways; he confined his suggestions to an expression of the hope that Field- Marshal Alexander's operations could be aimed at hampering the movement of German troops from Italy to the Eastern front. Thus, if they were to fulfil any of the Russian requests, the Anglo-American strategic air forces were left with no real alternative to the policy of attacking east German cities near the fighting front such as Berlin and Leipzig. Meanwhile, the angle of approach at the Yalta discussions had shifted, and apart from General Antonov's request that Berlin and Leipzig should be paralysed, the Russians showed little further in- terest in the strategic air offensive. As far as its application to targets in eastern Germany was concerned, they seem to have been anxious to restrict rather than to encourage its development. General Antonov suggested that a kind of air frontier or bombline should be established in Germany and that it should run from Berlin to Dres- den, Vienna and Zagreb.1 Though the Russians made it clear that the towns through which it ran were to be allotted to the Western air forces for attack, General Kuter feared that it would exclude the bombing by the Anglo-American air forces of about twenty important strategic targets, including the oil plants at PÃ¶litz and Ruhland. He also observed that it would prohibit operations against industrial and com- munications targets 'in the neighbourhood' of Berlin and Dresden. Though General Antonov's argument about the precise significance of the proposed bombline was somewhat obscure, he insisted that it could not be moved farther to the east. He even suggested that if it was, there would be no targets left for the Soviet air force to bomb. Sir Charles Portal said that the British and United States
