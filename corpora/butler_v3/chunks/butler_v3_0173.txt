ttacks on east German towns did not constitute any fundamental change in bombing policy. The February attack on Berlin was not the first which the United States Eighth Air Force had made on the German capital. Nor was it, or the operations which followed against such places as Dresden, Munich and Leipzig, the first occasion on which the Eighth Air Force had made general attacks on built-up areas in which many bombs were dropped blindly by H2X indications and in which the results corresponded with the British night area bombing assaults. As far as Bomber Command was concerned, the continuing area bombing offensive had never ceased to be an important part in the strategy of the air attack, and, though, as has been seen, there had been much disagreement about the priority which should be afforded to this particular aspect of the offensive, there had, as yet, been no authoritative suggestion to the effect that it should be abandoned. Nevertheless, and in spite of the fact that the oil campaign was still clearly regarded as the primary aim of the combined bomber offen- sive, the new plan did impose important modifications upon the exist- ing pattern of bombing policy. While for some time past severe area attacks upon the Ruhr had been demanded in the interests of causing chaos in the immediate rear of the German army on the Western front, the application of the same principle to the Eastern front pre- sented a new situation for which there had been no previous oppor- tunity. Thus, area bombing, which had been associated with many different aims in the past, now, for the first time, came to be con- nected with the desire of the Western allies to assist the Russian advance into German territory. This much was made clear by the whole development of the plan and especially by the prodding to which the Prime Minister had subjected the Air Staff at the end of January. The fact that the Russians themselves apparently expressed special interest in only two of the targets concern
