The fact that the Russians themselves apparently expressed special interest in only two of the targets concerned, namely, Berlin and Leipzig, of course, had no bearing upon the motives which led to the inclusion in the list of other targets such as Chemnitz and Dres- den. This modification, as Sir Charles Portal expected, might well  THE STRATEGY OF VICTORY 108 ANTI-CLIMAX AND CLIMAX have led to a revision of the directive by Sir Norman Bottomley and General Spaatz, especially as the one they had issued on 15th Janu- ary had fallen so far out of step with the realities of the situation.

This was curious, and particularly so since on 7th February 1945 Sir Norman Bottomley had suggested to General Spaatz that they should jointly issue a new directive allocating the first priority to oil, the second to communications including the destruction of Berlin. Leipzig, Dresden, Chemnitz and similar centres, the third to tank factories, the fourth to jet aircraft production and the fifth to sub- marine yards. 1 The failure of the agents for the direction of the com- bined bomber offensive to do this was unfortunate as it led to some confusion amongst their superiors, but the absence of a directive made little difference at the time either to Sir Arthur Harris or to General Doolittle. Their instructions, as has been seen, were quite clear, and it was obvious that the American attack on Berlin would shortly be followed by similar operations against Dresden, Leipzig, Chemnitz and, perhaps, other places as well. Even General Kuter, who was apparently unaware of the plan, showed at the Yalta Conference that he knew Dresden was a probable target for the strategic air forces .?
