Dresden, with its pre-war population of more than 600,000 now swollen by an influx of refugees and its significance enhanced by military events on the Eastern front, had, even before these develop- ments, been regarded as a desirable bombing target in its own right. So much had this been so, that towards the end of 1944 the British Air Staff had, with the approval of the Prime Minister, sought to per- suade the Soviet Air Force to bomb it.3 Nothing had come of this but, as will be remembered, Dresden took its place alongside Leipzig and Chemnitz as among the towns which Sir Arthur Harris had for some time believed to be in urgent need of destruction.

In daylight on 14th February the action against Dresden was taken up by more than four hundred bombers of the Eighth Air Force.
