The United States official history does not make any reference to the heavy Eighth Air Force attack against the marshalling yards at Dresden on 17th April 1945.

The German output of petrol had by that time, they estimated, been reduced to the level of 30,000 tons per month, which was about six per cent of the normal production. They considered that none of the remaining oil plants was capable of any substantial output and even the small resources which were still avail- able could not, they reported, be properly distributed owing to the collapse of the German transport system.2 Thus, it appeared, and as will be seen in Chapter XIV, it was actually the case, that the oil plan had achieved its ultimate aim. The Air Staff, therefore, and for the best of reasons, no longer had a case for persisting with the oil policy which had to so great an extent absorbed their attention since June 1944. Bu
