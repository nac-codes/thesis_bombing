For these reasons the path of the advocates of com- munications bombing became easier and they were able to harness an increasing proportion of the heavy bomber effort to their purposes. Though these operations were an inseparable part of the military campaign which they so greatly facilitated, they were equally an in- separable part of the strategic air offensive, for, as will appear in Chapter XIV, these attacks, together with those on oil, made a decisive contribution to the paralysis of the heart of Germany which was wrought by that offensive in the closing months of the war. The communications campaign had included two major plans. The first, known as Clarion, was mainly an American conception which had been strongly canvassed for some time and had been especially recommended by General Marshall. It involved widespread attacks on communications all over Germany by heavy, medium and light bombers as well as by fighters. Thus, while it provided for a func- tional concentration of air power, it necessitated an enormous geographical dispersal which by many, including the British Air Staff, was thought to be a severe disadvantage.1 In practice the operation, which was initiated towards the end of February 1945, was largely indiscriminate and failed to produce any very satisfactory results.2 While the American air forces were concerned with this dispersed application of the communications campaign, Bomber Command devoted its main efforts to a more concentrated attack upon the Ruhr with the aim of isolating it from the rest of Germany. This was the object of the second main plan which had long been advocated by Sir Arthur Tedder and which was now given the code name of Bugle. It involved the use of the Anglo-American heavy bombers against the Ruhr area itself where, at the beginning
