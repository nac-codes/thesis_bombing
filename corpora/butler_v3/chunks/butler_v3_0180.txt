Sir Arthur Tedder observed to Sir Norman Bottomley on 16th March 1945 that he could no longer see much difference between strategic and tactical bombing.  THE STRATEGY OF VICTORY 112 ANTI-CLIMAX AND CLIMAX Thus, by the beginning of April 1945, the principal parts of both the oil and the communications plans had been executed. The anti- climax of January had rapidly and dramatically been translated into a climax, for it was now apparent that the aim of the strategic air offensive had been accomplished. The military, industrial and econo- mic system of Germany had been undermined to the point of utter collapse. The enemy was no longer capable of effective armed resist- ance. Nothing which could endure stood between the Russian armies moving westwards and the Anglo-American armies moving east- wards. In these circumstances, it became
