In view of this and in view of the fact that even the Prime Minister seems to have been temporarily influenced by the same delusion, it seems necessary to examine the foundations upon which this myth grew. The conduct of the strategic air offensive had long been regarded with suspicion by sections of public opinion in Britain. It was gener- ally regarded as morally legitimate to bomb strategic objectives such as factories, oil plants, dockyards and railway centres, even if this did incidentally cause severe destruction of residential areas and of civi- lian life and limb. On the other hand, the view that it was morally legitimate to bomb residential areas, even if the object was to reduce military or industrial activity, was frequently challenged, and the more apparent it became that in the majority of its major area attacks, Bomber Command was, in fact, aiming at the centres of the residential areas, the more pronounced the protests became.

Notable among them were the Bishop of Chichester, Dr. Bell, and the Marquess of Salisbury.1 Now, of course, the responsibility for the fact that Bomber Command often, and at some stages of the war generally, aim
