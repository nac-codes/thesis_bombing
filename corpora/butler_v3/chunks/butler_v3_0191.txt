Staff were not yet prepared to prohibit area bombing under all circumstances.1 When, on 6th April 1945, this decision was communicated to Sir Arthur Harris an important element in the strategic air offensive was withdrawn, but, in fact, the whole campaign was ending because the utter collapse of Germany was daily becoming more obvious and more imminent.2 On 10th April General Eisenhower and Sir Arthur Tedder concluded that the primary object of bombing was now to give direct support to the armies, and they suggested that the greater part of the effort should be devoted to the destruction of communica- tions, especially in the area of Leipzig and Halle.3 Nor did the Air Staff any longer wish to resist this conclusion, though they believed that a limited effort should still be devoted to the oil plan.4 The new situation was recognised by Sir Norman Bottomley and General Spaatz in the fourth and last of their directives which, on 19th April 1945, was recommended for the approval of the Combined Chiefs of Staff by the British Chiefs of Staff. It stated that the 'main mission of the Strategic Air Forces is now to give direct assistance to the land campaign' and, in effect, it signalised the ending of the stra- tegic air offensive against Germany. This directive was dated 16th April 1945, but it was not officially promulgated until 5th May owing to differences of opinion in London and Washington as to whether it should be issued by Sir Charles Portal and General Arnold or by Sir Norman Bottomley and General Spaatz.5 1 C.O.S.
