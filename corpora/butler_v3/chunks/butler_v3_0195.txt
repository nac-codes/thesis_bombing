ndeed, showed signs of becom- ing safer than night bombing, for no method could be found of en- gaging the German night fighters in the way that the day fighters were being engaged and overwhelmed. Nevertheless, day bombing was no longer necessarily more accurate than night attack. On the contrary, owing to the extraordinary advances of Bomber Command in the techniques of marking and aiming at night, the opposite was often the case. Then, in the late summer of 1944, the German night fighter force began to show a sudden and precipitate decline in effectiveness which presently left Bomber Command in possession of an air superiority at night as complete as that which had been gained earlier in daylight. The revolution suggested by these abrupt and sweeping changes was one of great complexity which depended upon a number of radical factors, some of which were the product of natural and ex- pected developments, such as the improvement in the techniques of Bomber Command, and some of which, like the changes in fortune of the German night fighter force, were more sudden and less expected. Whether expected or unexpected and whether evolutionary or revo- lutionary, these developments did, all the same, produce entirely new factors which, in turn, produced conditions for the bombing offensive which were not only different but often quite the reverse of those which had governed the earlier phases of the campaign. In the sections which follow the nature and effect of these new factors is analysed in detail, for it was upon them that the eventual decisive- ness of the combined bomber offensive depended. Here, in this intro- ductory section, an appraisal of their general significance and of the connection between them is made. Among the most important of the new factors was one due entirely 123  NEW OPERATIONAL SKILLS 124 NEW OPERATIONAL FACTORS to the logical and expected development of tendencies and decisions revealed much earlier.
