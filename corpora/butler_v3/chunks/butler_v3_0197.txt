al different targets at the same time, but it was even to be shown that a single Group could effectively mount a major area attack upon a major German town. The exploitation and development of these new capacities was made urgent and imperative by two other factors which also arose as the Battle of Berlin came to an end. The first was the nature and extraordinary variety of tasks which Bomber Command was called upon to undertake in direct preparation for Overlord and the short 1 In April 1944 there was a daily average of 1,023 aircraft available with crews for operations in Bomber Command. The daily average of aircraft available for operations was: Lancasters 614 Halifaxes 353 Stirlings 58 Mosquitoes 72 In April 1945 these averages had increased to 1,609 aircraft available with crews for operations and the average for individual aircraft at that time was: Lancasters 1,088 Halifaxes 349 Mosquitoes 170 These figures include only bombers.

The second was the alarming of the German night fighter force which reached an un- precedented climax on the night of the Nuremberg operation at the end of March. These, of course, were entirely different kinds of factors and the connection between them was purely coincidental. It was, however, nonetheless strong for that reason. The requirements of Overlord and the success of the German night fighter force were mutu- ally supporting in their effects. Strategically, the consequence was to impair the concentration of effort which, during the previous twelve months, had been devoted to targets within the German frontiers. Operationally the consequence was to disperse the concentrated tactics which Bomber Command had progressively developed during the previous four years. The preparations for Overlord, as will be remembered, involved Bomber Command in a plan for the destruction of a large number of relatively small targets within an extremely short time. Military con-
