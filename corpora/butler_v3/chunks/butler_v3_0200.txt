If, however, the German night fighters could dri between the tactics which Bomber Command had to purs to protect itself and those necessary to make its attacks eff the outcome was likely to be quite different. The most element of the Battle of Berlin was that the latter situatio be materialising. The tactics of concentrated saturation, to the destruction of the targets and especially of Berlin it as had previously been the case, of offering the bombers security now appeared to be presenting the German their best opportunities. This was due to the way in w man fighters were able to exploit the measures which I mand had to take in order to achieve its concentration Concentration on the route, which may be describe formation flying by dead reckoning, was dependent navigation and time keeping because, in the darkness were only occasionally visible to one another. The be only be achieved by radar navigation, and since Gee wa enemy territory, this meant the use of H2S by as mu force as possible and the provision of pyrotechnic ro the benefit of those not equipped with H2S. But these to concentration were also aids to interception. H could be picked up on German radar screens and Route markers could be seen by the German pilots British. The more that Bomber Command did to centration en route the easier it became for the Ger concentration, and the greater the concentration a likely it became that German fighters flying in i would be able to sight and engage individual bom Thus, while concentration had tended to conc bomber in the mass of the bomber stream and had reduced the
