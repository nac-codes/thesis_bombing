If, however, the German night fighters could drive a wedge between the tactics which Bomber Command had to pursue in order to protect itself and those necessary to make its attacks effective, then the outcome was likely to be quite different. The most disquieting element of the Battle of Berlin was that the latter situation seemed to be materialising. The tactics of concentrated saturation, so necessary to the destruction of the targets and especially of Be
