ng element of the Battle of Berlin was that the latter situation seemed to be materialising. The tactics of concentrated saturation, so necessary to the destruction of the targets and especially of Berlin itself, instead, as had previously been the case, of offering the bombers their greatest security now appeared to be presenting the German fighters with their best opportunities. This was due to the way in which the Ger- man fighters were able to exploit the measures which Bomber Com- mand had to take in order to achieve its concentration. Concentration on the route, which may be described as a kind of formation flying by dead reckoning, was dependent upon accurate navigation and time keeping because, in the darkness, the bombers were only occasionally visible to one another. The best results could only be achieved by radar navigation, and since Gee was jammed over enemy territory, this meant the use of H2S by as much of the main force as possible and the provision of pyrotechnic route markers for the benefit of those not equipped with H2S. But these and other aids to concentration were also aids to interception. H2S transmissions could be picked up on German radar screens and used for homing. Route markers could be seen by the German pilots as well as by the British. The more that Bomber Command did to improve its con- centration en route the easier it became for the Germans to find the concentration, and the greater the concentration achieved the more likely it became that German fighters flying in its neighbourhood would be able to sight and engage individual bombers in it. Thus, while concentration had tended to conceal the individual bomber in the mass of the bomber stream and had, therefore, greatly reduced the efficiency of the German night air defences in their radar search for individual targets, it had also presented those air defences with an increasingly well-defined collective target. The development of route concentration had, therefore, produced its
