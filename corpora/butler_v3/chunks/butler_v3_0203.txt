radar search for individual targets, it had also presented those air defences with an increasingly well-defined collective target. The development of route concentration had, therefore, produced its own nemesis, or rather the German night fighter force had created its own oppor- tunity, for it was, after all, the German night fighter force which had, in the first place, been mainly responsible for the Bomber Command policy of route concentration. A .C This German opportunity depended upon their ability to locate the Bomber Command concentration and, in turn, to concentrate their own forces in the most favourable position. After Window had largely dislocated the earlier system of linear defence and individual O 90 100  NEW OPERATIONAL SKILLS NEW OPERATIONAL FACTORS 128 ground-controlled interception, the most favourable point for general concentration and visual interception had appeared to be at the target itself. Not only was there sure to be a heavy concentration of bombers there, but fires and flares were likely to silhouette the air- craft and, therefore, to offer the fighters a greater prospect of visual contact with them. Moreover, the target had to be marked and, there- fore, disclosed before the attack began. When, therefore, the Germans introduced the 'running commentary' system of interception, which has already been described, the main task of the fighter controller was to detect the target in sufficient time to arrange for his fighters to meet Bomber Command at it.1 These tactics were, however, vulner- able to the Bomber Command counter-measures of 'spoof' marking, diversionary attacks and deceptive routing, which were liable to mis- lead the German controller as to the real destination of the main force. On several occasions Bomber Command did, in fact, succeed in passing a concentrated bomber stream to the target while the Ger- man fighters were being assembled at some quite different point. Nevertheless, these German tactics did effect the first real
