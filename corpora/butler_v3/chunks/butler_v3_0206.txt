to different targets and often not seeking deep penetrations. Thus, while the German fighter force still had the opportunity, which it often took, of inflicting very heavy casualties upon elements of Bomber Command, it was denied the chance of attacking the whole force. In consequence, the overall casualty rate in Bomber Command began to decline. Thus, the re- quirement of Overlord for the application of divided concentrations to many different targets saved Bomber Command from the full con- sequences of the new German night fighter tactics, while the success of the latter had, in any case, made the adoption of such a policy by Bomber Command virtually inevitable. This reduction of casualties was, however, by no means the only important consequence for Bomber Command which flowed from the Overlord requirements. As has been mentioned, most of the targets were relatively small, were situated in friendly territory and, there- fore, had to be attacked by the most precise methods. The Pathfinder Force had not developed such methods and its experience had been principally confined to the marking of area targets for the united main force concentration which followed. As will have been noticed, the Pathfinder Force technique of high-level radar-assisted target  NEW OPERATIONAL SKILLS 130 NEW OPERATIONAL FACTORS marking had not solved, nor even assisted in the solution of the much more precise marking problems with which 617 Squadron had for some time been concerned. Moreover, the Pathfinder Force, owing to its limited size and, when Oboe was used, owing to the limited num- ber of aircraft which could be operated at the same time, was seriously restricted in the number of simultaneous attacks which it could lead against different targets. Thus, the Pathfinder Force, which had measured its accuracy against the standards of area bombing and had related its scale of effort to the needs of the single concentration, was unsuited to the new requirements for really precise marking
