easured its accuracy against the standards of area bombing and had related its scale of effort to the needs of the single concentration, was unsuited to the new requirements for really precise marking and the use of divided concentrations. The result was that, for the first time since 1942, Bomber Com- mand had to make a radical revision of its methods of target marking. The solution, as Sir Arthur Harris would have had it in the first place, was found in the so-called main force groups themselves. Each group was encouraged to develop its own marking and bombing technique for the particular task which confronted it and, in consequence, a great tactical diversification grew up in Bomber Command.1 The predominance of the Pathfinder Force was much reduced and the standard operational technique of the main force groups developed into a series of specialised and often quite different techniques. This led not only to the solution of the problems raised by the requirements of Overlord but, by greatly increasing the operational ability and versatility of Bomber Command, it also changed the prospects of the strategic air offensive at night. The exacting demands of the Overlord air plan formed the school of experience in which Bomber Command developed its capacity for the wonderful feats of air power which characterised its performance in the final air offensive. In this process the techniques of night bombing in some respects outstripped those which had been developed in daylight, and there were to be many occasions when the former was not only more destruc- tive, but also more accurate, than the latter. Even so, the activities of the German night fighter force had seriously shaken confidence in the efficacy of the cover of darkness which more and more seemed to be a factor favouring the night fighter rather than, as hitherto, the night bomber. Moreover, this occurred at the very time when the efficacy of the cover of long-range fighters was being so convincingly demon- stra
