ent returned with the marks of fighter action upon them. In the period between July and December 1943 five per cent of these heavy bombers had been lost in action and nine per cent had been damaged by fighters.1 The danger from flak, so far from diminishing, had actually tended to increase, 2 so that the decline in the effectiveness of the German day fighter force may have been even greater than is suggested by these figures. This decline was not due to a reduction in the strength of the German day fighter force which was still expanding and was about to be expanded still faster. It occurred before the somewhat limited strategic effects of the 'Big Week' operations could make themselves felt. Nor was it due to any sudden loss of fuel supplies, for it occurred before the allied offensive against oil production had begun. Its operative cause was the great American victory in actual air combat and it was this which made the 'Big Week' battle one of the most decisive of the war in the air. This combat was provoked by the American heavy bombers which carried the threat of the bomb to the heart of Germany by reaching out to targets of deep penetration and leaving the German fighters with no alternative other than to defend them. But the combat was primarily fought and certainly won by long-range fighters of the Eighth Fighter Command under the determined leadership of General Kepner, who had long refused to believe that his fighters 1 Report by Eighth Air Force O.R.S., 12th Feb. 1944.
