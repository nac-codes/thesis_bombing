TORS could not eventually engage the enemy even over Berlin.1 This, in- deed, was what now came to pass. By February 1944 the escort radius of action of the P.47 Thunderbolt had been increased to 475 miles. That of the P.38 Lightning, which had been introduced in November 1943, had been extended to 520 miles and, in March 1944, when it was provided with two 108-gallon drop tanks, the P.51 Mustang was given an operational radius of action of no less than 850 miles. 2 Thereafter, these fighters could operate from their British bases up to the eastern limits of Germany and the factor of range allied with that of performance in an aircraft which could fly in the manner of an interceptor fighter for as far as a heavy bomber became the key to the decisive American victory which followed. Never again did the American bombers have to fly beyond the range of fighter cover as, for example, they had had to do on their Schweinfurt operations in 1943. No longer was there any point beyond which the German fighter force could rely upon finding an American bomber formation at a disadvantage. Moreover, as the number of long-range fighters was increased at a more than charac- teristically American rate and as the aggressiveness of their tactics was developed, there ceased to be any part of Germany in which fly- ing for operational, transport or training purposes could be under- taken with safety. The Luftwaffe had lost the security of its base in the daylight hours and the heart of Germany was at last exposed to the day bombing offensive. This, of course, did not lead to an absolute security for the Ameri- can bombers, for there never was such a thing as absolute air suprem- acy. Considerable numbers of German fighters remained in the air until nearly the end of the war, and there were occasions when they could achieve a local and temporary superiority. There were also occasions when they could still find American bombers unaccom- panied by friendly fighters. This was inevitable, if
