the bomber formations in a strictly escorting role. To an in- creasing extent, the role of the long-range fighters became that of seeking and destroying the enemy wherever he could be found. The immediate protection of individual bomber formations, though naturally always important, was of secondary importance. What was sought was the safeguarding of the bombers by general air supremacy and not merely by local air superiority. The American bomber formations did, of course, have to pay in casualties for this policy from time to time, but a more important con- sequence was that wherever the German fighters rose they were generally engaged by superior forces. Despite their continuing occasional and local successes, the German fighters, therefore, failed to inflict decisive damage upon the American bomber formations, their own casualties increased sharply and, aided by the harsh criticisms of their superiors, the morale of their pilots and their commanders in- evitably declined. In this way the command of the daylight air over Europe passed from the Germans to the Americans. The effect of this upon the whole course of the war both in the air and on the surface was fundamental and far-reaching but, as far as the Bomber Command offensive was concerned, the favourable con- sequences were not all entirely direct, nor were they by any means immediately felt. The new conditions did mean that the American heavy bombers could now develop their daylight offensive at a cost in casualties which was far lower than that of 1943 and which was also lower than that which Bomber Command continued to sustain at night. This was remarkable, but it did not mean that Bomber Com- mand could remedy its situation by an immediate switch from night to day operations. In most forms of war there is one law for the trained, the experienced and the properly equipped, and another for the untrained, the inexperienced and the ill-equipped. The art of high-level daylight formation flying was an advanced
