e achievement of day- light air superiority. Some of the great feats performed by Bomber Command in the later stages of the war, ranging from the destruction of the battleship Tirpitz to the devastation of certain oil plants and communications I35 targets, were the results of daylight actions. These, like practically the whole of the American offensive from Britain and Italy in the same period, were direct products of a fruitful exploitation of day light air superiority, but the latter also had a bearing which was much less direct, though not less important, upon the issue of night air superiority. Two great factors in the collapse of the German night fighter force in the late summer of 1944 were the loss of territory in western Europe which contained forward bases and radar early warn- ing installations, and the reduction of fuel supply which followed from the air attacks on oil production and particularly aviation petrol. This collapse, which was both abrupt and irretrievable, did not offer Bomber Command absolute security at night, but it did enable the force, at a very low cost in casualties, to translate the techniques which had been developed in France and to apply them to the des- truction of Germany herself. Thus, the heart of Germany was exposed to a night offensive which was no less accurate and far more destruc- tive than the contemporary daylight offensive. A fundamental con- dition of the night offensive was, therefore, changed primarily by the advance of the allied armies to the Rhine and by the initial effects of the strategic air attacks upon oil plants. But without daylight air superiority the allied armies would hardly have got ashore, or at any rate remained ashore, in Normandy in June 1944, and without day- light air superiority Bomber Command would have been virtually alone in the oil campaign. It is, indeed, difficult to see how night air superiority could ever have been gained if day air superiority had not first been achieved. To this extent,
