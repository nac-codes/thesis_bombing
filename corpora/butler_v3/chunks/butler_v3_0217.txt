day fighter force had little direct and no immediate effect upon the night fighter force other than, perhaps, to involve it to some indeterminate extent in the general decline of Luftwaffe morale. Nor did the method of victory in the daylight struggle even provide a useful precept for the solution of the problem at night. Indeed, the German night fighter force was never engaged in decisive combat by allied fighters, and the somewhat meagre efforts of the long-range night fighters of Fighter Command and 100 Group, the special counter-measures formation, were rewarded with an even more meagre result. Moreover, the collapse of the day and night arms of the German fighter force occurred not only in substan- tially different ways but also at substantially different times. Though it is difficult to date precisely the achievement of day air superiority, it can now be seen that the battle had swung decisively in favour of the Americans by the beginning of April 1944.1 The coming of night air superiority was somewhat more abrupt and it is clear that the German night fighters ceased to operate as an efficient force in August 1944. Between these two events, it will be noticed, there was an interval of fully three months during which the day fighter force was contained more or less constantly in a condition of virtual neutralisation, but during which the night fighter force continued to operate with formidable and even increasing efficiency. This shows the extent to which the connection between the two events was non- immediate and indirect. This fact was, however, to some extent obscured by the general and constant decline in Bomber Command casualties which occurred over the period between January, when the missing rate was about five and a half per cent of the despatched sorties, and June 1944, when it amounted to little more than two per cent. This apparently satisfactory trend was, however, primarily due not to a decline in the German night fighter force, but to the dispers
