and June 1944, when it amounted to little more than two per cent. This apparently satisfactory trend was, however, primarily due not to a decline in the German night fighter force, but to the dispersal of the Bomber Com- mand concentration and to the fact that, in the later months, the majority of the operations involved only shallow penetrations of French territory. To the perceptive mind, it tended only to conceal continuing and even growing dangers. The Bomber Command effort would not always be mainly confined to divided attacks upon French targets. In the attacks on Germany greater concentrations and greater penetrations would be required. Moreover, even when Bomber Command's activities were mainly 1 This was not nearly so evident at the time since air superiority by combat is something which can only be gauged by looking at the general conditions over an extended period. In rather the same way it was not entirely evident to Fighter Command that the Battle of Britain had been won in the middle of September 1940. 137 directed at what were sometimes thought to be easy targets and when the effort was divided between seven or eight different localities on the same night, the German night fighters secured some remarkable successes. In May 1944, for example, when the overall loss rate of Bomber Command was less than three per cent of the despatched sorties, the German night fighters were presented with singularly un- promising conditions. Apart from the independent Mosquito opera- tions, there were only five attacks on German targets during the month and on none of these was the size of the concentration com- parable with the normal standards of a few months earlier.1 In addition, on every night that it operated, Bomber Command dis- persed its effort over several widely separated areas and there was never any massive concentration at one place at one time. Owing to its restricted size, it was, therefore, never possible for the German night fighter force to engage vir
