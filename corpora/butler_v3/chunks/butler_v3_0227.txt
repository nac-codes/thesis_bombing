ms of bombing policy, which have already been considered, this opportunity was neither fully nor immediately exploited, but it certainly was not lost. By far the greater part of the damage done to the German war machine by Bomber Command in the entire war was done in the period between July 1944 and April 1945 and, in combination with the great achievements of the United States Strategic Air Forces, this ulti- mately proved to be one of the decisive elements in the allied victory of May 1945. Such, in outline, were the principal processes and the connections between them which changed the conditions of the strategic air offensive and produced, from apparent defeat, its eventual triumph. 2. Overlord and the strategic air offensive. The development of precision bombing at night April-June 1944 In March 1944, as will have been seen in an earlier chapter, Bomber Command continued, as it had been since March 1943, to be mainly committed to the strategic offensive against Germany. The bulk of its operations, sometimes for general and sometimes for selective pur- poses, were directed against city centres and most of them were area attacks focused by the high-level radar-assisted marking of the Path- finder Force. But while the Battle of Berlin was thus drawing to a close the date for the launching of Overlord was also drawing near. Active discussion of the part which Bomber Command should play in the phase of immediate preparation for this great undertaking and of the system of command by which its effort should be directed had, as will be recalled, been proceeding for some time and, as will also be remembered, had resulted in a series of important decisions at the end of March. Bomber Command was to be placed under the 'direc- tion' of the Supreme Allied Commander, General Eisenhower, and its principal though not, of course, its only object was to be the dis- location of railways in north-western Europe and especially in northern France. These decisions were not formally
