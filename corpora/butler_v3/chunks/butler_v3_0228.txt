senhower, and its principal though not, of course, its only object was to be the dis- location of railways in north-western Europe and especially in northern France. These decisions were not formally put into effect until the middle of April, but before that and, indeed, before final agreement had been reached about them, Bomber Command began, on a limited and experimental scale, to carry them out. In March, attacks were made on the marshalling yards at Trappes, Le Mans, Amiens, Laon, Aulnoye, Courtrai and Vaires, and these marked the beginning of what may conveniently be called the Overlord air diversion. This rail- way campaign soon mounted to formidable proportions and in the three months between the beginning of April and the end of June 1944, Bomber Command carried out no fewer than one hundred separate operations, involving the despatch of twelve thousand nine hundred and forty-nine sorties in its pursuit.1 A few of the targets were in Germany, but the vast majority lay in France and Belgium. Nor was this the only or even the greatest cause of diversion from German targets. An even greater effort was devoted to flying-bomb launching sites, coastal batteries, signals depots, ammunition dumps, military camps and similar targets outside Germany. At times the diversion became almost total and the proportion of bomb ton- nage dropped by Bomber Command on German territory declined 1 Bomber Command Quarterly Review, April-June 1944. 14I  NEW OPERATIONAL SKILLS 142 PRECISION BOMBING AT NIGHT from forty per cent in April to eight per cent in June. Over the three months as a whole it amounted to little more than seventeen per cent.1 In the eyes of the army commanders much of this diverted effort was strategic. The armies did not come into contact until 6th June and it was, therefore, not until then that any strictly tactical air operations could occur. The aim of the railway campaign up to that time was to damage the German lines of communication to such an extent that
