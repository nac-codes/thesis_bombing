tive of defences, namely, night fighters. Being so small, they did not in- dividually require the great bomber concentrations which had proved so vulnerable in the later stages of the Battle of Berlin. On the contrary, they afforded Bomber Command an unprecedented oppor- tunity for dividing its force and thereby confusing the defending night fighters and denying them a well-defined collective target.2 Again, because they were so small, these targets stimulated a drama- 1 Bomber Command Quarterly Review, April-June 1944. 2 It will have been noticed that in the hundred operations against railway targets between Ist April and 30th June 1944, 12,949 sorties were despatched. This meant that the average strength of each despatched force was 129 bombers. In the nineteen major attacks on Berlin between the beginning of November 1943 and the end of March 1944, some 11,113 sorties were despatched, which meant that in this case the average strength of each despatched force was 585 bombers. 143 tic development in the technique of precision bombing at night not only by specialised elements of the force but by all Bomber Com- mand. The consequences of this, as far as the strategic air offensive was concerned, began to emerge soon after the invasion in June when Bomber Command embarked upon the destruction by night of Ger- man synthetic oil plants. Thus, the participation of Bomber Com- mand in the Overlord air diversion not only made an important and, perhaps, even an indispensable contribution to the success of the in- vasion, but it also tended to restrict the opportunities of the German night fighter force and to develop the precision techniques of Bomber Command. Nevertheless, the difficulties imposed upon the German night. fighter force by the nature of the Bomber Command contribution to this air diversion were not necessarily permanent. Indeed, as was mentioned in the previous section, the German fighters, as they had so often done before, soon began to adapt their tactics
