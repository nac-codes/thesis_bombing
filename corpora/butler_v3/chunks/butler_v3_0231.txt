bution to this air diversion were not necessarily permanent. Indeed, as was mentioned in the previous section, the German fighters, as they had so often done before, soon began to adapt their tactics to the new situation and presently to score impressive successes even against small-scale attacks of shallow penetration. Still less was it likely that, when Bomber Command returned in force to Germany, the night fighters would be unable to regain the kind of superiority which they had enjoyed in the early months of 1944. Nor did the fact that Bomber Command had in April, May and June so successfully met the challenge of precision bombing against lightly defended targets of slight penetration in occupied territory necessarily or even prob- ably mean that the same challenge could be met against much more heavily defended and more distant targets in Germany. Precision bombing after all, other things being equal, was more dangerous than area bombing, because it tended to involve longer periods over the target and because it often had to be carried out from lower alti- tudes and on clearer and lighter nights than were necessary for area bombing. It was also more difficult to achieve at long than at short range because of the cumulative effect of navigational errors, the opportunities for German radar jamming and the limited distance to which some kinds of radar such as Oboe and G-H could reach. Thus, while the strategic air offensive against Germany suffered a set-back as a result of the breathing space which was afforded to the German homeland by the preoccupation of Bomber Command in the Over- lord air diversion, it was likely to gain from the tactical and opera- tional developments which were produced or stimulated by that diversion only in so far as these developments could be applied to the conditions prevailing over Germany itself. As far as the neutralisa- tion of the German night fighter force and the application of precision techniques were concerned, the prospects
