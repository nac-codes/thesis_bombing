be applied to the conditions prevailing over Germany itself. As far as the neutralisa- tion of the German night fighter force and the application of precision techniques were concerned, the prospects, as was shown by the relatively inaccurate and exceedingly expensive Bomber Command attacks on oil plants in the Ruhr during June, were by no means  NEW OPERATIONAL SKILLS 144 PRECISION BOMBING AT NIGHT promising. In only one of these four attacks did it appear that serious damage had been done to the target and even on that most of the bombs fell wide. 1 Moreover, the lowest missing rate was 5.8 per cent of the despatched force while the highest was no less than 27.8 per cent.Âª As will, however, duly be shown, Bomber Command did eventually succeed both to a much greater extent and at a very much lower cost in casualties in translating the precision technique of the auxiliary offensive over France into terms of the strategic offensive over Ger- many. But one of the principal factors and, as far as night bombing was concerned, perhaps, the decisive factor, in this achievement was the conquest of territory in western Europe by the allied armies. When they lost France, the Germans also lost the fundamental basis of their night fighter defence organisation. Bomber Command was afforded a secret entrance to Germany simply by the process of approaching over France at a low level. By the loss of its early warn- ing system, the German night fighter force suffered a crippling blow from which there was to be no recovery. But the advance of the allied armies towards the Rhine also enabled Bomber Command to ad- vance the sites of its radar ground transmitters whose reach into Germany was, therefore, greatly extended. This was to be an import- ant factor in the efficiency of precision attacks upon German targets. It also helped to increase the accuracy of area bombing. These bene- ficial consequences did not make their full impact until September, by which time the allied armies wer
