al scale, and it is considered that a total minimum of ten night fighter Mosquito squadrons should forthwith be placed at the disposal of 100 Group to satisfy this requirement.' He did not regard it as essential that all these squadrons should be equipped with Serrate. Fighters equipped with only A.I. were, he said, 'quite effective', and he meant to use the aircraft not only for night fighter support to the bombers but also in attacks on German night fighter bases. Sir Arthur Harris was, thus, insistent upon his minimum require- ment, but he was also realistic about the objections which would be raised to it. 'It may be urged', he said, that the night defence of Great Britain would be dangerously weakened by such a reinforce- ment of 100 Group. This argument he rejected in advance, on the grounds of the dwindling strength of the German bomber force. There would, he claimed, still be sufficient night fighters left in Air Defence of Great Britain to provide, in conjunction with the ground defences, for an adequate protection from night attack of the Overlord concentrations and, in case of need, this force could be supported by 100 Group. Another objection foreseen by Sir Arthur Harris was that many of the available Mosquitoes were equipped with Mark VIII A.I.1 and were, therefore, prohibited from operating over enemy territory in case the nature of the equipment was revealed to the Ger- mans. 'This again', Sir Arthur Harris said, 'is surely an entirely in- adequate ground for withholding protection from our bombers.' Finally, Sir Arthur Harris thought, it might be argued that a major decision of the kind which he was urging could not be made effective quickly enough to have a worthwhile effect. If this were so, he believed, 'we should compare very poorly with the American performance in providing their day bombers with long range fighter escort within a few weeks of the necessity for this step becoming apparent, though the difficulties which confronted them were far
