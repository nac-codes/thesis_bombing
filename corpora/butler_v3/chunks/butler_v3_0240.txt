n performance in providing their day bombers with long range fighter escort within a few weeks of the necessity for this step becoming apparent, though the difficulties which confronted them were far greater than those with which we are now faced.' 2 Thus, believing that Bomber Command could not, on account of 1 Presumably he meant Mark X A.I. 2 Letter Harris to Evill, 7th April 1944 149 its relatively low ceiling, exploit the day air superiority which had been gained by the Americans, Sir Arthur Harris now sought to gain the same kind of air superiority by the same kind of means at night. In this attempt, however, he was to be frustrated. A conference sum- moned at the Air Ministry by Sir Charles Portal on 20th April 1944 decided to transfer to 100 Group, not ten night fighter squadrons, but three.1 All these had to undergo retraining and a considerable measure of re-equipment. Their efforts undoubtedly caused some disturbance to the German night fighter force and, perhaps, to some extent, deterred the German crews from using their own radar equip- ment which was liable to reveal their position to the 100 Group squadrons. But the total claims of all the 100 Group fighter squadrons over the whole period between December 1943 and April 1945, a period of seventeen months, amounted only to the destruction of 257 enemy aircraft and the probable destruction of a further twelve.2 This relative failure was not due purely or even mainly to lack of strength in the 100 Group long-range fighter arm. Indeed, in one respect, greater strength would have caused greater difficulties. As it was, much time and effort was wasted in the pursuit of what proved eventually to be friendly fighter aircraft. The main problem was that of interception. The always limited efficiency of Serrate declined even further as time went on. The average number of contacts obtained with this equipment per sortie completed declined from 1Â·1 in May 1944 to 0.005 in September and the number of A.I. contacts
