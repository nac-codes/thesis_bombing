ined even further as time went on. The average number of contacts obtained with this equipment per sortie completed declined from 1Â·1 in May 1944 to 0.005 in September and the number of A.I. contacts needed to result in one successful combat increased from an average of nine in May 1944 to sixty in September.3 The reasons for these set-backs were that the German pilots became more wary, that interference with the Mark IV A.I. increased and more and more German fighters were equipped with a new kind of A.I. which did not register on Serrate. Low-level offensive fighter patrols carried out by aircraft without radar interception devices were even less successful. In June 1944, for example, some 138 of these sorties resulted in the claim of only one enemy aircraft being destroyed.4 Nor did the in- creasing introduction of the Mark X and later the Mark XV A.I. make any substantial difference. No effective means was ever found of engaging the German night fighter force in direct combat and it was certainly not to direct combat that its ultimate collapse was due.

On the other hand. the belief, which he expressed at the beginning of April to the effect that Bomber Command could expect little protection from
