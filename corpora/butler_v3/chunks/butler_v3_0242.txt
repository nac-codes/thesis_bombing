and that it was, therefore, somewhat over-optimistic. On the other hand. the belief, which he expressed at the beginning of April to the effect that Bomber Command could expect little protection from further 'tactical innovations', was, perhaps, especially if these were taken to include radio counter-measures, somewhat over-pessimistic. Indeed, the recently formed Bomber Command Tactical Planning Committee had already proposed a number of innovations by which it was hoped to increase the problems of the German night fighters. These included the division of the bomber stream by splitting the force, the dispersing of the altitude at which it flew and the employ- ment of a greater diversionary effort.1 Such measures were in the nature of palliatives rather than solutions, but in combination with the developing campaign of radio counter-measures, they did eventu- ally have some effect upon the efficiency of the German night fighter force. Radio counter-measures, as has already been seen, were now prin- cipally the responsibility of 100 Group, and throughout this period 192 Squadron carried out airborne investigations to determine the radio tactics of the opposing air force. In addition, six Flying Fort- resses of 214 Squadron operated with a device known as airborne Cigar which was designed to disrupt the radio-telephone communica- tions between the German night fighter controllers and pilots. This, however, was merely the prelude to a much more intense and com- plex campaign of radio counter-measures which was necessarily delayed by the time required to equip and train squadrons in 100 Group and voluntarily by the desire to spring some puzzling sur- prises upon the Germans at the time of the Normandy invasion. Thus, the Mandrel screen, which was produced by 199 Squadron Stirlings and Flying Fortresses of the 803rd Squadron, United States Strategic Air Forces, did not make its initial appearance until the night of 5th June 1944 when it was used to mask the approach of
