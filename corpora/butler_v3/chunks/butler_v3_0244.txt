the greater accuracy which might be expected, was, however, losing much of its force. This was due to the remarkable advances in the techniques of night precision bombing which took place between March and June 1944. The Bomber Command railway campaign in preparation for Over- lord began, as has already been mentioned, on the night of 6th March 1944 when the marshalling yards at Trappes were the target. This was the first of fourteen operations against eleven similar targets which were carried out between then and the night of 10th April.2 They involved the despatch of some 2,513 heavy bomber sorties, nearly three-quarters of which were flown by Halifaxes of 4 and 6 Groups. On each occasion the target marking was laid down blindly by Oboe Mosquitoes of the Pathfinder Force.3 The only variation of these tactics was in the last attack on the night of 10th April when two master bombers visually assessed the green target indicators which had been dropped by the Pathfinders on the marshalling yards at Aulnoye and then dropped their own red target indicators as the aiming point for the main force. This somewhat more ambitious modification of blind Oboe marking, known as controlled Oboe, intro- duced the altogether more complex and also more accurate methods which followed in the second phase of the campaign. Though Bomber Command had little previous experience of these types of operation, the plan had been scientifically prepared with the object of bringing the right amount of force to bear upon the right points. In consultation with railway experts and 'other interested parties' the various aiming points had been carefully selected in the marshalling yards and the necessary densities of attack in terms of hits by five-hundred-pound medium-charge bombs per acre had been calculated. To these factors Bomber Command then had to apply its expectation of the marking and bombing error and of the abortive sortie rate in order to determine the required scale of attack. An allowa
