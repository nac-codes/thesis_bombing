y the main force bomb-aimers but to a much higher proportion of gross errors by the Oboe Mosquito markers than had been expected. 2 This, indeed, despite the considerable and remarkable success achieved, 3 was the principal and the most obvious respect in which the tactics of the campaign were defective. It suggested the import- ance of developing yet more accurate and reliable target marking techniques and, at least, as was done in the Aulnoye operation, of imposing a visual correction to blind radar marking. Thus, though not, of course, to the same extent, the problem facing the main force of Bomber Command was substantially the same as that which for 1 The actual bomb loads in the fifteen operations were composed as follows: 1,000 lb. 500 1b. M.C. . G.P. Total . 44.9% 55.1% 38.9% 53.8% 6.0% 1.3% In one attack twenty-three 2,000-lb. bombs had to be carried owing to a temporary supply difficulty. For the purpose of these attacks the value of a 1,000-lb. bomb was assessed at one and a half that of a 500-lb. bomb. The reason for the inclusion of 1,000-lb. bombs was that an all 500-lb. bomb load was uneconomic in Lancasters and Halifaxes. Unlike Stirlings, which could economically carry maximum loads of 500-lb. bombs, these aircraft were underloaded when armed exclusively with 500-lb. bombs. The normal load of a Halifax (without H2S) on these operations was nine 1,000-lb. and six 500-lb. bombs. If the 1,000-lb. bombs had been omitted, only fifteen 500-lb. bombs could have been lifted. 2 O.R.S.(B.C.) Report, 15th June 1944. Individual reports on each of the fifteen operations had been produced earlier by the O.R.S. 3 Five of the marshalling yards, those at Trappes, Le Mans, Amiens, Vaires, and Lille, were, in fact, estimated to have been destroyed to the required extent. 153 some time had confronted 617 Squadron. Fundamentally it was a problem of target marking and not of bomb aiming, and the great advances of April and May in overcoming it were founded upon the experi
