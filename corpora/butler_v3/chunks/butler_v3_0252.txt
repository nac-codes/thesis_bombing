Either by having them cancelled or by warning the bombing force verbally of their position.  NEW OPERATIONAL SKILLS PRECISION BOMBING AT NIGHT 156 out the marking, backing up and wind finding, as also upon those hard-pressed men who made the complicated mathematical calcu- lations under somewhat inconvenient circumstances. Above all, or to be more accurate, under all, the presence of Wing Commander Cheshire over any target was rightly recognised by all 5 Group to be a factor of incalculable advantage. Not the least remarkable feature of this officer's service in the war was that he lived to see the end of it. Another consideration of undoubted importance was the relatively low level from which the 5 Group bombing attacks were delivered. The average bombing height in these operations was, in fact, 7,500 feet, which compared with an average of 12,300 feet for the Oboe- controlled attacks.1 Nevertheless, the 5 Group technique which was responsible for such brilliant feats as the attacks on the marshalling yards at Tours, Juvissy,ª La Chapelle, and elsewhere as well as upon the Kjeller air- frame factory at Oslo, the explosives works at St. Médard-en-Jalles near Bordeaux and many other targets suffered from the defects of its own qualities. Apart from the use of Oboe Mosquitoes of the Path- finder Force for proximity marking, the whole of each operation turned first upon the visual identification and marking of the target, and, secondly, upon a clear view of the markers from the bombing aircraft. This meant that the operations were at the mercy of the weather. They could not be carried out in poor visibility or when there was much low or medium cloud. Moreover, by its very nature, the technique involved rather lengthy periods in the target area for some aircraft and, when difficulties arose, sometimes for the whole force. This was liable to be more than usually dangerous, especially as the German fighter defences over France grew stronger and more efficient. The very h
