against major German targets, and though Lancasters from I Group con- tributed on each occasion to the bombing forces, these were real and severe tests of the extent to which the 5 Group precision technique might be translated into the sphere of the strategic air offensive against Germany. The three attacks took place on the nights of 22nd, 24th and 26th April and the targets were the centres of Brunswick, Munich and Schweinfurt. On each occasion the plan was for Mosquito crews from 5 Group to dive-mark the aiming point with red spot fires after a visual identification of the target in the light of flares. If this proved to be impracticable, 5 Group Lancasters were to lay down sky mark- ing on the indication of H2S. The bombing was to be controlled by the master bomber by means of radio telephone. In the Brunswick operation the dive-marking, some of which was delivered from as low as one thousand feet, appears to have been successful and it was well backed up by Lancasters from higher levels. Unfortunately, however, in addition to these ground markers, a number of sky markers were dropped wide and to the south of the target. These were, no doubt, thought necessary as there was a good deal of haze and thin cloud over Brunswick, but they attracted about forty per cent of the bomb- ing effort. Owing to bad radio conditions many crews failed to re- ceive Wing Commander Cheshire's instructions to ignore these sky markers. Nevertheless, heavy damage was done in Brunswick. The Munich operation two nights later was much more successful. The four 617 Squadron Mosquitoes flown by Wing Commander Cheshire, Squadron Leader D. J. Shannon, Flight Lieutenant G. E. Fawke and Flight Lieutenant R. S. D. Kearns dived through intense flak and searchlight dazzle to lay their red spot fires. Wing Com- mander Cheshire estimated that these were within a hundred yards of the aiming point, and they set in motion what appeared at the time, and was later confirmed by photographic reconnaissanc
