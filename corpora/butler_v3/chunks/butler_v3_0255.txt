Wing Com- mander Cheshire estimated that these were within a hundred yards of the aiming point, and they set in motion what appeared at the time, and was later confirmed by photographic reconnaissance, to be a devastating attack of great accuracy. All the low-level Mosquitoes returned safely, though not without difficulty from their extraordin- ary adventure and thereby demonstrated that a really well-defended target could be visually dive-marked from between two and four thousand feet under reasonable weather conditions.1 The third operation, against Schweinfurt on the night of 26th April, did not achieve the same degree of success, though the ball- bearings plants and marshalling yards in this difficult and contro- versial target were hit. The arrival of the flare force and the bombing 1 Wing Commander Cheshire's feat over Munich on this occasion was prominently mentioned in his subsequent citation for the award of the Victoria Cross.  NEW OPERATIONAL SKILLS 158 PRECISION BOMBING AT NIGHT force was delayed by an unexpectedly strong headwind which sprang up on the outward journey. The initial red spot fires, not on this occasion dropped by 617 Squadron, were somewhat wide of the mark and the backing up crept even farther from the aiming point. The valiant efforts of the master bomber to concentrate the attack some- what beyond the markers were only partly successful and the bombing force, which by that time was being severely harassed by German night fighters, found itself in considerable difficulties. Twenty-one of the air- craft, representing 9Â·3 per cent of the despatched force, did not return.1 These three operations, and especially that against Munich, were certainly remarkable, and in many respects they provided a convinc- ing vindication of the 5 Group technique which by some had been regarded as wholly unsuitable for major German targets. All the same, they represented a refinement of area bombing rather than an introduction of precision attack. In their a
