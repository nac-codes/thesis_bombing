These statistics were derived from the analysis of twenty-nine operations, fifteen of which were by blind Oboe, five by Musical Newhaven, six by controlled Oboe and three by the 5 Group technique. 159 Thus, the gloomy forecasts made by the Commander-in-Chief before the campaign began about the inability of Bomber Command to hit small targets at night as well as the fears, so vigorously shared by the Prime Minister, that large numbers of French civilians would be killed in the attempt by misplaced bombs, were now shown to have been largely without foundation. Operationally, the Overlord air plan and the determination of the Air Staff that Bomber Command should take part in it, had been vindicated, and now, as will have been seen in the previous chapter, powerful opinions in the Air Staff believed that the same kind, if not quite the same degree, of night precision bombing should be applied to the strategic offensive against Germany and particularly to the attack upon oil production which had already been initiated by the United States Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces in daylight. The wisdom, or otherwise, of this view depended upon whether something like the standard of bombing accuracy which had been achieved over France could be maintained over Germany and whether this could be done without a prohibitive rise in Bomber Command casualties. The experience of 5 and I Groups over Brunswick, Munich and Schweinfurt in April, though by no means discouraging, was limited and inconclusive. In the four oil attacks of June 1944, Bomber Command was, therefore, venturing upon yet another of the great experiments which had recently filled its history. As far as casualties were concerned, these four oil attacks were, as will already have been seen, little short of disastrous. From the 832 heavy
