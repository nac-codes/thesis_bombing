t three minutes of the attack, the bombing appeared to be accurate and concentrated, but after that smoke began to drift across the target, obscuring the marking, and the usual pronounced creep back of bombing began to assert itself. Night photographs suggested that, though two hundred Lancasters had got their bombs within three miles of the aiming point, only fifteen of them had actually hit the oil plant, but subsequent daylight photographic reconnaissance showed that a much better result than this had been achieved. It clearly showed that, in fact, the whole plant had been heavily damaged. Nearly all its vital elements were seen to be affected, especially the injection houses, the generating plants, the turbine house, the hydrogenation stalls, a gas generating plant and a paste preparation plant. In addition, many oil storage tanks appeared to have been destroyed, all the thirteen cooling towers were damaged and railway lines and wagons within the plant were widely dislocated.1 The Pathfinder Force Oboe ground marking tech- nique had, in fact, resulted in a remarkably precise attack upon a target which, though not as heavily defended as expected, was covered by a formidable flak barrage. On the same night Bomber Command was over Amiens, Caen, Poitiers, Arras, Cambrai and a second target at Amiens, and con- fusion caused by all these operations somewhat delayed the German fighter reaction to that against Gelsenkirchen. For that reason bombers taking part in it were not intercepted until they had almost reached the Zuider Zee on their return journey. Nevertheless, at least eleven Lancasters were shot down by fighters at and after that point and altogether seventeen of them failed to return.2 The same tactics were used for the second attack on the night of 16th June. This time the target was the oil plant at Sterkrade. Sixteen Mosquitoes and six Lancasters of the Pathfinder Force were des- patched to do the marking and backing up and they were followed by 162 Halifa
