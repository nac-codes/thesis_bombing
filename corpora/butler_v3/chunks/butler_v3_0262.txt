port. On this operation the airborne Mandrel screen was used in support of Bomber Command for the first time.  NEW OPERATIONAL SKILLS 162 returned after combats with fighters so badly damaged that they had to be scrapped. The missing rate in the Wesseling operation was 27.8 per cent of the despatched sorties. 1 On the evidence of these four operations against oil plants the prospects of precision bombing in Germany at night seemed bleak. Only one of the attacks had apparently achieved significant damage and very heavy casualties, which in the last case had become pro- hibitive, had been the result. Moreover, if the weather, which had had such a bad effect upon the accuracy of the attacks, had been better, there was little reason to believe that the casualties might not have been even more severe. On the other hand, there was equally little reason to suppose that the casualties would have been lighter in these cases if the operations had been area and not precision attacks. All the losses had been borne by the bombing forces. None had been suffered by the markers either of the Pathfinder Force or of 5 Group. But the bombing forces had operated at normal area attack altitudes of about twenty thousand feet and there had been no undue delays in the target areas. Moreover, on the two last and most expensive operations, though the visibility above the cloud had been dan- gerously good, there was no moonlight. The high casualties suffered were, therefore, a commentary, not particularly upon the hazards of this kind of precision bombing, but upon the general hazards of any kind of night attack over any territory which was well covered by the German night fighter force. This, as Sir Charles Portal was soon to suggest to the Prime Minister, made a strong case for the adoption by Bomber Command of daylight tactics. 2 1 O.R.S. Nt. Raid Report. The weather forecast for this operation was wrong. It had been predicted that the Ruhr area would be clear of cloud all night. Actually
