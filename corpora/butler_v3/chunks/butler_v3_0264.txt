d's strategic operations against German targets. Nevertheless, the Overlord requirements as also those for the destruction of flying bomb sites and other similar small targets in occupied territory did still have an important ultimate bearing upon another aspect of the final strategic air offensive against Germany, and this was the development of daylight bombing. Rather as the preparatory phase of the Overlord air plan had, after March 1944, provided the occasion and the opportunity for the development of night precision bombing, so now, after June 1944, a somewhat similar occasion and opportunity was provided for the development of daylight bombing. In this section it is, therefore, intended to examine the way in which day bombing was resumed by Bomber Command and developed to such a point that towards the end of the period here reviewed, it had become a fundamental aspect of the Bomber Command contribution to the Combined Bomber Offensive. But at the same time new conditions in the night offensive were also being established and these, too, must be examined in this 163  NEW OPERATIONAL SKILLS 164 DAY ATTACK AND NEW NIGHT CONDITIONS 165 section, for it was due to them that Bomber Command succeeded in developing, on the basis of its somewhat adverse experience of the four oil attacks in June, a really formidable and diminishingly expensive precise element in the continuing night offensive as well as a vastly increased destructive potential in its area attacks. Daylight bombing had a bad reputation in Bomber Command especially when the employment of heavy aircraft was involved. The efforts of the past, which had been largely abandoned by the end of 1942, had resulted in little else than exceptionally heavy casualties and the grounds on which Sir Arthur Harris had in 1942 resisted Air Staff pressure to persevere with the development of the Lancaster as a day bomber still seemed to him to be firm and valid in the spring of 1944. 'Even the Lancaster', he wrote to the V
