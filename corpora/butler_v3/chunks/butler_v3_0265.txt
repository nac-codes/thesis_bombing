2 resisted Air Staff pressure to persevere with the development of the Lancaster as a day bomber still seemed to him to be firm and valid in the spring of 1944. 'Even the Lancaster', he wrote to the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff on 7th April, 'would be incapable of operating in formation above 18,000 or 19,000 feet', and at this height, the Commander-in-Chief thought, the effect of flak would be 'lethal'.1 The Air Staff, on the other hand, was inclined to believe that the 'general situation' might at any time make day bombing by heavy aircraft of Bomber Command 'both practicable and profitable. It is appreciated', Sir Arthur Harris was told on 18th April 1944, 'that under present conditions, by reason of their armament and limited ceiling, our existing types of heavy bombers, when flying in forma- tion are unsuitable for a full scale offensive against Germany. Never- theless,' the Air Staff letter continued, 'it should be possible for them, under cover of an adequate fighter escort, to penetrate to targets in the occupied countries and even into Western Germany. In the clear conditions required for visual bombing the flak risk would be appreciably higher than at night, but provided the targets selected are not too heavily defended by flak and the forces are carefully routed, losses due to this cause should not be unduly heavy.' 2 There were, as was explained in this letter, a number of important reasons to account for the Air Staff desire to resume daylight opera- tions. Bomber Command would be enabled to exploit any sudden deterioration of the German day fighter force and achieve successful attacks upon 'vital precise objectives'. The reinforcement of the American day offensive would, it was thought, do much 'to confuse and further reduce the efficiency of the enemy fighter defences.' Greater accuracy, it seemed, could be expected in daylight attacks upon small targets, 'particularly those of a tactical nature.' The potentialities of 617 Squadron and of the new Tallb
