the decisive hours of the war, had been singular and encour- aging. Moreover, the feebleness of the German day fighter force bore interesting comparison with the still severe and effective reaction of the night fighter force. These factors had led Sir Arthur Harris to expect that, at any rate against targets in occupied territory, opera- tions might be more cheaply executed in daylight than at night. Nor was the Commander-in-Chief disappointed in this expecta- tion. From the 2,716 daylight sorties, the bulk of which were flown by Lancasters and Halifaxes, despatched in June, only 0.4 per cent failed to return. From the 6,847 similar sorties despatched in July the missing rate again was only 0.4 per cent. Being of very short range, all these operations were covered by Fighter Command Spit- fires of 11 Group and being for the most part directed against relatively ill-defended targets no undue flak risks were encountered.1 These operations, to which many different squadrons in all the bomber groups contributed, did not involve the elaborate formation tactics which had been developed in the United States Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces. Most of them were undertaken, often at short notice, by ordinary squadrons whose crews had little training in and no operational experience of daylight bombing. Indeed, because of the vast training effort which would otherwise have been required, it was initially decided that no attempt should be made to carry out the operations in formation. Squadrons were merely instructed to keep reasonably close to each other so that the escorting Spitfires could provide cover for at least the bulk of the force. This naturally meant that, unlike the American crews, who dropped their bombs in the pattern of the formation on a signal from the leader, the Bomber Command crews each had to sight and aim individually at the target. For that reason, the aiming points were marked in much the same way as at night and the attacks were usually controlled, also
