The average bombing error produced by it in the Fromental, Wemaers and Mont Candon attacks was only 275 yards and in the first attack it was actually 150 yards. The average bombing error of the other aircraft in the formations amounted, however, to some 760 yards. This was a less accurate result than was being obtained from similar methods by Marauder crews of the United States Ninth Air Force, but the 3 Group crews were still lacking practice in daylight formation flying, and the Stirlings, flying near the limit of their altitude, were by no means easy to handle.1 Thus, on the evidence of the first few experiments, even though they were carried out by comparatively inexperienced crews in relatively inefficient aircraft, the G-H formation bombing technique was shown to be a most promising development in the tactics of daylight precision attack. Even so, it was less accurate, not only than some other methods of day bombing, but also than some night techniques. Indeed, on the evidence of an analysis of some 108 day- light and ninety-nine night precision attacks by various methods against targets in occupied territory carried out between March and September 1944, it appeared that the Oboe formation bombing tech- nique was the best of any method tried by day or night. Its closest rivals were, firstly, the 5 Group visual night technique, especially after the introduction of offset marking and, secondly, the daylight visual method. 2 Visual bombing, or bombing which depended upon visual mark- ing, whether by day or by night, was, however, dependent upon the weather, and if the target was covered by more than a very moderate thickness of cloud, it could not be carried out.3 For that reason, the 5 Group visual technique at night was not so much comparable a
