ollowed by mobile G-H transmitters, with the result that the area of Germany covered by them was greatly increased. In other ways, too, this land advance simplified the problems of the daylight offensive. Refuelling facilities in France became avail- able for the escorting fighters and the period of early warning for the German air defences was reduced, and, in the case of operations against the Ruhr, reduced virtually to nothing. The flying bomb sites, which had absorbed so much daylight effort, were captured and the German air force, already desperately short of petrol in consequence of the strategic attacks on oil plants, was thrown into some confusion by the need to withdraw to new bases. Thus, by these processes, the prospects of day bombing, which for some months had been favourable, were made more favourable. At the same time the prospects of the night offensive which so recently had looked so bleak, were, for much the same reasons, rendered equally favourable. In June, it will be remembered, Bomber Command had carried out only four major night attacks on German targets. All of them had been directed against oil plants in the Ruhr and very heavy casualties, amounting, as far as the heavy bombers were concerned, to eleven per cent of the despatched sorties, had been suffered, mostly as a result of the prompt and effective reaction of the German night fighter force, which had scored its successes in the face of the growing radio counter-measures campaign and the Bomber Command tactics of diversions, feints and divided concentrations. In the first half of July there were no major operations by Bomber Command against German targets, but in its second part a considerable effort was devoted to night attacks on the Ruhr oil plants at Wesseling, Scholven-Buer, Homberg, Bottrop and Wanne-Eickel as well as to massive area attacks on Kiel, Hamburg and Stuttgart, the last of which was bombed three times. These ten operations involved the despatch of 3,419 sorties seventy
