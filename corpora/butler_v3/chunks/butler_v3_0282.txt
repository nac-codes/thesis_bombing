re encouraging results, but there were still some extremely disagreeable aspects of the situation. While the effective and inexpensive operations against Wesseling and Scholven were taking place, another Bomber Command force, consisting of 110 Lancasters and five Mosquitoes from 5 Group, was being heavily and almost continuously engaged by German fighters all the way from Dieppe to the railway junction at Revigny in Belgium and back again. Twenty-four of these Lancasters, accounting for 21.8 per cent of the heavy bombers despatched, did not return. Many of the interceptions were made by single-engined fighters whose pilots were using free-lance 'cat's eye' tactics which, of course, were not subject to interference by Window. At this period, indeed, Bomber Command, owing to the activity of these 'cat's eye' fighters, suffered heavier losses over the general area of north-eastern France than over Germany itself. Nevertheless, few operations were as inexpensive as those against Wesseling and Scholven on the night of 18th July. Nor, as the month came to an end, did the situation seem to be improving. On the night of 28th July, 803 bombers were despatched to make area attacks on Hamburg and Stuttgart. Sixty- two of them did not return.1 The five oil attacks of July compared favourably with those of 1 O.R.S.(B.C.) Report and Nt. Raid Reports. The ten major operations against DAY ATTACK AND NEW NIGHT CONDITIONS 175 June not only in the lower casualties incurred but also in the better and more uniform results achieved. In the Wesseling operation the plan was to open the attack with sticks of illuminating flares dropped blindly on Gee or H2S. These were to be followed by proximity markers from Oboe Mosquitoes and, in turn, the aiming point was to be marked visually with mixed green and red target indicators. In each of these processes, the Pathfinder Force achieved an out- standing success despite the fact that the master bomber was only partially effective owing to a smoke
