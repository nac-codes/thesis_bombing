een and red target indicators. In each of these processes, the Pathfinder Force achieved an out- standing success despite the fact that the master bomber was only partially effective owing to a smoke screen which the Germans put up to the south of the plant. Both the marking and later the backing up was accurate and a well-concentrated attack was the result. Photographic reconnaissance duly showed that severe devasta- tion had been caused throughout the plant. The Scholven plant, which was marked by substantially similar means, was also badly damaged.1 In the attacks on Homberg and Bottrop the oil plants were blindly marked by Oboe Mosquitoes, but the attacks were, nevertheless, accurate and well concentrated, causing, as was shown by photo- graphic reconnaissance, severe damage to both installations. At Wanne-Eickel a considerable ground haze made visual identification of the target impossible, but the Oboe ground markers, though initially somewhat scattered, could be seen through the gloom. Once again photographic reconnaissance showed that heavy though, by comparison with the other attacks, rather less extensive damage had been done to the plant.2 German targets in July 1944 were as follows. The figures in brackets refer to Mosquitoes and are included in the totals.

The tables, therefore, omit all independent Mosquito attacks. 1 O.R.S.(B.C.) Nt. Raid Report. In the Wesseling attack nearly seven hundred tons of H.E. bombs, including fifty-two 4,000-lb. bombs, were dropped. In that on Scholven
