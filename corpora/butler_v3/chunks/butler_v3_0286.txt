Operations in September were admittedly mostly of short penetration, but there were twelve major night attacks on German targets which involved the despatch of 3, 188 sorties, including 132 by Mosquitoes, and one by a Lightning. From these operations, sixty-nine Lancasters and Halifaxes and three Mosquitoes, amounting to only 2.4 per cent of the despatched force, failed to return.2 The reasons for the decline of the German night fighter force were complex and manifold and not all of them were due to the events of the spring and summer of 1944. To some extent they must remain obscure until a definitive study of the Luftwaffe is undertaken. There were, nevertheless, in the summer of 1944, certain salient develop- ments which undoubtedly had a most important effect. These were 1 O.R.S.(B.C.) Report and Nt. Raid Reports.
