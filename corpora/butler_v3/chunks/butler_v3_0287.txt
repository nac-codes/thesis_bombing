NEW OPERATIONAL SKILLS 178 the loss of territory, the loss of fuel supplies and the development of radio counter-measures. The allied break out from the Normandy beach-head and subse- quent advance had, by the middle of August, engulfed the most westerly of the German night fighter bases in France. By the end of the month the Luftwaffe retained control of only a fraction of its aero- dromes and assembly points there. Already the position of those in Belgium and Holland was precarious. Precipitately, the German night fighter bases had to be withdrawn eastwards. At the same time the night fighter controllers lost their early warning installations on the Brest peninsula and along the Calvados coast. Bomber Command was presented with the opportunity of approaching a wide range of German targets at a low level over a great width of friendly territory. Its penetrations of enemy-held territory, therefore, became shorter and less heralded. These advantageous consequences of the allied advance towards the German frontier were further enhanced, especially in so far as the approach to north German targets across the neck of Denmark was concerned, by ingenious developments in the use of the airborne Mandrel screen, which, it will be recollected, was a means of jamming the German radar early warning reception. Behind the screen, the approach of a bomber concentration could be masked, but, on account of its limited size, the area in which the bombers were concentrating could hardly be concealed. Bomber Command, how- ever, devised a means of exploiting this apparent weakness. On nights when no operations of consequence were despatched the Mandrel screen was flown and other symptoms of Bomber Co
