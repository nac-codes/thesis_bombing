ted by a series of misfortunes. The master bomber was forced to return early by an electrical defect in his aircraft and both the deputy master bombers were shot down before they reached the target. The initial flares fell somewhat to the west of the target and in the absence of any directions it was impossible for the low-level Mosquitoes to drop their markers. The bombing force, therefore, had to aim visually or by radar. Thirteen crews preferred to join the simultaneous and much more successful attack on Rüsselsheim. Nineteen others bombed alternative targets. Only four or five crews got their bombs on to the target at Darm- stadt and about twenty-five more got them within three miles of it. The original force had consisted of 190 Lancasters and six Mosquitoes.1 + P Legend NORTH WESTERN AIMING POINT ........

Four nights later, on 29th August, the 5 Group attack on Königsberg provided an impressive demon- stration of the more general rule. In this operation considerable difficulties were encountered. The target lay at very long range and, therefore, called for a particularly high standard of navigation.2 A low approach across the North Sea behind the Mandrel screen concealed Bomber Command's intentions until the 5 Group Lancasters had crossed the Danish coast, but there was still a great distance to run before Königsberg was reached.
