ut- standing as this achievement was, it cannot really be compared to the feats which had more than a year earlier resulted in the breaching of the MÃ¶hne and Eder dams. There was, however, one notable respect in which the Dortmund-Ems Canal attack was more effective. When it was over, Bomber Command stood ready to destroy the banks again when the Germans had repaired them and this, in fact, was to be done, not once but several times. 2 Thus, by the autumn of 1944, Bomber Command had developed a paralysing power of attack which, in all but the most exceptional circumstances, could accurately be brought to bear by day and by night against targets large and small and near and far. Nor was there much that the German air defences could any longer do to disrupt or disperse the operations of Bomber Command. Strategic bombing, of course, still had its limitations. Some kinds of weather could defeat the most ingenious plans and the most advanced equipment and some targets proved to be substantially invulnerable even to the most powerful bombs. Nevertheless, Bomber Command in conjunction with the United States Strategic Air Forces now, for the first time in the war, had the operational capacity for decisive action and, in the remaining months of the strategic air offensive, that undoubtedly is what was achieved. 13.
