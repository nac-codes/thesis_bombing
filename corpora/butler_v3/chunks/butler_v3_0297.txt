Among the great victories achieved will be found most of the highlights of the whole offensive including the complete obliteration of a number of oil plants, the widespread destruction of communications, including the constant breaching of the Dortmund-Ems Canal, and the felling of the Bielefeld viaduct, the ultimate despatch keel upwards of the German battleship Tirpitz and the vast havoc of the continuing area offensive culminating in the devastation of Dresden.

Lord Tedder's observation which is recorded as the first motto for this chapter was afforded a particularly clear reinforcement in advance by Sir Arthur Harris.

Fourteen per cent of it was aimed at oil targ
