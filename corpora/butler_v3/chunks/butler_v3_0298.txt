ht thousand tons of the last three months in 1942.ª Fifty-three per cent of this enormous effort was devoted to area attacks upon large industrial cities. Fourteen per cent of it was aimed at oil targets, fifteen per cent at railways and canals and thirteen per cent at targets such as enemy troops and fortifi- cations which were directly associated with the land battle. The remaining five per cent was devoted to naval and other objectives.3 The area offensive was spread far and wide over Germany. In the Ruhr area sixteen towns were bombed, many of them several times. In south and south-west Germany eleven towns were bombed and in north and central Germany five more were attacked. The greatest effort was made against Duisburg, Essen, Cologne and Düsseldorf. In the case of Duisburg there were four major operations involving the despatch of some 3, 1 19 sorties and the dropping of nearly thirteen thousand tons of bombs. Within a period of twenty-four hours on 14th October over two thousand sorties were despatched in day and night attacks of roughly equal strength and nearly nine thousand tons of bombs were aimed at Duisburg. Essen was also bombed four times and over 11,500 tons of bombs were aimed at it. Cologne was bombed three times and nearly 9,500 tons of bombs were dropped. In a single attack on Düsseldorf involving the despatch of 992 sorties more than 4,400 tons of bombs were dropped. In smaller attacks on Bochum, Gelsenkirchen, Dortmund, Hagen, Witten, Oberhausen, Neuss, Solingen, Münster, Hamm, Duisburg and Leverkusen about another twenty-two thousand tons of bombs were dropped. Thus, in the last and utterly crushing Battle of the Ruhr between the beginning of October and the end of December 1944, some 14,254 sorties were despatched, 60,830 tons of bombs were dropped and only 136 bombers failed to return. This was a missing rate of less than one per cent of the despatched sorties.4 1 Marshal of the Royal Air Force The Lord Tedder: Air Power in War, p. 12, The
