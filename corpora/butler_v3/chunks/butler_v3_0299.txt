ped and only 136 bombers failed to return. This was a missing rate of less than one per cent of the despatched sorties.4 1 Marshal of the Royal Air Force The Lord Tedder: Air Power in War, p. 12, The Lees Knowles Lectures, Air Ministry Pamphlet 235 (1947).

A very high proportion of the bombs dropped were of the high-explosive and not as had pre- viously been the case of the incendiary varieties. In the great attacks on Duisburg, Essen, Cologne and Düsseldorf, for example, about eighty-five per cent cent of the total tonnage dropped consisted of high- explosive bombs. This, às Sir Arthur Harris has explained, was because much of the inflammable elements in these Ruhr towns had already been burnt in earlier incendiary attacks and with their devastated wildernesses they had become decreasingly profitable objectives for fire-raising attacks.1 It was this high proportion of high- explosive bombs which accounted for the scenes of almost incredible destruction in these towns. They, however, are more easily judged from photographs than from descriptions. Elsewhere in Germany the weight of the area offensive was brought to bear in the south and south-west on Ulm, Stuttgart, Karlsruhe, Heilbronn, Freiburg, Ludwigshafen, Saarbrücken, Nuremberg, Munich, Bonn and Coblenz. In north and central Germany attacks were made on Bremen, Wilhelmshaven, Brunswick, Osnabrück and Giessen. These operations were, however, on an altogether smaller scale than those against the Ruhr towns. The largest individual attack was against Stuttgart on the night of 19th October when a force of
