e night of 14th October against Duisburg and Brunswick, which involved the despatch of 1,245 sorties, seven bombers failed to return. From the daylight attack on Duisburg, involving the despatch of 1,063 bombers, fourteen failed to return. From the G-H operation against Bonn, on which 128 Lancasters were despatched, one failed to return. In all cases highly accurate and concentrated attacks were delivered. 1 The controversial oil plan was largely neglected by Bomber Com- mand in October, but a much increased effort was devoted to it in November and over the whole period of the last quarter of 1944, Bomber Command carried out twenty-seven heavy bomber attacks upon fifteen oil plants. Some 5,194 sorties were despatched on these operations, fifty-seven bombers failed to return and about 23,000 tons of bombs were aimed at the targets.2 Nineteen of the operations were carried out in daylight with fighter cover and, though the flak damage was often considerable, the Ger- man fighter force offered little or no resistance. The weather, how- ever, as was to be expected at the end of the year, was often bad, and, when, as in the attack on 9th November against Wanne-Eickel, a ground marking technique was used, the bombing tended to be scattered because cloud obscured the aiming point. Sky marking was not accurate enough for the precise bombing which was needed to hit an oil plant, and it was in these circumstances that the real value of the 3 Group G-H formation was demonstrated. 3 Group Lan- casters, forming in 'vics' of three and bombing on G-H, did, indeed, 1 O.R.S.(B.C.)
