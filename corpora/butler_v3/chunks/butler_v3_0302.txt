A spectacular example of this was provided by the 2 Group attack on 3 1st October when the target was the hydrogena- tion oil plant at Bottrop-Welheim. Though the target was completely covered by thick cloud, the 3 Group Lancasters executed an accu- . rate and concentrated attack from between 15,000 and 19,500 feet.1 Thus, Bomber Command was able to maintain an accurate and effective attack upon oil targets of short penetration even when the weather was quite unsuitable for visual bombing or ground marking.2 The eight heavy bomber attacks on oil plants at night, like all the day attacks, were mostly against targets in the Ruhr area. Also like the day attacks, they generally achieved a high degree of success at the cost of only a very low missing rate. There were, however, two op
