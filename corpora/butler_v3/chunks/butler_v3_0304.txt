the Eighth Air Force was more frequent than the photographic reconnaissance of them. It was, therefore, not possible to make reliable and detailed estimates of the results of individual attacks. This difficulty, at the time, caused some doubts about the priorities for attack and re-attack. It has to be remembered that though 3 Group could now bomb accurately through the overcast, the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit could not take pictures through it. Incidentally, 3 Group was at times the only element of allied air power which could operate in support of the armies during the bad weather at the time of the Ardennes counter-offensive.  NEW OPERATIONAL SKILLS 188 THE OPERATIONAL CLIMAX shown to have been hit when the photographic reconnaissance pic- ture was developed.1 In the chapter which follows, it will be seen how the Anglo- American bombing offensive against oil plants contributed to the ultimate downfall of Germany. In this joint offensive, the very heavy, and generally accurate, Bomber Command contribution was a vital and, perhaps, even a decisive element. But even these attacks, though they may have been the most important, were by no means the most spectacular which Bomber Command carried out in the last three months of 1944. The Dortmund-Ems Canal, it will be remembered, had been successfully breached by Bomber Command on the night of 23rd September 1944. But the Germans reacted to the disaster with some- thing like the same vigour which had characterised their repair work on the MÃ¶hne Dam after the 617 Squadron attack in May 1943. Their efforts in the autumn of 1944 were, however, to be less rewarding, though not less necessary. The Dortmund-Ems Canal is a somewhat misleading name, for the channel was more than merely a link between Dortmund and Emden. Through a junction with the Mittelland Canal near Rheine, it in fact carried a great part of the inland water traffic between the Ruhr and many other industrial towns. Thus, after the breach of 23rd Septem
