the Ruhr, which were recorded under the heading of industrial areas, substantial damage was sometimes done to benzol plants which, of course, belonged to the oil plan. In addition much other important industrial damage was done. Even more so was this the case with the communications plan. It was impossible to make an effective attack on any town area without doing damage to communications and very probably to railways. Similarly it was very difficult to attack a large railway centre without 1 Bomber Command Quarterly Review, Oct .- Dec. 1944, O.R.S.(B.C.) Nt.

This, indeed, as will be remembered, had been one of the objections to the French railway plan. But in France it had been intended to damage only the railways and not the towns. In Germany it was intended to devastate both, and, in fact, the forces carrying out the German communications campaign were generally given two aiming points when bombing railways. One was the railway centre and the other was the town centre. The devasta- tion of the town contributed to the difficulty of repairing the railways. It was only when the target was relatively isolated, as had been the case in the canal operations and was presently to be in that of the Bielefeld Viaduct, that 'pure' communications bombing could be recognised. The same considerations applied to most other target systems, but in no case more so than in that of communications bombing. It would, therefore, be entirely misleading to judge the Bomber Command effort against communications by the statistics recorded under that heading. N
