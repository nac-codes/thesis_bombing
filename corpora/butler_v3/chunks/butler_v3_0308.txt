e more so than in that of communications bombing. It would, therefore, be entirely misleading to judge the Bomber Command effort against communications by the statistics recorded under that heading. Naturally, however, a railway centre tended to suffer more heavily when it was an aiming point than when it was not. 5,00 2000 YARDS e R An impressive example of this was provided by the 5 Group attack on Giessen on the night of 6th December 1944. 255 Lancasters and ten Mosquitoes made a joint attack upon the railway centre and the town itself. In both cases the Newhaven marking was extremely accurate and the bombing was highly concentrated around the two aiming points.1 The railway centre, as can be seen in the photograph opposite page 183, was left in a parlous condition though not all the damage was due to this particular attack.2 Though this attack on Giessen was an outstanding success it was by no means an unusual one, either for 5 Group or for Pathfinder Force led operations. The results of two attacks against the railway centres at Bingen and Cologne-Nippes on the nights of 22nd and 24th December are typical examples of the extremely high degree of accuracy and con- centration which was now normally achieved by Bomber Command at night in the course of routine operations. On the first occasion a force of ninety Halifaxes from 4 Group was led into action by two Mosquitoes and fourteen Lancasters from the Pathfinder Force. In the Nippes operation eighty-one Lancasters from I Group were led by five Mosquitoes and sixteen Lancasters from the Pathfinder Force.
