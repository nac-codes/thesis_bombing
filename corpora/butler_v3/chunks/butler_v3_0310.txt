consisted almost exclusively of high explosives. Though both attacks were highly successful, the superi- ority of the Lancaster over the Halifax was graphically demonstrated by the fact that the seventy-eight I Group Lancasters which bombed Nippes railway centre dropped 483 tons of bombs whereas the eighty 4 Group Halifaxes which bombed Bingen dropped 272 tons of bombs.1 These operations against railway targets were not, however, con- fined to night action. 3 Group Lancasters, using the G-H formation technique, often from above continuous cloud, also made an im- portant and effective contribution. Among the many marshalling yards attacked in this way were those at Fulda, Duisburg, Osterfeld and Siegen.2 Undoubtedly, however, the most famous and in some respects the most remarkable daylight operation in this period was that which resulted in the destruction of the German battleship Tirpitz by a small force of Lancasters. Between three and half past three in the morning on 12th November 1944, thirty-one Lancasters of 617 and 9 Squadrons, armed with Tallboy bombs and accompanied by another Lancaster of 463 Squadron carrying a film camera, took off from Lossiemouth in Scotland. About seven hours later the 45,000 ton German battle- ship Tirpitz, already little more than a hulk, rolled over and dug her superstructure into the mud at the bottom of Troms√∂ fjord in Norway. The utter destruction of what had once been among the most powerful fighting ships in the world by two squadrons of heavy bombers was the climax of a long and controversial struggle between the aeroplane and the capital ship. 3 This was a struggle which had its origins in the daring exploits of General Mitchell long before the war and with which, for Bomber Command, the Second World War had inauspiciously begun at Wilhelmshaven. By November 1944, it embraced the calamitous American experience at Pearl Harbour, the British loss of the Prince of Wales and Repulse and, on the other hand, the long and trying
