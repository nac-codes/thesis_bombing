un at Wilhelmshaven. By November 1944, it embraced the calamitous American experience at Pearl Harbour, the British loss of the Prince of Wales and Repulse and, on the other hand, the long and trying attempts to dispose of the Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen. It also included a series of air attacks on the Tirpitz herself. Launched at Wilhemshaven on Ist April 1939, the Tirpitz as an actual fighting ship had been more an anxiety to the British than an asset to the Germans. By the time of her destruction she had, indeed, carried out only a single warlike operation and that had amounted to no more than a raid against the island of Spitzbergen in Sep- tember 1943 when the opposition was negligible and, incidentally, 1 O.R.S.(B.C.)

NEW OPERATIONAL SKILLS 192 THE OPERATIONAL CLIMAX the White Ensign was flown.1 Even so, the possibilities of this great, powerful and fast battleship were much greater than her actual achievements. She might have broken out into the Atlantic to prey upon convoys there or she might have fallen upon allied shipping making the already desperate passage to Russia. She was a fleet in being and by her very existence she demanded the presence in northern waters of at least one fast battleship and one Fleet carrier of the Royal Navy. Even with this counter there could be no assur- ance of bringing her to action either promptly or without grievous loss.Âª The naval and air action with the attendant loss of H.M.S. Hood which resulted in the destruction of the Bismarck, a sister of the Tirpitz, was enough to show the potential danger of the latter. Obviously then the existence of the Tirpitz was something which the British could not afford to ignore and it was something which the Prime Minister found it hard to tolerate. The problem was to
