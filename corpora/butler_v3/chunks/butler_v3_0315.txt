armed with a Tallboy bomb, and in the second there were six Lancasters each armed with a number of the much smaller so-called Johnny Walker anti-shipping bombs. The remaining Lancaster which came from 463 Squadron was there to film the proceedings. Seventeen of the bombing Lancasters, led by Wing Commander J. B. Tait, came from 617 Squadron and ten, led by Wing Commander J. M. Bazin, from 9 Squadron. The plan was for the Tallboy Lancasters to attack first in sections of five aircraft each disposed between 14,000 and 18,000 feet. The Johnny Walker aircraft were to attack from between 10,000 and 12,000 feet, but in order to achieve surprise, the force was to approach at less than 1,000 feet until the Finnish border was reached. At that point they were to climb to between two and six thousand feet above their bombing heights so that the final approach to the battleship could be made in a glide as fast as possible. Three aircraft from 9 Squadron were detailed as wind finders and were to fly slightly ahead of the rest until within sixty miles of the ship, when they were to fall behind the attacking force, which by that time would be increasing speed on the final approach. Everything went well, except that on the final approach the Tall- boy Lancasters found themselves considerably off track and had to make a drastic alteration of course. Nevertheless, there was little cloud over Alten fjord and the Tirpitz was taken by surprise. Wing Commander Bazin reported that the smoke screen began to appear at 12.55 (D.B.S.T.), but within the next minute at least five and perhaps six Tallboys had been dropped.1 The first one appears to have come from the 9 Squadron Lancaster flown by Flight Lieu- tenant J. D. Melrose and he later reported that he had seen five Tallboys fall between ship and boom. The smoke screen now thickened and no one could be sure of what was happening, but the attack went on with the flak bursts from the Tirpitz as the aiming point. Various crew reports sugges
