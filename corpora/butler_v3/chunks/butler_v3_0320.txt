ed in preventing the erosion of the dam by manipulating the water level. The Sorpe Dam was attacked with Tallboys by 9 Squadron, and several direct hits were achieved. The dam did not give way. 197 October, November and December 1944, in its three principal roles of prosecuting the strategic air offensive, contributing to the war at sea and supporting the armies in the field, Bomber Command dis- played practically the whole range of its now formidably versatile and immensely powerful striking force. Towns, oil plants, marshalling yards, dams, battleships and concrete emplacements were crumbling beneath a weight and concentration of bombardment unprecedented in the history of warfare. The question in 1945 was no longer what could be destroyed but what ought to be destroyed. In January 1945, the daily average of Bomber Command aircraft in the squadrons and immediately available with their crews for operations was 1,420. Of the aircraft available for operations, 1,305 were four-engined heavy bombers and 148 were Mosquitoes. By April 1945 the daily average of aircraft available with crews for operations had increased to 1,609. Of the aircraft available for operations, 1,440 were four-engined bombers and 203 were Mos- quitoes. Thus, in the three years of Sir Arthur Harris' command, the striking power of the force, expressed in this way, had increased by more than fourfold. In February 1942 the daily average of available operational aircraft with crews had been 374. In February 1945 it was 1,431.1 But in the same period, owing to the greatly improved quality of its aircraft, the available bomb lift of the Com- mand had increased by more than tenfold. In February 1942 it amounted to a daily average of 510 tons. In February 1945 it was 5,216 tons.2 In accuracy of attack the improvement was even more radical. For night attacks on German cities, excluding Berlin and in conditions of good and moderate weather, the percentages of aircraft which dropped their bombs within three
