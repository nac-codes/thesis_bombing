rovement was even more radical. For night attacks on German cities, excluding Berlin and in conditions of good and moderate weather, the percentages of aircraft which dropped their bombs within three miles of the aiming point, were, on the evidence of night photography, sixteen in October and November 1941 and ninety-six in October and November 1944.3 In 1945, between the beginning of the year and 8th May, Bomber Command dropped over 181,000 tons of bombs, which amounted to 1 Bomber Cmd. O.R.B. The April 1945 average was the highest ever achieved, but the number of operational aircraft for January 1945 was lower than the levels reached in October and November 1944 when the figures were: October, 1,348 four-engined bombers and 120 Mosquitoes; November, 1,346 four-engined bombers and 137 Mosquitoes. 2 Harris Despatch. These are theoretical figures based on the product of the available strength in numbers of aircraft and the average tonnage dropped in the month by the various types of bombers which claimed to have reached their targets. The figures are, therefore, influenced by the range of the attacks made and also by the kinds of bombs carried. Thus, in November 1944 when attacks were generally of short penetration and high-explosive loads were common, the daily average bomb lift amounted to 6,521 tons. This was the highest figure ever calculated. 3 Harris Despatch. In poor weather there was naturally little or no photographic evidence. The early figures are liable to a bias due to the fact that only a small proportion of the force carried cameras and these, the Despatch suggests, 'were usually carried by the best crews'. The first figure was based on the examination of ninety-two plotted photographs and the second on 2,399 plotted photographs.  NEW OPERATIONAL SKILLS 198 THE OPERATIONAL CLIMAX nearly a fifth of the aggregate for the whole war. In operations of all kinds during the same period Bomber Command despatched some 67,483 sorties from which only 608 aircraft
