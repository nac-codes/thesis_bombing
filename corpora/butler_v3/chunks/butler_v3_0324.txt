in the oil campaign was intensified in 1945 and throughout the period from January to April it was sustained and effective, to a greater extent than might be suggested by the fact that only twenty-six per cent of Bomber Command's destructive tonnage was devoted to it. It was, as had long since been understood, a fallacy to suppose that oil targets, because of their vulnerability, did not require heavy and destructive attacks, but when, as was now the case, these relatively small objectives could be accurately and consistently struck by Bomber Command at night or in daylight and even through ten-tenths cloud, adequate devastation could be caused by much smaller forces than those required to dis- rupt a whole city. What was important was that as many plants as possible should be devastated and that they should be attacked again whenever they showed signs of resuming production. In January, February, March and April 1945, Bomber Command carried out seventy-four operations against forty-nine oil targets, which involved the despatch of 12,588 sorties, from which 11,849 sorties resulted in 46,636 tons of bombs being aimed at the targets. Thirty-eight of these operations were carried out at night and thirty-six of them in day- light. Of the latter, twenty-eight attacks were made by the G-H technique in formations of about a hundred bombers on each occasion, and the majority of these, which were nearly all highly successful, were delivered from above ten-tenths cloud.
