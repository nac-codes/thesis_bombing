The night attacks were even more concentrated. On nine occasions two, and twice three, oil targets were attacked in a single night. On twenty-five of the forty-seven nights on which Bomber Command operated at all, oil targets were bombed. Thus, if by no means a maximum effort, the Bomber Command part in the oil campaign of 1945 was intensive and concentrated. It was also exceedingly destructive and, in combination with the even more frequent but somewhat lighter attacks of the United States Strategic Air Forces, it proved to be a great deal more than the already badly mauled oil industry could withstand.1 The eighty-one Bomber Command attacks which were directed against synthetic oil plants, refineries, benzol plants and fuel storage depots, were carried out by substantially the same means as those which had preceded them in the last three months of 1944.2 Four of the operations, two of them in daylight and two at night, serve to illustrate the tactical pattern of the offensive. The weather over the Ruhr on 10th March was forecast to be cloudy and for that reason the attack on the synthetic oil plant, Scholven-Buer, was planned as a G-H operation. 155 Lancasters from 3 Group were despatched and, as had been expected, they found ten-tenths cloud at five to ten thousand feet over the target. 153 of them carried 1 Bomber Command Review 1945.
