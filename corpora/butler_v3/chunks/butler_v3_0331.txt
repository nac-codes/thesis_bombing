success of this weapon in 1944 has already been noticed in several places and it will be remembered that it was this bomb which made the destruction of the Tirpitz possible. Plans for the development of the Grand Slam were also pushed ahead and arrangements were made for its production both in England and in the United States, but this progress was arrested in September 1944,2 when, in the light of the War Cabinet's expectation that the war would be over by Christmas, the Air Staff cancelled Grand Slam pro- duction in both countries. This too was an unfortunate decision, but it was redeemed in October by a characteristically far-sighted, in- dependent and courageous decision by the Chief Executive at the Ministry of Aircraft Production, Air Chief Marshal Sir Wilfrid Freeman. This set the wheels of production in motion once more. On 13th March 1945 the first explosive-filled Grand Slam was experi- mentally dropped on the Ashley Walk bombing range. It produced a crater thirty feet deep and 124 feet in diameter.3 Here then, if rather late, was an important addition to the striking power of Bomber Command. No more time was lost and on 14th March, the day after the experiment, the first Grand Slam was dropped operationally by 617 Squadron. The target was the railway viaduct at Bielefeld which carried the main line from Hamm to Hanover. It had been attacked on a number of occasions previously. Aircraft of the United States Eighth Air Force had damaged two spans and a pier with 1,000-lb. and 500-lb. bombs, but the Germans had been able to relay the track by placing girders across the damaged sections. They had also succeeded in making good the much more serious damage done by Bomber Command Tallboys on 22nd Feb- ruary 1945. For the operation on 14th March, which took place after a series 1 A.H.B.
