In addition to the bomb- ing of production plants in the Ruhr, the systematic attacks carried out on railway installations are largely responsible for the critical situation. While the former can result in an appreciable drop in our total war out- put, the disruption of our communications may well lead to a production crisis which will gravely jeopardise our capacity to continue the war.'
