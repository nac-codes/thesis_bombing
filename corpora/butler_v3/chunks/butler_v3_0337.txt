eral Spaatz. On the other hand, that part of M.E.W.'s work which dealt with the general economic position of Germany became less important. The hope that the war would soon be over meant that less thought was devoted to the long-term results of the offensive. Attention was, as has been seen, concentrated on the immediate assistance that the strategic air forces could give to the armies by depriving the enemy of their weapons and the oil and communications that enabled the weapons to be used. For the same reason a less important part was played by the appreciations of the strategic damage made by R.E.8, the special department of the Ministry of Home Security. Their studies of particular attacks on oil or aircraft plants took too long a time to prepare, though they continued and were useful as a check on previous estimates. The technical skill of the department was used by representation on or advice to other committees which could work faster. R.E.8 also continued its studies of the effect of different kinds of bombs on various structures, and, as the armies advanced in France, these could be checked by the knowledge obtained of the results of the bombing on French targets which had been liberated from the enemy. But during this period it became impossible to make accurate surveys and estimates of the amount of destruction in particular German towns. They had been so heavily bombed that it was often impossible to distinguish to a sufficient degree new damage from old. The Joint Intelligence Committee was employed as before to put the results of the work of the various committees into a convenient form for the attention of the Chiefs of Staff. It paid, however, more attention to strategy and less to industry and economics. It was used by the Chiefs of Staff to make a fortnightly report on oil, but this was largely a summary based upon the results produced by other organisations described below. It tried to estimate the effect on the land battle of the shortage of oil
