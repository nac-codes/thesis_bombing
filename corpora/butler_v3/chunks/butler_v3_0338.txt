It tried to estimate the effect on the land battle of the shortage of oil or the rupture of communications, but in such assessments it had new competition in the intelligence sections of the allied staff, which was directing the offensive. During the first five months of this period these had a commanding position, for the strategic air forces were at the disposal of the Supreme Commander and his Deputy, Sir Arthur Tedder, directed  APPRECIATIONS AND RESULTS 210 CHANGES IN ALLIED METHODS their activities.

But for information as to the nature and location of the targets and appreciations of the results of the attacks, they had to use the organisations already set up for that purpose. The estimates of the oil situation were in the hands of the Hartley Tech- nical Committee, but the oil section of M.E.W. had taken an increasing share in the calculations concerning consumption and production. The Enemy Objectives Unit of the Economic Warfare Division of the United States Embassy also had its own advisers, who took part in the discussions and conveyed the views of experts in the United States, where the subject was given much attention in the Petroleum Committee of the Board of Economic Warfare. The success of the oil offensive in which the three strategic bomber commands were taking part showed that this machinery was not sufficiently co-ordinated or able to act with the necessary rapidity. In July, therefore, a new organisation was set up in the Joint Oil Targets Committee by the Air Staff and the United States Strategic
