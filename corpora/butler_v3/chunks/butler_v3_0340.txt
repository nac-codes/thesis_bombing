Thus, the progress of the strategic offensive was surveyed by a common organisation, which, so far as operations were con- cerned, was independent of all other Commands. New photographic machines and processes, some devised in the United States, were also introduced, while the Spitfire XIX, though in short supply, began to be used for high-speed and high-altitude reconnaissance. Just as important was the necessity of obtaining the assessment of the results of a raid as rapidly as possible in order to ascertain if it had to be repeated. Since thousands of photographs were delivered every day at the Unit's headquarters, this was no easy task; it was nevertheless accomplished with great skill. Throughout the offensive a first estimate of the results of the attacks on the refineries and oil plants could be supplied to the air forces in a matter of twenty-four hours so long as the weather allowed photo- graphs to be taken of the target. This was an important qualification for the weather often placed insuperable obstacles in the way of finding out what had been done, though great efforts were made to overcome them by low flying and the use of the night photographs. Whenever possible also the targets were under continual survey from the air and the Unit was thus able to report when a new attack was necessitated by the progress of repair. There was much other intelligence of various kinds and this was increased when the occupation of France began and the prisoners of war multiplied. To assess this kind of material an Enemy Oil Intelligence Group had been set up in 1942 in the Ministry of Economic Warfare. In this Committee representatives of the different agencies discussed the evidence and put it into practical shape in a weekly bulletin. This information was neither
