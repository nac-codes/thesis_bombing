APPRECIATIONS AND RESULTS 214 CHANGES IN ALLIED METHODS (ii) To issue, on behalf of the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff and the Commanding General, U.S.St.A.F.E. weekly pri- ority lists of strategic targets for attack under the current directive. (iii) To formulate and to submit to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff and the Commanding General, U.S.St.A.F.E. joint proposals to meet specific situations as and when these may arise.' 1 Thus these terms involved, as has already been pointed out in Chapter XII, strategic advice to those directing the attack, but the validity of this advice depended on the machinery for the apprecia- tion of the different target systems.

Indeed, at one meeting Colonel Maxwell felt it necessary to assert that the opinion that the Committee were 'oil fanatics' was not true, but he added that oil was 'by far the most profitable target system'.2 But the whole attack had to be reviewed and the other working committees reported to the C.S.T.C. each week or when it was necessary to do so. There were two other main ones at the start. One dealt with aircraft construction, the old 'Jockey' Committee, which had been functioning for so long, and was now termed 'working committee for the G.A.F.' The other was for Army objec- tives now called 'working committee (A
