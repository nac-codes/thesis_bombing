mittee on that target system which had also always reported to the C.S.T.C. and now pressed its claims upon it. There was thus a complicated prob- lem of deciding priorities within target systems, which in the direc- tives had an equal position. Finally, though there was no working committee to assess the area offensive, the relation of the attack on towns to those in the other target systems had to be considered by the C.S.T.C., for the former became of considerable importance both to the oil offensive and to that on the communications of the Ruhr. The machinery thus constituted was undoubtedly far better adapted to the needs of the offensive than any that had preceded it. There were, however, conditions which made the appreciations less authoritative than they might otherwise have been. Neither of the two Commanders was prepared to accept the advice of the Com- mittee except when he agreed with it. Sir Arthur Harris, as has been seen, did not admit the authority of the Committee to decide the targets inside the target systems. General Spaatz remained for the most part in France and took advice from the intelligence depart- ments of S.H.A.E.F. as well as from those in London. The Deputy Supreme Commander and his United States colleagues had no great opinion of direction by committee as the quotation at the head of this chapter indicates.1 He continued to claim an equal if not pre- ponderant authority in assessing the results of the offensive on com- munications and the selection of the targets which should be attacked until, in the final stages of the war, the offensive was entirely con- trolled by his advisers in S.H.A.E.F. or the commanders in the field. 1 He later denied that this observation was directed against the C.S.T.C. and its working committees, but rather to the whole system from the Combined Chiefs of Staff downwards. But it was drawn from him at a time of controversy between his own advisers in S.H.A.E.F. and the C.S.T.C. and its working committee on
