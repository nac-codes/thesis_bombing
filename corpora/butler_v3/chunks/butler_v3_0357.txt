He had long ago realised that his own system of technological control was in conflict with the basic philosophy of the totalitarian state. But at Nuremberg he admitted the fundamental error of not realising that the Fuehrer- prinzip, which he had exploited for his own purposes, was bound to result in overwhelming disaster.1 Yet in this final period German armament production, still in the main under Speer's direction, achieved amazing results and contri- buted to delaying the inevitable end. Production reached its peak in July 1944 and then declined with increasing acceleration under a hail of bombs. Even then, when, as Speer said, all was improvisation, the process of repairing the destruction and producing armaments and the means of using them went on with undiminished energy. Numerous new expedients were tried, some with considerable success, others with complete failure. One resource was the attempt to put industry underground, or half underground, with huge cement roofs over it, which amounted to the same thing. This process had begun long ago in a few cases such as those of aircraft production and V-weapons. It was now considered by some as the last resource of the Reich.
