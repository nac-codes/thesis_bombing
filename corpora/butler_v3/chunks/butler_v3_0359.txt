to Frydag (former Generaldirektor of Heinkel and Head of the Aircraft Construction Committee), twenty per cent of all aircraft construction, including all that for the Me.262, the new jet aircraft, had been put underground by the end of the war. Frydag Interroga- tion, July 1945-  APPRECIATIONS AND RESULTS 222 THE GERMAN RESPONSE TO BOMBING factories, but Speer himself was never an enthusiastic advocate of underground construction. He preferred his own expedients of fighter and anti-aircraft artillery defence, smoke, protection of machinery against blast and rapid repair.1 Dispersal was also intensified, and, so long as the communications were efficient, had considerable success. But some industries could not be dispersed and when communications were attacked the effect was much increased by such methods. The breakdown of postal, telegraph and telephone services caused the gradual disintegration of central control. One of Speer's proposed remedies was to divide Germany into six armaments regions (Ruestungsbezirke) so that most of the components could be supplied through local arrangements and only for the balance would it be necessary to have recourse to central authority.Âª He also made an attempt to get some order into the Ruhr by the appointment of one of his own experts as a super- Gauleiter over the six Gauleiters of the Ruhr district, but Hitler refused to supersede old Party members in this way.3 Similarly at the end of 1944 the number of Main Committees was reduced and the organisation simplified. As early as June 1944 Speer insisted that the Army must not demand any further modifications in their weapons as such changes slowed up production considerably. Only the most essential alterations were to be permitted.4 But by this time the situation had gone too far to be retrieved. It was kept going by the local efforts of those in charge, aided by the flying squads of skilled repair workers which Speer had devised and the special repair organisations directed by
