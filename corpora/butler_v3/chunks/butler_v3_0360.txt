It was kept going by the local efforts of those in charge, aided by the flying squads of skilled repair workers which Speer had devised and the special repair organisations directed by Geilenberg and others. The Reichsbahn itself was not under Speer's control. But when so much reconstruction was necessary to enable it to function, he gained considerable influence on its direction and in the end made its repair a primary object, not for waging war, but for preserving the existence of the German people. He stated that the situation was such, after the heavy attacks on it began, that it was impossible to make any general plan.

One of Hitler's arguments for insisting on no retreats was the catastrophic effect on the armaments industry which he said they would produce.

But Speer showed him that sufficient stocks remained to carry on the armaments industry f
