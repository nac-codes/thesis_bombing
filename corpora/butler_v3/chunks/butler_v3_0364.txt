ice that the oil situation of Germany was precarious and that an attack on it would be more rewarding than that on any other target system. If the statistics on which this advice was founded were often inaccurate, the general trend of the oil situation was estimated cor- rectly. Though the totals of the figures for stocks, production and consumption were too high, the variations in them were close enough to reality to enable the advice to be soundly based. The committees failed, for example, to appreciate sufficiently the effect of the oil offensive on the production of explosives and the effect of the shortage of explosives on the production of oil, but it may be doubted whether it would have made much difference to their advice at this time if they had been able to do so. Nor were they able to assess exactly the distribution of the production of the Bergius hydrogenation plants between aviation spirit and motor petrol. It was in fact impossible to do so, for there could be no certain information of the exact use of these plants which could be directed to different processes. Still, there was less emphasis during the early months of the offensive than might be expected on the supply of aviation spirit on which the ability of the Luftwaffe to defend the Reich so clearly depended. The committees' task was to some extent simplified by the fact that, though the targets were numerous, the most important were few in number, and were all well known. When the weather was 225  APPRECIATIONS AND RESULTS 226 THE ATTACK ON OIL at all favourable they could be continually surveyed, and, perhaps, the greatest contribution of the intelligence teams was not their estimates of total production and consumption, but the detailed information concerning the different plants which enabled the air forces to direct their attacks where they could produce the most effect. Here also there were naturally some errors, but the priorities recommended were generally those which would best reward a
