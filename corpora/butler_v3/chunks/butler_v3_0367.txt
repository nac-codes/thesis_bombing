Some of the Bergius hydrogenation plants in western and central Germany were extended, but, as the vulnerability of these plants was recognised, new ones were built in Czechoslovakia and Silesia. It was thought that these would be out of range of attack, though the Luftwaffe was also confident of its ability to defend those in the West. Consequently, in spite of some suggestions to that effect, it was decided not to undertake the formidable task of con- structing any underground plants.

The gallant low-level attack of the Ninth Air Force did more damage than was appreciated at the time, more indeed than any one of the attacks of 1944, but its casualties were so
