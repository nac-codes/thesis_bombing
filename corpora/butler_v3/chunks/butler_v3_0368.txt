Paper, 8th Nov. 1944. The gallant low-level attack of the Ninth Air Force did more damage than was appreciated at the time, more indeed than any one of the attacks of 1944, but its casualties were so heavy that it could not be repeated until April 1944.  APPRECIATIONS AND RESULTS 228 THE ATTACK ON OIL substitute fuels for this purpose, while military vehicles were fitted to utilise bottled methane (Treibgas) produced in the hydrogenation plants. Thus, in spite of the great battles in the East, production increased more than consumption. The stocks of aviation spirit, motor petrol and diesel oil had grown by May 1944 from 800,000 to 1,336,000 tons, of which 574,000 was aviation spirit.1 The precarious nature of the supply of aviation spirit and explosives was realised, but it was hoped that this situation would be remedied as the new plants in eastern Europe and the extensions to the others came into full operation. The use of aviation spirit had, however, to be economised as much as possible. One obvious means was to reduce the supply devoted to training. The temptation was not resisted so that the training hours of the Luftwaffe crews were reduced while those of the Anglo-American air forces, already larger, were being increased. 2 But the real urgency of the position was still not fully recognised. An allied attack from the West was in preparation, even if some Germans in high position thought it would never take place. This would increase consumption and make it necessary to draw on the reserves. Moreover, the supply was specially vulnerable because so large a proportion of the most valuable production was centred in a small number of targets. Nearly one-third of the Bergius hydrogena- tion production was contained in the two large plants of Leuna and PÃ¶litz and over a third more in five other plants. Thus, over two- thirds of their production could be lost by the destruction of seven targets. Much synthetic production was concentrated in the Ruhr and the allied
