a third more in five other plants. Thus, over two- thirds of their production could be lost by the destruction of seven targets. Much synthetic production was concentrated in the Ruhr and the allied advance in Italy had given new bases for attacks on the oil of Rumania and central Europe. When it is remembered that ninety per cent of the aviation spirit came from the Bergius hydro- genation plants and most of the rest from Rumanian oil, the threat to the Luftwaffe was obviously a great one. These plants were also a main source of supply of synthetic nitrogen and methanol. The refineries of crude oil were a more difficult target because they were numerous and there was more refining capacity than could be used. But a number of the most important were in the West, especially at Hamburg and its twin port Harburg. The others were naturally mainly situated near the oil fields of Austria and Hungary, but these were now within range of the Fifteenth Air Force. Thus, though the danger to the oil supply was appreciated in Germany, 1 Oil in the German War Effort. The total production of Greater Germany was almost eight million tons, of which forty-seven per cent was produced in the hydrogenation plants. See App. 49 (xxxiii). Other reports as to stocks vary somewhat from the figures in the text. 2 The effect on operations was only gradual. German reports regarded training as satisfactory during 1943, but by May 1944 the reduction in fuel for this purpose was beginning to have effect and the effect was cumulative. 229 the full extent of the danger was not realised until too late. The oil target system was more vulnerable than the Germans imagined or, indeed, than the oil committees had ventured to predict. But, as has been seen, their arguments had appealed to General Spaatz, though the attack by the Eighth Air Force in May was defended on different grounds from those put forward by the com- mittees. Sir Arthur Harris joined in the attack in June. Even with the limited force u
