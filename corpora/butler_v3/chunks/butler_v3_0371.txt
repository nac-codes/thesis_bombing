ntirely ceased. Then the Fifteenth Air Force was free to con- centrate on plants in the East and the oil refineries in Austria and Hungary. Meanwhile the Eighth Air Force, in addition to attacks in the West, had severely damaged Leuna, Pölitz, Zeitz, Brüx and Böhlen, the principal plants of central and eastern Germany. Bomber Command during these short nights had been confined to attacks on the oil plants in the Ruhr and west Europe. But they had done immense damage and Scholven and Nordstern near Gelsenkirchen had been almost completely knocked out with others 1 Of the ten thousand tons 4.7 thousand was produced by the benzol and other small plants according to an Economic Intelligence Report of the Luftwaffe dated January 1945, see App. 49 (xxxix). 2 See App. 49 (xxxiii) and (xxxiv).  APPRECIATIONS AND RESULTS 230 THE ATTACK ON OIL of the Ruhr plants, so that production there was almost at a standstill. 1 At the same time the defence against the double attack on the Western and Eastern fronts had increased German consumption of these fuels. That of aviation spirit rose by 46,000 tons in July and, if consumption was drastically reduced in August and September, this was because stocks were rapidly decreasing. There had been a similar rise in the consumption of motor fuel and, though civilian consumption was again cut by nearly half, stocks of this fuel were also running low. The serious nature of the attack on oil was immediately recognised in Germany and great efforts were made to cope with it. Speer at once took energetic action and he obtained from the Fuehrer head- quarters complete priority for his measures of defence. The one thing unobtainable, which he recognised was the only real defence, was for the Luftwaffe to inflict such losses on the attackers as to cause them to abandon their attempt. But large numbers of anti-aircraft guns were sent from other localities to increase the defence of the hydro- genation plants so that they became veritable fortresses,
