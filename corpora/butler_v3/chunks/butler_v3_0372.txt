them to abandon their attempt. But large numbers of anti-aircraft guns were sent from other localities to increase the defence of the hydro- genation plants so that they became veritable fortresses, Hydrierfestun- gen. Concrete blast walls were built round the most important parts of the plants. Smoke screens were set up or increased in volume, though the acid that produced them was in short supply because most of it was made from the products of the Leuna nitrogen plant which had been severely damaged. New decoy plants were designed to divert the bombers from the real target. Shelters were constructed for the workers in or near the plants so that they might take remedial measures or resume their work at the earliest possible moment. All these measures had some effect. The anti-aircraft fire increased casualties to some extent and helped to reduce the accuracy of the attack but by no means prevented it. The concrete gave some pro- tection from blast, especially that from the lighter bombs of the United States air forces, but it could not prevent these from cutting pipelines and other vital links in many places. Smoke was, perhaps, the most effective defence, but it was by no means sufficient, because of the strength and skill of the attackers. The decoy plants sometimes diverted a good part of the bombers to the wrong target but the rest were able to inflict substantial damage. The morale of the workers varied in different plants. In a few they were only kept at work by terrorisation and special supervision, but in the majority of cases they did all that was possible. They were especially affected by the raids of Bomber Command because they lasted so much longer than those of the United States air forces. 2 1 Report Speer to Hitler, 30th June 1944, App. 32 (i). 2 The experts of the United States post-war survey made an assessment of all the 231 But Speer's main defence was to repair the plants as rapidly as possible, and he adopted his usual method of appointing fo
