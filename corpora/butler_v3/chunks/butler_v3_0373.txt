xperts of the United States post-war survey made an assessment of all the 231 But Speer's main defence was to repair the plants as rapidly as possible, and he adopted his usual method of appointing for this pur- pose a special director with unlimited powers. He chose Edmund Geilenberg, described by him as 'the most active of my Main Committee Chiefs'. The proper functioning of his organisation, Speer said, will 'practically be decisive for the war'. He hoped also that the British Air Staff would, like the German, be so exalted by their success that they would leave too long an interval between attacks and thus enable some considerable quantity of oil to be produced.1 This hope was not altogether unfounded though not primarily through the fault of the Air Staff and its advisers. It was impossible to disperse the oil industry as the aircraft industry had been dispersed. The plants were too complicated to build quickly. Some dispersal was obtained by constructing numbers of small distillation plants in sheltered places and increasing the number of the benzol plants, but this could only be a small contribution to the total supply. Speer at first rejected the proposal to place hydro- genation plants underground. But after three months, almost as a policy of despair, Geilenberg was authorised to undertake this pro- ject and an enormous effort was made. None of this was effective before the war ended and, even if it had been begun earlier, it is unlikely that any substantial production could have been achieved, for the projected plants were far behind schedule. Meanwhile Geilenberg proceeded more successfully with his task of repairing the plants as rapidly as possible after each attack. Large numbers of workers were employed; 7,000 engineers were released from the armed forces and an unlimited supply of slave labour was placed at his disposal. Large quantities of concrete and steel were used. In August, Speer stopped all new construction above ground and the machinery as
