most part was not due to errors in assessment but to other causes such as the weather, operational difficulties and the necessity, or supposed necessity, of attacking other targets. There were, of course, some errors which are revealed by the post- war surveys. These, for example, criticise the intelligence teams for making mistakes about the exact lay-out of the plants and thus choosing the wrong aiming point; but surely mistakes of this kind were inevitable. It is suggested also that too much attention was given to the Fischer-Tropsch plants and the refineries because they produced so little aviation spirit. Certainly too great a priority was given to the Fischer-Tropsch plants because their capacity was over- rated. But when it is said that if they were bombed at all they should have been bombed heavily enough to keep them out of production altogether, this judgment takes too little account of operational difficulties.2 It would appear that the Ruhr plants were as a whole over-bombed in comparison with others, but that was largely because of their proximity. It is also, as has been already noted, surprising that more emphasis was not placed at an earlier date on the probable effect on aviation spirit, a point which might have been expected to make a special appeal to the Commanders of the Air Forces. For this was Speer's principal anxiety at this time. He had already pointed out that unless the Bergius hydrogenation plants could be enabled to produce a reasonable amount, the Luftwaffe would before long be unable to make any defence at all. Speer's hopes now lay in the approach of autumn when the weather would deteriorate and thus by dimin- ishing the weight of the attack not only enable some production to be obtained but also allow the German air force and armies to be regrouped and reduce their consumption of aviation spirit and motor petrol. 3 1 See, for example, the estimate of 3rd October, App. 49 (xxxvii).
