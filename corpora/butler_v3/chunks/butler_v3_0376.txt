be regrouped and reduce their consumption of aviation spirit and motor petrol. 3 1 See, for example, the estimate of 3rd October, App. 49 (xxxvii). The estimate for September is extraordinarily correct. These appreciations were revised each week as further information was obtained, but after a time those for the earlier months remained unchanged. 2 U.S.S.B.S.

Telegram Speer to Bormann, 16th Sept. 1944. For both documents see App. 32 (i) and App. 34. This last telegram was given a wide circulation amongst the top leaders of the Reich to combat a widely prevalent These hopes seemed for a time to be justified. The reduction of 233 the attack in October allowed the production of aviation spirit to rise from 10,000 to 29,000 tons and in November to 46,000 tons.1 Consumption also decreased. Some of this was due to further drastic economies, the practical cessation of training and the use of other fuels for aero-engine testing. But much was also saved, as Speer had predicted, by the reduction in the allied attack. Not only was there less aerial activity and land fighting in the West, but the Russian attack was halted for five months except on the Hungarian front. For this reason there was also a reduction in the consumption of motor petrol while its production increased by a few thousand tons. Thus, the oil for the Ardennes offensive could be accumulated without stocks being entirely exhausted. In November the attack on oil was increased and, so far as the Ruhr plants were concerned, was very successful. The benzol plants there were now placed high in the schedule of priorities. These were numerous but the positions of many of the most important were known and the attack was fairly successful. Some were injured by the area bombing of Bomber Command. The attack on commu
