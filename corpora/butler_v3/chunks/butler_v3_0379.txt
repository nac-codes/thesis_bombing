a great reduc- tion in the supply of aviation spirit. In December it was down to 26,000 tons, in January it fell to 11,000 tons and in February it was no more than a trickle. If motor petrol and diesel oil had not suffered to the same extent, the Ardennes offensive had used up oil in the West and the Russians began their winter offensive in January which caused new demands from the East. By the end of January stocks had been so reduced as to limit the Luftwaffe to occasional forays and made much more difficult the defence of the Eastern front.1 There can be no doubt of the great part played by Bomber Com- mand in this great success. Their heavy night attacks were the main cause of the principal plants being put out of production altogether, for in most cases the lighter attacks of the United States air forces could not in such a season be repeated often enough to secure this result. 'It has now been reported', wrote Speer on 19th January, 1 See App. 49 (xxxviii) and (xxxix). The production of the benzol plants was reduced from an average of fifty thousand metric tons a month in the third quarter of 1944 to twenty-one thousand metric tons in January of which only 9,500 could be used as motor fuel. U.S.S.B.S. The German Oil Industry (No. 113), pp. 60-61. 235 'that the attacks which take place so often at night now, are con- siderably more effective than daylight attacks, since heavier bombs are used and an extraordinary accuracy in attacking the target is reported'. Bomber Command could hardly have had a more hand- some testimonial.1 In February and March it was comparatively easy to pursue the offensive to its logical conclusion, for there was hardly any resistance by the Luftwaffe. As the major plants were completely destroyed attention could be given to smaller ones, including the smaller benzol plants, and still the number of targets was decreasing. Finally only the smaller distillation units and some benzol plants were left together with the supply that came fro
