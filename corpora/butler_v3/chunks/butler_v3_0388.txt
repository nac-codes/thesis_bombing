d been produced during the Ardennes offensive and, indeed, from December onwards on the fighting efficiency of all the German forces, because they could not use even such armaments as could still be supplied to them. For this reason, he thought that the lack of oil fuel had an even more decisive effect on the course of the war than the difficulties in armaments and communications.1 1 The Baranov offensive was often referred to but the above reflection is taken from a special report of Speer which includes much documentary evidence. His final words were: 'Durch die Verluste in der Treibstoffindustrie war auch die verringerte Rüstungsproduktion für den Kampf bereits im Dezember 1944 und Januar 1945 nicht mehr auszuwerten. Der Verlust an Treibstoff war daher für den Kriegsverlauf nach meiner Ansicht noch entscheidender als die Schwierig- keiten in der Rüstung und im Verkehr.' ('As a result of the losses in the fuel industry it was no longer possible even in December 1944 and January 1945 to make use of the reduced armaments production in the battle. The loss of fuel had, in my opinion, therefore, a more decisive effect on the course of the war than the difficulties in armaments and  APPRECIATIONS AND RESULTS 240 THE ATTACK ON OIL It has been suggested, indeed, that no sensible effect resulted from this cause until February 1945.1 But this view can hardly be accepted. There is much other evidence of effects similar, if smaller and less catastrophic, than those produced in the Ardennes and Upper Silesia.ª Though the German commanders were used to working with a minimum of oil and for months previously had employed every kind of means to reduce dependence upon it, yet their power of resistance was obviously impaired by lack of it. The shortage of explosives must also have had an effect though this is hard to measure. Only the stubborn fighting of their infantry and the inability of the allied armies in the west and Italy to overcome the difficulties of terrain and logisti
