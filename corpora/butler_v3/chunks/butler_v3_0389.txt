an effect though this is hard to measure. Only the stubborn fighting of their infantry and the inability of the allied armies in the west and Italy to overcome the difficulties of terrain and logistics that confronted them enabled the resistance to be so long prolonged. It had been expected that even when the forces of the Reich had been broken to pieces much isolated and costly fighting would have to take place before they were finally overcome. That this did not occur was also in part due to the destruction of their last few stores of oil by the allied air forces, the tactical forces playing the most important role in this offensive.3 It can thus be said that while there were many factors in the final defeat of the enemy, the reduction and eventually almost the entire destruction of their oil supply and especially of their aviation spirit was of the first importance. None of the other means of pressure could have been applied with such success if the attack on oil had not taken place. It is, perhaps, also as well to remember at this point that the attack on oil could not have been successfully pursued had not allied air superiority over Germany first been established. But the attack on oil was an important factor in the maintenance of that air superiority and its eventual development into air supremacy, even when the Germans had a significant lead in the design of fighter aircraft through the new jet-propelled machines. The attacks on other objectives during this period must also have contributed something to the success of the attack on oil. Some of the United States experts did not, however, consider that this con- tribution was of much importance. They did not think that the attack on communications had much effect on the supply of oil until a date when the destruction of the plants was already nearly complete.4 It certainly, however, at an earlier date affected the communications.')
