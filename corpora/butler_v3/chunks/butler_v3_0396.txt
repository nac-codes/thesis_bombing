September had by now diminished, but it was still thought in some quarters that the German front in the West could be crumpled up by a special effort of the allied forces. This optimism was, how- 245 ever, turned into a pessimism equally extreme by the Ardennes offensive of the German armies which also had an immediate and permanent effect on the selection of the targets. The controversies between the intelligence organisations were heightened by these two emergencies and new criteria had to be applied in their apprecia- tions. So far did the pessimism go that the allied strategic air forces were diverted to some extent to an attack on the communications in the east of Germany rather than in the west, to assist the Russian advance rather than that of their own armies. The existence of these differences of opinion as to what targets should be attacked caused differences of opinion as to the results of the attacks that had been made. The assessment of the strategic, as distinct from the tactical, results of an attack on communica- tions is in the best circumstances a very difficult problem. Each intelligence organisation tended to stress in the multifarious and often inaccurate intelligence about what had been accomplished those parts which seemed to justify its own view of what targets should be attacked. But, if a concentrated attack was not achieved until a late stage of the offensive, there were in the meantime big results from the attacks that were made. Some considerable concentration on the Ruhr was obtained through the attacks on the other target systems which were competing with that on communications. There is no doubt that the results were of great importance. It can be demon- strated that the attack on communications played a major role in the final collapse of Germany. It is more difficult to ascertain at what period the attack became decisive and to isolate its effects from the other factors operating at the same time. It can be seen, therefore, that, w
