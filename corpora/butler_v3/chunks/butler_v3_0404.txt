Those which were adjacent to built-up areas and thus specially suitable for attack by Bomber Command were designated as such. 1 Such concentration as there was in this plan was provided in the special priority targets, the Dortmund-Ems and Mittelland canals and the viaducts on the main lines to the East, all of which were directed to isolating the Ruhr. This concentration might be increased if the Working Committee was able to ensure that its recommendations were carried out. But this did not in fact occur. The most successful part of the offensive was that on the canals. The Dortmund-Ems Canal had, as has been noted, already been hit by Bomber Command in September and October. No sooner was it repaired than it was cut again on 21st November and another successful attack was made on Ist January. The Upper Rhine had also been blocked to a con- siderable extent before the offensive began by the accidental destruc- tion of the Cologne-MÃ¼lheim bridge on 14th October during an area attack on Cologne. Traffic both on the canals and the Rhine itself had been reduced to a small percentage of that normally carried. 2 But though a hundred and twenty other attacks were made on communications before the Ardennes offensive they were widely distributed and the viaducts of the main lines were not cut. The autumn weather not only made the attacks more difficult, but pre- vented the results from being known in many cases. Thus, the main sources of information were not the reconnaissance photographs, but more general intelligence which was unreliable and difficult to assess. It is not surprising, therefore, that there was no general agreement as to how the attack was progressing when it was interrupted by the Ardennes offensive. That offensive showed at any rate that the attack 1 Review of Working Committee (Communications). It had been agreed at the meeting at S.H.A.E.F on 26th October that
