more optimistic view prevailed.Âª The plan had been closely watched there. S.H.A.E.F. demanded a weekly report on results from the Working Committee, but in addition it began to issue one of its own which was much more favourable. In its meetings in December the C.S.T.C. strongly sup- ported its Working Committee when the latter insisted, through its new Chairman, Mr. Wood, that the strategic results could not be ascertained. There was, indeed, some difference of opinion on the subject in the C.S.T.C. But the prevailing tone was sceptical. Air Commodore Bufton refused to believe that any such effect could have been produced as was suggested at S.H.A.E.F. by the com- paratively small weight of bombs distributed over so wide an area. Mr. Lawrence said 'that the C.S.T.C. had been compelled to adopt the attack of communications targets as an act of faith.' No assess- ment had, therefore, been made, as had been done in the case of other target systems, of the weight of bombs necessary to produce the desired effect. It was not possible, he said, to estimate the results from the information available.3 Thus, by the time the Ardennes offensive had expended itself there was acute controversy as to what had been accomplished and what the future targets of the communications offensive should be. It had been pointed out that there was a conflict between the tactical and strategic objectives, but it was not thought that this made much difference to the result.4 The difference of opinion went deeper than this. The C.S.T.C. and its Working Committee were always afraid that the oil offensive would suffer, while Sir Arthur Tedder believed that, apart from tactical results, the targets of the communications offensive could be so chosen as to impair the German ability to resist by destroying their means of production of armaments of all kinds. In actual fact, as post-war records reveal, the optimism of Sir Arthur Tedder was nearer the truth than the more sceptical attitude held in Lon
