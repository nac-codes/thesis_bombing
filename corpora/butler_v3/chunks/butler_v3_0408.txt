esult had been produced by the attack on the canals. Though repairs, camouflage and a rapid rush through of traffic at night had enabled some increase of tonnage to be obtained in December beyond the mere five per cent of normal which had been able to pass through in November, the attack at the end of that month had again com- pletely blocked most of the canal. Though the rail connections with the Ruhr had not been so severely damaged, there had been con- siderable concentration on the Ruhr itself by Bomber Command in its area attacks and in the oil offensive. The internal as well as the external communications of the Ruhr had been injured more than was suspected in London.1 Thus, the supply of coal to the rest of Germany was already seriously reduced, nor could the Ruhr itself be supplied with the same tonnage of ore. Steel production had fallen sharply. Ten railway stations were unusable and fifty others seriously injured. Outside the Ruhr coal stocks were rapidly falling including those of the Reichsbahn itself which needed hard coal for its engines. By the first week of December more than half of the railway divisions had no more than four days' reserve and priority had, therefore, to be given to its coal before all other demands.2 Speer had begun to be preoccupied with the situation in the Ruhr almost as much as with the supply of oil. Though transport was out- side his sphere, he began to take action in an endeavour to improve conditions which were becoming impossible. He tried by interviews and special reports to make Hitler realise the serious nature of the 1 Western German Reichsbahndirektionen Nov. 1943 Oct. 1944 Wagons allotted Nov. 1944 Dec. 1944 Western R.B.D.s combined (a) For all purposes: 1,131,732 641,769 549,228 394,802 Daily average (b) For coal: 16,700 B.B.S.U.
