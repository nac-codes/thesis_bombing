he activities of the Reich. They were still afraid that increased attention to communications would jeopardise the attack on oil, which, they thought, would produce a much more rapid and direct effect on the fighting capacity of the German armies. 2 These controversies had been produced by the attempt of the Working Committee to review the effects of the strategic offensive in order to provide the basis of a new plan. It was now working very closely with S.H.A.E.F., where the tactical aspects of the plan could be considered with fuller information and experience. But there was still the controversy between London and S.H.A.E.F. as to the strategic effects that had already been produced and were likely to be produced by further attacks. The consequence was that it was nearly two months before a plan was finally adopted and the isola- tion of the Ruhr made the main object of the attack. Meanwhile, under the current directives and as a result of the decisions of the army and air commanders, much had already been done by the attack on communications to disrupt the economy of the Reich. In the review made by the Working Committee it was agreed that the attacks on the communications, both road and rail, during the Battle of the Ardennes had been very successful and so far as rail transport was concerned had practically sealed off the battle area. But this effect had been produced by a concentration of all the air forces on a limited area in which every kind of target had been subjected to attack. They could not expect to produce any strategic results of a similar nature since the attack would still have to be distributed along a broad front. For, though General Eisenhower had agreed that an attack by the armies north and south of the Ruhr should be the main offensive, he was still concerned to push the rest of the enemy front back from the Siegfried line to the Rhine. How soon the main attacks could be mounted was also a matter of doubt. It was not, therefore, considered
