Oil, it was pointed out, affected enemy resistance everywhere, while an attack on communications was limited to a small area.2 Front line as at 13th January 1945 Lübeck p Hamburg Elde Elbe Bremen o Aller Weser Mittelland Stendal Canal Rheine eelže MINDEN Hanover ~ o Osnabrück BERGESHOVEDE Lohne o ehrte 9 ROTHENSEE Magdeburg Münster O BIELEFELD Hameln ANA ALTENBEKEN and NEUENBEKEN Viaducts EMS C Wesel P- DATTELN Q.Hamm Paderborn O Soest Duisburgo' DORTMUND Kassel The Ruhr Schwerte Naturally this point of view was not accepted by S.H.A.E.F. and the advance of the Russian armies into Silesia converted Mr. Wood, the Chairman of the Working Committee, to the view that the reduction of the coal still available from the Ruhr would now have immediate results on the German capacity to produce and transport armaments and, indeed, on the whole economy of the Reich.3 This same fact also emphasised the necessity of concentrating on the Ruhr communications, while at the same time this fitted in to a large extent with the land attacks now planned to the north and south of it. Thus, on 10th February a new plan was produced, which sub- sequently became known as the 'Ruhr Plan'. In this plan it was pointed out that the canal system had now been neutralised and considerable damage done to the three main railway lines leading out of the Ruhr. The strategic air forces should, therefore, concentrate on cutting these main routes. A number of other routes would, however, still remain open, though these were more circuitous and not capable of carrying as much traffic as the main ones.
