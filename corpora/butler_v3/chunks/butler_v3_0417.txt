it has to be remembered that the decline in production was due to a number of causes of which the strategic attack on communications was only one, if a major one. Such attempts as have been made to estimate how much of the decline should be attributed to it have not been very satisfactory. Since no comprehensive statistics exist for this period the United States team limited itself to demonstrating the decline in the trans- port of the coal of the Ruhr and the effect of this on a limited area and in particular industries, for which detailed statistics have been found. They show, for example, that while coal production in the Ruhr dropped from about ten million tons in August to little more than five million in November, December and January and even less in February, the stocks of coal at the pits increased from 415,000 tons in August to two and three-quarter million tons in February. There was always a large seasonal increase, but this was altogether abnormal and more than three times the usual amount. It must, therefore, in their opinion, have been caused by the inability to transport the coal that was mined. This is, no doubt, true, though some of the increase must have been due to the decline in the con- sumption of coal in the Ruhr itself. There was, for example, no production at the Krupp works in Essen after October 1944. An even more direct proof of the decline in the transport of coal from the Ruhr is shown by the statistics of the wagons used for that purpose which declined by fifty per cent. At the same time transport of coal by the canals had virtually ceased.2 The kind of effect produced by this lack of Ruhr coal is shown by two sets of statistics. The stock of coal in most of the eight southern divisions of the Reichsbahn was practically exhausted by the end of the period and they were using the inferior brown coal from the mines 1 U.S.S.B.S.
