d mainly due to this cause is explicitly stated, though in some cases the answers may have been elicited by the method employed in questioning them. At the same time there were many other causes for the decline in production.

It was demonstrated there that production could be drastically reduced by the destruction of short-haul communications, an effect largely produced by area bombing or the spill over from direct attacks on oil and weapons. This shows also the effect of there being so little motor transport for such short hauls when other means had been destroyed. The loss of the Silesian coal at the end of January deprived Germany of more hard coal than was then being produced in the Ruhr. And the complete isolation of the Ruhr, though a tremendous feat, was accomplished only a short period before the allied armies closed round it. As has been seen, the trans- port of its coal to the rest of Germany had long been drastically reduced. Nevertheless, the facts already given show clearly enough that the
