Speer was given special powers in order to bring some order into the chaos into which the com- munications system was falling. The anti-aircraft artillery was con- centrated round the most vulnerable centres and towns hitherto heavily defended, such as Schweinfurt, had to be left unprotected. The local population were directed to the repair of the railways and the repair gangs of the Todt organisation were used for the same purpose.
