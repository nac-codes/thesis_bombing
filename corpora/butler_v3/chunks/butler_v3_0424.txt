opinion was due to past disputes between those who directed the attack. The answer appears to be that both forms of attack were necessary to produce the desired result. Similarly the attack on oil was also necessary to obtain the same result in a limited period of time. If more motor transport could have been operated many difficulties would have been lessened. It should be noted also that while all the different air services contributed to the result, the heavy bombs of Bomber Command were as important in the attack on communications as they were in the attack on oil. Without them the immensely difficult task of preventing the operation of the canals could hardly have been accomplished while the destruction of marshalling yards and viaducts 1 U.S.S.B.S.

In this connection it must be remembered that it was one of the main causes of the success of the armies. This tactical aspect will be dealt with by others but it is obvious that it had to be taken into account in all the plans that were made. These were mainly devised for the assistance of the Western armies, but as has been noted, for the Italian and even the Soviet armies as well. But, even so, a more concentrated strategic attack could have been planned and executed if there had been more unity of purpose amongst the planners. It is, indeed, possible that better results would have been obtained, both in the attack on oil and in the attack on communications, if the direction of the strategic forces had remained in the hands of the Deputy Supreme Commander, as in the earlier period, simply because he might have secured greater co-oper
