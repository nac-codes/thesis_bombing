ECT ATTACK If the attack on oil produced the most immediate effect on the Ger- man armies and air force and the attack on communications was a major cause of the decline in production, a greater weight of bombs was dropped during this period on other target systems. Some of this was to give direct assistance to the allied armies in their own offensive on the Western front and their repulse of the German offensive in the Ardennes. So far as Bomber Command was concerned, area bomb- ing absorbed the greater part of the rest. Some of the attacks of the Eighth Air Force, though ostensibly aimed at marshalling yards or factories, were, in effect, area attacks. But there were also, as has been seen, attacks on the aircraft industry, on factories producing tanks and motor vehicles, on ordnance depots and on the submarine yards. It is no easier to estimate the results of these direct attacks than to appraise those of the attacks on the other two target systems already considered. Nevertheless there is much evidence to show that they did make a substantial contribution to the final result. The area attack is the most difficult of all to assess. The estimates of the post-war surveys are almost worthless for this period. They base their results on analogies with the earlier periods without any direct enquiry into the nature of the damage produced. But the area bombing of Bomber Command assumed a rather different character in this period. Not only were more H.E. bombs more accurately dropped on its targets but a greater proportion of them were 4,000 pounders. The extra weight together with the much greater accuracy produced new kinds of effects. The area which was most affected was the Ruhr. Bomber Command certainly won what was a third battle of the Ruhr, the importance of which, as has already been noted, Speer was the first to recognise. These area attacks produced results which were altogether different from those of the attack on communications, though this attack and that
