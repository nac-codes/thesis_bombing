their repair was much more diffi- cult under the conditions created by area bombing. Thus, the decline in the production of the Ruhr was larger and more rapidly produced than that in the rest of Germany and in many factories ceased altogether. This was, indeed, the kind of result that had been hoped for in 1937 and 1938 when the first air plans were made. The pro- duction of the Ruhr was drastically reduced and also that of much of the Rhineland area. But in the rest of Germany there was not such a concentration of effort and the same effect was not obtained. Dresden alone suffered overwhelming catastrophe equal to, or even exceeding, that ex- perienced by Hamburg in 1943. Meanwhile, production outside the Ruhr was declining, at first slowly but then at an increasingly rapid rate, for the reasons described in Section 3. There appears to be little doubt that this decline was due mainly to the attack on communica- cations rather than to the area attacks. The exact proportion of the loss caused by area bombing cannot be estimated either in the Ruhr or outside it. But, as in the case of the communications attack, it was possible to illustrate the kind of effect produced by enquiries into particular towns or industries and the main conclusion to be drawn seems fairly clear. In the Ruhr itself a number of towns have been investigated. Chief amongst them was Essen. Here, as already noted, all production virtually ceased in the Krupp works after the attack of October 1944. Many buildings had been destroyed or severely damaged, but these could have been re- paired as had been done after previous attacks. What prevented further production was the loss of electricity and gas and the im- mense disruption of the internal communications of the plant. There was, indeed, little need of the further attacks on it by Bomber Com- mand. The great steel plant at Borbeck in the north of Essen was also so injured by the area attacks of September and October that there was no further produ
