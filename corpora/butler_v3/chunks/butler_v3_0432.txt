he Ruhr nor was there the same destruc- tion of gas and electricity. Thus, the direct damage was not caused sufficiently rapidly to forestall the much greater loss caused by the failure in communications. This effect was only slow in the autumn period, but became catastrophic in the first three months of 1945, and especially when it was augmented by the loss of the Silesian coal. It should be noted also that the devastation of Dresden was, like that of Hamburg in 1943, of such a character that these general considera- tions did not apply to it. Because Dresden after the war was in the Russian zone no survey was made of it, so that the amount of the lost 1 U.S.S.B.S.

It must have been immense, though there is evidence that some industries there recovered somewhat before the end. The results of the other area attacks in the Eastern zone, for example that on Chemnitz, have never been investigated. But it is probable that the attack on communications, especially after the loss of Silesia, would in any case have produced an almost equal decline in production. Whether, and how far, these attacks contributed to the Soviet advance in the East is not known.1 Finally, in all these cases we have been considering the effect on total production. The effect on the production of armaments was exerted more slowly because the factories making essentials were in some cases enabled to go on at the
