The attack on the production of army weapons was divided into 267 two well-defined periods. In the months of August and September it was given a place in the directives, if a subordinate one, and a num- ber of attacks were made. The tank target system had a diverse number of targets well distributed over Germany. There were the factories assembling complete tanks and other factories which made their bodies, engines, gears and other components. These were for the most part known, but the United States survey has criticised the intelli- gence teams for not perceiving in 1943 the importance of bottlenecks in engine construction and transmission gears. In this period, how- ever, the components were widely dispersed. The industry was thus more vulnerable to an attack on communications than to a direct attack against itself. The most profitable targets left for direct attack were the tank assembly plants and the main tank engine plants. Forty attacks were made on the industry in the earlier part of this period. The Maybach works lost fifty per cent of its production after a raid on it in Septem- ber 1944, but tank engines were now being produced in a number of other plants. The greatest effect on the industry was produced by an attack on the Heinkel works at Kassel, but it has been calculated that the total loss caused by all these attacks did not reduce produc- tion by more than one-fifth and this figure, based on an estimate of the potential and actual production, is probably too large a one.1 When, after the Ardennes offensive, it was realised how much had yet to be done to overcome German resistance, the armies insisted on further attacks being made on tank co
