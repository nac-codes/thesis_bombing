accepted. But this decline was due almost entirely to the attack on communications. The dispersal of the in- dustry into 300 separate plants, if it had made direct bombing un- remunerative, had enormously increased the effect of this form of GRO HAM ( KIE R Ven nover ZE ·B LAMS · LAN NIGEROD NGE NIE BEN IGEN O EISEN FELD o Augs ALLAC 1 U.S.S.B.S.

The British post-war survey of the aircraft in- dustry concluded that 7,500 combat aircraft were lost to the Germans through various forms of bombing during the period July 1943 to the end of 1944. Of these, 2,000 were lost in 1943, 2,500 in the first half of 1944 and 3,000 in the second half of 1944. The United States study of the aircraft industry considered that the total loss for the same period was more than double the British figure, 15,523 combat air- craft.2 Neither of these figures can, however, be considered as more than an indication of the kind of effect produced. They are based on comparisons between the programmes and potential production of the aircraft industry and the actual number of aircraft accepted by the Luftwaffe. Even this last figure, though based on authentic records, is disputable. The figure for 1945 cannot be
