the whole course of the war'. Speer Docs. (Hamburg Series). 4 Petersen Interrogation, 20th July 1945. A.D.I.(K) Report. Saur Interrogation, July 1945; he said 1,308 were built and regarded this total as a triumph over difficulties. The programme could not be fulfilled owing 'to shortage of both building and aircraft con- structional material and small components and the calculated delay in getting them to the place where they would be needed'. do. 10th June 1945. Thus, the decline was due to a continuation of area bombing as well as to the attack on communications. 273 successfully operational and a number of reconnaissance flights were made over Britain from September onwards. But its development was not pursued with the same energy as the Me.262, and since it was made in the East its production was stopped by the advance of the Russians after 200 had been handed over to the Luftwaffe. The He. 162 was developed very rapidly by Heinkel to meet the demand for what was called the 'people's fighter', a rapidly climbing aircraft of small dimensions which could take off from aerodromes near the threatened plants and attack the oncoming bombers. Mass production was begun in Vienna in December before the prototype had been fully tested, but the chaos in communications prevented any being produced before the advance of the allied armies made removal necessary. It may be doubted whether such a plane could have had much success if it had become operational.1 Thus, if the general attack on aircraft production and aero- engines was not of great importance, the allied bombing of com- munications assisted by the difficulties produced by area bombing did much to prevent the new German aircraft from becoming a serious menace at the end of the war. A similar effect could be traced in the progress of the new U-boats. The direct attack on U-boat con- struction was made at the urgent request of the allied navies. The threat to their supremacy on the sea was, indeed, a serious one. Not
