and April devastating raids were made on Hamburg and Bremen. Thus, the final result of all the planning and effort extending over two years was that only eighty type XXI U-boats were delivered to the German navy in 1944 and no more than thirty-nine in 1945. Only one of these became operational and that did no damage. The less ambitious programme for the type XXIII U-boats fared rather better. Sixty-three were delivered to the Navy and six became opera- tional, doing some damage in the closing stage of the war.3 This 1 These types were developed from a new design by Professor Walther, type XVII, which was to be powered by a new kind of engine. Though a few of this type were constructed they did not become operational. A number of midget submarines were also built, but their contribution was a small one. 2 Much work was done on a huge bunker, called Valentin, at Farge, where most of the assembly was to be carried out, but it was not finished before the war came to an end. An enormous amount of labour and material was thus employed to no purpose. B.B.S.U. German U-Boats, p. 7. 3 Of type XXI U-boats, forty-six were assembled at Blohm and Voss, Hamburg, forty-three at Deschimag, Bremen, and twenty-six at Schichau, Danzig. Of type XXIII, forty-nine were assembled at Deutsche Werft, Hamburg, and fourteen at Germania Werft, Kiel. Others were to be produced at Toulon, Genoa, Monfalcone, Nikolajev and Linz. B.B.S.U. German U-Boats, Tables 7 and 8, pp. 15, 17. The total for type XXI U-boats is, however, probably 119 and not 115 as given in the above figures. 275 failure was due partly to the difficulties already described but also to the various attacks of the strategic air forces during this period. Two important components were affected by attacks on the towns where they were made. The accumulator batteries, of which a larger num- ber were needed for the new U-boats, were produced in four plants, at which one, at Posen, was but a small one, while that in Vienna was destroye
