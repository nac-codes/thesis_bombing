was, however, to a large extent produced in 1945 when there was not time for such boats to become operational. Only if the war had lasted longer would the destruction of the U-boats in the assembly yards have been of great importance.1 The production of the conventional U-boats was also reduced by allied bombing during this period. Twenty-two were sunk in the ports, but of these seventeen were destroyed in 1945.2 These boats began to operate with the new device, the Schnorkel, in June 1944. But this threat, which also seemed serious at one time, was reduced by another form of attack of Bomber Command which also had an important effect on the operations of the new type U-boats. For, in spite of all difficulties, over a hundred type XXI U-boats were delivered to the German navy, forty-three of them six months or more before the end of the war. Had even a limited number become 1 These are the estimates of the British team, B.B.S.U. German U-Boats, pp. 21-22. It must be emphasised that these figures are only approximately correct, being based on a number of assumptions some of them quite arbitrary. The survey concluded that the total was correct to within plus or minus fifteen U-boats. A more accurate estimate may be seen in the following table given in the narrative of Captain D. V. Peyton-Ward, R.N., already cited: Type XXI Type XXIII PRODUCTION Number scheduled for delivery in original programme 381 95 Number not produced because of organisation troubles, faulty design and bad workmanship 202 13 Estimated number denied by delays and damage 60 19 caused by allied bombing attacks The actual number delivered to the German navy 119 63 AFTER COMMISSION The number sunk by allied bombing attacks 15 2 The number still training on acceptance trials or fitting out at end of the war 91 38 The number at or on passage to operational bases in Norway but not yet fully operational 12 17 The number fully operational at the end of the war .
