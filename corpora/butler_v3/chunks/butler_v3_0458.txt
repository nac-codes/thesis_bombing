ly realised the great importance of the mining operations or how much they had accomplished. Indeed, it was long before research in the German records revealed what had been done. But the mining of the Baltic played a similar role in the final months of the war at sea to that of the attack on oil in the war on land and in the air. The mining operations also continued to reduce the sea traffic in the Baltic and were one of the reasons why Sweden withdrew her ships from that sea. It should be recalled that this process had been going on from 1942 onwards. The U-boat operations from French ports were hindered by it and a sensible, if minor, reduction in Ger- man production was produced by it. The cumulative effect, though it cannot be calculated, must have been a real contribution both to the war at sea and to the weakening of the German economy.1. Another contribution of the strategic air forces in the later part of this period was to the virtual destruction of the German high seas fleet. That of the Tirpitz was only important in that it removed a threat in the minds of the allied naval staffs. Nor were the other warships any longer a serious menace when they were sunk or damaged beyond repair by the onslaught of Bomber Command. Finally, it should be pointed out that the weapons and ammunition produced in this period were diverted even more than before to defence against the allied air forces. The number of anti-aircraft weapons was much increased and, though there was never sufficient ammunition for them, they absorbed a good share of the all too 1 The following table shows the amount of effort and the results for 1944 and 1945.
