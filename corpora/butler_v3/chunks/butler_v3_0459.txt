Similarly they used much electrical equipment which was also in short supply. All this must have detracted from the efficiency of the German armies.1 This was in addition to the fact that the Luftwaffe was now engaged almost exclusively in defence. The importance of this fact during the invasion has already been pointed out. It continued to operate during this period. Such efforts as Hitler made to assign aircraft production to bombers and galvanise the Luftwaffe into aggressive action were of no avail. Only once, in the attack on the allied aerodromes on Ist January 1945, did the Luftwaffe have any real success, but this incident showed how much might have been done under different circum- stances. As it was, so many German pilots were lost that the attack did more harm to the Luftwaffe than the allied air forces. Of course the allies had established air supremacy in daylight, and such attacks could have been no more than forays. But, if the Ger- mans had possessed an effective bombing force for night operations, something could still have been done to injure the allied ports and landing bases. Moreover, the laying of mines by the bombers of the Luftwaffe in the Scheldt estuary and approaches under cover of dark- ness could have had serious results on the main sea supply of the allied armies to Antwerp from November 1944 onwards. German U-boats and E-boats were already attempting to do this. The con- stant possibility of this addition to the menace was a nightmare to the naval commanders both at Chatham and S.H.A.E.F. In conducting their offensive the allied armies had no such obstacles to overcome and they owed their immunity, at least in part, to the strategy forced on the German air force by the strategic air offensive.
