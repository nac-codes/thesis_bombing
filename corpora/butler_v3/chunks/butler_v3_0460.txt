ting their offensive the allied armies had no such obstacles to overcome and they owed their immunity, at least in part, to the strategy forced on the German air force by the strategic air offensive. One further observation is needed in view of the judgments which we have made concerning unnecessary bombing. Some of the bomb- ing in this period was unnecessary, either because the targets had already been adequately destroyed, or because of the advance of the allied armies or because Germany capitulated before the effects could make themselves felt. One of the problems of the strategic offensive was to calculate the time and extent to which it should be tapered off. It is easy now to criticise such calculations because we now know that the armies were able to advance and that Germany did surrender in May 1945. But had the allied armies been checked or Germany resisted for a longer period, the criticism might well have been applied in the opposite sense. 1 See Vol. I, p. 491, fn. 2. S.A.O .- VOL.

THE MARQUESS OF HALIFAX 283  The strategic air offensive W HEN victory over Germany was celebrated but little was said of the part played in it by the strategic air offensive. The Prime Minister did, it is true, pay a tribute to Bomber Com- mand in a special message to Sir Arthur Harris, in which he spoke of their 'decisive contribution to Germany's final defeat' and praised the 'fiery gallant spirit' of their crews. 1 But no tribute was paid to that campaign in the Prime Minister's victory broadcast of 13th May except for a cryptic reference to the attack on V-weapons, and no campaign medal was struck to distinguish those who took part in the strategic air offensive.
