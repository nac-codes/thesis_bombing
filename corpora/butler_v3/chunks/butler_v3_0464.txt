Commonwealth as well as from some of the allied countries which had fallen under the German yoke. It had received much new equipment in the shape of radar aids, better bombs and superior aircraft including the Lancaster and Mosquito. It had devised far more efficient tactical methods which to a great extent had derived from the creation of the Path- finder Force and, since February 1942, it had been led by a great Commander-in-Chief, Sir Arthur Harris. From March 1943 until March 1944 a truly formidable and ever-increasing weight of attack was brought to bear upon Germany in the area offensive. Immense destruction was caused and Bomber Command appeared to be reaching a hard-won maturity. Throughout this time, however, the strategic idea of selective attack had not been abandoned nor had the operational one of pre- cision bombing. On the basis of experiments and inventions both scientific and tactical, which were often imaginative and daring, Bomber Command carried out in the spring and summer of 1944 a highly precise night, and latterly also a day, offensive in France and elsewhere in preparation for and in support of the allied invasion of the Continent. Almost immediately, corresponding techniques and tactics were applied to the strategic air offensive against Germany and in the last year of the war to the greatly increased power of area attack by Bomber Command was added a high capacity for precision bombing both in daylight and in darkness. The gap between strategic desirability and operational capacity was almost closed and Bomber Command was at last able to fulfil the tasks for which it had origin- ally been designed. In the pursuit of this great achievement, Bomber Command fought the war constantly from start to finish. Naturally the scale of the offensive varied as also did the hazards encountered by the crews, but the whole front line was always involved. Regularly, and sometimes several times within a week, the Commander-in-Chief committed practically the
