was a great one. Of those killed in action or on active service, 38,792 were serving in the Royal Air Force, 9,913 in the Royal Canadian Air Force, 4,037 in the Royal Australian Air Force, 1,676 in the Royal New Zealand Air Force and twenty-seven in the South African Air Force. Thirty-four belonged to other parts of the British Common- wealth, 928 were Poles and 481 were from other allied countries.1 The material cost, though much harder to measure, was less sub- stantial than is sometimes supposed. There are many ways in which it can be expressed but, because bombers cannot be precisely com- pared to tanks or to battleships and because bombers performed many functions other than those connected with the strategic air offensive, none is exact. But, one calculation was 'that the British strategic air offensive over Western Europe cost, on an average, 7 per cent of the manpower effort directly absorbed by the fighting services during the war.' 2 This contribution to victory was, indeed, a great one, though, in direct terms at least, it was long delayed. The initial attacks of Bomber Command up to the spring of 1942 scarcely caused the Ger- mans much inconvenience, though it cannot be doubted that they contributed powerfully to the maintenance of British morale in a period when no other directly offensive blows could be struck at Ger- many. Indirectly, however, even in the early phases, when Bomber Command was at its weakest, two notable results were produced. First, in the summer and autumn of 1940, the very existence of Bomber Command was part of the deterrent to the execution of the German plan for the invasion of Britain as well as causing damage and dislocation to barge concentrations, and it was one of the reasons for which the Luftwaffe was compelled to engage Fighter Command in the Battle of Britain as a preliminary and never completed task. Secondly, the persistent offensive of Bomber Command gradually transferred the main air battle from Britain to Germany a
