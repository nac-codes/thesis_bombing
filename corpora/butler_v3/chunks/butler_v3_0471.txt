orce. For this very reason the strat- egy of the bombing offensive was normally a controversial issue. A reasonably convincing argument could generally be advanced for attempting something other than what was being done. One of the major problems of the bombing offensive was, therefore, the achieve- ment of a strategic concentration or, in other words, the establishment of a main aim which was compatible with the scale of attack available. This problem persisted throughout the war and was never wholly resolved. At the outset it was emphasised by the difficulty of applying precise appreciations to what, on a major scale, was an entirely new method of warfare and, in the closing stages, it was emphasised again by the great variety of tasks which were demonstrably within the capacity of long-range bombers. Thus, throughout the war Bomber Command and, when they came into action, the United States Stra- tegic Air Forces also were beset by a multiplicity of tasks which often did violence to the principle of concentration of effort. Even in the middle period of the war from the beginning of 1942 to the beginning of 1944 when, for Bomber Command, because many of its operational limitations had been revealed and much of its later versatility had not yet been developed, the conditions for strategic concentration were at their best, there were still formidable difficulties in achieving it. The great issue of that time; the issue which the Casablanca Conference failed to settle, was between general and selective attack-between, on the one hand, the aim of attempting to cause some dislocation to as much as possible and on the other, that of seeking to cause a higher degree of dislocation in a smaller, but especially vital segment of the enemy war machine. This issue was not primarily concerned with methods of attack such as precise or area bombing, but with the aims to which it should be applied and to a great extent it turned upon the question of in- telligence and its interpre
