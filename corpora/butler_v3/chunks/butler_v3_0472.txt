y concerned with methods of attack such as precise or area bombing, but with the aims to which it should be applied and to a great extent it turned upon the question of in- telligence and its interpretation. The whole conception of selective bombing, whether by precision or area attack, depended upon the assumption that vital segments in the enemy war economy could 291 be detected. Much of the argument in favour of general bombing depended upon the belief that this was impossible, that there really were no absolutely vital segments in the enemy war machine, or, as Sir Arthur Harris called them, 'panaceas'. Thus, even after the abandonment of the highly selective plans for the destruction of electricity, gas and oil production, for the disloca- tion of communications and for the direct attack on armament factories with which Bomber Command had entered the war, there was still the difficulty of determining whether the area offensive should be devoted to as many as possible of the largest cities in Ger- many or to that of only those associated with some vital activity such as ball-bearings, oil or aircraft production. But this was not only a question of intelligence and its interpreta- tion. It also involved a basic principle of war which, as far as armies and navies were concerned, had been long established, but which, as far as air forces were concerned, was still highly uncertain in applica- tion. This principle concerned the question of the extent to which it was necessary to grapple with the opposing armed forces as a con- comitant of or a preliminary to the achievement of ulterior strategic aims. The idea of selective attack upon German aircraft production and of anciliary production such as that of ball-bearings or of oil, was central to this question and raised what was undoubtedly the most important strategic problem of the bombing offensive.
