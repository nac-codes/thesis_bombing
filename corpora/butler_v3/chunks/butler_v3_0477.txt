cing by the end of 1943, and especially by the spring of 1944, when it became apparent that Germany was surviving the onslaught and that the Bomber Command casualties were approaching an unbearable rate.  CONCLUDING SURVEY 294 THE STRATEGIC AIR OFFENSIVE If a wider measure of agreement and, in some respects, a higher degree of operational flexibility could have been obtained, a greater concentration of effort could have been devoted either to the general or the selective application of bombing policy. But the inherent in- consistency of the attempt to achieve air superiority by bombing alone would have remained. In fact, the attempt to proceed directly with the prosecution of a strategic offensive without taking adequate steps to defeat the German fighter force in being ended in virtual defeat which, for the Eighth Air Force, was signalised by the Schwein- furt operation in October 1943 and, for Bomber Command, by the Nuremberg operation in March 1944. Thus, it became clear that, if prohibitive casualties were to be avoided, the bombing could not be pressed to the degree which was necessary to achieve decisive results, and it had long been clear that the main cause of casualties was the German fighter force. It was also evident that the German fighter industry, which was no easier and in many respects more difficult to knock out than other industries, could not be adequately destroyed by bombing while the German fighter force continued to be in effective operational being. In order to secure the protection afforded by evasion and ruse, Bomber Com- mand was denied the ability to achieve the necessary concentration and accuracy, and in order to achieve the necessary concentration and accuracy, the Eighth Air Force was denied the protection given by evasion and ruse. It became clear, in other words, that the problem of air superiority hinged upon some means of direct and effective attack upon the Luftwaffe in being. The British Air Staff was slow to accept this conclus
