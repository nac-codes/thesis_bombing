purpose the decision has to be made whether to proceed with the strategy and find new and more successful operational methods or change the strategy to conform with what is operationally possible. It has been seen how Bomber Command was made almost impotent by its operational limitation in the early years of the war. The result was that its strat- egy of selective bombing by precise attack was changed into general area bombing on production and morale. The Eighth Air Force, on the other hand, persisted in its strategy and by the development of the long-range fighter found the eventual means to carry it out success- fully. Bomber Command also in the years 1943-44 found the means to carry out all the strategic aims which had been laid down in its pre- war plans, and, though it did not abandon general area bombing as its main offensive, it was this mastery of a new technique which en- abled it to make its greatest contribution to victory in the final stages of the war. The process was a complicated one and its description and analysis have occupied a large portion of these volumes. It has been necessary to show how it depended on the production of new radar devices, bombs, markers and other material aids to target finding and bomb aiming as well as on the new methods employed by the crews in using these aids. At the same time, in order to concentrate a sufficient weight of bombs on the target and restrict the casualties to a bearable proportion of the force engaged in destroying it, many new kinds of tactics were devised. All depended on the skill, discipline, courage and endurance of the crews; for the material aids were often in- adequate and in any case had to be employed under difficult and dangerous conditions against an enemy who was also resourceful, courageous and persistent. Those directing operations and the scientists who were assisting them had constantly to be on the alert 297 to discover and apply new methods of attack and new methods of defence against
