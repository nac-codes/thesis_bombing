persistent. Those directing operations and the scientists who were assisting them had constantly to be on the alert 297 to discover and apply new methods of attack and new methods of defence against enemy attack. Thus, the direction of bombing operations, and especially night operations on which each crew from take-off to landing was largely a self-determining unit, was a very complicated business. In their for- midable task of adjusting their strategy and translating the means of carrying it out into operational orders capable of execution, the Air Staff was slow to achieve success. No doubt a true appreciation of operational capacity can only be made under fighting conditions, but in the case of Bomber Command, the initial realms of doubt ex- tended far beyond those which were made inevitable by the difference between peace and war. Nor can the lack of remedial action be attri- buted wholly to the difference between peace-time and war-time service budgets. Before the war, the navigational means by which bombers would find their targets were hardly ever tested in practice and scarcely even considered in theory. The aiming methods by which bombs could find their targets was studied in an inadequate and unneces- sarily unrealistic manner. The reliability and destructive effect of the bombs available was examined too little and, by practical methods, hardly at all. Even the simple facts about what could be seen at night in the various conditions of darkness and from varying heights was not discovered. Complex aircraft such as the Wellington and the Whitley were introduced without the corresponding measures to pre- pare the crews to operate them, and the operational plans of the force were made without apparent regard to the revolutionary change in the prospects of fighter interception which were produced by the in- vention of radar and the development of high-performance aircraft such as the Hurricane, the Spitfire and the Messerschmitt 109. Yet these prospects were
