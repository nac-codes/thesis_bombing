at all. This was not everywhere appreciated and, perhaps, is still not adequately understood. There are, for example, those who believe that if the effort which was, in fact, devoted to making area bombing operationally effective had been devoted to the development of precision bombing, a different result might have been obtained. Such a view does not take account of all the facts. The phases of development for the two kinds of attack were after all basically and initially the same. The one was simply a further refinement of the other. The task of the Pathfinder Force in making area bombing effective was to lay markers at the target with the greatest possible accuracy and the task of the main force was to aim at those markers with the greatest possible degree of precision. The task of the marking and bombing forces in the case of night precision attacks was not different. It was only more important that it should be more precisely fulfilled. That this could not be achieved against German targets was not due to 301 a lack of effort, of courage or of scientific devices in the Pathfinder Force in 1943. Nor was it due to corresponding defects in the main force. It was due to the fact that no device, radar or otherwise, proved to be an adequate substitute in the case of really precise attack for visual identification of the target. Thus, the constant effort to improve the efficiency of area attack was also a contribution to the eventual capacity for precision attack. Nor did the area offensive delay the development of techniques outside the Pathfinder Force which eventually made an even greater contribution to this achievement. While the area offensive was a main preoccupation, a special squadron was formed for the specific purpose of breaching the Ruhr dams and while the Battle of the Ruhr was at its height, 617 Squadron went into action. From its initial precise bombing achievement an almost equally precise marking capacity was eventually evolved and this, by the adop
