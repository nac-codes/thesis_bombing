ther major factor which greatly delayed the operational success of Bomber Com- mand. This was the German air defence. The German air defences made daylight bombing impossible for Bomber Command for the greater part of the war and they contributed powerfully to the inaccuracy of night attack for much of it. The latter effect was due  CONCLUDING SURVEY 302 THE STRATEGIC AIR OFFENSIVE not only to the very heavy casualties which were inflicted and the loss of efficiency caused by them. It was also due to the severity of the conditions under which even the best and the most fortunate crews habitually had to attack. Searchlight dazzle enormously complicated the problem of night vision and, at low level, could cause disaster. Flak and balloon barrages made low-level operations extremely hazardous and, in the course of 1942, the night fighter force began to develop into the greatest danger of all. A great part of the tactical and scientific ingenuity at the disposal of Bomber Command had to be devoted to the attempt to reduce this danger by measures of evasion and of deception, but, as was shown by the Battle of Berlin, this was a struggle in which the Germans enjoyed an advantage and which Bomber Command alone could not win. To the bomber crews, a heavy flak barrage was often taken as the welcome sign that night fighters were not in the area. As operational versatility increased, the limitations imposed upon strategy by operational considerations grew less and the considera- tion of what ought to be done became more important. The deter- mining factors in this were intelligence of the German war economy and the appreciation of what result the strategic air offensive had achieved against it. The Chiefs of Staff, the Air Staff and Bomber Command were supplied with economic, industrial and technical information about the potential targets by a number of agencies, amongst which the Ministry of Economic Warfare had the foremost place. Often the criticism which it received from
