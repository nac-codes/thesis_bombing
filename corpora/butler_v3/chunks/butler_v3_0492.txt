or making it selective was weakened and that in favour of making it general was strengthened for erroneous reasons. On the other hand, the more detailed intelligence about the struc- ture and contents of individual cities and the nature of the principal industries and their contribution to the German war production tended to be much more accurate. In estimating many of the target systems, the Ministry of Economic Warfare achieved an informed realism which increased as the war went on and culminated in the detailed estimates of the German oil position-a triumph which was due to the Ministry of Economic Warfare and to other agencies. From 1943 onwards the co-operation of the British and American economic intelligence experts grew continually closer until in the second half of 1944 they were fused together in the Combined Strategic Targets Committee. In addition, the operational and intel- ligence staffs of the two air forces were also associated with the same joint committee. This machinery was meant to produce a greater concentration of strategic purpose and of operational effort, but this result was to some extent frustrated by the existence of a rival intelli- gence organisation at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force and by the fact that the Deputy Supreme Commander, Sir Arthur Tedder, the Commander-in-Chief, Bomber Command, Sir Arthur Harris, and the Commanding General of the United States Strategic Air Forces, General Spaatz, were not always prepared to accept the advice of the Committee as authoritative.

But in the case of communications there were substantial differences of opinion as to the nature of the target system itself which resulted in delay and confusion. It cannot be doubted, how- ever, in the light of information gathered after the war, that the allied estimates of the condition
