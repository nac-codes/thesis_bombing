ature of the target system itself which resulted in delay and confusion. It cannot be doubted, how- ever, in the light of information gathered after the war, that the allied estimates of the condition of the German oil industry in its latter stages were remarkably accurate. The earlier estimates of the German ball-bearings industry which were also agreed between the British and American experts, on the other hand, were to a major extent in error, but the errors were hardly surprising, especially as even the Germans themselves were unaware of the real facts. Another respect in which intelligence estimates were often vitiated was in the errors which were made in the appreciations of the conse- quences of the bombing. The estimate of the actual damage inflicted  CONCLUDING SURVEY 304 THE STRATEGIC AIR OFFENSIVE was, after the initial period of wholly absurd and grossly optimistic reasoning, often extremely accurate. This was in large measure due to the great efficiency of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit and the great skill developed by the interpreters of the photographs. But the extent to which and the speed at which the Germans could recover from the attacks or in other ways minimise their effects was often considerably underestimated. This, for a large part of the war, tended to produce under-bombing, though eventually the lesson was observed and some cases of over-bombing occurred. In considering the errors of intelligence, which admittedly had some profoundly misleading effects upon the strategy of the offensive, it is necessary to remember that the nature of the intelligence upon which the strategic air offensive depended was more complicated than that for any other kind of warfare including even naval blockade and that the reservations which were sometimes written into the original appreciations did not always reappear in the operative summaries of them. The general tendency towards the dispersal of the strategic air offensive and the dilution of its aims w
