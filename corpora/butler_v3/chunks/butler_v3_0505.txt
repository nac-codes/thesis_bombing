emanded of the ordinary crews that they should face the ordeal of major battle alone and in the darkness thirty times, conviction, leadership and invention would not have availed. It is, of course, easy for historians to criticise the Air Staff of the Second World War and before for failing to learn the lessons of history. Hind-sight contributes powerfully to wisdom. To detect the lessons of the history of the strategic air offensive for the future is more difficult. The dangers of preparing for the last war rather than the next have, however, been reduced by the obvious magnitude of the changes brought about by the harnessing of nuclear energy, the development of high-speed flight and the creation of new delivery systems.
