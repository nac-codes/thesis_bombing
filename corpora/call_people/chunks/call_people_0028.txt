ed of great things to come from the warplane. In the arena of images competing for the public’s attention, it was the optimistic and reassuring images that had the greatest impact on shaping expectations once the airplane emerged as a reality. This varied interpretation of the prospect of aerial warfare has a long history. After witnessing the first human balloon ascension in 1783 Benjamin Franklin reflected an early utopianism when he speculated that balloons would end warfare. In fact, he based his judgement on arguments that would later become central themes for air power advocates: balloons manned by soldiers could attack without warning anywhere in the enemy’s homeland; no army could be strong enough everywhere to stop such a force; and this force “could not cost more than Five [sic] ships of the line.”4  Continuing the utopian vision, in 1852 Tennyson’s “Locksley Hall” depicted “airy navies grappling in the central blue” with such overwhelming superiority that they brought about an era of universal peace and a ‘Tederation of the world.”5  As with Franklin’s predictions, this notion of air power ending the scourge of war was a standard theme of later predictions for air warfare. 20 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

During the early 16th century Leonardo da Vinci experimented and speculated on various methods of human flight, in part for its military potential. While he felt that such a weapon would end warfare, he saw that it could only come through a reign of terror but saw little that could be done to stop it: In truth, whoever has control of such irresistible forces will be lord over all nations, and no human skill will be able to resist his destructive power....no lock, no fortres
