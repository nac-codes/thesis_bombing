edictions, though, the failure of balloon warfare to live up to fanciful expectations did not inhibit speculation in popular imagination: the years leading up to 1903 saw a steady stream of future-war literature predicting an imminent air war revolution.1 0 Much of this speculation appeared after 1871 as Germany’s stunning victory in the Franco-Prussian War awakened a virtual flood of future-war literature. Cultural changes wrought by the scientific and industrial revolutions, as well as the rise of mass literacy, had helped spur the genre of science fiction, and after 1871 writers’  imaginations were further inflamed by nationalistic paranoia and industrialized warfare.1 1  Fearing an invasion at any minute from any direction, writers across Europe and America imagined all sorts of horrendous weapons that could be turned against them by some terrible “other,” and their hopes turned to fantastic weapons that could rescue them from impending defeat. While the future-war literature of this period focuses on all aspects of warfare, much of it speculated on war in the air. Utopian air power prophecies of the period reflected the over-heated war anxiety of late nineteenth century popular literature, but they were also products of the era’s progressive spirit. An example of this confluence of cultural themes can be seen in Simon Newcomb’s 1900 novel His Wisdom the Defender.  A professor and astronomer of international note, Newcomb styled himself an expert on numerous other subjects, and his novel reflects the progressive faith that reason can solve the world’s intractable problems. Set in 1941, an American college professor discovers an anti-gravity substance which he 22 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
