rt in it, there will be increased unwillingness to engage in war....A small nation can afford no adequate navy, but it can on short notice equip a thousand airships. This tends to equalize the smaller with the larger powers....The strong powers will be slow to declare war even against a weak power, when the latter can do it infinite harm. The age of aviation may thus be the age of peace.2 9 The future-war image of air power as a benevolent weapon that forces the world to disarm continued in the vein of Simon Newcomb. Written on the eve of World War I, and serialized in the Saturday Evening Post  during the early months of the war, The Man Who Rocked the Earth , by Arthur Train and Robert Williams Wood, was published in book form in 1915. It depicts a world sunk into devastating but inconclusive war and sliding toward collapse. A scientist invents a nuclear energy beam powerful enough to alter the earth’s rotation and destroy entire mountain ranges and mounts it on an atomic- powered “Flying Ring.” The scientist calls himself PAX, and “The Dictator of Human Destiny,” and forces the nations of the world to disarm completely. Despite PAX’s death when his machine malfunctions, the fear prompted by PAX’s invention prompts the nations of the world to join together to outlaw all weapons and embark on an era of peace and prosperity.3 0  In the same spirit, but writing in the midst of the Great War, John Stewart Barney’s L.P.M.: The End o f the Great War  portrays another American inventor who uses an anti-gravity aircraft to cow the world’s armies and establish a fascist-like world government based on the American corporation and run by “the Aristocracy of Intelligence,” which eliminates war by ruling with dictatorial powers.3 1 31 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
