Henry H. “Hap” Arnold, for example, recalled first thinking that airplanes would be a perfect means of invasion when he saw a painting sometime during his cadet days at West Point between 1903 and 1907 that depicted a balloon invasion of England, and again later in 1909 upon seeing the plane Bleriot had flown across the English Channel that same summer.5 7  Later in 1911 Arnold appeared as a stunt flier in two films, The Military Scout  and The Elopement , in an effort to promote the need for American air power.5 8  Arnold later became one of the leading air power advocates in the interwar period and head of the Army Air Forces during World War II.

Having never seen an airplane first-hand, he based his predictions on what he had read about aviation; still, he predicted: The results of these preliminary engagements between the hostile aerial fleets will have an important effect on the strategic movements of the hostile ground forces before they have actually gained contact....the aerial victory should be an important factor in bringing campaigns to a short and decisive end.5 9 Civilians also began to show an early concern that America needed more air power. At a time when the Army owned only one airplane, Robert F.
