n, a relative unknown at the time, was chosen because he had flown with the Lafayette Flying Corps; the movie was the brainchild of John Monk Saunders, who had flown for the U. S. Army during the war. One of the movie’s two stars, Richard Arlan, had flown for the Canadian Royal Flying Corps while the other, Charles Rogers, was a civilian pilot who became a Navy test pilot during World War n.6 8  The movie was made with $16,000,000 worth of aid from the Army, both because the Air Corps saw an opportunity for good publicity, but also because many airmen knew Wellman from his days with the Lafayette Flying Corps. Before shooting was done Wellman reportedly got “nearly every Army pilot in the country” and some unwelcome Congressional criticism.6 9  Critics agreed the plot was thin, a love triangle, but the flight sequences were the best that had ever been filmed and set standards that still dominate aviation and air war films to this day. More important, though, is the image it sent to American audiences. The film did not preach the air power gospel as later movies would, but the heroes were romantic, dashing, and in their union with their flying mounts they sent the message that the man-machine combination had transcended earthly and traditional military bounds. The warplane looked down on the mud of no man’s land, it sent everything scattering when it dove and strafed and bombed. The movie opened only months after Lindbergh’s flight, thereby benefitting from the attention the “Lone Eagle” had brought to aviation, and was met with critical acclaim and record attendance, thus giving air power the public boost Saunders and the Air Corps had wanted.7 0  Almost as 48 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
