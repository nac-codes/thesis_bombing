levels among Allied decision makers. One measure of his impact on American policy during the war is that John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces, sent Caproni a personal note after the war thanking him for his help.7 7  Douhet’s influence, although difficult to measure, had a more lasting impact. A controversial air power theorist during the war, Douhet was court-martialed and imprisoned in 1917 for criticizing Italian air policy.7 8  After the war, Douhet spelled out his theories in a two-part work, The Command o f the Air,  published in 1921 and 1927. The initial volume constituted the first systematic plan for a war-winning bombing campaign, and claimed that a fleet of bombers, striking the enemy’s cities with high explosive and incendiary bombs and poison gas, would drive the enemy to surrender or collapse in a matter days.7 9 Two other early bombing advocates came from Britain. Commander of Britain’s Royal Air Force from its creation in 1918 to 1929, Hugh Trenchard influenced American thought more through personal contact. While Trenchard focused on bombing industrial 53 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

H. Liddell Hart. An army captain during World War I, Liddell Hart became one of the leading strategic thinkers during the interwar period. He is best known for his theories on tank warfare, but he made one foray into the realm of air power with his slender volume, Paris: Or the Future o f War}1  While Liddell Hart echoes Douhet, he made more of an immediate impact by reaching a wider audience.8 2 These four figures heavily influenced America’s early thoughts on air power. One of the most visible proponents of air power in America was William “Billy” Mitchell, who served
