g a wider audience.8 2 These four figures heavily influenced America’s early thoughts on air power. One of the most visible proponents of air power in America was William “Billy” Mitchell, who served as Assistant Chief of the Air Service from 1919 to 1925. Mitchell had little contact with aviation until 1916 when he became deputy head of the Army’s tiny aviation section. He soon learned to fly in his spare time and took on the cause of advancing military aviation.8 3  In March 1917, on the eve of America’s declaration of war, the Army sent him to France as an aeronautical observer. While it is difficult to determine who had the greatest impact on Mitchell’s thinking, or when his theories first crystallized, he clearly was impressed by Caproni, Douhet, and Trenchard, and he first started forming his ideas during these early months as an observer.8 4  Mitchell was convinced the airplane had supplanted all other forms of warfare and that the only way his vision of air power would ever come to fruition would be through changing public attitudes. With that end in mind, in 1924 he began writing articles and books aimed at as wide an audience as possible. Mitchell felt bombing gave air power revolutionary potential and that modern war against an industrial nation made its entire population a key element in the war effort.8 5 54 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
