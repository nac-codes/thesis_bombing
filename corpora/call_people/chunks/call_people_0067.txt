d the Navy, and a host of other observers, when a group of Army aircraft under his direction sank several surrendered German warships, most notably the reputedly unsinkable battleship Ostfhesland.  Frustrated that the Army and Navy did not immediately come around to his way of thinking, Mitchell three years later detailed the bombing tests and outlined his grand vision of air power in a series of articles in The Saturday Evening Post.  Mitchell’s conclusion on the sinking of the O stfhesland  was emphatic: navies are obsolete, for aircraft can sink any ship with ease and air power can perform the Navy’s mission better.8 7  Mitchell went even farther and stated that in the air age “the destinies of all people will be controlled through the air.” In the future airplanes would bomb cities with high explosives and tear gas, industries would collapse, and the nation that struck first with its air fleet would win a complete victory: “an attack from an air force...may cause the complete evacuation and cessation of industry.... This would deprive armies, air forces, and navies, even, of their means of maintenance.”8 8  The following year, at the height of his court-martial publicity, Mitchell spelled out these ideas in fuller detail: To gain a lasting victory in war, the hostile nation’s power to make war must be destroyed - this means the manufactories [sic], the means of communication, the food products, even the farms, the fuel and oil and the places where people live and carry on their daily lives....
