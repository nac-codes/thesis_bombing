illustrate the enduring legacy of Mitchell’s image: on the eve of World War II the Air Corps dubbed its B-25 aircraft the Mitchell bomber, and in 1955, in a much more favorable political and cultural climate, latter-day air power advocates redeemed Mitchell and his theories in a cinematic paean, The Court-Martial o f Billy Mitchell!* Army fliers were not the only ones extolling the capabilities of air power. In 1924 Samuel Taylor Moore made one of the first mass-audience appeals for greater American 58 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

Writing in H arper’ sMagazine  Moore described the airplane’s ability to inflict great damage on cities and industry through bombing with high explosives, incendiaries, and poison gas. After a lengthy survey of aviation improvements around the world, Moore summed up by concluding simply, “Control of the air mocks all forms of defense in other wars. The only effective weapon against aircraft is more aircraft.”9 5  The next year, in an effort to get America to improve its air arm, famous aircraft designer Igor Sikorsky warned in an article published by The Independent  that New York City was vulnerable to a devastating surprise bombing attack from aircraft refueled and reloaded at sea by pre-positioned naval vessels. In describing the panic and paralysis that would follow such an attack, Sikorsky sounds remarkably like Wells in The War in the Air,  but there are two key differences. First, Sikorsky states in considerable detail why America’s navy could not stop such an attack, and that the effectiveness of air power to launch long- range attacks of this nature proves that land forces are no longer the “backbone” of a nation’s defenses. Secondly, Sikorsky’s warning was not meant to shock the world into abandoning air power as Wells had hoped to do; quite the contrary. Sikorsky hoped to shock America into
