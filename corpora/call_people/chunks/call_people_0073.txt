to convey its message. In fact, compared to Mitchell, Moore, and Sikorsky, Royse’s warning seems almost tame and overly technical. Michael Sherry has stated that the American public’s image of air power during the twenties was shaped more by civil aviation, and thus bombing remained in its eyes a benign force.9 9  The popular culture approach of those on either side of the air power debate suggests otherwise. With the both sides using similar graphic depictions as they competed to shape the public’s image of air power through mass media, one could hardly call the American public uninformed on the warplane’s brutal power. In the long run, the unanimous agreement between its advocates and critics that air power possessed such destructive potential may have helped the American public accept air power and strategic bombing with unexpected enthusiasm when war loomed in 1941.

All other types were variants from the standard. Note that Mitchell, Moore, Sikorsky, Royse, and Chase had all based their images of air power deliverance or disaster on the airplane as bomber. This conception is comparable to the army’s view that the infantry is the fundamental basis of land warfare, and the long-held naval view that the standard warship was the battleship.1 0 0  This distinction is not a trivial one, for it highlights how strongly the bombing advocates who arose in the Air Corps actually believed their theories. One point overlooked by scholars studying the rise of American strategi
