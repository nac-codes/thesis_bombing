p polls on the question of increasing the armed forces in the years leading up to World War II. The polls generally indicate a majority opinion that all forces should be increased, but the majority favoring an increased air force was consistently and markedly higher. In 1935 48% favored higher Army appropriations as opposed to 11% favoring smaller appropriations and 41% feeling they should remain the same. For the Navy the figures are 54%, 11%, and 35% respectively, but for air force appropriations the figures are 74%, 7%, and 19% respectively. This support was bipartisan and held generally the same percentages across all geographic regions.1 1 9  In January 1938, on the question of whether the U. S. should build larger forces, 74% favored a larger Navy, 69% favored a larger Army, but 80% favored a larger air force.1 2 0  By November 1938, shortly after the Munich Conference, the percentages had increased across the board to 86%, 82%, and 67 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

S. had begun increasing its forces. The latent support for air power, though, had been held in check throughout the interwar period by isolationism and anti-militarism. Once those were swept away by the passions evoked by Pearl Harbor, the latent support surfaced and air power seemed to many to be the perfect weapon. Moral qualms could easily be mollified by faith in the technological wonder that would allow America to bomb efficiently and humanely, both wonderful progressive images, not brutally and clumsily as enemy nations had done. The technological superiority image was reinforced by the mess
