in air power was the response to Gallup poll questions on the issue of air force independence. In July 1941 42% favored independence, 33% opposed it, and 25% were undecided. By August 1942, 44% of respondents claimed to be familiar with the issue and of those 57% favored independence while 27% opposed it and 16% had no opinion. By July 1943, apparently the last time the question was posed, of those familiar with the question 59% favored independence and 41% opposed it.1 2 6 Leaders of the Army Air Forces (AAF), as the Air Corps was known after June 1941, sensed this increased public support but worried that it would die out when the war was over.

For example, in 1943 the AAF conducted a study of its Public Relations Officers (PROs) posted with field units around the world and concluded that the AAF was missing a golden opportunity to ensure postwar public support for air power because its PROs were too poorly chosen and trained to get AAF exploits into the news.
