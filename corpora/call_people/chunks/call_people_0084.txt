tunity... to demonstrate the truth of everything that has been claimed by its adherents.... If the general public...comes to understand what Air Power is and what it can do, there is every likelihood we will maintain after this war an air establishment adequate for the nation’s security. On the other hand, if the present widespread misunderstanding is permitted to spread, it seems most likely that war-made public convictions will ensure...a public decision to junk the Air Forces and rely chiefly on increased naval power. Such a policy, of course, could cause defeat in the next war, under certain circumstances.”1 2 * Air power advocates’  efforts to shape and exploit popular support during the war is a well known phenomenon which has received considerable analysis, but several topics bear brief examination in the context of this study. As late as 1941 AAF leaders Arnold and Eaker were telling the public that AAF strategy relied on industrial bombing at night, and they describe in great detail how they would achieve pin-point accuracy despite bombing in darkness.1 2 9  In the summer of 1941, though, when Roosevelt asked the military for force requirements if America went to war, the AAF presented a far different picture. To project and justify AAF requirements the newly formed Air War Plans Division (AWPD), made up of former ACTS instructors, developed a comprehensive plan built around their concept of daylight precision bombing.
