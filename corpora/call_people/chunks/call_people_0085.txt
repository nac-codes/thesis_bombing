and the AAF suddenly found overt public support for air power, it began publicizing as its main strategy a doctrine perfectly suited to the image of bombing which the public was most prepared to embrace: technologically sophisticated, efficient to the point of appearing scientific, and humane in its emphasis on precision. One early example of the AAFâ€™s effort to win popular support for its bombing methods was the 1943 movie Air Force,  a feature film which was seen by millions of movie-goers and which received generally favorable reviews. The film was directed by Howard Hawks, a World War I Army pilot and director of The Dawn Patrol,  and AAF leaders played a central role in shaping the movie from start to finish. Arnold had consulted with Jack Warner, of Warner Brothers Studios, about the film at its inception and remained personally involved at various stages, and AAF technical advisor Captain Samuel Triffy helped mold the central concept and write the script.1 3 1 The film not only depicts the heroic exploits of the crew of a B-17 in the opening days of the war, it elevates the image of American technical superiority and bombing accuracy to absurd levels. In one scene, according to the script, the crew drops only three bombs but sinks one cruiser and two transports. At the same time the gunners shoot down three out of six Japanese fighters before they are themselves forced to crash-land. In the movie version the bombing was cut out to heighten the dramatic effect of the final battle scene, but the gunners shoot down seven out of nine planes.1 3 2  While the public did not see this first display of bombing prowess, it illustrates the image Hollywood and AAF leaders wished to convey to the public. Later, in the climactic battle scene the crew joins a larger force attacking a Japanese fleet and drops three salvos of bombs sinking one tanker, 71 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
