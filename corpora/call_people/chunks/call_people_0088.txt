A self-described aviation enthusiast, Disney claimed to have concluded earlier that air power held the key to victory in World War II and felt that educating Americans about air power through the film was an important civic duty.1 4 2  The film set de Seversky’s ideas into Disney’s characteristically impressive and effective images, but those images conveyed the dichotomous nature of de Seversky’s view of bombing in ways both subtle and overt. In numerous instances throughout the film, bombers are shown hig
