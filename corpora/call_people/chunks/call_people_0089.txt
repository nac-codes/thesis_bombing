and effective images, but those images conveyed the dichotomous nature of de Seversky’s view of bombing in ways both subtle and overt. In numerous instances throughout the film, bombers are shown high overhead raining bombs down indiscriminately on enemy cities below, but when the illustrator gives the audience a close-up view of the scene on the ground, only factories are destroyed, reinforcing America’s faith that their bombing is almost miraculously accurate.

When focusing on the German situation, the lines of communication 74 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

This image was graphically rendered for the audience by showing fewer and fewer weapons coming out of the pipelines, thus allowing the ground forces to smash through the wheel’s rim. This was a fairly innocuous depiction emphasizing the military nature of the bombers’  targets.
