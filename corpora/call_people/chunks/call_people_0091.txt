t this does not tell the whole story of public perceptions of American bombing, for other voices also projected images of air power that proved quite popular with the public. De Seversky’s popularity disseminated darker images that meshed with passions generated within the American public by the war to create a public mood advocating bombing enemy cities and civilians.1 4 5  Anxious for revenge and desparate to shorten the war and save American lives, the public was willing to use any weapon that promised to accomplish these goals, even if it meant adopting methods that only a few years earlier would have sparked moral outrage.

A United States News  pictograph on the eve of Pearl Harbor extolled America’s ability to bomb Japanese cities, which it points out were comprised of “rice-paper and wood houses,” while a wartime Life magazine pictograph depicted a blanket of bombers a mile wide and 117 miles long.

The celebratory text makes it clear that the incendiaries are burning homes and causing large numbers of civilian casualties. The accompanying illustration shows a highway leading to a city engulfed in flames. By the road is a signpost labeled “U.S. Route 40" leading from Utah to Tokyo.1 4 7  Government
