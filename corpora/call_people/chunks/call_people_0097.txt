Air Power  (McLean, Va.: EPM Publications, 1980) is a good place to start for the efforts of early military fliers in support of air power, but it should be used with caution - many historians consider it little more than thinly-veiled hagiography; for early aircraft industry leaders Wayne Biddle, Barons o f the Sky  (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1991) is informative and much more balanced. 56.
