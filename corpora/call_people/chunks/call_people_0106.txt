ring the war generated support for, and interest in, air power topics within the American populace; (2) the threat of the Cold War and the nuclear arms race made the public susceptible to the technological messianism air power seemed to offer, and of course, (3) aviation and war topics had long been ripe fields for romanticism and high drama in many media of popular culture.

They saw the widespread public support the war had engendered for their cause, and they saw danger to America in the world around them, a danger they felt only air power could meet. All this would have been enough to prompt air power advocates to redouble their efforts after the war, but their energies were further mobilized by their fear that their critics would once again subjugate and scuttle American air power, that the public’s faith did not go deep enough, that somehow the dreams of air power they had so long and fervently nurtured for would once again fall short of their goal. To understand the popular culture campaign, therefore, we need to understand the new generation of postwar air power advocates and the means by which they sought to bring about the air power revolution. This chapter will examine some of the individuals who singly and collectively carried forward the cause and the methods and media they used to convey that message. The list of individuals who advocated air power is a long and varied one and we have already met some of them in the interwar period.
