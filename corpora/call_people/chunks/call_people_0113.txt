- ideas, discuss them with Crawford, Crawford would then type a rough draft which Spaatz would then edit, and together they would write the finished product.1 7  While this certainly weakens Spaatz’s reputation as a writer it does not change the fact that Spaatz enjoyed the opportunity to routinely place his ideas about air power before a major segment of the reading public over a long period of time. Spaatz’s thoughts on air power, as expressed in popular media, show more depth than Arnold’s, and those thoughts changed somewhat over time and in response to Cold War events. IBs April 1946 article in Foreign Affairs , “Strategic Air Power: Fulfillment of a Concept,” shows a near complete espousal of strategic bombing of ACTS tradition with its emphasis on industrial paralysis and its assertion that surface forces operate on the periphery while air power strikes immediately and directly at the enemy’s heart. This same article, though, also shows the dichotemous rationalization of strategic bombing’s Douhet tradition of brutal force, for Spaatz states that the same strategic air power concept that worked so well against Germany was applied in the same manner to Japan.1 8  He continued much the same line of reasoning two years later in his premiere Newsweek article when he asserted that strategic bombing had done much to defeat Germany and Japan.1 9  His exclusive emphasis on strategic bombing softened over time, though, and once the Korean War started he began urging build up of both the Army and Navy.2 0 IRA C EAKER As an air power publicist, Ira C.
