rly, LeMay corresponded with another air power advocate, Arthur Godfrey, and their letters make plan that LeMay played the central role in converting the famous television and radio star from supporting the Navy to backing the Air Force.3 6 In assessing the image LeMay put before the American public as part of the popular culture crusade, one encounters two problems. The first is that throughout the period under study LeMay was on active duty and held highly visible senior leadership positions. As such he would be expected, some might even say compelled, to make statements or voice opinions that reflect current official policy rather than his own personal views. For this reason LeMay’s public statements that seem to fit more in the category of news or official statements have been generally left out of this study.
