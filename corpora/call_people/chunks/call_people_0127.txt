apocalyptic view of American air power, but the key phrase in Huie’s tirade is “if Russia attacks us.” Huie saw the world confronted by a grave danger and wanted to avoid another devastating war; note the emphasis Huie places on the word “must” in the title of his article. He could visualize the awesome power of the tradition of Douhet and he felt that power could deliver the world of great evil, first Hitler, and after the war the Bolsheviks.

BEISNELAY, JR. The figures of Beime Lay, Jr., and Sy Bartlett represent not only two significant air power advocates, but also a phenomenon that helps explain some of the driving force behind the crusade for air power in the postwar period.
