The plot then revolves around the drama of who will win the argument, and by extension, the war. If Dennis silences his many critics strategic bombing will prove its potential and win the war, if his critics prevail then German air power will by default prevail. In either case, according to Haines, the war will be decided in the air. The only question for Haines is whether Americans have the mettle to use the most decisive weapon despite its high costs in men and materiel. Surface forces are treated as superfluous and inconsequential to the larger struggle going on over their heads - both figuratively and literally. While Haines and Huie both share technological messianistic views of salvation wrought by air power and present those views to the public, they approach the subject from opposite perspectives. Huie’s view reflects the Douhet tradition of apocalyptic destruction, Haines’  views embody the ACTS tradition of scientific precision yielding surgical paralysis. In fact, the theorists of the ACTS could hardly ask for a more faithful and powerful presentation of their theories. Haines even goes to the extent of couching his depiction in the old imagery of the progressive struggle against “the interests” , the young, dedicated Dennis pits his “modem” theories against the evils of interservice in­ fighting and political chicanery in a way that wins the sympathies of all good progressives over to Dennis, and by extension, the cause of strategic bombing and air power.
