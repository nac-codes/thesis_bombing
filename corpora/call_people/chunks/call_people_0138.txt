l.7 3  The revolutionary impact of air power is frequently highlighted, as when in 1947 he compares it to Columbus’  voyages, or again on 1  August of the same year, designated Air Force Day, when a character states that the nation should never forget the “awful power” of warplanes and let another Pearl Harbor occur; the strip also carries the logo “Air Power is Peace Power.”7 4  In the postwar setting Canyon was a fighter pilot, and while this gave numerous opportunities to extoll various fighter missions, such as air defense, Caniff also emphasized strategic bombing.
