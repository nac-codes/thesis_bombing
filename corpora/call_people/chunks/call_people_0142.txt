egic force to keep the Soviets from launching an attack. In 1953 Godfrey stated in an interview with the International News Service that while the Air Force could still launch a tremenous nuclear strike against the Soviet Union, failure to put B-52s into full scale production had left SAC’s bomber fleet inadequate and obsolete. He further stated that a large B-52 force would “probably be the greatest deterrent to World War HI that it is in our power to decide.”8 5  Godfrey repeated this same basic message in other settings, such as speeches before various groups, and whenever he talked he made news, thus magnifying the audience of his message.8 6  Godfrey also saw Air Force troop morale as an important key to air power and he used his electronic soapbox to boost morale. In this effort he filmed shows at Air Force bases, including remote Thule, Greenland, he suggested to LeMay a system of Air Force-run television stations at remote bases and donated his shows to be broadcast on the system, and he fought for military pay raises.8 7 Godfrey’s message may not have been profound, but he reached millions, many of whom put great trust in his words, and he reached them on a consistent basis throughout much of the Fifties; in this way he not only reinforced the more profound thoughts on air power voiced by other advocates, he also probably did more than anyone else to popularize the air power gospel with the masses. 123 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
