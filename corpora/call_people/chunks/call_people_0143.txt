in the Revolution, both grandfathers fought for the Union in the Civil War, and his father fought with the Rough Riders in the Spanish- American War and served in France in World War I. Stewart left the family-owned hardware store to graduate from Princeton, as his father had, in 1931, and then pursued an acting career in which, by 1941, he had achieved considerable fame.8 8  Stewart showed an early interest in flying - at the age of four he tried to fly a pushmobile off the roof of a shed - and by 1941 owned his own plane and part of Southwest Airways. In March 1941 he became the first Hollywood star to enlist, and he was also the first to see combat. Significantly, Stewart could have easily avoided service as well as combat.
