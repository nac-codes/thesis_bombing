The group sought grass-roots activity in the local community through the organization’s squadrons scattered across the country. Planned squadron activities included speakers bureaus, aviation courses in public schools, model plane and glider activities, air shows, scholarships, and many other activities. While this sounds impressive, there are signs that the reality did not live up to the goal. Throughout most of the period covered by this study the AFA suffered from low membership and struggling local squadrons. Early enthusiasm brought in 158,000 members in the first three and a half years, but in that same period 88,000 dropped out. After an initial high point of 102,492 in 1948 membership dropped to 36,961 in 1951 and remained in the 36- 40 thousand range until 1956 when it rose to 52,299, but lagged again, reaching only 55,640 by I960.1 7  This problem with membership manifested itself in problems at the local squadron level. In 1948 the Association claimed units in over 200 communities, but by 1954 that figure was down to 109 squadrons and in 1960 it had risen to only 149. Moreover, a 1959 AFA survey found that many squadrons had fewer than 20 new members and that 13 squadrons had had their charters suspended for low membership.1 8 With the local units struggling, the emphasis of effort shifted even further toward its magazine as the group’s main outreach for it was advertising revenues, mostly from industrial sources, that kept the Association solvent. After a rough start financially, the magazine soon recovere
