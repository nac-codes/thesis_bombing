Overall, the report adhered so closely to what many air power advocates and AAF leaders were saying for and about the AAF that the League felt constrained to include a disclaimer that their report did not reflect official AAF policy.2 8 Sometime before 1948 the Air Power League changed its name to the National Air Council and dramatically altered its approach to advancing air power. Still organized as a non-profit foundation and still seeking corporate and organizational contributions, it now set $500 as the minimum annual contribution and gave certain minor privileges that went along with becoming an “accredited Company Member.” Examples of privileges included being listed in the Council’s periodic roster of company members and company executives receiving free copies of the Council’s journal. Individuals could still join the Council, and minimum annual dues remained at $50. Another indicator of strong continuity between the two groups is that fully 75% of the League’s officers and directors, 24 out of 32, remained as the Council’s officers, or on its Executive Board of Managers and Board of Governors. New additions to the Council’s leadership include Thomas K. Finletter, who 149 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
