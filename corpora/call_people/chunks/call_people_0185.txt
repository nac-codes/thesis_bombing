He was an outspoken proponent of strategic air power and a harsh critic of the Navy, and throughout his tenure with American Mercury , he held the key position to project his views through a popular general interest magazine with a national readership.

The list of charter members of the Air Power League, as well as the list of executives of the League and its successor the National Air Council, is a veritable treasure trove for anyone seeking to find behind-the-scenes air power advocacy within the print media. Several publishers of newspapers large and small, for example, affiliated with the League. Such figures include William Randolph Hearst, Jr., publisher of the New York Journal-American  and head of the Hearst Corporation, Frank E. Gannett, of the Gannett newspapers group, and Eugene Meyer, editor and publisher of The Washington Post.  The list of publishers and editors who became charter members bears inclusion to grasp its full magnitude. Amon G.
