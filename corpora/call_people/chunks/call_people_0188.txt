the magazine’s founder, Robert J. Collier. Owner and long-time editor of the magazine, Collier was an avid flier, a friend of the Wright Brothers, and an early proponent of both aviation and air power. In 1911 he was concerned that the Army had only one airplane, so he bought a Wright-B flier and loned it to the Army until it could find money enough to buy more. In 1911 he also established the Collier Trophy as an award to be given annually for outstanding achievement in aviation; the award often recognized advances in civilian aviation, but it also frequently went to such military figures as H.H.

Collier's supported the Army and the Navy and frequently ran articles sympathetic to their needs. In general the magazine was decidedly pro-military and advocated strong national defense across the board, but the Air Force always seemed to be the “apple of its eye.” A
