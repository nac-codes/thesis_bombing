s sympathetic to their needs. In general the magazine was decidedly pro-military and advocated strong national defense across the board, but the Air Force always seemed to be the “apple of its eye.” Air power articles clearly and consistently outnumbered articles on the other services, and air policy was rarely questioned, except to say that the Air Force did not have enough planes or was being suppressed in some way. The issue marking the 45th anniversary of the Wright Brothers’  first flight was almost entirely given over to celebrating the advancement of aviation, and air power figured prominently in the commemoration. C ollier’ s  even expanded its pro-aviation and air power stance in the fifties to include the full commercial and military exploitation of space.5 0 The R eader’ s Digest  was another major outlet for works by air power advocates. Bearing the distictive stamp of its founder Roy DeWitt Wallace, the Reader’ s  Digest  was staunchly pro-military and anti-communist throughout the period, but like C ollier’ s , its air power articles far exceeded its Army or Navy articles. This may be in part a result of the fact that aviation and military affairs constituted two of the 25 main categories Wallace stressed upon his editors in selecting articles for the magazine. Thus military aviation, which combined both categories, may have had a special place in Wallace’s heart. Whatever the reason, after World War II the Reader’ s Digest  dedicated itself to advancing strategic air power. In 1948, for example, senior editor Paul Palmer wrote to Spaatz, “We 165 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
