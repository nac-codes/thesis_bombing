The Civil Air Patrol began during the early years of World War II before America’s entry. Originally intended to enlist America’s civilian pilots in efforts to boost air defenses, by the end of the war the CAP was participating in anti-submarine warfare off America’s coasts and patroling for enemy aircraft. After the war it dropped its air defense mission and assumed its current missions of aiding in disaster relief efforts and searching for downed aircraft and people lost or injured in inaccessable areas. For a useful study of the CAP see Frank A. Burnham, Hero Next Door  (Fallbrook, Calif.: Aero Publishers, 1974). 35. 19 July and 26 July 1949 letters to H.H. Arnold, Eaker Papers, Box I: 29, LOC. 36. Two studies on the American Legion are Raymond Moley, Jr., The American Legion Story  (New York: Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1966), and Thomas A. Rumer, The American Legion: An Official History, 1919-1989  (New York: M. Evans and Co., 1990); while dated, Roscoe Baker, The American Legion and American Foreign Policy  (New York: Bookman Associates, 1954) is a study of how the Legion’s organization and methods help bring pressure to bear in achieving its goals; thus it examines the topic of our study during the period of our study; see 20-25 for contemporary assessment of League’s effectiveness. 37.
