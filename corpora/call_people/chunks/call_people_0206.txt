Postwar air power advocates saw great economic consequences for international trade and air travel arising from exploitation of this concept. W.B. Courtney for example, warned in a 1947 C ollier’ s  article that America lagged behind Britain and the Soviet Union in the development of commercial air transportation and air liners able to take advantage of opportunities presented by the polar concept, and urged immediate action to avoid being locked out of the future trans-polar trade routes.7 Air power advocates seized upon the polar concept and made it a part of their message that air power brought a new threat from a previously unimagined direction, a threat that only air power could meet. In a December 1945 Collier's  article Spaatz stated that intercontinental atomic war was already a reality, because, by flying over the arctic, a B-29 could reach any potential adversary in the northern hemisphere, “where, curiously enough, all of the great powers lie.” The article includes a polar projection map of the northern hemisphere that shows the distance from Chicago to such countries as Japan, China, India, and Britain.* Ira Eaker expanded upon this point in a 1946 speech on the Army-sponsored radio program So Proudly We Hail: All the prime industrial powers of the world are located above  the 30 degree, north latitude line.... Every great industrial center can be hit by a plane with the B-29's range, flying from a base near the Arctic Circle. An enemy plane could make a one-way crossing of the polar area, the shortest air route, and strike any of our key manufacturing zones.9 The Air Power League stress
