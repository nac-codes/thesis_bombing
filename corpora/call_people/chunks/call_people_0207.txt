from a base near the Arctic Circle. An enemy plane could make a one-way crossing of the polar area, the shortest air route, and strike any of our key manufacturing zones.9 The Air Power League stressed these same sentiments in both February and September of 1946,1 0  but Alexander de Seversky gave the concept its fullest delineation.

The article even includes a half-page graphic illustration to reinforce the point. When de Seversky incorporated this article into his 1950 book A ir Power: Key to Survival , he expanded the point to include its commercial implications, which he felt dictated America’s economic domination of South America, but by this time many were familiar with the polar concept.1 1 The military implications of the polar concept quickly caught on in America’s popular media, but its wider cultural image did not. Writers who were not necessarily connected to the air power cause soon joined the air power advocates in warning of the air threat from the north. In 1946, for example, William Veazie Pratt, a retired admiral, former Navy CNO, and a Newsweek  correspondent long noted for his cooperative attitude toward the Army and the AAF, used the polar concept as his main argument for Air Force independence. In his regular Newsweek  column Pratt stated that the arctic region would become a main theater for any future conflict, and because of its inhospitable climate, only land-based air would be able to operate effectively in that region.1 2  Similarly, John Kord Lagemann, in a 1946 C ollier’ s  article, stated that unlike the last two thousand years where civilization centered around the Mediterranean, for the next two thousa
