He claimed that the region above the 30th parallel contained 98% of the world industry and 90% of the world’s population. He warned, though, that this entire region was within striking range of B-29-type bombers 181 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

Under these circumstances, he claimed, “the power which controls the arctic airspace controls the w orld"1 3 It is interesting to note that Spaatz’s and Pratt’s articles, Eaker’s speech, and the two Air Power League pamphlets mention no specific enemy. The threat could come from any nation on the Eurasian land mass north of the 30 degree north latitude. By 1947, when de Seversky first wrote of the polar concept, tensions with the Soviets had escalated to the point that he mentions them as the West’s only adversary. Finally, by February 1950 the concept of a holocaust coming at America from over the North Pole had become so firmly entrenched that a Life magazine article discussing the threat of aerial attack includes a depiction of a proposed series of interlocking radar stations protecting North America.1 4  By 1950, then, the concept had been reduced to a grim reality of the Cold War but the larger vision of a new world view fell by the wayside.
