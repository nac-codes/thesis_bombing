In each case, though, buried within their pages, the pamphlets also pointed out that unification would bring Air Force independence.2 3 Air power advocates’  support for unification frequently led to attacks on the Navy, which opposed unification, and started a long pattern of postwar conflict between the two that culminated in the “Revolt of the Admirals” in 1949. Lay, for example, stated that the Navy and its secretary, James Forrestal, were using delaying tactics in the public debate hoping that the public would forget about the issue. And Charles E.

There is little doubt that advancing the air power c
