image in the public’s eye. Thus a recurring theme in the popular culture campaign was an effort to elevate Mitchell to the status of a far-sighted visionary who was martyred for his efforts to prepare America for the dangers that lay ahead. The spoken message emphasized that events proved that the nation should have listened to him despite his traditionalist critics, but the unspoken message was clear as well: America should also heed postwar air power advocates when they warned about the current need for air power. The revisionist effort on behalf of Mitchell stretches back to at least the war years. In 1942, for example, de Seversky dedicated both the book and movie versions of Victory Through A ir Power  to Mitchell, and took these opportunities to tell America that a grave injustice had occurred. In the film de Seversky called Mitchell one of history’s “men of vision” who foresaw the war but was ignored and vilified. That same year and the next saw the publication of two laudatory biographies of Mitchell, one bearing the leading title Billy Mitchell, Founder o f Our A ir Force and Prophet Without Honor?1 After the war, though, redemption efforts hit full stride as numerous air power advocates paid homage to Mitchell. Some of the testimonials made on his behalf were quite subtle. A sample speech distributed to all AAF units in 1946, for example, recalls the memory of fallen airmen from the war and then lists Mitchell as “foremost in our affection” for he “fought against hopeless odds...to have air power recognized as the mighty weapon it is.” And in the play, novel, and movie versions of Command Decision the hero, Brigadier General Dennis, names his firstborn son after Mitchell.3 2 188 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
