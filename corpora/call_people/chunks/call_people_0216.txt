Courtney claimed that Mitchell had been the pioneer of “real air-power thinking.” Trenchard had been of the same mind, but Douhet had been impractical. More important, though, is that Courtney claimed that the Germans had been Mitchell’s closest students during the interwar years and that applying his lessons made their initial victories possible. But because they did not fully trust those lessons, Courtney added, they shackled air power’s true potential and were defeated by American air power.3 3  In a similar vein the Air Power League credited Mitchell with inventing the concept of vertical envelopment, that is, flying over the enemy forces to strike them in the rear.3 4  These claims that Mitchell was a pioneer air power theorist are clearly exaggerated, for as Mitchell’s biographer states, “he borrowed his ideas largely from the international community of airmen which he joined during World War I.”3 S Another frequent claim was that Mitchell had foreseen World War II and its basic character, a point Huie, for example, makes repeatedly in his 1946 indictment of the Navy, The Case Against the Admirals.  Huie even took to affecting Mitchell’s colorful language, as in a 1949 Reader's Digest  article when he referred to Army and Navy leaders who opposed air power as “the Maginot minds, the yeamers for Yesterday.”3 6  Arnold himself undertook a comprehensive effort to reform the public memory of Mitchell through his 1949 memoirs. Throughout his chapters on World War I and the interwar period Arnold portrays his friend and mentor as a brash but visionary patriot who sacrificed himself to gain air power for America. At one point Arnold states that he counseled caution but that Mitchell voiced his determination to sacrifice himself to make the Army and Navy listen. 189 Reproduced with permission of the co
