rong or stronger than it had been before the war. As we shall see, this faith extended to an attempt to prove that strategic bombing had won the war, but it also shaped air power advocates’  conviction that the main effort of any future war would involve a massive bombing campaign aimed at the enemy’s industrial base. Spaatz gave this conviction its fullest expression in a 1946 Foreign A ffairs  article. Spaatz called strategic bombing “the most powerful instrument of war thus far known,” because it was: the first war instrument of history capable of stopping the heart mechanism of a great industrialized enemy. It paralyzes his military power at the core.... it has a capacity...to carry a tremendous striking force...over the traditional line of war (along which the surface forces are locked in battle on land and sea) in order to destroy war industries and arsenals and cities...in fact, the heart and the arteries of war economy - so that the enemy’s will to resist is broken through nullification of his means.4 4 While carefully avoiding the claim that strategic bombing won World War n, Spaatz nonetheless claimed that strategic bombing’s unique capabilities meant that the next war would likely be determined by air power before surface forces were able to engage the enemy in combat.4 5 194 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Most other works, including most by Spaatz, fitted the atomic bomb squarely into the predictions of strategic bombing’s revolutionary capabilities. This is ironic because America’s supply of atomic bombs remained so low for so long that for many years any strategic bombing campaign would have, by necessity, relied heavily on conventional bombing.4 6  This was
