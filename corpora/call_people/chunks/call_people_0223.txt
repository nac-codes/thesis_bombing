Early public reaction to the atomic bomb showed a strange mixture of emotions ranging from fear and anxiety to awe and admiration. Despite misgivings, though, nuclear weapons for national defense enjoyed strong public support.4 7 Air power advocates quickly seized upon the range of public emotions toward the atomic bomb to portray air power as at once the shocking face of future warfare and the only means of protecting America from grave danger.
