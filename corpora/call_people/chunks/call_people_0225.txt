A month later Francis Vivian Drake, writing for the Reader's Digest,  claimed that atomic bombs were already much more powerful than the ones dropped on Japan, and mounting these new bombs on missiles posed a grave threat to America. Such weapons were impossible to stop Drake observed, noting that “no V-2 was ever intercepted ”5 1 Air power advocates stressed the image of a nuclear threat to America as a means of presenting air power as the only defense against this new threat that was itself based upon attack through the air. Such an approach relied heavily upon the tradition of technological messianism long inherent in the popular fascination with aviation, for air power advocates were setting up an air power bogeyman and then offering air power as the nation’s only hope of salvation. In this effort they became early proponents of nuclear deterrence. After painting the specter of nuclear-tipped missiles devastating American cities, Arnold, in his November 1945 article, stated that the only defense against such an attack was a strong strategic air force in-being poised to retaliate against any nation that launched such an attack.S 2  It is significant to note that this early enunciation of the deterrent role of air power was made before any other nation had acquired nuclear weapons and before the Soviet Union emerged as the main adversary of the West. In laying out this argument Arnold presented a theme that would remain a standard feature of the popular culture crusade throughout its duration, and most air power advocates adhered closely to Arnold’s original lines. The Air Power League in September 1946 stated that armies and navies were in many circumstances ineffective as a deterrent, but that air power was “the best preventive of aggression that exists.” It then drove the point 197 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
