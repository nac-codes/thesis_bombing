not matter, though, for the popular culture campaign dealt largely in images, and the image of precision and the crippling effect of knocking out enemy industry was interwoven into images of the atomic bomb’s revolutionary destructive capability. One wonders if the general public, upon reflection, truly believed de Seversky’s claim that atomic bombs could take out factories without killing the cities and civilians surrounding them, but on the popular imagination level the emphasis on precision and industrial targeting helped “sell” postwar American strategic bombing by continuing the image that it was efficient, progressive, and scientific. The images of “pickle barrel” bombing could, in effect, mitigate the images of Hiroshima. One of the chief means of emphasizing the tradition of precision industrial bombing was the effort to establish continuity between wartime precision bombing and postwar nuclear bombing. And to establish precision industrial bombing as a valid part of the air power revolution air power advocates had to reinterpret the World War II strategic bombing campaign to prove that it had won the war just as interwar prophets had said it would.
