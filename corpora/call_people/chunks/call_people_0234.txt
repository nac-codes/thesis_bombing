ermany, but that it could not have won the war alone because time did not permit such an approach. After he had retired, though, and in the more public arena of his Newsweek  column, Spaatz was less diplomatic. In September 1948 he alluded to the “rubble-heaped industrial plants of Europe” as testimony to strategic bombing’s effectiveness, and in March 1949 he stated that by defeating the Luftwaffe bombing had made the invasion of Europe possible.6 2  It is interesting to note how Spaatz implies that destruction equals effectiveness, and in listing the seizure of air superiority as one of strategic bombing’s contributions Spaatz neglects the fact that that was not the main contribution predicted for bombing both before and after the war. The Air Force Day 1946 publicity package sent out by the Public Affairs Office was also careful how it stated its claims for wartime bombing. While a sample speech states that strategic bombing was “a decisive factor in winning the war,” it also added that air power cooperated with the Army in ground battles and that it “worked with the Navy in patrolling the sea lanes.”6 3 Other air power advocates were less equivocal. In one of the rare references to both theaters, Arnold, in a 1946 radio address stated emphatically that the war was won by getting “bombs on the Messerschmitt plant at Regensburg or the Zero plant outside Tokyo.”6 4  W.B. Courtney expanded the point and stated flatly, “Air power caused the war in Europe. Air power won the war in Europe.” He went on to explain that air power had given the Germans the confidence to launch their war of conquest but their misuse of air power had cost them the war. Furthermore, he stated that had the Allies devoted more resources to the bombing effort air power could have won the war sooner and with less cost.6 5  In its first publication in August 1945 the Air Power League quoted German Field 205 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
