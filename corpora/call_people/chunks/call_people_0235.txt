and with less cost.6 5  In its first publication in August 1945 the Air Power League quoted German Field 205 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

It eliminated fuel, destroyed railways, shut off supplies of raw materials from outside Germany, smashed war production centers.”6 6  And in a round-about fashion de Seversky argued that strategic bombing did not win the war because the Army and the Navy would not let the AAF fight the war the way it wanted to, and the way he had recommended. Still, he claimed, despite being relegated to a supporting role for the ground forces, strategic bombing was decisive in Europe.6 7 Such claims were tenuous on the surface because Germany had not surrendered until most of its territory had been occupied and Hitler was dead, and the Navy had a valid argument that it contributed the decisive forces in defeating Japan. Air power advocates tried to prove their case through less obvious evidence, and one of the favorite tactics was to quote from the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey. Conducted in both Europe and Japan after the war, the USSBS was an effort to assess the effectiveness of strategic bombing on the Axis war effort. Teams of civilian and military leaders and specialists pored over records, conducted interviews, and examined target areas and published their findings and conclusions in dozens of volumes and reports. Ail told, there were enough facts, figures, and statements to support just about any claim.6 8  Spaatz, for example, in his 7 March 1949 Newsweek  column, quoted the overall assessment of the USSBS: “The German experience suggests that even a first-class military power - rugged and resilient as Germany was - can not live long under full-scale and free exploitation of air weapons over the heart of its territory.”6 9  Two
