ggests that even a first-class military power - rugged and resilient as Germany was - can not live long under full-scale and free exploitation of air weapons over the heart of its territory.”6 9  Two could play at this game, though, and the Navy’s partisans used the USSBS to show that bombing had been a costly waste of lives and resources. 206 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Stahlman, for example, prepared a pamphlet attacking Air Force policies, particularly its attachment to strategic bombing, and circulated it among his “several hundred” friends in the newspaper business. Stahlman, a former Navy reservist, quoted extensively from the USSBS to show that strategic bombing had had little effect on German war production, that tactical bombing was more effective than strategic bombing, and that bombers were vulnerable without escorting fighters.7 0  That both sides could use the USSBS to their own advantage is shown by two articles published by R eader’ s Digest in a “point - counter-point” feature. Arguing for the Navy, Fletcher Pratt quoted the survey to show that German war production in 1944, when the bombing campaign was reaching its peak, actually increased. Francis Vivian Drake countered that Pratt was misreading the USSBS, and he marshaled his own quotes to show that in 1944 strategic bombing cut output of aviation gasoline by 90%, nitrogen by 90%, and steel by 80%.7 1 The most effective means of extolling the contribution of strategic bombing in the war, though, came through two works of fiction that were turned into popular movies. Twelve O ’ clock High  and Command Decision  together perhaps did more to establish the image of strategic bombing as a critical part of America’s war effort in the public consciousness than all the articles, books, and speeches by all the other air power advocates combined. In the process they were crucial t
