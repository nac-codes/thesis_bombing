In 1948 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer turned the play into a movie that brought in over $3 million and stood at eighteen on the list of the year’s most popular movies. The movie’s screenplay was coauthored by William R. Laidlaw, an Air Force Reserve colonel and veteran of the Eighth Air Force, and George Froeschel, and their script followed the play closely.

On one side of the conflict are the critics of air power and strategic bombing. Pitted against them is “Brigadier General 212 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner
