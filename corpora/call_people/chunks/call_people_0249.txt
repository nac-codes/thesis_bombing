realized before, some might think, surely they must have a unique insight into the future of war. This at least was what air power advocates thought about themselves and what they hoped others would think. The images they presented about the revolution in warfare did appear to many as revolutionary. They were also appealing. Promises of quick, easy, and cheap victory had a powerful attraction for people with memories of two world wars. Between the revolutionary and the appealing imagery air power advocates succeeded dramatically in winning the American public over to their way of thinking.

When asked again in October 1953, after the Korean War had ended, the percentage of Americans expressing faith in air power jumped to 81%. Two years later when the question was asked for the last time that figure fell to 71%. This faith also translated into support for a larger Air Force. In 1952, in the midst of the Korean War, 54% of Americans surveyed said the Air Force should be built up further as opposed to 11% for the Army and 8% for the Navy. Four years later, when asked what additional defense money should be spent on, 59% called for more strategic air power weapons while only 14% called for more ground forces and 11% favored more aircraft carriers.9 7 But their images were also too simplistic and combined contradictory traditions to mollify shocking implications if people thought about the images too deeply. All future wars, even before the Soviet Union emerged as the main adversary, appeared as generic conflicts that could be quickly resolved with the same prescription: strategic atomic bombing.
