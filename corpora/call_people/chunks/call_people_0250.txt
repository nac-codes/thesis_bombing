The war would be almost instantaneously fought and won with the adversary unable to counter, react to, or negate the effects of American bombing. And finally the postwar situation never intruded on the images of future war to suggest that the wholesale atomic bombing of one’s adversary might have unanticipated side-effects such as anger and resentment among the defeated population or international opprobrium. Moreover, the traditions of Douhet and the ACTS, utter devastation versus surgical, scientific precision and efficiency, were conflated into one. The atomic bomber would obliterate all before it, but it would also paralyze the enemy’s defenses and leave the innocent civilians thankful they had been spared. All of this while delivering the American people from fear and high casualties as well as easing the tax burden. The images air power advocates placed before the American people through the popular culture campaign may have differed from the images that emerged from debate in other venues, such as newspapers, Congress or the Pentagon, but they were powerful images that shaped how average Americans viewed air power at a deep and visceral level. As such, the images of the air power revolution are important to understanding the overall place of air power in America during the Cold War. These popular culture images would change over the next decade and a half as a result of events throughout the period, but it is important to appreciate the contours and textures of the images created by the air power advocates as the halcyon days of the popular culture crusade came to an end. 219 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
