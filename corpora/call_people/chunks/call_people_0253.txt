Much has been written on the interwar drive for an independent Air Force. The best place to start is Futrell, Ideas, Concepts, Doctrine,  particularly chapters 2 and 3. A wide range of perspectives can be found in Thomas H. Greer, The Development o f A ir Doctrine in the Army Air Arm, 1917-1941  (Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala.: USAF Historical Division, Research Studies Institute, Air University, 1955; reprint, Washington, D.C.: Office of Air Force History, 1985), Sherry, Rise o f American A ir Power,  and DeWitt S. Copp, A Few Great Captains: The Men and Events That Shaped the Development o f U.S. Air Power  (McLean, Va.: EPM Publications, 1980). 21. Less has been written on the subject of postwar efforts to secure an independent Air Force. Futrell, Ideas, Concepts, Doctrine  is also a good place to start on this topic, as are Perry McCoy Smith, The A ir Force Plans fo r Peace, 1943-1945  (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1970), and Herman S. Wolk, Planning and Organizing the Postwar Air Force, 1943-1947  (Washington, D.C.: Office of Air Force History, 1984). 221 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
