Not only did critics publicly dispute their conception of air power and national defense, but other events arose that raised serious questions about the air power advocates’  priorities and theories. The challenges during this period included the Revolt of the Admirals, the Soviet detonation of an atomic bomb, and the outbreak of the Korean War. Each in its own way threatened not only the air power advocates’  devotion to strategic bombing, but also the image of air power that its adherents sought to popularize in the public imagination.
