ssly brought on by the Navy itself by its interwar opposition to the development of long-range bombers. Relegating the Navy to mere transportation support, de Seversky stated that “there simply is no fighting that navies can do which aviation cannot do more effectively and more quickly without their help.”4  Four months later, Huie supplemented The Case Against the Admirals,  his indictment of the Navy’s resistance of unification, with another attack launched in The American Mercury.  Detailing Navy resistance to new weapons during the war, Huie claimed that the Navy was unfit to act as the nation’s primary 231 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

In 1948 Huie resumed his assault on the Navy, first with an article in July charging that the Navy was undermining the new unification system, wasting taxpayer money on useless projects, and trying to build a bigger air force than the Air Force. Next in September he claimed that the Marine Corps was an outdated relic that needlessly duplicated the Army, and in December he made a similar charge about the Navy’s air arm duplicating the Air Force and challenging it for the strategic bombing mission.6  Up to the end of 1948 the anti-Navy campaign was dominated by the twin firebrands of de Seversky and Huie. Other air power advocates either voiced only veiled criticisms or couched their charges in more temperate language. Spaatz, for example, stated in July that the “older services” did not understand the airmen’s revolutionary zeal, and thus they put their faith in “‘balanced force’  based upon quantitative equality...rather than scientific balance in terms of a given military tas
