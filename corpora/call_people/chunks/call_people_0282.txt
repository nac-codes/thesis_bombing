He was also quick to state, though, that the U.S. should continue to build up its nuclear stockpile and that the “strategic-bomber force should be increased to at least the number contemplated in the 70- group program.” His next installment extolled advances made in air defense capabilities and called for immediate efforts to build an effective radar warning system. He cautioned, however, that such a system would have limits: “While well-organized defenses might not prevent a raid, they would certainly minimize its effects. They could avert disaster.”3 3 Air power advocates focused their main efforts, though, on convincing the public that strategic bombing must remain the main defense against Soviet attack on America. For years air power advocates had promised that the bomber would always get through. In the early postwar years they trumpeted the fact that no World War II bombing mission had every been turned back. In the Revolt of the Admirals they used the same approach to deflect criticism
