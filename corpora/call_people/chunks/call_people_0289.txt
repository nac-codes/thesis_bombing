Its radio advertisements calling for volunteers for the Ground Observer Corps, for example, created images of an air defense system so weak that it desperately needed thousands of civilians to help plug the gaps. One such radio spot declared, “the Reds right now have about a thousand bombers that are quite capable of destroying at 252 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
