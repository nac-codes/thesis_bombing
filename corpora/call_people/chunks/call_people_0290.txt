In his Newsweek  column from the same period he called for an increase to at least the World War n  level of250 groups and stressed strategic bombing as the greatest need for growth. By early 1952 he had modified his prognosis and applauded Congress for endorsing the Joint Chiefs of Staff plan calling for 143 wings but then chided Congress for delaying implementation of the plan stating that it could lead to costly and perhaps fatal results.4 7  At times air power advocates’  calls for more groups even left them in conflict with the Air Force.
