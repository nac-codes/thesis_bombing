rtin places the mission in the context of a massive Air Force - Navy interdiction campaign to save the U.N. position by starving the enemy of supplies.5 8 A more colorful effort, literally and figuratively, came from a Life photo essay complete with aerial photos of a carpet of bomb bursts and a close-up of the risque nose- art adorning a B-29. The target for this mission was the staging area for four divisions of North Korean troops massing for an attack on U.N. positions at Taegu. Again emphasizing images of scientific efficiency, a pictograph details the grid-like pattern the bombers used to ensure eveiy bit of the staging area was covered, but the text indicates 260 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

As in the previous example, this was not quite the “one bomb -100 mortars” image that Vandenberg used, but it was stirring and, as the author relates, when the American G.I.s dug in across the river saw it they “stood up in their emplacements and cheered.” But to ensure that no one missed the larger meaning of this image, the author added, “The ‘wild blue yonder boys’  of the Air Force were forsaking their strategic bombing to give help to the beleaguered ground troops.”5 9 Like the long-time image of strategic bombing created by air power advocates, Vandenberg’s image of air interdiction seemed inherently sensible and efficient. Why drop one bomb on one mortar when the same bomb could be used to knock out 10, or even 100? What Korean War air interdiction campaigns such as “Operation Strangle” were to prove, though, was that Vandenberg’s claims, common among most Air Force leaders, did not always hold true. Air interdiction racked up impressive tallies of trucks destroyed, rail lines cut, and bridges destroyed, and it frequently halted daylight movement of Communist forces and supplies, but the damage was quickly repaired
