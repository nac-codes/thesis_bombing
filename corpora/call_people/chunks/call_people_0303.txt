And like Drake, Spaatz called for a dramatically increased level of aircraft production.6 6 Even though air power advocates made public bows to the importance of tactical air power, they still cautioned that strategic bombing must remain the main focus because it was still America’s best defense. Spaatz, for example, in a 1950 Newsweek  column, conceded that tactical air power was important to meet Cold War challenges like Korea, but then stressed that “[t]he B-36 and the atom bomb still constitute the military force preventing a full-scale world war and localizing the Korean conflict.” And in his 1951 Reader’ s Digest  article calling for tactical forces to seize air superiority in Europe, Spaatz said that ground and tactical air forces should act merely as holding forces while strategic bombing won the war by bombing the Soviet homeland: “there is not the remotest chance that our ground forces can defeat the Russian Army by coming to grips with all its divisions. The Russian Army must be strangled by the bombing of the industries behind the troops.”6 7  Similarly, in his Saturday Evening Post  article Vandenberg stated that strategic bombing was the only thing deterring Soviet aggression, but if war did come with the Soviets strategic bombing was the best means of seizing air superiority and supporting ground troops because it destroyed planes and weapons at their source.6 8 The public effort to bolster the image of strategic bombing extended to the cinema as well.
