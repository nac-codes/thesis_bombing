The article even melded the twin traditions of strategic bombing into its overall image of SAC capability for it lauded both the destructive capabilities of the bombs SAC planes carried and the exacting precision with which the crews delivered them.8 The emphasis on SAC increased after the Korean War, and one of the earliest postwar articles came from Francis Vivian Drake in a Reader’ s Digest  article published only two months after the war ended. Drake makes clear the overall significance of SAC at the outset: “The free world may well stand hat in hand before our superbly trained atom-bomber crews.... They stand guard for all of us 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.” He also highlights SAC’s concern for constant readiness by detailing the reaction to a headquarters security team’s attempt to sneak onto a SAC base in what appears to be a stricken airliner. The description of crewmembers and the demands they face presents a harrowing image: “Never has so much been demanded, both physical and intellectual, of fighting men in peacetime....
