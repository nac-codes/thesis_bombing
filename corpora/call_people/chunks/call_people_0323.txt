The solution, for Drake, is more money for SAC so that it can increase its manning to two crews per aircraft. But he does not advocate a larger defense budget. Claiming that SAC gets only $5.50 out of every one hundred defense dollars, he calls for increasing SAC’s share by taking existing money from other forces, “that, no matter how courageous, could not head off atomic aggression.”1 1 The next year Life, in a lengthy piece detailing the many wonders of the “Jet Age,” focused much of the article on the men and planes of SAC. The tone of the article mixes images of nuclear destructive capabilities with cutting-edge high technology advances being made in the Air Force. Modem aircraft, epitomized by the nuclear bomber B-47, are characterized as so advanced that it takes a new breed of man to fly them. Describing the B-47 as the backbone of SAC, and its crews as “[t]he foremost representatives of the jet age,” the article details the B-47 mission profile and flight regimen as so stressful that crews must be “psychologically decompressed to bring them gently down to a slower tempo,” and so physically demanding that they need a massage and steam room to “relax by sweating out their physical fatigue.” Crewmembers who can withstand such pressures are so critical to the nation’s defenses that, as the article quotes one senior Air Force officer: “When we lose one of them it’s like losing the battleship M issouri”1 2 A unique chapter in the SAC literature came in 1955 from Arthur Godfrey.
