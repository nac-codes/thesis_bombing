cern to Lay, who told LeMay that he felt SAC would be dependent upon reservists for 80% of their personnel for a long time and that he hoped the movie would inspire more of them to reenlist.4 2 In the process of explaining why Holland must stay in the Air Force the movie repeatedly stresses why SAC is so important to the nation. It is in this vein that images of revolutionary air power appear, because SAC and its strategic bombing role are depicted as the only force standing between America and war. When Major General Castle, 8th Air Force Commander, tells Holland he is being recalled, Castle tells Holland, “Look, do you realize that we’re the only thing that’s keeping the peace? By staying combat ready we prevent a war?” Holland is still unconvinced and bitter until on a flight a long-service sergeant tells Holland, “Every day in SAC’s a war, Colonel. Pressure’s on all the time and General Hawks is breathing down your neck. We never know when the other fellow may start something so we’ve got to be combat ready 24 hours a day, seven days a week.” This gets Holland thinking, and the course of subsequent events convinces him that he must stay in because, as he explains to his wife, “But there is a kind of war on. You’ve got to stay ready to fight without fighting. That’s why I made this decision.” With such repetitious emphasis of the same theme and the contemporary worries about nuclear war, the audience could hardly miss the point that, according to those who made the movie, the only thing standing between them and a Soviet nuclear attack was air power in the form of strategic nuclear bombing.4 3 298 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
