--- Page 325 --- The Kennedy administration moved American defense policy away from a slavish reliance on nuclear obliteration, but official policy could not easily alter cultural attachment to images of salvation through nuclear air power.6 7  The same technological messianistic images that made easy victory through air power such a compelling notion for air power advocates also drew the general public like a siren song. The fallacy of strategic bombing suitable for all occasions exerted a powerful attraction to a society deathly afraid of the Communist threat but confronted with the intractable complexities of the Cold War. In the second half of the fifties, though, and continuing into the early sixties, voices arose in popular culture questioning the popular image of air power in general and strategic bombing in particular. This popular culture counter-revolution started out tentatively but by the early sixties rose to a crescendo and create an alternate image, an alter-ego as it were, of the Mad Bomber that competed with the popular image of SAC. The counter­ revolution would not totally eliminate the hold air power had gained on the popular imagination, but it would change the nature of public debate on air power issues and to a great extent end the air power popular culture crusade. 314 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
