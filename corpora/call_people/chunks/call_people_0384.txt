was hardly the happy results promised by the airmen. The number of nuclear weapons and the world-wide tragedy that results also served as one manâ€™s response to those air power advocates, such as de Seversky, who said that thousands of nuclear weapons could be used against an 336 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

One got through to Washington and two to London. Most of the statesmen in both capitals were killed leaving decision-making to military leaders who launched a retaliatory strike against the Soviets discovering only too late that it was a mistake. By then chaos reigned as critical decisions devolved to ever lower echelons of military commands. In the midst of the Soviet - NATO nuclear war another one breaks out between China and the Soviet Union, and at one point near the end China was being run by an Air Force major.2 5 What the reader sees, therefore, is that air power has made nuclear war too easy to start, impossible to defend against, and because of its speed and destructive capability, impossible to control if unanticipated events occurred. In short, air power in the form of strategic nuclear bombing was too inflexible to serve as any rational form of defense. If anybody missed this point, Shute drove the image home explicitly. When one character suggests that the problem was that nuclear weapons had become too cheap and readily availa
