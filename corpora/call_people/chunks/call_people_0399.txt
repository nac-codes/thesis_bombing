hey have entrusted machines with determining when to unleash that destruction. More important, though, the airmen have themselves become machines, unthinking, unfeeling, incapable of understanding anything but the linear logic of nuclear warfare and its dictates. In describing the training SAC crewmembers undergo to ensure they attack or refrain from attacking as ordered, the authors state, “The tests, the indoctrinations, the training - all were designed to convert normal American boys into automatons.” The most graphic representation of the “automated” SAC crewmember is the commander of the group of attacking bombers, Colonel Grady. The authors’  description of him bears this out: “He was an automated man.... There was only flesh and bone; there was no heart. There was intellect, but it lay inert, unmotivated by emotion.” The culmination of the machine motif comes when Grady refuses to obey a direct order from the President, coming to him by radio, to abort his attack and return to base. Arguing that he is not authorized to receive orders once past his fail-safe point, Grady cannot adapt to situations that fall outside his rigid training.4 9 The Air Force objected to the premise of the novel, but as with their reaction to Salter’s The Hunters,  the airmen did not seem to catch the deeper implications of the charges made about air power’s inherent danger. Assuming the attack by Burdick and Wheeler was directed against SAC’s system, the Air Force defended the system and missed entirely the message that the danger of air power was in the people who made up the system.
