did not preclude Kubrick from making a movie that was quite popular. Kubrick did request Air Force assistance but the depiction of their Positive Control system precluded any help.

He went on to other causes, most notably civil rights and military injustice. In this latter area he wrote The Execution o f Private Slovik  in 1954 and The Hero o f Two Jima  in 1962, but another work in 1964 indicates an evolving attitude toward air po
