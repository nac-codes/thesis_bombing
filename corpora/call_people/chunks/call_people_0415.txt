ted to the outskirts of the new cultural debate. Where once air power advocates had promised quick, easy, and painless victory through air power, now they lectured Americans on the need to accept great sacrifices and suffering. Their message had not really changed in its fundamental premise, though. What had changed was society’s response to their message. Fears of nuclear devastation had risen to new heights since 1957 and this prompted many to reexamine their faith in air power. When they did so they found a long line of critics raising increasingly sharp attacks on the image of air power and the old faith could not stand up under the assault. With the old faith gone and fears of nuclear war reaching a new high point, the exhortations of LeMay and Twining sounded to many like something out of Catch-22,  or worse, Dr. Strangelove. 364 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
