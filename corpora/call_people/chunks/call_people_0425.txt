the eve of America’s deepening involvement in the war in Vietnam there was a significant gulf between what the Air Force and air power advocates believed air power could do and what the public was willing to support. Many in the Air Force in 1965 agreed with LeMay’s strategy for winning the war. Latter-day air power advocates point to the massive bombing raids on Hanoi during the Linebacker II operation in December 1972, which hastened the signing of the peace accord in early 1973, as a vindication of modern air power. In fact, to this day there is a strong belief among Vietnam veterans in the B-52 community that the Linebacker II raids ended the war, and they claim that if Johnson had unleashed the bombers in 1965 or 1966 the way Nixon had in 1972, the same results would have obtained sooner.1  Few Americans supported such a policy. Long before 1972 air power had become a widespread symbol of the excessive and counterproductive means being used to prosecute the war. For many Americans air power in Vietnam came to symbolize bombed-out villages, widespread defoliation, and jets fruitlessly hunting lone snipers hidden in triple-canopy jungles, and the public generally found these images disturbing. Clearly the public had widely repudiated the sentiments expressed in 1955 by Frank Harvey when he extolled the image of bombers using nuclear weapons to stamp out brushfire wars in all corners of the globe.2 Air power’s previous image as the epitome of high technology warfare actually came back to haunt air power advocates during the Vietnam War.
