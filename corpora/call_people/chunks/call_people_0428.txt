litary structure that shape its attitudes toward military policy.

Invariably these campaigns have included works placed in popular culture by each branch’s advocates and these campaigns would make fruitful areas of study for future historians. No branch, however, has enjoyed the success that air power advocates enjoyed after World War n. Not only did they successfully tap the power of America’s faith in the airplane and use that power to help lead the Air Force to the premier position in national defense, they also helped convince average Americans, for a short time at least, that they should rely on that which they feared most - nuclear air power. This then is the ultimate testimony to the power of images to shape popular attitudes toward warfare. Fearing nuclear attack, Americans might have shunned nuclear weapons outright or put their faith in more direct forms of protection such as air defense. Instead, thanks in large part to the long parade of images advanced by air power advocates, they put inordinate faith in the very instrument that threatened their destruction, hoping desperately that Soviet fear would mirror their own and maintain the balance of terror. This bizarre situation is matched only by the bizarre images in popular culture that helped to shape their faith. 377 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
