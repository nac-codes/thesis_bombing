ent of change. They were convinced that the air - plane—used as a bombing platform—offered the means to make wars much less lethal than conflicts waged by armies or navies. The airmen contended that a clash of armies, with its subse- quent slaughter, was unnecessary to fight and win future conflicts. Instead, the truly vital ingredients of modern war—the essen-tial industries that produced weapons and fuel, key communica- tions centers, and lines of transportation—were vulnerable to at- tack from the air. The loss of those installations would not only wreck a nation’s ability to fight, it would also sap the will of the populace, because the same facilities needed to wage modern war were also those necessary to sustain normal, day-to-day life. Air - craft would destroy the vital centers through precision bombing— sophisticated technology would guarantee that bombs hit only the intended targets, and few lives would be lost in the process. The finite destruction would end wars quickly, without crippling EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

To assure the success of their ideas, the advocates of “progres- sive air power” also called for reforming America’s defense struc- ture, with the establishment of a separate air force as a new armed service. They set out to convince the nation of that perceived need, and along the way recruited a core of like-minded officers who took their ideas and further refined them. The conviction that the “strategic bombing” of vital centers offered the solution to fight-ing and winning future wars efficiently blended with the belief that service autonomy was essential to assure the bomber’s proper wartime use against industrial targets—not against armies or na- vies. Ultimately, the two notions
