fourteen Gothas had dropped nearly two tons of bombs, killing 162 people and injuring 432. 11 The bombers attacked in daylight and with impunity; none fell to antiaircraft fire or fighters. Many of London’s East End workers, fearing the bombers’ return, stayed away from their factories. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and his War Cabinet ordered two squadrons of fighters home from France. Britain’s leaders also looked to pay the Germans back in kind. Before the Gotha assault, the British had shunned the development of an independent bombing force. In April 1917, their air strength in France consisted of twenty-seven fighter squadrons, twenty-one army support squadrons, and two bomber squadrons. After the Gotha raid, the British government’s Air Board recommended de- veloping forty squadrons of long-range bombers.12 In France and Italy, Bolling’s group also discovered a strong preference for bomber development. The French could not pro - duce enough aircraft to satisfy both the demand for additional air support at the front and the desire for bombers to attack Ger - many. They hoped that the 4,500 figure mentioned by Premier Ribot could form a strategic force—that intent had been mistak- enly omitted from the cable—and they made certain that Bolling’s mission understood their wishes.13 In Italy, the Americans found bombing operations that were more than mere speculation.

Their air offensive, sporting as many as 140 aircraft on a single raid, impressed Bolling’s group.14 The group was also impressed by the man who had molded the Italian bomber force, the designer and theorist Gianni Caproni.
