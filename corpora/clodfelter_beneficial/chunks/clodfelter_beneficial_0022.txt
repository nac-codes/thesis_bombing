many as 140 aircraft on a single raid, impressed Bolling’s group.14 The group was also impressed by the man who had molded the Italian bomber force, the designer and theorist Gianni Caproni. Gorrell in par - ticular was inspired by Caproni’s vision of air power, which par - alleled the thoughts of Giulio Douhet, Caproni’s close friend and confidant.15 Caproni maintained that for bombing to be effective it had to be “systematic, thorough, and consistent.”16 This asser - tion became a cornerstone of Gorrell’s plan. Submitting his initial report to General Squier on 15 August 1917, Bolling called for the production of training aircraft, air - craft to support American troops in the field, and “aircraft in ex- cess of the tactical requirements of the Army in France.”17 His group had selected four types of Allied aircraft for American pro- duction: the British Dehaviland dh-4 for day-bombing and obser - vation; the British Bristol and French spad for air-to-air combat, and the Italian Caproni Tri-motor for long-range night bomb - ing. He recommended that the United States build as many of all types as possible. Bolling contended that the number of airplanes needed to support the ground forces depended on the size of the Army and would vary in proportion to it. Combat aircraft in ex- cess of those required for Army support could conduct “indepen- dent” air operations, such as night raids on Germany. He further suggested a precise apportionment of aircraft types for this inde-pendent force: 37. 5 percent of its aircraft should be fighters ca- pable of escorting bombers, 25 percent should be day bombers, and the remainder should be Caproni night bombers.18 He found the prospects of night bombing especially appealing, and noted that if it were conducted “on a sufficiently great scale and kept up continuously for a sufficient time, there seems good reason to believe that it might determine the whole outcome of military g e n e s i s  i n t h e g r e a t  w a r EBSCOhost - pr
