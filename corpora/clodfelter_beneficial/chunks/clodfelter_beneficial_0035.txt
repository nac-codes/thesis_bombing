rrell stated that such bombing occurred mainly at long distances and was integral to the air offensive on the Western Front. It was not primarily a vehicle for retaliation. Instead, its basic purpose was “to weaken the power of the enemy both directly and indirectly; directly, by interrupting his production, transport, and organization through the infliction of damage on his industrial, railway, and military cen - ters and by compelling him to draw back his [aerial] fighting ma- chines to deal with the enemy’s; indirectly, by producing discon-tent and alarm among the industrial population. In other words, it aims at achieving both a material and a moral effect.” 54 Gorrell reiterated that German war production depended on a g e n e s i s  i n t h e g r e a t  w a r EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Pinpointing those links was the essence of successful bombing. Thus far, the lack of “proper scientific knowledge” and the failure to identify “the real object” of an air offensive had prevented bombing from achiev-ing its potential. 55 Gorrell claimed that the necessary expertise now existed, and he was determined to use it. Aircraft would at-tack the industrial centers earmarked in his plan, and the bombs that missed would have “the desired moral effect” by depriving the enemy of “the enormous number of man-hours that a single aerial bombardment of necessity always causes.”56 Attacks would occur throughout daylight and darkness, with day bombers flying at high altitude in tight formation to overcome enemy defenses, while night bombers flew with the impunity that he believed al-lowed them to conduct the most accurate bombing.
