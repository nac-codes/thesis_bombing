. In January 1918 Pershing had agreed that British personnel could organize, train, and equip the thirty projected American night bombing squad- rons, and British flying schools also taught some American day bombing aircrews. In all, thirty-six Americans attached to the iaf flew combat “training” missions over Germany, and half of them were killed, wounded, or captured.63 Yet just as Pershing prohib- ited American ground combat units from amalgamating with Al- lied armies, he would not condone American bombers flying to achieve British objectives, especially when American ground forces needed air support. “In making arrangements with the British it must be thoroughly understood that when our [air] forces reach a certain importance the regions to be bombed will be designated by these headquarters and that the selection of targets will de-pend solely upon their importance with respect to the operations which we contemplate for our ground forces,” McAndrew told Major General Mason Patrick, who had replaced Foulois as aef Air Service chief. 64 The issue of cooperative allied air operations was a sticky one, however, and Americans would revisit it with the British in the years to come. In the end, America’s bombing contribution to the Great War consisted of day bombers raiding targets in France, and that con- tribution was meager. Eight antiquated Breguet-14 b-2 biplanes of the Ninety-sixth Aero Squadron flew in the first American bomb- ing raid, a 12 June 1918 attack on the rail yard and warehouses in Dommary-Baroncourt. Two planes returned to base with en-gine problems, while three others ran out of gas after dropping their bombs. Because of the Breguets’ feeble engines, it took sev- eral minutes for the tiny formation to climb to its bombing alti- tude of four thousand feet. Still, some of the aircraft hit the tar - get, and they survived attacks by three enemy fighters on the way g e n e s i s  i n t h e g r e a t  w a r EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via
