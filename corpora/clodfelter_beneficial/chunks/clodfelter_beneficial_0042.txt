reason American stra- tegic bombing never materialized was that his plans “were not syn- chronized properly, especially from a mental point of view” with the Army’s General Headquarters. 72 General Foulois concurred, declaring in October 1919: “The General Staff of the Army, either through lack of vision, lack of practical knowledge, or deliber - ate intention to subordinate the Air Service needs to the needs of other combat arms, has utterly failed to appreciate the full military value of this new military weapon, and, in my opinion, has failed to accord it its just place in our military family.”73 Even Mitchell, who had worked tirelessly to support the ground forces with air power, agreed that Army officers—with the sole exception of Ma- jor General Hunter Liggett, who had commanded the First Army— did not know what “air power” meant.74 In July 1918, Mitchell had insisted that the Chief of the Air Service, rather than the Ar - my’s General Staff, should direct the Air Service’s ghq Reserve. He based his argument on the need for unity of command, which would allow the Air Service chief to concentrate all available air power in a critical area for maximum impact.75 His plea went un- heeded, even though the ghq Reserve existed in name only—an American squadron of night bombers did not arrive at the front until 9 November 1918.g e n e s i s  i n t h e g r e a t  w a r EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

He remarked in his discussion of the Argonne offensive: “The tendency of our air force at first was to attach too much significance to flights be- yond the enemy’s lines in an endeavor to interrupt his communi- cations. However, this was of secondary importance during the battle, as aviators were then expected to protect and assist our ground tro
