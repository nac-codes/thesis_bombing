After the Bolling mission recommended building the Caproni bomber, General Pershing claimed final authority to determine aircraft types, and in November 1917 he recommended production of the British two-engine Handley-Page.80 Incredibly, despite the difficulties that would stem from building two types of bombers, the Joint Army-Navy Technical Board suggested pro- ducing both—and the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy approved the recommendation!81 European designs compounded American production problems. Most of the materials provided by the French, British, and Italian builders to serve as guidelines for Coffin’s manufacturers were in- complete or delayed. American production centered on the machine tools and detailed blueprints of the assembly line, whereas Euro-pean production stressed skilled craftsmen and individual work-manship. 82 Not until 16 January 1918—almost six months after the Bolling mission’s initial selection—did Caproni’s representa-tives arrive in the United States. British designers for the Hand-ley-Page had arrived only two weeks earlier. 83 The combination of differing production philosophies, delayed arrivals, and over - lapping authority produced construction programs with wildly fluctuating numbers of projected aircraft. The planned number of Caproni bombers went from 500 on 9 August 1917 to 9,000 a week later, to 2,000 on 24 August, to 50 on 19 February 1918, and to 250 on 3 May. 84 In actuality, the United States built only one Caproni before the Armistice. As for the Handley-Page, plans to assemble
