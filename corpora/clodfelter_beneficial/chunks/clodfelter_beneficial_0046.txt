This air offensive, he mused, “would have caused untold sufferings and forced a German surrender.” 89 Yet the likelihood of Mitchell’s vision becoming reality was remote. President Wil- son told Congress in his war message: “We shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and our - selves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and fair play we profess to be fighting for.”90 Secretary of War Baker re- flected those sentiments, telling Army Chief of Staff General Pey- ton March to notify the Air Service that the United States would g e n e s i s  i n t h e g r e a t  w a r EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

By destroying those elements of Germany’s in- dustrial complex that were essential components of the army’s means to fight, Gorrell aimed to render enemy forces impotent. For him, the key to applying air power successfully w
