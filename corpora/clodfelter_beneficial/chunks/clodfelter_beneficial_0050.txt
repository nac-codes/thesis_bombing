hips. By proving that air power had supplanted the Navy as America’s traditional first line of defense, Mitchell be - lieved that he would establish an ironclad rationale for his dream of an independent air force. The challenge was formidable. The Navy anchored the Ost- friesland sixty-five miles off the Virginia Capes, requiring Mitch- ell’s aircraft, based at Langley Field, Virginia, to fly almost one hundred miles before arriving at their destination. Navy rules also limited the number of hits airmen could score against the imposing target. Launched in 1911, the twenty-seven-thousand- ton dreadnought sported a four-layered hull and numerous wa - tertight compartments. It had survived eighteen direct hits and a mine detonation at the Battle of Jutland. And it had withstood earlier attacks that morning and on the previous day by Navy air - craft and Mitchell’s Martins. The Martin bombers had scored three hits with 1,100-pound bombs, but Navy inspectors deemed that the ship remained seaworthy. Mitchell agreed; he knew that stan- dard bombs would not suffice to wreck the German behemoth. In his eyes, the previous attacks had been for the Navy’s benefit, as they permitted observers to scrutinize the damage inflicted at pe-riodic intervals. After the next bomb run, he aimed to make fur - ther inspections superfluous. Slung beneath the fuselage of each bomber that flew past the Osprey  was a specially built two-thousand-pound bomb. While those bombs would likely cause substantial damage to the Ger - man battleship if they hit it, Mitchell had directed his crews to drop their ordnance in the water near the ship. He planned to take advantage of the Navy’s limit on direct hits by relying on the hammer-like pressure of underwater explosions to crush the un-armored hull. The first of the massive bombs exploded one hun- EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
