Mitchell maintained that air power alone could defeat a na- tion by paralyzing its “vital centers,” which included great cit- ies, factories, raw materials, foodstuffs, supplies, and modes of transportation. 11 All were essential to wage modern war, and all were vulnerable to air attack. Moreover, many of the targets were fragile, and wrecking them promised a rapid victory. Mitchell as- serted: “Air forces will attack centers of production of all kinds, means of transportation, agricultural areas, ports and shipping; not so much the people themselves. They will destroy the means of making war, because now we cannot cut a limb out of a tree, pick a stone from a hill and make it our principal weapon. Today to make war we must have great metal and chemical factories that have to stay in one place, take months to build, and, if destroyed, cannot be replaced in the usual length of a modern war.”12 Only an air force possessed the means to attack vital centers without first confronting enemy surface forces, and destroying those cen- ters would eliminate the need to advance through enemy territory on the ground. “The influence of air power on the ability of one nation to impress its will on another in an armed conflict will be decisive,” he insisted. 13 Like many Army officers of his time, Mitchell could recite Clause- witz’s dictum on the objective of war, and he did so with a paro- chial twist. Air power would wreck an enemy’s will to fight by de- stroying its capability to resist, and the essence of that capability was not the army or navy, but the nation’s industrial and agricul- tural underpinnings. Eliminating industrial production “would deprive armies, air forces and navies . . . of their means of main- tenance.”14 Air power also offered the chance to attack the will to fight directly. Mitchell equated the will of a nation to the will of its p r o g
