n, and the Chesapeake Bay, and that destroying those centers and their transportation links would not only wreck industrial productivity but also lead to widespread starvation if the nation chose not to capitulate. 18 In such projections, war-making capa- bility ceased once bombs destroyed vital industries and agricul-tural areas, or once civilians left the factories and fields. Mitchell dismissed stockpiles of materiel, especially food, and he also re - jected reserves of morale. 19 He bestowed on the governments un- der attack a degree of rationality that ignored the enemy’s war aims and the possibility that the population would willingly suf-fer to avoid capitulation. His examples intimated that all indus- trial powers were alike—and that all resembled his view of the United States. He thus overlooked crucial distinctions between nations—and the types of wars they fought—that would directly affect bombing’s ability to achieve an independent victory, much less a rapid one.p r o g r e s s i v e  p r o p h e c y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Mitchell later stated that he had “frequent conversations” with Douhet during his 1922 visit to Italy; whether those conversations actually occurred, he was well acquainted with Douhet’s confidant, Gianni Caproni, and received a synopsis of Douhet’s classic book, The Command of the Air, in late 1922.20 Much of Mitchell’s and Douhet’s writ- ing was remarkably similar.21 Both agreed that “nothing can stop the attack of aircraft except other aircraft,” and that after achiev- ing air supremacy, an enemy’s vital centers—a term used by both men—could be wrecked at will. 22 They differed, however, about how best to achieve air contr
