rcome the limitation on range that protected the United States from air attack by a European or Asiatic power. Under his guidance, Air Service Colonel Townsend F. Dodd prepared an April 1919 study evaluating the need for a separate air force that concluded: “The moment that [an] aircraft reaches that stage of development which will permit one ton of bombs to be carried from the nearest point of a possible enemy’s territory to our commercial and industrial centers, and to return to the starting point, then national safety requires the maintenance of an efficient air force adapted for acting against the possible en- emy’s interior.”28 By the time that trans-oceanic flight had been perfected, Mitchell aimed to make Americans an “air-going peo- ple,” ready to conduct “war at a distance” through a Department of the Aeronautics equal in status to the Army and Navy Depart- ments in a single Department of National Defense.29 Mitchell tried to transform the American populace into air power advocates by emphasizing the progressive notions of order and effi - ciency. Not only could an autonomous air force protect the United States and achieve an independent victory in war, he insisted that it could do so more cheaply—and more effectively—than either the Army or the Navy. Yet the Air Service could not perform an independent mission, Mitchell argued, as long as the Army con-trolled it. Because the Army divided air units among its various corps and divisions to assure that they received adequate air sup- port, air units had a meager chance of being massed together for a long-range independent mission in which Army commanders had little interest. “To leave aviation essentially under the domi- nance and direction of another department is to absolutely stran - gle its development, because it will be looked on by them merely as an auxiliary and not as a principal thing,” he protested in De-p r o g r e s s i v e  p r o p h e c y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
