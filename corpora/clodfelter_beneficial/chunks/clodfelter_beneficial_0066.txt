ted States, and airplanes could not cross the Atlantic or Pacific. The mood endured for more than a decade. Incremental Interwar developments The failure of the American public to respond directly to Mitch-ell’s outcry did not mean that the issue of air autonomy disap-peared, but it did mean that the steps taken during the interwar years would be incremental. National boards and committees con- tinued to study the issue of how best to organize Army aviation. The Air Corps Act of July 1926 changed the Air Service’s name to the Air Corps and provided an Assistant Secretary of War for Air and special representation on the War Department’s General Staff. It also authorized an Air Corps of twenty thousand men and 1,800 aircraft, but Congress failed to fund the expansion. The Great Depression further slowed the Air Corps’ growth. From 1927 to 1931 annual budgets ranged from $25– 30 million; in 1934 appropriations fell to $12 million; in 1938, $ 3.5 million.44 Manpower, which averaged 1,500 officers and 15,000 enlisted men during the first three Depression years, stood at only 1,700 officers and 17,000 enlisted men as late as 1939.45 Aircraft totaled 1,619 in 1933, of which 442 were obsolete or nonstandard.46 Still, the recommendation of the 1934  aviation board chaired by former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker led to the creation of a Gen- eral Headquarters (ghq) Air Force, containing all Air Corps com- bat units, in the spring of 1935. Although the air power compris- ing the ghq Air Force was never significant—in 1939 it owned just 14 four-engine b -17 bombers—it nevertheless was one step p r o g r e s s i v e  p r o p h e c y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
