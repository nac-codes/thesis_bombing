school provided an intense, nine-month, air power-focused curriculum to the Air Corps’ top mid-level officers, and graduated 261 of the 320 generals serving in the Army Air Forces at the end of World War II.56 Initial classes were small. An average of 22 students attended while the school was located at Langley Field from 1920 to 1931, and they learned “the air tactics and techniques necessary for direction of air units in cooperation with other branches of the armed forces.”57 By 1926 the curricu- lum’s focus had begun to shift to independent air operations, and by 1935 it stressed the bomber as a war-winning weapon.58 In concert with the new emphasis, the school moved to Max- well Field, Alabama, and also acquired more students: the aver - age increased to fifty-nine in 1931, and jumped to one hundred in 1939, when a series of four twelve-week courses began.59 Mitchell had been instrumental in founding the school, and his bombing p r o g r e s s i v e  p r o p h e c y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Sherman, Dargue, George, Olds, and Walker—the latter two had served as Mitchell’s aides— filled key positions on the faculty, and all promoted Mitchell’s vi- sion of independent air power founded on the bomber. From the student perspective, the Tactical School opened new vistas in air power thought. Laurence S. Kuter, who left the Forty- ninth Bombardment Squadron at Langley Field to begin school in the class of 1934–35 as a new first lieutenant (and the second youngest member of the class), later commented that “imagina- tions were released, aroused at Maxwell, when they were dormant at Langley. I think I’m speaking for all of my generation at the time. We had our first introduction to any sort of air strategy.”61 Major Ira C. Eaker, a disti
