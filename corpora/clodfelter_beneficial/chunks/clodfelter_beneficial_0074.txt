Germany surrendered because its populace lost the will to resist, not because its army had been destroyed.

The Allied blockade threatened Germany with starvation, but George did not believe that such drastic measures were nec- essary to cause national will to collapse. “There is plenty of indi- cation that modern nations are interdependent,” he maintained, “not so much for the essentials of life as for those ‘non-essentials’ needed to conduct their daily lives under the existing standards of living.” Because most aspects of modern society were not self-sufficient—for example, many workers in large cities depended on public transportation to get to work, and many factories and homes received electric power from distant locations—eliminat- ing the interdependent features of normal life might suffice to crack civilian morale. 68 Moreover, George insisted, the key elements that sustained nor - mal life were the same  ones that enabled a nation to wage modern war. Interrupting this economic web would likely defeat a nation, and air power could attack it directly, preventing an exhaustive ground campaign or a time-consuming sea blockade. “It is possi- ble that the moral collapse brought about by the break-up of this closely knit web would be sufficient [to cause defeat],” he pos-tulated, “but connected therewith is the industrial fabric which is absolutely essential for modern war. To continue a war which is hopeless is worse than an undesirable peace, because the lat- ter will come soon or late anyway; but to continue a modern war without machinery is impossible.”69 D
