the Tactical School cooks who stirred them together sometimes added more of one item than another. Clausewitzian frameworks and Marxist economics, set against the backdrop of World War I’s totality, fla- vored the instructors’ thoughts on war. George’s lecture echoed a 1926 school publication that viewed the objective of war as “un- dermining the enemy’s morale, his will to resist,”72 yet George also noted that destroying the capability  to fight might be the key to wrecking will. The school attempted to differentiate between the “national” objective of wrecking will and the “military” aim of destroying “the enemy’s material and moral means of resis-tance,” but the multi-layered goals overlapped and distinctions between them were subtle—especially when discussing air power that promised victory in one fell swoop.73 According to the Tactical School, the capability to fight mod- ern war stemmed from a nation’s economic prowess, and eco-p r o g r e s s i v e  p r o p h e c y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

A 1934 lecture asserted that “world conflicts arise over outlets for over-production”; an- other added that modern wars “are essentially economic wars, caused by the clash of rival production machines.” 74 Using air power to destroy those machines would eliminate the motive for conflict—hence removing the will to keep fighting. “Air power is the only means of waging war which has the capability of strik-ing directly at the will to resist of a hostile nation, by paralyzing its economic structure and threatening its very existence,” con-cluded a school text. 75 Instructors further elaborated: “The prin- cipal and all important mission of air power, when its equipment permits, is the attack of those vital objectives in a nation’s eco-nomic structure which will tend to paralyze that nation’s ability to wage w
