Accordingly, the attacker should avoid bombing gov- ernment centers, because “the political establishment must remain intact if the attitude of the people at large is to be rapidly sensed and given appropriate consideration.” 83 Instructors expected the attitudes of a beleaguered government and its populace to resemble p r o g r e s s i v e  p r o p h e c y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

He asserted that the key elements of Amer - ican production were 11,842 “critical” factories, almost half of which were located in New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachu-setts. Destroying the factories in those three states, or the trans- portation or power systems linking them, would “apply tremen-dous pressure to our civilian population while at the same time seriously imparing [sic] our ability and capacity to wage war.” 84 Tactical School instructors thought that such destruction would fatally affect American morale. “With life unbearable or perhaps not even supportable, it seemed that even the sturdiest people in our own Northeast country with their army and navy could soon be persuaded to yield to the will of an enemy with effective inde-pendent air action,” Kuter remembered. 85 The school devoted much time to determining which particu- lar elements in the industrial web would have the greatest impact if destroyed. Here too, the United States served as the predom-inant example for the theorizing. Fairchild noted that without adequate raw materials and the power to drive machinery, the American industrial complex could not function. A precarious balance held the system togeth
