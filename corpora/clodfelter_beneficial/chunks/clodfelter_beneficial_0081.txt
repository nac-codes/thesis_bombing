or the theorizing. Fairchild noted that without adequate raw materials and the power to drive machinery, the American industrial complex could not function. A precarious balance held the system together even in peacetime; a strike in a small factory producing door latches for automobiles had halted production in many automobile factories across the country. The demands of war strained that balance to the utmost, as could be seen from the failure of American industry to provide more than token support to the Allied cause in 1917–18. “A careful and complete scientific analysis” would identify the proper targets, Fairchild insisted.86 The key was to pinpoint ba- sic commodities essential for both public services and war-fight-ing. Once identified, air power could attack them in a variety of p r o g r e s s i v e  p r o p h e c y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Factories manufacturing essential commodities were usually found in specific locales, adjacent to raw materials, markets, la- bor, or lines of communication. They were generally large enough to allow easy identification from the air and too numerous to al- low “an efficient local defense.”87 Examples included the steel in- dustry in Pittsburgh and Birmingham, and the brass industry in Connecticut. Besides destroying the factories, air power could eliminate essential commodities by attacking the raw materials needed to produce them. Removing either coal or iron ore would prevent the production of steel. A school text concluded: “Air power could thus defeat a nation by depriving it of just one com-modity, [such as] steel, because no nation can successfully wage war without it.” 88 Because Tactical School instructors based the industrial web theory on American projections, they have since been criticized for “mirror-imaging”—substituting America’s economic and social make-up for that of
