The defending fighters often failed to locate the bomber formations, and if they did so, it was often too late to intercept them. Major Walter H. Frank, the Tactical School’s Assistant Commandant, remarked after watching 1929 air maneuvers in Ohio: “There is considerable doubt among the umpires as to the ability of any air organization to stop a well- organized, well flown air attack.” 98 Mitchell’s former aide, Lieu- tenant Kenneth Walker, echoed this sentiment as a Bombardment instructor from 1929 to 1933, and the notion found its way into Tactical School texts. Most instructors believed that the defensive firepower of tight formations would ward off any fighters that happened to intercept a bomber attack. Still, they considered the possibility of an escort fighter that could accompany bombers to target, but dismissed the notion for two reasons: (1 ) they could not envision an aerodynamic design that successfully melded a fighter’s speed and maneuverability with a bomber’s range; and (2) money for both fighter and bomber development simply did not exist during the Depression, and fighters were not going to gain the independent victory that would lead to an autonomous air force. 99 Major Claire Chennault, who directed the Tactical School’s Pursuit section from 1934 to 1935, adamantly opposed using fighters as escorts—in his mind, their sole mission was air defense. 100 Dogmatic views also prevailed regarding anti-aircraft artillery. Kuter recalled teaching that “anti-aircraft gunfire may be important but should be ignored.” He also remembered that in classroom exercises instructors deemed “bombing inaccuracy”— not enemy defenses—the greatest threat to a successful air offen-siv
