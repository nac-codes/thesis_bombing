r, which precluded them from carrying heavy bomb loads for long distances. To overcome this deficiency, Air Corps Chief Major General Benjamin Foulois submitted a request to aircraft manufacturers for a design capable of flying 2,000 miles with a ton of bombs at a speed of 250 miles per hour. Three companies responded to the request, and one, Boeing, built a four-engine model designed for f r o m  p r o p h e c y  t o p l a n EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

That prototype, the xb- 17, could reach 250 miles per hour at fourteen thousand feet, could operate as high as thirty thousand feet, and could carry 2,500 pounds of bombs 2,260 miles or 5,000 pounds for 1,700 miles.7 For airmen it was the manifestation of nirvana. Hap Arnold recalled that the b-17 was “the first real American air power. . . . Not just brilliant proph- ecies, good coastal defense airplanes, or promising techniques; but, for the first time in history, Air Power that you could put your hands on.” 8 The Air Corps wanted to purchase sixty-five b-17s, but the prototype’s crash in October 1935 , stemming from locked flight controls—and the War Department’s desire for a bomber better suited for supporting ground troops—limited the order to thirteen. They began arriving at Langley’s Second Bombardment Group in March 1937. Complementing the b-17 was a device that significantly im- proved bombing accuracy—the Norden bombsight. In October 1931 Air Corps observers witnessed use of the Navy’s new bomb- sight, the Mark XV. Carl L. Norden, a civilian consultant, and Navy Captain Frederick I. Entwistle had developed the device, and in 1932  Foulois requested twenty-five of them for the Air Corps. The main feature of the black metal bombsight was a gyro- stabilized, motor-driven telescope. The bombardier looked through it during the bomb run, after having inserted the win
