Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur obtained from his naval counterpart, Admiral William V. Pratt, an agreement that the Air Corps would conduct the air defense of the United States and its possessions. Two years later, following Lieutenant Colo-nel Hap Arnold’s nonstop flight of five b-10s from Alaska to Se- attle, the War Department endorsed an Air Corps request for a bomber with a five-thousand-mile range, two-hundred-mile-per- hour speed, and two-thousand-pound bomb load that could take off from American soil to defend Hawaii, Alaska, and Panama.10 In 1936 the War Department also approved a request for a bomber with an eight-thousand-mile range.11 The War Department’s failure to sanction the b -17, however, indicated that the Army’s fundamental view of air power had changed little from the Mitchell era. The Air Corps received a har - binger of Army sentiments in late December 1934, when Brigadier General Charles Kilbourne, chief of the General Staff’s War Plans Division, sent a proposed Air Corps doctrinal manual to General f r o m  p r o p h e c y  t o p l a n EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

So far, well-organized na- tions have surrendered only when occupied by the enemy’s army or when such occupation could no longer be opposed.” 12 Foulois sent the document to Maxwell for comment by the Tac- tical School. Its faculty responded that the proposed doctrine was neither “reasonable” nor “progressive,” and returned
