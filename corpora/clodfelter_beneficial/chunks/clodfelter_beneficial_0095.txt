Woodring to prohibit further procurement of four-engine bombers. Spaulding decreed that the Army would purchase only equipment that supported a current Army mission, and the b-17—which could be used defen- sively against a naval force, or offensively against an enemy’s vital centers—did not fit that criterion.

Handsome, athletic, and artic- ulate, Andrews graduated from West Point in 1906, served in the cavalry for eleven years before transferring to the Air Service, and directed the Air Service’s postwar European contingent for his fa- ther-in-law, General Henry Allen, who commanded American oc- cupation troops in Germany.
