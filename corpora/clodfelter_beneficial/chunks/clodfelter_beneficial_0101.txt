The spark for Craig’s ac- tion perhaps emanated from Navy Secretary Claude Swanson. The Navy had downplayed the success of Andrews’s bombers in attacking the Utah , and the final report of those maneuvers drafted by Swanson and Secretary of War Woodring discounted the b-17’s ability to navigate in clouds or accurately bomb a tar - get.31 The Rex intercept portrayed—for the whole world to see— a surface fleet at the mercy of long-range bombers despite das-tardly weather. That vision might cause the American public to question—as had Mitchell seventeen years earlier—the Navy’s viability as a first line of defense. If such logic produced an inde- pendent air force, the sea service could expect to lose not only its foremost mission, but also a large chunk of its budget. Such rationale might also cause the Army to lose its air support for ground troops. An autonomous air force founded on strate - gic bombing as a war-winning instrument would provide little in- centive to devote money to ground support. Soon after the Rex incident, Secretary Woodring directed that no b -17s in produc- tion would be procured during fiscal year 1940. Instead, the Air Corps would confine its 1940 projections to light, medium, and attack bombers. General Embick barked that “our national pol- icy contemplates preparation for defense, not aggression. . . . The military superiority of . . . a b-17 over the two or three smaller planes that could be procured with the same funds remains to be established.” 32 Embick asked for a joint Army-Navy board to study the whole issue of heavy bombers and to recommend lim-its “beyond which Army planes should not be developed.” 33 In the spring of 1938, with the Great Depression continuing to rav- age America,
