When Andrews’s tenure as ghq Air Force commander expired one month later, Woodring personally ap- proved his assignment to Fort Sam Houston as district air offi- cer.43 Andrews reverted to his permanent rank of colonel and was given an office that included an open latrine—the same office that Mitchell occupied when banished to Fort Sam Houston in 1925.44 Yet the penance proved short-lived.
