n assertion that recalled the Rex intercept, Spaatz insisted that two groups of b-17s (eighty-four aircraft) on Hawaii would wreck any carrier force that Japan sent against the islands long before the carrier aircraft launched an attack.54 Although he deemed Spaatz’s observations valuable, Arnold focused his attention on Europe and sent handpicked observ- ers to Britain and France. Spaatz joined the group on the eve of Dunkirk, and the Battle of Britain provided him with a firsthand appreciation for the difficulties of applying independent air power against a nation’s capability and will to resist. He concluded that the Luftwaffe would not win daylight air superiority—or wreck British will—by waging a poorly coordinated offensive against the city of London.

Three days earlier, Arnold had asked the president for $80 million to purchase two hundred b-17s and $106 million for pilot train- ing—a brave request, given that two months before, Roosevelt threaten
