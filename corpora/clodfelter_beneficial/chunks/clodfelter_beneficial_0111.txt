Three days earlier, Arnold had asked the president for $80 million to purchase two hundred b-17s and $106 million for pilot train- ing—a brave request, given that two months before, Roosevelt threatened Arnold with an assignment on Guam if he did not sup- port the planned dispatch of aircraft to Britain and France.56 Ar- nold dragged his feet because he believed that the Air Corps’ needs outweighed those of the potential allies. He realized that aircraft production took time, and he knew that bombers were necessary to defend the United States and its possessions if war came. For Roosevelt, an appreciation for the intricacies of bomber production would not occur until late 1940 . At a 27 September White House meeting without Arnold—he remained “in the dog- house” for his stand against sending aircraft overseas—the presi- dent demanded that b-17s be sent to Britain. Marshall responded that, aside from a few squadrons stationed on the Philippines and Hawaii, the United States possessed a grand total of forty-nine of the heavy bombers for its own defense. “The President’s head went back as if someone had hit him in the chest,” recalled new Secretary of War Henry Stimson, who believed that Roosevelt “fi- nally saw the situation we were in.”57 On 4 May 1941, the pres- ident ordered the production of five hundred heavy bombers per month.
