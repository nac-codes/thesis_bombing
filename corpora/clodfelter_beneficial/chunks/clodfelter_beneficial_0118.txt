The only restriction given George was that his proposal had to conform to rainbow 5, the overall war plan agreed to by the British and American staffs in May 1941. rainbow 5 designated Germany as the major Axis threat and stated that Anglo-American efforts would focus on defeating Germany first while maintaining a strategic defensive against Japan. Like Nap Gorrell in 1917, George realized that he could not estimate the number of aircraft needed without first determining how air power would be used. In that regard, he faced a dilemma. Although he and his staff were convinced that strategic bombing could inde - pendently defeat Germany, they also had to submit a plan that was palatable to the Army hierarchy. Just as Pershing had expressed concern over the airmen’s em- phasis on independent air operations in World War I, Marshall, while favorably disposed toward strategic bombing, was likely to reject a plan making no reference to air support for the ground forces. The Chief of Staff had recently called for twelve groups of “Stuka-type” dive bombers in a proposed air expansion to eighty- four groups.73 Accordingly, George listed the American air mis- sion as: “To wage a sustained air offensive against German mili-tary power, supplemented by air offensives against other regions under enemy control which contribute toward that power; to sup- port a final offensive, if it becomes necessary to invade the con-tinent; in addition, to conduct effective air operations i
