Yet George also acknowl- edged that air power would be available to guarantee an invasion’s success if the need arose. Six years earlier, as an Air Corps Tacti- cal School instructor, he had asked his students whether air power could achieve a solo victory in war. He now aimed to construct an air campaign that answered that question with a resounding yes. The progressive notions of Tactical School theory formed the plan’s underpinnings; the challenge was to translate accepted be- liefs, based on hypothetical applications against generic enemies, into a specific design against an enemy that was very real. Ger - many—a “modern” nation waging “modern” war—appeared to be an especially apt choice for testing Tactical School principles. If the test proved successful, the bomber offensive would yield vic- tory—and serve as a vindication for air force autonomy. Having determined that strategic bombing would be the es- sence of America’s air effort, George and his planners worked to identify those parts of Germany’s industrial web that contributed the most to Hitler’s war effort. Hansell’s studies while assigned to the Strategic Air Intelligence office were invaluable in this en-deavor. Using them, planners concluded that the electric power, transportation, and oil production systems were the key compo- nents of the German economy. They
