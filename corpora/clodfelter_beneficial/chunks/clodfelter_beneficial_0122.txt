ability of destroying it—the same percentage deemed acceptable in sim-ilar problems at the Air Corps Tactical School. 80 In addition—as Gorrell had pointed out in 1917—bombers would have to attack many targets more than once to prevent the Germans from repair - ing the damage. The planners anticipated that the Germans could repair most targets other than electric power facilities within two to four weeks; power plants would take longer to restore.81 George’s group next calculated the number of bombers required to guarantee a 90 percent level of destruction to the 154 key tar - gets selected, given the expected accuracy and the need for re-peated attacks. They determined that 1,100 bombers were nec - essary to ensure a 90 percent probability of destroying a single hundred-foot-by-hundred-foot target under combat conditions.82 A like number of aircraft would have to return to that target in two weeks to keep it out of action. Planners quickly realized that the aaf needed an enormous number of bombers to destroy the German war effort through constant pounding. George thought that dismantling German industry required at least six months of non-stop bombing, and planners anticipated an April–Septem-ber offensive to coincide with the most favorable flying weather. Given weather, maintenance, and crew rest limitations, they esti-mated that a bomb group containing seventy aircraft could send thirty-six of its bombers against Germany eight times a month. 83 Thus, to wreck the 154 key targets in a six-month span would re- quire ninety-eight bomb groups—or 6,860 bombers—at the start of the offensive.f r o m  p r o p h e c y  t o p l a n EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
