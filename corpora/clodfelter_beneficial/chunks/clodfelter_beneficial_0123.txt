e 114 --- 97 Those bombers would consist of ten groups of b-25s and b-26s, twenty groups of b-17s and b-24s, twenty-four groups of b-29s, and forty-four groups of b-36s. Planners noted that the ideal type of bomber for the offensive was the b-29, a recently designed four-engine marvel; two-engine b -25 and b -26 “medium bomb- ers” would suffice “only because they were available.”84 The vast numbers would swamp airfields in Great Britain, which would serve as home base for the b-17s, b-24s, b-25s, and b-26s. b-29s would operate against Germany from Northern Ireland and the Middle East. The b-36, a proposed behemoth with a four-thou - sand-mile range, could fly from Newfoundland, Greenland, Af - rica, India, or the northeastern United States. George’s staff antic- ipated that each group engaged in combat would lose 20 percent of its aircraft (and 15 percent of its flying personnel) per month, creating a requirement for an additional 1,272 bombers.85 Although the estimate of bombers needed to assault Germany dwarfed previous aircraft projections for the entire Army Air Forces, 86 those bombers were by no means the only airplanes George and his planners envisioned. The massive air offensive against the Third Reich required fighters to defend air bases and support aircraft. Moreover, substantial numbers of fighters and bombers were needed to defend the Western Hemisphere, and the teeth of the strategic defensive in the Pacific would consist of b-29s and b-32s operating from bases in Alaska, Siberia, and the Philip- pines. All told, George’s group calculated that 239 groups and 108 observation squadrons were necessary to defeat the Axis—a grand total of 63,467 airplanes. If the United States began fighting, as an- ticipated, in the spring of 1942, planners thought that the nation would be hard pressed to produce such an armada before the end of 1943.87 Still, they believed that a land invasion of Germany in less than three years was unlikely, thus giving air power a chanc
