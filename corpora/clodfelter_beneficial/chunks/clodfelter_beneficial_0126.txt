The turmoil created by Pearl Harbor canceled a scheduled briefing on awpd-1 to the president, and Hansell later termed the lost opportunity “a cruel disappointment” because he believed that it prevented bombing advocate Roosevelt from fully understanding the value of a con- centrated air offensive. 93 Yet the seemingly inevitable march to- ward war in the late summer of 1941, with the Japanese defying Roosevelt’s oil embargo as they advanced across China, and the Germans threatening Atlantic sea lanes while they plowed toward Moscow, was likely a key reason that both Marshall and Stimson endorsed awpd- 1 without complaint.

Just as Gorrell had worked to convince Pershing that his plan for bombing Germany would not deny air support to ground forces, awpd- 1 specifically noted that air power would support an invasion of Europe if such an invasion proved necessary. Some airmen viewed the obligation to demonstrate that they would support their pare
