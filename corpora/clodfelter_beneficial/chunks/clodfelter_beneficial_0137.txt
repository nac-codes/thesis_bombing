Just imagine for yourself bombs hitting wash- ington and the Pentagon Building through a thick snowstorm. what will it do? the ger- man people cannot take that kind of terror much longer.” • Lt. gEn. ira C. EakEr to arnoLd, novEmBEr 1943 17 August 1943 Thirteen minutes after the last of 139 b-17s from Eighth Air Force’s Fourth Bomb Wing had crossed the Dutch coast, the first German fighters appeared. Instantly, the bomber crews knew that their mis- givings about the mission against the sprawling Messerschmitt factory at Regensburg were justified. The daylight raid would mark the deepest penetration into Germany yet for an Ameri- can bomber force, and would occur in tandem with an assault by 222 b-17s of the First Bomb Wing against the ball bearing plants at Schweinfurt, responsible for almost 50 percent of Germany’s output. Both the Regensburg and Schweinfurt formations would proceed to their targets largely unescorted despite sixteen squad- rons of Spitfires and eighteen squadrons of p-47s that accompa- nied them across the English Channel, because no Allied fighter possessed the range to fly beyond the German frontier.
