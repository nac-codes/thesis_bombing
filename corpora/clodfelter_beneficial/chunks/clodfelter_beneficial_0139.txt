lot to ask for from a bombing force that had never flown so far across hos-tile territory. Pre-mission briefers told crews to expect “negligi - ble” opposition, but the airmen had routinely flown missions that summer that produced loss rates approaching 10 percent, and ex- pected the worst. Their fears increased when dense fog shrouded their British bases that morning. “The mission itself started under a cloud of doubt and we didn’t know until the last minute whether it would be scrubbed or not,” Colonel Curtis LeMay, the Fourth Bomb Wing Commander, said afterward. “Finally, 26 minutes be- EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

LeMay had trained his crews extensively in instrument take-offs, but even he called the assembly of his seven groups of b-17s “miraculous” given that they had to climb through two dense layers of over - cast.3 The formation finally departed for Regensburg ninety min- utes behind the time originally scheduled. Meanwhile, LeMay’s counterpart commanding the First Bomb Wing, Brigadier General Robert Williams, did not receive the take-off order until almost an hour and a half after LeMay got the word—which resulted in a departure for Schweinfurt five hours later than the originally scheduled time and almost four hours after LeMay’s Fourth Wing had left. Rather than cancel the Schweinfurt part of the mission, the Commander of VIII Bomber Command, Brigadier General Frederick Anderson, determined that the importance of the tar - gets justified the risks involved in dispatching the two bomb wings individually.4 As a result, almost three hundred Luftwaffe fight- ers were available to attack
