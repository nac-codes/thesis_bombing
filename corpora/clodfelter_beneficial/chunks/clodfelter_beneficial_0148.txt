mmented after the war that he had intended to make Ar - nold “as nearly as I could Chief of Staff of the Air without any restraint,” but added that Arnold was “very subordinate” and complemented Marshall’s strategic inclinations.22 Indeed, Arnold once confided to Eaker, “If George Marshall ever took a position contrary to mine, I would know I was wrong.”23 Marshall’s support proved insufficient, though, to give Arnold and his cohorts a true appreciation for the magnitude of the task they faced at the start of their air offensive against Hitler’s Eu- rope; moreover, they could not envision how the momentum gen- erated by a war against an equally committed foe would trans- form their progressive notions about bombing. The men who had crafted awpd- 1’s requirements had done so based on their faith in a uniquely American approach to applying air power, but had no empirical evidence to back their claims. They largely dismissed pre- vious examples of bombing because those episodes did not corre- spond to the theory, equipment, and techniques that they deemed essential for a successful air campaign.24 Instead, as they began to assemble a bombing force in England, they did so with the be- lief that their precision air offensive would quickly and efficiently wreck German war-making capability—and hence its will to re-sist—in contrast to the raf’s bludgeon aimed directly at German morale. They were reluctant to heed their British counterparts who sported more than two years of bombing experience, including a disastrous daylight effort against Germany in 1939–40. 25 In July 1942, Eighth Air Force finally received its first comple- ment of 180 aircraft, which included 40 b-17 “Flying Fortresses.”26 Those b-17s were “E” models and differed significantly from the “C” models that the British had acquired in 1941.
