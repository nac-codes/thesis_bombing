The fighters that initially arrived as part of Eighth Air Force did so to protect friendly bomber airfields from German attack; awpd- 1’s designers had intended them for that purpose, not to protect bombers in flight. 28 Although Hansell and a few others argued before the war that pursuit aircraft (fighters) would prove useful as bomber escorts, their pleas fell on mostly deaf ears, and those who listened did not believe that a suitable single-seat fighter could be built with sufficient range to accompany bombers to tar - get.29 The b-17 and the b-24 (the other four-engine bomber that comprised Eighth Air Force’s “heavy” bomber force) would have to fight through the toughest German defenses alone, as would two-engine “medium” bombers such as the b-25 and b -26 that also were a part of the Eighth. Spaatz, for one, expressed little concern about the challenges ahead. One week after the Eighth Air Force’s first bombing raid of the war, a 17 August 1942 attack by 12 b-17s against a marshal- ling yard near Rouen, France, he wrote Arnold that with 1 ,500 heavy and medium bombers, plus 800 fighters to defend his air - fields, he would have “complete aerial supremacy over Germany within a year, with the resultant insurance of he
