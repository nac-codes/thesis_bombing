The pilot of the lead aircraft was one of the best in the Army Air Forces, Major Paul Tibbets Jr., and the gifted commander of the Ninety-seventh Bomb Group, Colonel Frank Armstrong Jr.—who would serve as the model for “Frank Savage” in the novel and movie Twelve O’Clock High!—flew as copilot.

Yet, despite the fanfare resulting from America’s first bombing raid in Europe, few bombs hit the target, and the over - all results were marginal, though no bombers were lost. Four similar missions against French targets followed, again wit
