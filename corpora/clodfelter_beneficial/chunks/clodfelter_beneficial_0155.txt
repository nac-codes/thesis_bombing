hough initially apprehensive about the inability to take evasive action on the bomb run, crews found that their loss rate to German flak actually declined with a steady approach to target. LeMay had already reached that conclusion by using the artillery manual from his Ohio State rotc course to b r e a c h i n g  f o r t r e s s  e u r o p e EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Eaker soon found himself on the defensive from the British, led by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who contended that the Americans should abandon daylight bombing and join the raf’s night campaign against German cities. On the evening of 13 January 1943—while hosting his first dinner guests after becoming Eighth Air Force Commander—Eaker received a telephone call from General Eisenhower, order - ing him to report at once to Casablanca, where Churchill would meet Roosevelt in top-level strategy discussions.
