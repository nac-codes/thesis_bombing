Arnold and the rest of the Combined Chiefs of Staff would attend as well, and Arnold wanted Eaker to dissuade the prime minister from recom- mending American night bombing to Roosevelt. Eaker needed lit- tle persuasion. Three months earlier, after comparing British and American bombing methods, he had written Spaatz: “I believe it is clearly demonstrated that the efficiency of day bombardment over night bombardment is in the order of ten to one.”45 Churchill had spoken favorably of Eaker in the past, and Arnold believed b r e a c h i n g  f o r t r e s s  e u r o p e EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

The president and the prime minister had both determined well before the conference that they would pursue a policy of com- plete surrender for the Axis powers; Roosevelt believed that the failure to crush the German regime in World War I had spawned the stab-i
