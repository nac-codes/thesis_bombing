m those guidelines—and Eaker’s promise to Churchill and the high demand for bombers in North Africa and elsewhere guaranteed that the Eighth Air Force would begin its portion of the “Com-bined Bomber Offensive” (cbo) with less than the desired num- ber of aircraft—then the time required would take far more than half a year. Moreover, the six-month estimate assumed (1) a high degree of bombing accuracy on a consistent basis, (2) the bomb-ing force would prevail against German defenses in a reasonable amount of time, and (3 ) the Germans would yield as a result of destruction rendered. Those premises were thin reeds at best, and “unconditional surrender” made the final notion especially prob- lematic. Roosevelt’s declaration now defined German defeat not only as military loss, but also as the eradication of the Nazi re-gime. Using bombs to sever the delicate strands of Germany’s in-dustrial web might not suffice to cause the Germans to throw in the towel. 51 target germany, January–June 1943 On 27 January 1943, Eighth Air Force finally launched its first raid against Germany when heavy bombers attacked naval facil- ities at Wilhelmshaven. Only 91 bombers flew on the raid, and of those, only 53 located the cloud-obscured target. Still, only 2 b-24s and 1 b-17 were lost, and crews claimed 50 German fight- ers shot down.52 After dismal weather grounded the bombers for much of February, the Eighth attacked the submarine construction b r e a c h i n g  f o r t r e s s  e u r o p e EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
