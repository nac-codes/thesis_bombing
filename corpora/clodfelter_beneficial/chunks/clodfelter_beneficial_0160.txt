Their conclusions paralleled Hansell’s earlier findings in awpd-42. The coa initially placed aircraft, electric power, oil, rubber, transpor - tation, chemicals, and electric equipment at the top of their Pri - ority A list.58 Arnold placed enormous weight on their priorities, and directed that his commanders follow the committee’s recom- mendations in selecting targets.59 Initially skeptical of the group and prospects that it might “try to run the air war from Washing- ton,” Eaker relented after meeting many committee members, and for the remainder of his tenure as Eighth Air Force commander he frequently consulted the coa on targeting possibilities.60 Besides considering coa suggestions, Eaker also had to address Allied concerns.
