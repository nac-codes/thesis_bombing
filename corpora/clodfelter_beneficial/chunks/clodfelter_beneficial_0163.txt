percent loss rate when escorted, compared to a 7 percent loss rate without the “little friends.”66 Eaker appreciated the value of escorts to a degree, writing that “it is most important to have some fighter protection” on raids with fewer than three hundred bombers.67 His preference, though, was to increase the size of the bomber force until its own defensive firepower would suffice to protect it. On the eve of Casablanca he learned that Spaatz’s Twelfth Air Force would receive twenty- eight b-17 replacements originally slated for the Eighth. Eaker no- tified Arnold’s air staff that his average bomber group strength had shrunk from thirty-five to eighteen aircraft—the total needed to put in the air on combat missions—which meant that he now had zero bombers available for spares or as a reserve force. 68 For the next four months he refused to commit more bombers and crews than he could replace with the meager numbers of aircraft and men heading his way. 69 Eaker’s struggle to obtain more bombers merged with efforts to determine how best to use the force that he had. In early Feb-ruary he met with coa representatives to exchange views on tar - gets that Eighth Air Force might attack with precision bombing. Eaker offered that “no judgment could be made as to the results b r e a c h i n g  f o r t r e s s  e u r o p e EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
