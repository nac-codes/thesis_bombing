s of Germany’s ability to fight. A steady increase in bomber strength was vital to success. Eaker ar - gued that he would need a total force of at least 800 bombers to dispatch 300 on a regular basis, and ultimately he would require a force of 2,700 “heavies.” After limited debate, the Joint Chiefs concurred. They approved Eaker’s plan in early May and recom-mended “implementing it to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with aircraft production, available shipping, and cur - rent strategic commitments.” 80 At the Trident Conference later that month, the Combined Chiefs of Staff endorsed Eaker’s plan as well. Moreover, they tied a cross- channel invasion—tentatively set for May 1944—to the successful b r e a c h i n g  f o r t r e s s  e u r o p e EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

By the end of May 1943 Eaker wrote his British counterpart, Air Marshal Arthur Harris, that bombers and crews had begun to arrive “according to sched- ule” and expressed optimism that Eighth Air Force would receive 2,700 heavy bombers by April 1944.83 The plan that spurred Eighth Air Force’s bomber total was a masterpiece of mechanistic logic solidly anchored to progressive roots. It noted that the coa had identified sixty targets, the de - struction of which “would gravely impair and might paralyze the Western Axis war effort.”84 Eaker added sixteen targets to the mix and divi
