It noted that the coa had identified sixty targets, the de - struction of which “would gravely impair and might paralyze the Western Axis war effort.”84 Eaker added sixteen targets to the mix and divided them all into six “systems,” comprising seventy-six precision targets that, once destroyed, would critically damage the German war machine. Those systems included: submarine con- struction yards and bases, the aircraft industry, ball bearings, oil, synthetic rubber and tires, and military transport vehicles. The plan linked Germany’s aircraft industry to the overriding inter - mediate objective of eliminating fighter strength in Western Eu-rope. Wrecking the associated targets would destroy 43 percent of Germany’s fighter capacity and 65 percent of its bomber ca- pacity and “produce the effect desired.” 85 The plan also highlighted ball bearings, which the coa had em- phasized since early February. “The critical condition of the ball bearing industry is startling,” the plan observed. “The concentra- tion of that industry renders it outstandingly vulnerable to air at- tack.” Eaker noted that the destruction of the plants at Schweinfurt b r e a c h i n g  f o r t r e s s  e u r o p e EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Yet he cautioned: “It would be most unwise to attempt it until we are perfectly sure we have enough force to destroy the objective in a single operation. Any attempt to repeat such an at-tack will meet with very bitter opposition.” 86 While acknowledging the strength of German air defenses, Eaker insisted
