171 --- 130analysis should “not harp too much on small precision targets. We find they are hard to hit, particularly in the face of heavy aa [anti- aircraft] fire and determined fighter opposition.”88 Besides enemy defenses, Hansell remarked that the wind and sun also played a role in bombing accuracy. The Norden bombsight could not com- pensate for cross-wind bombing approaches when the winds ex- ceeded 80 mph, and on crystal clear days a haze developed that was “frequently literally impenetrable toward the sun.”89 The “pre- cision pattern bombing” that Eaker had mentioned in his April briefing to the Joint Chiefs was fantasy; LeMay’s technique signif- icantly increased the odds that a group formation bombed in uni- son, but even ideal conditions could not guarantee “precision.”90 Too many variables affected bombing accuracy, and Eighth Air Force bomber crews had no control over most of them. 91 Eaker privately acknowledged that limitation as Allied leaders prepared to endorse his plan for the Combined Bomber Offen-sive. But he downplayed the significance of his admission by fo- cusing instead on the growing strength of Eighth Air Force, writ- ing Arnold in May 1943: As a result of the additional force we have just received and the in- creased rate of supply of replacement aircraft and crews, we are chang- ing our operating policy. In the past as I told you, we have matched our rate of operation to our receipt of replacements, so that our Air Force would not waste away and go downhill. We have, therefore, in the past, waited for good days when we could be reasonably sure of seeing our targets from high altitude. We are going now on a new ba- sis when we will go out in force on days when we may not be able to bomb our exact small point targets due to more than 5 /10ths cloud cover, but we will at any rate be able to hit our second or last resort targets, the built-up industrial area, and what is even more important, we will be able to work on the German Air Force i
