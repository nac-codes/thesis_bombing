April 1943. “There is difficulty only in convincing those in whose hands lies the power to grasp the opportunity.” Having received the blessing of Combined Chiefs in May, Harris set out to achieve aerial effects in concert with his American ally that he believed would “decide all.” 98 In actuality the Combined Bomber Offensive, officially desig- nated “Operation Pointblank,” provided few instances of genu- ine cooperation between the two bomber forces. Their distinctive targeting philosophies, exemplified by the raf’s night bombing aimed at morale and the Army Air Forces’ daylight effort aimed at industrial production—along with the intense American desire to demonstrate independent success to bolster the bid for service autonomy—led to largely separate air campaigns. 99 A notable exception occurred at the end of July when Harris turned his at-tention to Hamburg.

Hamburg also made a distinct impression on American polit- ical and military leaders. Roosevelt saw the raids as “an impres-siv
