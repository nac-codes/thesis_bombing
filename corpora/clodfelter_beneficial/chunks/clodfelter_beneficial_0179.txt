t Schweinfurt met a similar dismal fate and produced similar mea-ger results. Ploesti, Regensburg, and Schweinfurt exemplified the carnage that Luftwaffe defenses inflicted on Eighth Air Force throughout the summer and early autumn of 1943. Eaker tried to offset the losses by increasing his total of bombers and crews. He possessed almost 700 bombers by July, allowing him to launch some raids with as many as 300 aircraft, but he still lacked the numbers to do so on a consistent basis, plus his crew totals remained insuffi-cient. 113 Production problems in the United States left him short 240 bombers, and the diversions that had plagued him during the spring continued. 114 At his April briefing to the Joint Chiefs, he stated that he would likely need to replace a third of his force each month because of attrition, 115 but loss rates often neared 10 percent on the missions flown against Germany in August. Losses among new crews were higher still—four new groups that arrived in April averaged a loss of 21 aircraft in eighteen missions, while four experienced groups on the same missions averaged 9.116 Eaker told Arnold that new crews needed at least two weeks of train-ing to make them mission ready and that several losses occurred because “the formations are not always flown as instructed.” Yet b r e a c h i n g  f o r t r e s s  e u r o p e EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
