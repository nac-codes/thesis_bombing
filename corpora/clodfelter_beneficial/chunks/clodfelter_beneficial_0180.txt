German fighter force, which was responsible for the vast majority of bomber losses. 118 The p-47 “Thunderbolt” and the p-51 “Mustang,” two single-seat fighters with promising capa- bilities as escorts, lacked the range to venture far beyond the Ger - man border, and German fighter pilots waited until the escorts turned back to pounce. Engineers thus far had limited success de- veloping “drop tanks” to extend the American fighters’ range. At- tempts to protect bombers with the yb-40, a b-17 that carried no bombs and sported extra turrets and machine guns, failed miser - ably—the aircraft’s performance characteristics differed too much from standard bombers to keep place in formation. Eaker believed that with more bombers he could ultimately overcome the Luft-waffe, and that his bomber crews had already inflicted substan - tial losses on the German fighter force. He surmised that more bombers and larger formations offered greater firepower to shoot down German fighters. Eaker also pressed for fighter escorts, but he did not completely dismiss the yb- 40, which he thought was “a good idea but we have not quite gotten the correct aircraft for carrying it out.”119 To the pilots, navigators, bombardiers, and gunners who bat- tled the Luftwaffe, the prospects for success appeared grim in - deed. Most bomber crewmen did not focus on whether their ac-tions contributed to Germany’s demise. Instead, their definition of success was simple—survival. In January 1943, Eaker and Ar - nold gave heavy bomber crews a requirement of twenty-five com- bat missions, after which they would transfer to assignments free of combat duty.
