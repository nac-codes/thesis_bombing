eleven the previ - ous May—so many aircraft and crews that Lieutenant General James “Jimmy” Doolittle, the new Eighth Air Force Commander, could regularly send out missions with a mix of seven hundred  b l u d g e o n i n g  w i t h  b o m b s EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Many of Doolittle’s b-17s were new “G” models, which had a combat radius of seven hundred miles—nearly three hundred miles more than most of Eaker’s b-17s—plus they could carry two thousand more pounds of bombs. The “G” model also possessed a chin turret under its Plexiglas nose to ward off head- on fighter attacks, a favorite tactic of the Luftwaffe pilots. The b-24 had received a nose-turret as well, though it was manned in- stead of remotely operated as in the b -17 and made the bomber a bit wobbly in flight, yet the “Liberator” could still carry the same seven-thousand-pound bomb load as the “G” model “Fly-ing Fortress.” 18 b-24s comprised two-thirds of the heavy bomb- ers in Fifteenth Air Force, headquartered in Foggia, Italy, and ca-pable of attacking targets in southern Germany, Austria, and the Balkans. By February 1944, the Fifteenth possessed twelve groups of “heavies.”19 An increase in fighter strength for Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces matched the sizable gains in heavy bombers—and Army Air Forces engineers finally began to perfect 75- and 108-gallon drop tanks that allowed fighter escort for a distance of six hun- dred miles, enough to reach Berlin. The p-47 “Thunderbolt” and p-51 “Mustang” were the key escort fighters; both could fly in ex- cess of 430 mph above 25,000 feet, and the p-47 could approach 550 in a dive. At the beginning of 1944 Eighth Air Force possessed eleven fighter groups containing between seventy-five and ninety- six aircraft each, and by February Fifteenth Air Force would have four fighter groups of its own.
