ighth Air Force possessed eleven fighter groups containing between seventy-five and ninety- six aircraft each, and by February Fifteenth Air Force would have four fighter groups of its own. In addition, Spaatz and Doolittle de- cided that Eighth Air Force fighter pilots, who had thus far flown escort by staying close to the bombers that they defended, could now roam freely to seek out Luftwaffe fighters. Eighth Air Force fighter pilots also received the same amount of credit for destroy - ing enemy aircraft on the ground as they did in aerial combat to encourage the strafing of airfields.

Given the situation that he faced, he felt that he had little choice. He had three months to wrestle control of the air from the Luft- waffe; in April, General Eisenhower would take charge of usstaf (and raf Bomber Command) for invasion support. Yet Spaatz also knew that he had an abundance of numbers and a steady stream of replacements, while Ultra intelligence intercepts told him that the German fighter force had suffered severely during Eaker’s fall offensive—so much that Luftwaffe commanders had reduced re-cuperation times for wounded pilots, and even ordered test and transport pilots to fly against American bombers. 21 In late January, Spaatz wrote Arnold that he could not sim- ply wait for decent weather to bomb German aircraft factories— destroying them would not suffice to gain daylight air superiority in the time allotted. Thus, Spaatz would also bomb German air - fields, and he would further attack “objectives which force Ger - ma
