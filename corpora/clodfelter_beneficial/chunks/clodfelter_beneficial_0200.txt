destroying them would not suffice to gain daylight air superiority in the time allotted. Thus, Spaatz would also bomb German air - fields, and he would further attack “objectives which force Ger - man fighters into combat action within range of our fighters.” In short, he would wage attrition warfare, and use his bombers as bait. “Losses will be heavy,” he stated, “but we must be prepared to accept them.”22 He was confident not just that he could sustain the losses, but also that the magnitude of destruction inflicted on the Luftwaffe would produce air superiority in the shortest amount of time. Spaatz even acknowledged a willingness to risk bombers without fighter escort if such attacks yielded corresponding dam - age to the Luftwaffe. “Under peculiar weather conditions when all of Germany is fog-bound,” he told Arnold, “raids might be made well beyond fighter cover on area targets, such as Berlin, to force the German fighters into the air under conditions which will re - sult in heavy operational losses to their fighters.” 23b l u d g e o n i n g  w i t h  b o m b s EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

American engineers at mit had perfected their own version of the British h2s device, and the Amer - ican model, dubbed h2x, employed a shorter microwave length that resulted in a sharper radar picture of the ground. But h2x did not appreciably increase bombing accuracy, and the Army Air Forces official historians glumly noted that with radar “the aim- ing point became a highly theoretical term.”24 Arnold knew that radar bombing was far from precise, but he did not want his air commanders to convey that impression pub-licly. He directed Spaatz to avoid the phrase “blind bombing” when referring to raids with h2x, and Spaatz agreed to label such attacks
