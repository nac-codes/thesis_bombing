e did not want his air commanders to convey that impression pub-licly. He directed Spaatz to avoid the phrase “blind bombing” when referring to raids with h2x, and Spaatz agreed to label such attacks “overcast bombing technique,” “bombing through the overcast,” or “bombing with navigational devices over clouds ex- tending up to 20,000 feet.”25 Regardless of the terminology used, Eighth Air Force bombers mounted six weeks of radar raids, in-cluding a mission by more than eight hundred b-17s and b-24s against Frankfurt on 29 January, which mirrored raf Bomber Command’s area attacks in terms of methods used and damage inflicted. Remarked the aaf historians: “It seemed better to bomb low-priority targets frequently, even with less than precision ac-curacy, than not to bomb at all.” 26 While Spaatz likely agreed with that assessment, he could not wait indefinitely to achieve significant results. On 8 February he di- rected that “Operation Argument,” the anticipated assault against the German aircraft industry by the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces, would conclude by 1 March 1944 . Primary targets would consist of airframe and final assembly plants for single- and dual-engine fighters as well as ball bearing production facilities, which mem-bers of the Committee of Operations Analysts (coa) and usstaf planners alike deemed essential to aircraft construction. 27 Those targets all demanded “precision” bombing, and to attack them b l u d g e o n i n g  w i t h  b o m b s EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Thick clouds had canceled Argument on numerous occasions, but Spaatz could no longer wait for ideal conditions and accepted that poor weather might lead to losses exceeding two hundred bomb- ers for a single mission.28 On 19 February usstaf’s weather officers predicted a period of clear
