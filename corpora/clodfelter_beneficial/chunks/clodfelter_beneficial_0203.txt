Besides inflicting substantial damage in the air, Big Week also hurt the German aircraft industry. Radar bombing occurred on few missions; crews conducted most attacks with the Norden bomb- sight.33 b-17s and b-24s dropped more than ten thousand tons of bombs during the six-day span—more tonnage than the Eighth Air Force had dropped on all targets for all of 1943.34 The attacks completely wrecked the Regensburg complex and damaged other facilities as well, but analysts’ claims that the attacks had reduced production to 650 aircraft a month were wishful thinking. In ac- tuality, the large amount of slack in the German aircraft indus-try enabled the monthly production rate to increase despite the raids; many factories with only one shift of workers changed to twenty-four-hour operations. 35 Still, Big Week stymied German production plans. Nazi economic leaders had calculated that they could produce 80, 000 aircraft a year by 1945, yet they reached only 36,000 in 1944.36 Big Week was a key reason that they could not produce more. Buoyed by Big Week’s success, Spaatz turned his attention to the target that American airmen had most wanted to bomb since their first raid over Hitler’s Europe—Berli
