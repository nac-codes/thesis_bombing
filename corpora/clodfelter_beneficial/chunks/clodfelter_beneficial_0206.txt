Without the damage that Eaker’s Eighth Air Force had in- flicted on the Luftwaffe, Spaatz could never have gained air su-periority in the time allotted. In one sense, the achievement of air superiority that enabled Overlord fulfilled the progressive goal of inexpensive results by guaranteeing that fewer Allied soldiers would die in the invasion than if the Germans had retained control of the air. Whether the Allies would have attempted a cross-Channel assault lacking con- trol of the air remains doubtful, though, especially in light of the disastrous Dieppe raid in August 1942. 44 American air leaders hoped that the bomber offensive might eliminate the need for an invasion by wrecking German capability and will to fight once the air campaign gained control of the sky.
