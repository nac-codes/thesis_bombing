xamined prospects for attacking oil production and refining centers. They rejected such raids because they estimated that the Germans would not feel effects from them for at least six months, too long a time to influence the battle for air superiority that Spaatz had to win by April.55 Once he had gained daylight control of the air, the de- sire to attack those targets resurfaced. In late March, Spaatz argued that destroying Germany’s oil sup- ply would provide the greatest support to the invasion by restrict- ing enemy troop movements, but Eisenhower thought that attacks on transportation lines in northern France and Belgium would pay b l u d g e o n i n g  w i t h  b o m b s EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Spaatz pressed Eisenhower for limited attacks on oil—and even threatened resignation over the issue.57 Eisenhower relented, and gave him permission to use two good-weather days to attack synthetic oil facilities. Spaatz knew that the plans for bombing Germany called for six months of concentrated attacks on key industries to produce tell - ing results, yet he thought that he could inflict significant damage to the Nazi oil system with intermittent raids while the focus re-mained on supporting Overlord. He now possessed a vast force of more than three thousand heavy bombers, and Fifteenth Air Force provided the capability to attack key Balkan targets like Ploesti on a regular basis. 58 In fact, Spaatz had already begun the assault on Ploesti under the guise of attacking the city’s rail yards to support the Russian advance in Romania—most
