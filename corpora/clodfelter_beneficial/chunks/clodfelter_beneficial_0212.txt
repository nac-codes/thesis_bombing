d Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, “The enemy has struck us at one of our weakest points. If they persist at it this time, we will no longer have any fuel pro-duction worth mentioning.” 63 The results of the raids pleased Eisenhower, and he not only approved additional attacks on German oil targets for 28 and 29 May, but also permitted Spaatz to make oil usstaf’s top priority target on 8 June. Heavy bombers knocked out nine-tenths of avi- ation fuel production before Spaatz had to return his focus to in-vasion support on 22 June. 64 For the next month, attacks on oil facilities fluctuated according to the needs of the ground offen-sive in France. coa members spent much of June examining Germany’s oil sys- tem and revised their earlier estimate. This time they determined that oil was particularly vulnerable to bombing. Analysts con-cluded that the Germans could not easily hide or disperse their sprawling refineries and synthetic production facilities. In addi- tion, the Germans possessed no excess refining capability. Ploesti was essential to the Nazi war effort, but other refineries in Ger - many, France, Belgium, and Hungary were also important. The coa identified twelve key refineries and five synthetic oil plants that, if destroyed in a single month, two months later would pro- duce “a very serious curtailment in German military operations.” One analyst estimated that after three months, if other refineries remained at current production levels, “you will have immobi -b l u d g e o n i n g  w i t h  b o m b s EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

They will not be able to either fight or manufacture.”65 Such assessments intensified Spaatz’s desire to wreck German oil. As the air power demands in the Italian ground war began to subside, he dispatched Fifteenth Air Force heavies to wreck the oil target at the top of the list once
