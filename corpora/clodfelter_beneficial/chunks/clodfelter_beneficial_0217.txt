(We would no longer require bomb- ing strictly military targets.)”75 Once he received Spaatz’s critique, Eisenhower hedged—but only slightly. The Supreme Allied Com- mander acknowledged that he had always insisted on bombing precision targets, yet he was “always prepared to take part in any- thing that gives real promise to ending the war quickly.” Given the losses suffered during the invasion and breakout from the Nor - mandy beachhead—with the likelihood of tougher fighting as his troops neared Germany—Eisenhower found air power’s prospects for achieving a rapid victory enticing.

Spaatz then had Jimmy Doolittle, the Eighth Air Force Commander, scrub plans to attack military objectives in Berlin and prepare for bombing “indiscrim- inately on the town” when Eisenhower gave the order.77b l u d g e o n i n g  w i t h  b o m b s EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Kuter was therefore reluctant to endorse Thunderclap. He surmised that the impetus for the British proposal stemmed from their de- sire to retaliate for the recent buzz bomb a
