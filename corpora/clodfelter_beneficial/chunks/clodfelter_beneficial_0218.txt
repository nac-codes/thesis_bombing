their desire to resist. Kuter was therefore reluctant to endorse Thunderclap. He surmised that the impetus for the British proposal stemmed from their de- sire to retaliate for the recent buzz bomb attacks against England. Although he realized that Thunderclap’s intent was to break the will of the German leaders, he noted that civilians would bear the brunt of the attacks. “The bombing of civilian targets in Germany cannot be expected to have similar effects to those which might be expected in a democratic country where the people are still able to influence the national will,” he asserted. Kuter reiterated that it was “contrary to our national ideals to wage war against civil- ians.” Yet—consistent with awpd-1’s caveat three years before— he conceded that a time might arrive when attacks “against other than objectives immediately related to the battle” might tip the balance and end the war. Thus, while opposed to the British pro-posal, he recommended planning for it—just in case. 78 After examining the arguments, General Arnold directed usstaf to develop a plan for including British and American air forces in an “all-out, widespread attack” against Germany that would last roughly a week. Its purpose would not be to obliterate cit-ies or towns, nor would Berlin be the sole target. Rather, the as- sault would strike “military objectives of numerous types . . . to give every citizen an opportunity to see positive proof of Allied air power.” Arnold stated that such an operation could be “de-cisive” if conducted at the proper moment. 79 In mid-September, Spaatz’s headquarters began working on a plan for attacking mo- rale that did “not harbor the cold-blooded slaughter of civilians.” b l u d g e o n i n g  w i t h  b o m b s EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
