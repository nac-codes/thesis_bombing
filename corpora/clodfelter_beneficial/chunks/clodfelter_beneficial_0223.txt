The proposed attack on Berlin promised independent success that could overshadow the meager perfor - mance in the Pacific. A bombing-induced German collapse would not only save a multitude of Allied lives, it would cause political and military leaders around the world to acknowledge air power as the source of salvation. Thunderclap thus offered the chance to satisfy numerous concerns.

Almost one thousand b-17s dropped 2,279 tons of bombs on the city, causing heavy damage to the Reichschancel- lery, Air Ministry, Foreign Office, Ministry of Propaganda, and Gestapo headquarter
