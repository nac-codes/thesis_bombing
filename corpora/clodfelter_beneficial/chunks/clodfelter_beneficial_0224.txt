Almost one thousand b-17s dropped 2,279 tons of bombs on the city, causing heavy damage to the Reichschancel- lery, Air Ministry, Foreign Office, Ministry of Propaganda, and Gestapo headquarters, as well as to many railroad marshalling yards. 97 The raid may have killed as many as twenty-five thou- sand people.98 Against Leipzig and Dresden, the Eighth Air Force again attacked rail yards. In the 14– 15 February raids on Dres- den, clouds obscured the target, and crews mistakenly dumped their bombs on Dresden’s main residential district, which had been heavily bombed the night before by the raf. Refugees fleeing the Russians clogged the city, and between twenty-five thousand and thirty-five thousand civilians perished in the multiple assaults.99 Technically, the attacks on Berlin and Dresden were aimed at military objectives.
