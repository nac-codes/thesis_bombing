Moral qualms and the conviction that attacks aimed at war- making capability were more productive than those aimed at the enemy populace combined to prevent American air leaders from launching a wholesale campaign to kill German civilians. Air com- manders maintained that the essence of German morale was pub- lic support for the war, and that such support was fragile, but they agonized over how best to attack it. While Eaker, with ra-dar bombing in late 1943 , and Spaatz, with the 3 February raid on Berlin, attacked civilian morale directly, it was not their pref- erence to do so. They, as well as their counterparts, believed that attacking civilians indirectly—by terrorizing people rather than killing them, or by depriving them of needed goods and services— was the answer to breaking their will. Yet the difference between attacks intended to terrorize and those intended to kill was a fine one, and the distinction blurred as the war progressed. The impetus to end the war quickly led to the selection of targets—like Dresden’s rail yards—that would also have a maximum impact on civilian morale. When Secretary of War Henry Stimson learned of Dresden’s devastation, he re-quested information on the attacks and asked that “the City be thoroughly photographed to establish that our objectives were, as usual, military in character.” Arnold received the request while recuperating in Coral Gables and scribbled across it: “We must not get soft—War must be destructive and to a certain extent in-human and ruthless.” 102 By 1945, German civilians had no argu- ment with Arnold’s assessment. For them, no distinction existed between the raf Bomber Command’s area attacks and American raids
