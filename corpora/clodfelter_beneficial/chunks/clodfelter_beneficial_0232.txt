The nine months of intense bombing after achieving daylight air superiority paralleled the six-month requirement forecasted by awpd- 1, awpd- 42, and Eaker’s April 1943 cbo plan, though none of those plans anticipated the substantial diversion of the heavy bomber effort to battlefield support. raf Bomber Command made b l u d g e o n i n g  w i t h  b o m b s EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

By December, bombing had destroyed half of Germany’s supply of all petroleum products. The attack on German transportation lines, which be- gan in earnest in September 1944 and generally received second billing to oil targets, reduced the volume of railroad car loadings by 75 percent in February 1945. 115 The clamor for fast results removed the emphasis on efficiency that was a hallmark of American air power’s prewar progressive notions. When combined with the overarching objective of un-conditional surrender, the impetus for speed had dismal conse- quences for the attacker as well as the attacked. The requirement for total victory “with minimum suffering and loss for the victors . . . could justify almost any action that accelerated triumph,” re- marked historian Michael Sherry.116 The Combined Bomber Offen - sive killed 305,000 German civilians, wounded at least 780,000, destroyed the homes of 1,865,000, forced 4,885,000 to evacu- ate, and deprived 20 million of public utilities. By the third quar - ter of 1944 the air offensive had tied down an estimated 4.5 mil- lion workers, almost 20 percent of the non-agricultural labor force, in air raid-related activities.117 The goal of rapid succe
