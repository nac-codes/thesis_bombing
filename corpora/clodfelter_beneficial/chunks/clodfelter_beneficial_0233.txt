quar - ter of 1944 the air offensive had tied down an estimated 4.5 mil- lion workers, almost 20 percent of the non-agricultural labor force, in air raid-related activities.117 The goal of rapid success, though, impelled Spaatz and, to a lesser extent, Eaker to wage a campaign of aerial attrition that produced enormous losses for American airmen in the skies over Hitler’s Europe. By the end of the war Eighth Air Force had suffered 26, 000 fatal casualties— more than the entire United States Marine Corps. 118 All told, the Army Air Forces in the European and Mediterranean theaters lost almost 36,000 men killed.119 Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces combined lost 8,759 heavy bombers.120 raf Bomber Command, which fought for almost three years more than the Americans, b l u d g e o n i n g  w i t h  b o m b s EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

The Survey acknowledged that strategic bombing com-plemented those efforts by achieving air superiority and reduc-ing the quantity, and quality, of materiel that the Germans could bring to the battlefield. Though the dream of a distinctive “victory through air power” remained unfulfilled in Europe, American airmen would have
