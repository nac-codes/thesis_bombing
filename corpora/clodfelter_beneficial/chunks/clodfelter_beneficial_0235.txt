ch passed into the wee hours of the next day, Major General Curtis LeMay could not sleep. Instead, he paced back and forth through the Quonset hut that served as the oper - ations control room of Headquarters XXI Bomber Command on Guam, nervously smoking his trademark cigars. The thirty-eight- year-old LeMay had reason to be anxious. That afternoon he had watched 54 b-29  “Superfortresses” take off from Guam for To - kyo, to be joined by 110 b-29s from Tinian, and another 161 from Saipan.1 As the Commander of XXI Bomber Command in Twen- tieth Air Force, LeMay had ordered the raid, and every aspect of it contradicted the fundamental tenets guiding the American ap-proach to strategic bombing: the heavy bombers would attack at night, without any defensive armament, at extremely low al- EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

After rhetorically asking McKelway why he was still awake, the man who had found the Rex in the At- lantic, designed the Eighth Air Force’s formation tactics, and led the grueling August 1
