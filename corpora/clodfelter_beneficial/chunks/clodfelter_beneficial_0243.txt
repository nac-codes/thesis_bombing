Hap Arnold and his Army Air Forces commanders intended to conduct a sustained, high altitude, daylight, precision bombing campaign against Japanese industries once they could place a sub- stantial bomber force within range of Japan’s home islands. The guiding strategy for a bomber offensive, Arnold insisted, would be the “destruction of Japanese factories in order to cripple pro- duction of munitions and essential articles for maintenance of eco- nomic structure in Japan.”25 Yet Arnold and his cohorts had lit- tle information on the nature of the Japanese industrial complex and its key components. To fill that void, in March 1943 Arnold asked the Committee of Operations Analysts (coa) to identify the appropriate targets for an air campaign against Japan that “would knock [it] out of the war.”26 The coa, composed of civilian “experts” that included bankers and economists, as well as Army Air Forces officers, had directed their previous efforts to dissecting the key war-making components of Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich. The committee mem- bers began their examination of Japan in similar fashion by listing industrial linchpins that, if destroyed, would negate Japan’s capa- bility to fight. By November, they determined that steel was a key strategic target, and noted that the destruction of six coke plants, f i r e  f r o m  t h e s k y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
