It is believed that Japan’s power to wage war effectively would be gravely impaired probably within six months and certainly within one year after the destruction had occurred.”27 Steel was one of the six most important strategic targets iden- tified by the coa; others included merchant shipping, aircraft fac- tories, ball bearing plants, radar and radio facilities, and urban industrial areas. The coa did not stress one set of targets over the other, and the inclusion of “urban industrial areas” recognized the important contribution made by cottage industries to Japan’s war production—as well as the susceptibility of those areas to fire. “Japanese war production (aside from heavy industry) is pe- culiarly vulnerable to incendiary attack of urban areas because of the widespread practice of subcontracting to small handicraft and domestic establishments,” the coa report stated. “Many small houses in Japan are not merely places of residence, but workshops contributing to the production of war materials.”28 The coa rec- ommended attacks against urban industrial targets between De-cember and May to take advantage of probable weather condi - tions such as high winds that would maximize the damage from firebombs. The analysts also noted that striking many urban ar - eas simultaneously might “overwhelm the relief and repair facil- ities of the country as a whole.” 29 At first glance, the coa recommendation of “urban industrial areas” as targets appeared inconsistent with the notions of strate- gic bombing that had guided America’s initial plan
