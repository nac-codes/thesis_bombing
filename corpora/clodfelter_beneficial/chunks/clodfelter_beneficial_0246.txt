most efficient means possible to eliminate a key element of Japan’s production capability. While the coa tried to identify Japanese targets, Brigadier Gen- eral Orvil Anderson, the chief of the planning section of Arnold’s air staff, asked the intelligence branch to investigate how the Army Air Forces might best attack them with incendiary bombs. The subsequent October 1943 report compared German cities to those in Japan, observing that Japanese cities were more congested than their German counterparts and that Japanese residences were much more flammable. Combustible material in residential construction could serve as “kindling” for attacks that would also destroy fac- tories and other necessities of war. The report created three cate- gories of vulnerability that applied to Japan’s twenty major cities: f i r e  f r o m  t h e s k y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

They calcu-lated that six tons of incendiaries per square mile would suffice to destroy Zone I completely, while the total destruction of Zone II would require ten tons per square mile. The
