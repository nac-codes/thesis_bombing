production delays and design prob- lems, including four Wright r-350 engines prone to overheating, but contained unique features that made it a truly revolutionary design. The bomber sported the world’s first pressurized cabins (it had three—the cockpit, gunners’ compartment, and tail gun- ner’s compartment), enabling its eleven-man crew to fly at alti-tudes in excess of twenty-five thousand feet without having to wear the cold weather gear required by crews on b-17s or b-24s. The high operating altitude made the b-29 difficult for slow-climb- ing Japanese fighters to intercept. It had a top speed of 350 miles per hour, and a combat radius of 1,600 miles with twenty thou- sand pounds of bombs (roughly three times the bomb load of a b-17), which allowed it to attack targets in Japan from bases in the Marianas. It further possessed four gun turrets, remotely con- trolled via four General Electric analog computers, containing a total of twelve .50-caliber machine guns, plus a high-velocity 20 mm long-range cannon in the tail. 33 awpd- 1 and awpd- 42 had both envisaged the b-29 for the European war, flying against Ger - many from bases in the United Kingdom and Egypt. The need for a heavy bomber that could fly the vast distances required to bomb Japan, combined with lagging b-29 production and the build-up of b-17s and b-24s in Europe, relegated the Superfortress to the Pacific theater. There, the b-29 formed the mainstay of the Twentieth Air Force, created in April 1944 and directed from Washington dc, by Hap f i r e  f r o m  t h e s k y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Arnold later claimed that the genesis for an independent bombing force in the Pacific under his command stemmed from his visit to bases in the region in autumn 1942. “There was noth- ing else I could do, with no unity of command in the Pacific,” he contended. “It was so
