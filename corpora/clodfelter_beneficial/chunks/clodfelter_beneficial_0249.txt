in the Pacific under his command stemmed from his visit to bases in the region in autumn 1942. “There was noth- ing else I could do, with no unity of command in the Pacific,” he contended. “It was something that I did not want to do.” 34 That admission rang hollow, however. Arnold had no intention of al- lowing Army generals and Navy admirals to direct his high-priced bombers as auxiliary support for surface forces and divert them from their primary mission of destroying Japan’s vital centers. The prospects for the b-29s to accomplish that independent goal received a substantial boost in late 1943 at the Sextant Con- ference of the Combined Chiefs of Staff. At this Cairo gathering, the Combined Chiefs approved the “Overall Plan for the Defeat of Japan,” which outlined grand strategy for the conclusion of the Pacific War. The document noted “the possibility that the inva-sion of the principal Japanese Islands may not be necessary and the defeat of Japan may be accomplished by sea and air block- ade and intensive air bombardment from progressively advanced bases.” Planning for a possible invasion would continue “if this should prove necessary.” 35 Arnold was determined that it would not be. After several discussions with his Joint Chief counterparts— including a session with the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Ernest J. King, in which Possum Hansell argued for an independent b-29 force36—the Joint Chiefs sanctioned the Twentieth Air Force. The new air force would operate directly under the Joint Chiefs with Arnold serving as “executive agent” to implement their di-rectives. In actuality, the Army Air Forces Commanding General had secured control over his prized b-29s with minimum oversight, and had gained for himself his first ever combat command. While he received limited interference from the Joint Chiefs in directing Twentieth Air Force, Arnold did have to contend with one higher authority—Franklin Roosevelt.
