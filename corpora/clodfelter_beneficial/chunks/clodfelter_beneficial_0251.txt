Roosevelt, though, had promised Chiang that American bombers would soon head his way. Until the capture of the Marianas, China offered the only friendly location from which b-29s could attack Japan—and even then, they had the range to strike only Kyushu, the south-ernmost main island. When Arnold briefed Roosevelt in February 1944 on “Opera- tion Matterhorn,” the projected b-29 assault on Japan from China, as well as on his plans to bomb from the Marianas, he noted that Japanese cities were especially vulnerable to fire.

But as with the European war, the desire for fast results would ultimately overcome the progres - sive desire to minimize casualties among enemy civilians. From the perspective of those on the ground, a quick victory did not necessarily equate to fewer lives lost. Despite Arnold’s zeal to begin bombing, numerous difficulties delayed the start of “Matterhorn.” Mass production of b-29s had finally begun in autumn 1943 , yet deliveries occurred slowly, and many of the new bombers suffered from problems because of con- stant design changes. Only sixteen of the ninety-seven b-29s pro- duced in January 1944  were flyable.41 To remedy the situation, Arnold created an array of “production modification centers” in cen
