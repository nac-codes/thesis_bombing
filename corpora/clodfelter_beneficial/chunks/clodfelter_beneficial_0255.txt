in all weather con- ditions, both the bombardier and radar operator in the lead air - craft monitored the bomb run so that either could take control of the aircraft depending on the amount of visibility present over the target. By carefully managing his supplies, LeMay increased the frequency and intensity of XX Bomber Command raids. He also increased bombing accuracy. “We are now ten times more efficient than we were in August,” he boasted to Arnold at the end of November. 45 Pleased by the results, Arnold wrote Tooey Spaatz in Europe: “With all due respect to Wolfe he did his best, and he did a grand job, but LeMay’s operations make Wolfe’s very amateurish.”46 Ar- nold’s letters to LeMay transitioned from a salutation of “Dear LeMay” on 22 September to “Dear Curt” on 17 November. 47 A month later, Arnold complimented LeMay for a recent attack on Singapore that placed 41 percent of the bombs within one thou- sand feet of the aiming point. “I follow the work of the XX Bomber Command in far greater detail than you probably think,” Arnold remarked. “The b-29 project is important to me because I am con- vinced that it is vital to the future of the Army Air Forces.” In a handwritten note at the end of the letter, he added: “Tell all con-cerned how much the good work being done is appreciated.” 48 By December 1944 , questions of “where” and “how” to ac - complish good work against Japan loomed large. Ten months ear - lier the coa had examined target possibilities for Chengtu-based b-29s, and listed shipping concentrations, coke and steel produc- tion, aircraft factories, radar and radio installations, petroleum facilities, and urban areas. The coa cited seven urban areas in Kyushu, with a total population of 1,182,000, and noted that in raids against them, the “essential public utilities and thousands of small plants, as well as a number of large plants, would be destroyed.” 49f i r e  f r o m  t h e s k y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
