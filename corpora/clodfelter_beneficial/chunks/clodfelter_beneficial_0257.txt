Twentieth Air Force when Arnold had been incapacitated with his third heart attack. Arnold’s selection of Hansell to lead XXI Bomber Command from the Marianas came as no surprise. When he landed on Saipan at the controls of Joltin’ Josie, the Pacific Pioneer on 12 October, Hansell prepared to initiate the main b-29 offensive against Japan that Arnold had long counted on to produce decisive results.f i r e  f r o m  t h e s k y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Tokyo was the obvious choice for the first attack, and the coa had designated the Naka- jima aircraft engine plant at Musashino, in the northwest part of the capital, as the initial target in a series of raids designed to de-stroy the aircraft industry. Hansell, though, possessed only one partially finished runway on Saipan while Army engineers strug- gled to complete complementary airfields on Tinian and Guam. The prospect of constant long-range, high altitude attacks in for - mation also presented challenges. In stateside practice missions, flown from Kansas to Batista Field in Cuba (the same 1,400-mile distance as from Saipan to Tokyo), engines had caught fire after exhaust valves burned out, and the gunners’ plastic viewing bub- bles had frosted over above twenty-five thousand feet. Hansell had asked to fly his bombers from the United States to Saipan in for - mation to gain additional experience. Air Transport Command denied his request, he later observed, “on the grounds that the air - plane lacked the range to fly from Sacramento to Hawaii in for - mation, even without a bomb load and in good weather. The dis- tance was 2,400 miles. We would have to fly 3,200 miles, with a bomb load, in the face of enemy fighters, without
