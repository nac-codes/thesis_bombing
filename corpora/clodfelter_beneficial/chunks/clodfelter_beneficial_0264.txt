In the meantime, they agreed that aircraft factories, especially those producing engines, were priority targets and that the Saipan force should attack them, while XX Bomber Command in China should continue to attack steel production. The coa’s September conclusions underpinned the 10 October 1944 report that they submitted to Arnold—their last formal prod- uct of the war. In it, the analysts culled the target systems that they believed would have the most telling impact on Japan’s war effort f i r e  f r o m  t h e s k y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

The analysts deemed that the U.S. Navy’s sea-control cam- paign had “checked the expansion of the Japanese economy and rendered the attack on steel through coke much less important,” and the same logic applied to other materiel resources. 71 Most of the report focused on the forthcoming operations of the Marianas-based XXI Bomber Command. The committee mem-bers recommended that attacks begin against Japan’s five major aircraft engine plants, followed by “an attack upon the indus - trial areas of Tokyo, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Nagoya, Kobe and Osaka.” Such raids would “burn out all housing in Zones I and II” and likely “increase and prolong losses effected by precision attacks on war industries.” 72 Still, the analysts noted that area bombing would minimally impact Japan’s “front-line strengt
