tly obscured targets, and 1,600- mile flights to and from cities like Tokyo and Nagoya tested the limits of the b -29’s range, often leading to ditchings on the way back to the Marianas. From his 20 January assumption of com- mand through the first week of March, LeMay conducted six precision raids, and all produced miserable results. A 27 January attack by seventy-six b-29s on Hansell’s nemesis, the Tokyo Na- kajima aircraft plant, placed no bombs on the target at a cost of nine Superfortresses. 97 From Precision to obliteration The bleak production dismayed LeMay, Arnold, and Norstad, who all searched for alternatives to achieve success. Three days before he had taken charge of XXI Bomber Command, LeMay asked his friend Major General Fred Anderson, the Deputy Com- mander of Eighth Air Force Operations, for information on night photography that could assist in night bombing missions. “This weapon [the b-29] has tremendous possibilities, and I do not be- lieve that we have more than scratched the surface of new devel- opments, modifications, and methods,” LeMay stated. “Certainly, I will never permit the operations of a Command to which I am assigned to become routine and if there is a means of getting more bombs on to the target I propose to find it.”98 Arnold revealed similar thinking in his scribbles on a 30 January memorandum brought to him by his deputy, Lieutenant General Barney Giles. Giles noted that Japanese fighter opposition had increased in in- tensity over Tokyo and Nagoya, and wrote: “To offset this appar - ent concentration of fighter strength, we are instructing LeMay to direct his efforts at more widely dispersed targets and to engage in night fighter operations until our long-range fighters are avail-able for employment, which should be in the latter part of Feb-ruary.” Arnold marked out the second use of the word “fighter” f i r e  f r o m  t h e s k y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
