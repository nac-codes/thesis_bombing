Recuperating in Florida, Arnold noted the attention that the Navy attack received, as well as another headline announcing the one-thousandth b-29 pro- duced by Boeing’s Wichita plant. He commented to Giles that if only sixty or eighty b-29s could attack Japan at a time, “a change in management is certainly in order.”107 LeMay needed little prompting in the aftermath of the Navy’s attack on Tokyo. On 19 February he sent 150 b-29s against the same Nakajima factory that he and Hansell had bombed so many times—and that the Navy had now bombed successfully—and once again scored no hits on it, this time at a cost of six bomb-ers. 108 On 25 February, in response to Norstad’s prodding, XXI Bomber Command mounted its largest mission to date with 172 Superfortresses using radar to bomb Tokyo’s Zone I with 411 tons f i r e  f r o m  t h e s k y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

LeMay had originally wanted them to return to the oner - ous Nakajima factory, but the prediction of dense clouds over the target—along with the lack of success against it thus far—per - suaded him to condone the area attack. Despite the b-29s’ disper - sal, the raid was brutally effective, and the bombs—which fell in the midst of a heavy snowstorm—burned out one square mile of the city. No b-29s were lost to Japanese defenses. In his report to LeMay following the mission, Brigadier Gen- eral Thomas Power, commander of 314th Wing that had recently arrived at Guam, posed a question: If the crews had attacked at a lower altitude with a larger bomb load, would more destruction have resulted? The vile weather forced Power to fly his b-29 at a low altitude to Japan before climbing
