the struggle.”117 Like his counterparts in Europe, LeMay’s logic presumed that increased brutality would hasten victory, and that fewer people would die from his incendiary campaign than would perish if he failed to initiate it. That projected outcome, though, remained un- certain, and many Japanese would reach a different conclusion. aerial deluge While much of the credit for the 9 March raid against Tokyo went to LeMay, in reality he simply implemented a strategic design set in motion by the Committee of Operations Analysts, approved by Arnold, and pushed forward by Norstad. Arnold endorsed area attacks because they offered the best prospect for rapid, tangible results—results that he also believed would prove decisive in end- ing the war. LeMay’s low-level tactics and stripping armament and gunners from his b-29s conserved fuel and doubled the bombs that his aircraft could carry. Yet the key decisions—the choice of targets and the type of ordnance to drop on them—came from Arnold and Norstad. As Michael Sherry notes, LeMay “had the illusion of making his own choices . . . because the details were left to him. LeMay would also sincerely believe that he made the command decision.”118 Arnold and Norstad were content to have him believe it. LeMay demonstrated that he could achieve the de- struction that they demanded and continued to display that ca-pability in the raids that followed. After returning to Washing - ton dc in mid-March, Arnold addressed his letters to LeMay as “My dear Curt.” 119 LeMay’s low-level, night campaign continued against Japan’s major urban areas. More than three hundred b-29s attacked Zone I in Nagoya on 11 March and burned down two square miles of f i r e  f r o m  t h e s k y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
