stry. Norstad wrote him on 3 April with a new list of targets, noting that those assigned in March “were selected on the basis of a compromise between industrial importance and susceptibility to fire,” but that new areas “represent more nearly the top industrial areas. They also appear to be most susceptible to fire attack, but they do not represent any compromise.”129 Like Tooey Spaatz, his counterpart in Europe who had unleashed savage area attacks against German cities, LeMay hoped that his raids’ intensity would pay dividends with a quick end to the war. “The destruction of Japan’s industry by air blows alone is possible,” he declared on 15 April in a comment that drew a reprimand from Norstad for openly predicting victory through air power.130 While Spaatz did not announce that prospect, he harbored the same hope, and both he and LeMay could claim that their bomb - ing had a tangential connection to industrial capability. Yet Spaatz knew that his radar-directed area attacks missed most of the fac-tories that he targeted, and LeMay knew that his low-level area f i r e  f r o m  t h e s k y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

For both, achieving rapid results had become the overriding concern, and brute force became the methodology to assure speed. The enormous bomb tonnages, aimed at urban areas, ably sup- ported the overarching political objective of unconditional surren- der, while against the Japanese, the desire for retribution further condoned area attacks. As long as the Japanese (and the Germans) refused to yield, they would pay an indelible price. Roosevelt be- lieved that memories of such destruction would help dissuade the Axis populations from pursuing future war.131 Against the Japa- nese, American airmen generally
