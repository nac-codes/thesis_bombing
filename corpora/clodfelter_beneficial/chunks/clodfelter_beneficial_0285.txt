deavor. momentum Builds The Japanese refused to succumb to the massive March bombings, and LeMay lacked the capability to continue constant incendiary attacks. Despite the terrible toll of civilians killed and the enor - mous destruction rendered to their cities, the Japanese kept fight- ing with the same intensity they had demonstrated before raids. American Army and Marine forces invaded Okinawa on 1 April and did not control the islands until 21 June—at a cost of almost fifty thousand American casualties, of whom more than twelve thousand were killed or missing.135 The mounting losses in the fight for Okinawa intensified the de- mand for an air power–generated victory that would forestall an invasion of the home islands. LeMay’s March attacks had expended most of his supply of incendiaries, and, with the exception of two mid-April raids against Tokyo and another against Kawasaki, no more firebombing occurred until mid-May after the Navy had re- plenished his incendiary stocks. In the meantime, he returned to precision methods with high explosive bombs to strike new tar - gets that he received from Norstad. Those targets consisted of air - craft engine plants, oil, chemical production facilities, and, after 16 April, airfields to support the Okinawa invasion.136 The b-29s also conducted extensive aerial mining operations in the Sea of Japan that severely restricted movement among the home islands and ultimately sank or disabled eighty-three ships.137 Arnold was eager to reignite the incendiary campaign, which, unlike mining, produced immediate empirical evidence of the dam- age inflicted. He urged LeMay to “put the maximum weight of ef- fective bombs on Japanese targets” and noted that the Army Air f i r e  f r o m  t h e s k y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
