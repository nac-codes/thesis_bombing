d political leaders reflected those sentiments as well. Tru- man claimed after the war that Marshall had estimated an inva- sion might cost five hundred thousand American lives,165 though in the 18 June 1945 meeting with the Joint Chiefs (that Arnold had missed), the president had received conflicting projections. Marshall’s calculation of thirty-one thousand casualties in the first thirty days of fighting on Kyushu was among the lowest totals, but that estimate omitted potential Navy losses and did not proj- ect when the fighting would end; Admiral William Leahy antici- pated Kyushu losses exceeding two hundred thousand.166 Ultra in- telligence intercepts in the month after the meeting indicated that triple the number of estimated Japanese troops actually defended the selected Olympic invasion beaches, and Marshall likely noti- fied Truman of the update in late July.167 The impetus to obtain a rapid, inexpensive victory—from the American perspective—led Truman to approve the atomic attacks even if his numbers were indefinite. Yet he framed the first atomic raid from a progressive perspective resembling Norstad’s and noted on 9 August that Hi- roshima was “a military base . . . because we wished in this first attack to avoid, insofar as possible, the killing of civilians.”168 Brit- ish Prime Minister Winston Churchill provided a similar progres- sive view of the atomic bomb’s utility—with questionable num-bers as a rationale—in his typically vivid prose: To quell the Japanese resistance man by man and conquer the coun- try yard by yard might well require the loss of a million American lives and half that number of British. . . .
