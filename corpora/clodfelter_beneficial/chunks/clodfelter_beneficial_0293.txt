of the populace believed that Ja- pan could not win before LeMay’s incendiary assault began; the number had increased to 68 percent on the eve of surrender, of which more than half credited air attacks other than the atomic raids as the reason for their beliefs. 174 Still, the people’s morale f i r e  f r o m  t h e s k y EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

In fire raids against sixty-six urban areas, 8.5 million Japanese ci- vilians lost their homes—roughly one-third of all Japanese living in cities. The Survey estimated total civilian deaths from “conven - tional” bombing and the atomic raids at 330,000, though they may well have exceeded 900,000.175 More Japanese civilians likely died from American weaponry than did Japanese combatants, and the vast majority of civilians died from American bombs.176 For most American airmen, air power finally fulfilled the pro- gressive promise of a rapid, efficient victory—the b-29 campaign lost 1.38 percent of all combat sorties and cost the lives of 2,148 men in fourteen months of bombing, compared to 26,000 men killed in Eighth Air Force alone after thirty-one months of attacks in Europe.177 Most air commanders viewed the offensive against Japan as proof that a powerful, concentrated bombing effort, un- hindered by diversions, could produce dramatic results. “Our cam- paign against Japan was a more clear-cut case of the proper use of air power than Europe,” LeMay contended after the war. “The true buildup of air power in Europe came after the invasion.”178 The Japanese example further provided significant impetus to fulfill the dream of service independence.
