The former goal demanded the destruction not only of war-making capability, but also of hostile governments and the way of life that they fos- tered, and those objectives could not be obtained quickly. In addi- tion, the aim of unconditional surrender may have inadvertently lengthened the war by causing German and Japanese leaders to fight harder than they might otherwise have done since early ca-pitulation provided them with no benefit. 1 When combined with the goal of rapid victory, unconditional surrender produced such brutal applications of force as the area bombing seen in both the - aters. In the meantime, unexpected “frictional” developments fur - ther shaped the air campaigns and undercut the progressive pre- dictions of prewar planners.2 Diversions and production problems delayed the buildup of heavy bomber forces; key industrial tar - gets proved difficult to identify and destroy under wartime condi- tions; weather, wind, and climate produced constant challenges to effective bombing; and bombers, especially in the European the-ater, were much more vulnerable than anticipated. Given the aim of rapidly destroying the fascist regimes, the aer - ial technology available, and the impact of friction on the technol- ogy’s employment, air power was not the antiseptic instrument of finite de
