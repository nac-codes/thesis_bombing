1 November date scheduled for Operation “Olym- pic.” Such an outcome would have likely saved more American lives by exposing b-29 crews to less danger than they endured from overflying Japanese cities, and probably would have pro-duced fewer civilian casualties. Similarly, a less intense bombing of German urban areas, and greater emphasis on close air support, might have yielded victory in more time but with fewer losses— for all concerned—than actually occurred. The faith of air leaders in the perceived progressive merits of strategic bombing—which they viewed as the surest path to service autonomy—led them to dismiss alternatives for using heavy bombers in an auxiliary role to surface forces. For most air commanders, the great dilemma was how stra-p r o g r e s s i v e  l e g a c i e s EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Assuming that they correctly identified the targets that would fatally damage the en- emy’s war effort and destroyed them, what assurances did they have that the destruction would induce rapid surrender? Curtis LeMay told Arnold in June 1945 that the war would end by 1 October because by then b-29s would have destroyed all Japa- nese industry. 3 Likewise, the Committee of Operations Analysts often estimated how the loss of certain industries in the United States would impact America’s war-making capability, and then applied those projections to Germany and Japan. Such mirror- imaging presumed “rational” behavior and downplayed the ene- my’s will to keep fighting (it downplayed American will as well). Most air commanders understood that will was an essential part of the enemy’s war effort and that breaking it would produce col- lapse. Indeed, awpd- 1 noted that an attack against German morale late in the war might prove decisive, and both Eaker and Spaatz launched area attacks designe
