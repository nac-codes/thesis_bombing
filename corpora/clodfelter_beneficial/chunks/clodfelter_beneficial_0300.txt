and that breaking it would produce col- lapse. Indeed, awpd- 1 noted that an attack against German morale late in the war might prove decisive, and both Eaker and Spaatz launched area attacks designed to break Germany’s will to fight. LeMay’s initial incendiary raids—as well as the atomic bombs—targeted Japan’s will. Yet airmen could only guess at the impact such bombing might have on speeding the end of the war, espe - cially against the fanatical opposition that they faced. The time element had a significant impact on the conduct of the air campaigns in both Europe and the Pacific, and Arnold was al - ways conscious of a ticking clock as he pressed his commanders to achieve results independent of land and sea forces—the pur - suit of service autonomy added to the impetus for rapid results. At great cost, the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces achieved air supe-riority over the European continent, but they could not forestall the Normandy invasion, nor could they score a knockout blow against Germany before ground forces overran much of the coun- try. Eaker and Spaatz relied on widespread radar bombing—preci- sion methods were useless for much of the weather encountered—p r o g r e s s i v e  l e g a c i e s EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

The goal of rapid victory subsumed all other prewar progressive rationales; it sanctioned heavy losses of aircrews and civilians, and air commanders relentlessly pursued that goal convinced that it assured fewer losses than would the war’s continuation. That logic guided the bombing of Japan as well as Germany. Against Japan, weather conditions foiled high altitude precision bombing, and the nature of Japanese industry would have made the utility of such bombing problematic even
