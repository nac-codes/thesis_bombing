pabil-ity. Surrounding leadership was a ring of key production, which for most states included electricity and oil. Surrounding key pro- duction was a ring of infrastructure, comprising transportation and communications, and surrounding it was a ring of popula-tion, which included food sources. Finally, a ring of fielded mili-tary forces surrounded the population. Warden contended that leadership was the most critical ring because it was “the only element of the enemy . . . that can make concessions” and that attacking it promised “the quickest and cheapest” path to obtaining victory. 23 If that ring could not be attacked directly, the goal then became to confound the leader - ship’s ability to direct war-making activities, and air power could target the outer rings. Yet the focus of the attacks remained their impact on the center ring. He cautioned against attacking mili- tary forces, which he labeled “a means to an end,” and urged that they “be bypassed—by strategy or technology.”24 Warden also es- chewed direct attacks on civilians, and his rationale for attacking industry mirrored an Air Corps Tactical School text: “If a state’s essential industries (or, if it has no industry of its own, its access to external sources) are destroyed, life becomes difficult, and the state becomes incapable of employing modern weapons and must make concessions.”25 Warden’s beliefs reinforced the Air Force’s progressive vision, and that vision has meshed well with the war aims of American presidents during the last two decades. Beginning with the 1991 Persian Gulf War, American presidents have consistently embraced air power’s progressive notions in their pursuit of victory. At the time of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Warden was the Air Staff’s deputy director of “Checkmate,” its p r o g r e s s i v e  l e g a c i e s EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .
