A combination of factors led to his ideas forming the basis for the Desert Storm air campaign against Iraq, and chief among them was that his notions comple-mented President George H. W.

Bush intended to remove Iraqi troops from Kuwait in the most effective, inexpensive way possible. Thirty-seven days of bomb-ing by a vast coalition air armada against targets in Iraq and Ku- wait facilitated a four-day ground offensive that liberated Kuwait for a cost of only 148 American combat deaths.28 Although an estimated 2,300 Iraqi civilians died in the forty-one-day air cam- paign,29 the image that much of the world—and, in particular, the U.S. Air Force—took from the war was one of a remarkably effi-cient, high technology air offensive that rapidly produced maxi-mum results for minimum costs.

Beginning in 1993 in Bosnia, President William Clinton committed American air power to un and nato  efforts to preserve a multiethnic state in Bosnia and halt Bosnian Serb ethnic cleansing against Mus-lim
