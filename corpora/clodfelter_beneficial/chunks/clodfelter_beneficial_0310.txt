nning in 1993 in Bosnia, President William Clinton committed American air power to un and nato  efforts to preserve a multiethnic state in Bosnia and halt Bosnian Serb ethnic cleansing against Mus-lim and Croat populations. He eschewed sending ground forces, convinced that such an option might prove too costly in terms of lives risked and damage inflicted.

Those ground assaults reclaimed significant chunks of Bosnian territory that the Serbs had controlled and threatened to take more.32 To the president, though, air power rapidly achieved success and eliminated the need for American ground forces. The air attacks risked few American lives—only one aircraft was shot down and its pilot rescued—plus enemy civilians emerged rela-tively unscathed—the Bosnian Serbs claimed that bombing had killed just twenty-five noncombatants. 33 Clinton’s perception that air power had coerced the Bosnian Serbs caused him to return to that formula in response to Serb ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and his motivations for bombing in 1999 paralleled his 1995 o
