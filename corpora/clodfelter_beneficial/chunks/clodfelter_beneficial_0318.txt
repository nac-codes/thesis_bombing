nflicted often count more than reality. The limited goals sought in the wars that America is most likely to fight will demand not only extreme precision from air power, but also, in many cases, infallibility, and that is a very tall order for any type of military force. Ultimately, tying air power’s progressive ideals to a wartime crusade leads to a strategy based more on faith than sound reason- ing. Episodes of collateral damage will continue to offset positive pronouncements of air power accomplishments made by Amer - ican leaders. Although proponents may proclaim that air power can end wars quickly and cheaply, skeptics—in particular, non-American skeptics—can argue that such progressive views ap- ply only to proponents who are also U.S. citizens. The emphasis on the speedy conclusion of hostilities and a small loss of life ap-pears ideally suited to Americans, who have the world’s greatest air power and have displayed a willingness to use it, in the last two decades, as their first choice of military options. To some observers, the espoused progressive notions are mor - ally bankrupt, and really equate to assuring the smallest possible loss of life for American combatants, rather than guaranteeing no civilian casualties—as was indeed the case during the last years of World War II.
