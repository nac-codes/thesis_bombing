2,000 tons of bombs on targets in the Berlin area in a massive daylight raid supported by twenty-three groups of escort fighters; 1,371 tons fell on the city center. See Craven and Cate, Army Air Forces, 3:284–85; Richard G. Davis, “Op- eration ‘Thunderclap’: The U.S. Army Air Forces and the Bombing of Ber - lin,” Journal of Strategic Studies 14 (March 1991): 92. 97. Davis, “Operation ‘Thunderclap,’” 106. Only 250 tons of this total were incendiaries; the remaining bombs were high explosives. 98. Craven and Cate, Army Air Forces, 3 :725– 26. Richard Davis ques- tions this total, citing research in Berlin city and Federal Republic archives that indicates tolls of 2,895 dead, 729 injured, and 120,000 made home- less. Davis believes that accurate bombing combined with the meager num-ber of incendiaries used on the mission may have produced fewer casualties than those claimed by Craven and Cate.
