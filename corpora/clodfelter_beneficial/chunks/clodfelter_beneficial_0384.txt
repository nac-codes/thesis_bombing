The direct production loss results mainly from the interruption of pro- duction in damaged factories; partly from absenteeism induced by bombing and general damage” (51). 73. “Revised Report of the coa on Economic Targets in the Far East,” 10 October 1944, 51, file 118.01, v.2, afhra. The report further stated: “The loss imposed by the burden of repair and replacement of incendiary damage would fall chiefly on the construction industry and producers of industrial equipment. Since these industries lie deep in the productive process, the ef- fect on front-line strength would be delayed and diffuse. Most seriously af- fected will be the machine tool industry, it being estimated that over 15 per cent of all machine tools (almost one year’s output of the industry) will be destroyed or heavily damaged. It appears likely that machine tool replace - ment will be the limiting factor in recuperation; it should not, however, de-lay recuperation in any high priority industry beyond the limits assumed in this study” (52). 74. “Revised Report of the coa  on Economic Targets in the Far East,” 10 October 1944, 4, file 118.01, v.2, afhra. 75. “Revised Report of the coa  on Economic Targets in the Far East,” 10 October 1944, 3, file 118.01, v.2, afhra. 76.
