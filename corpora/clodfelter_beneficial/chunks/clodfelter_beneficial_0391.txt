From 17 April to 11 May, XXI Bomber Command devoted 75 per - cent of its effort to support the Okinawa invasion force that endured Japa- nese air attacks—including Kamikazes—from Kyushu and Shikoku islands. b-29s flew more than 2,100 sorties against seventeen Japanese airfields. See Carter and Mueller, Army Air Forces, 631. 137. b-29s dropped more than twelve thousand mines in Japanese home waters and effectively ended travel across the Shimonoseki Strait between Kyushu and Honshu. Mines dropped by the 313th Wing sank or disabled 163,000 tons of shipping, with more than half of the losses occurring in the Shimonoseki Strait.

Huston speculates that Arnold’s fragile health prevented him from attending the Washington dc meeting. Arnold was on Guam when he re- ceived word of it and dispatched LeMay. LeMay’s trip took thirty-six flying hours to get to Washington dc in a stripped b-29, and he arrived a day and a half before the jcs meeting, though Ira Eaker, then serving as Arnold’s dep- uty, attended the meeting with the president.
