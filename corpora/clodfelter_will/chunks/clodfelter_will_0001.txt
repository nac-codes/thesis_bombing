om air attack is the will of the armed forces. K EYWORDS : Airpower, Bombing, Morale An enemy’s ‘power of resistance’, Major General Carl von Clausewitz observed in On War , ‘can be expressed as the product of two inseparable factors, the total means at his disposal andthe strength of his will ’.1Seven decades later, the invention of the airplane portended that military force could now render an enemy’s will as well as its means vulnerable to direct – and immediate – attack. Italian airpowerdisciple General Giulio Douhet was quick to emphasize the apparentvulnerability of an enemy’s will to bombs. ‘We should keep in mindthat aerial offensives can be directed not only against objectives of leastphysical resistance, but against those of least moral resistance as well’,he wrote in the 1921 edition of The Command of the Air . 2 The views expressed in this article are the author’s own. 1Carl von Clausewitz, On War [1832] (ed. and trans.)

That notion also became a cornerstone of Americanairpower doctrine. Yet airmen since Douhet have had difﬁcultyspecifying how best to attack an enemy’s morale, nor have they developed a consensus view of the elements that comprise the desire to keep ﬁghting, which American airmen have labeled ‘will to resist.’ The 1992 edition of the US Air Force’s primary doctrine manual acknowledged the dilem
