iew of the elements that comprise the desire to keep ﬁghting, which American airmen have labeled ‘will to resist.’ The 1992 edition of the US Air Force’s primary doctrine manual acknowledged the dilemma: The basic targeting problem for strategic attack is to develop a plan for coordinated attacks against either enemy war-sustainingcapacity or enemy will. Given the elusive nature of the last, including the historical resilience of populations to strategic air attacks, commanders should probably focus their initial efforts onattacks against the ﬁrst element. 3 American airmen, relying on scientiﬁc analysis and technological sophistication, have typically stressed the destruction of the enemy’swar-making capability as the surest means to achieve victory withairpower. Yet attacks aimed solely at war-making capability have often failed to yield the desired results. Thus, while emphasizing raids on ‘physical objectives’, American air commanders have also attackedtargets deemed essential to both the enemy’s ability to ﬁght and itsperceived desire to continue the struggle. The Air Force continues to stress both objectives in its doctrine. The current edition of the Air Force’s basic doctrine manual notes:‘Strategic attack builds on the idea that it is possible to directly affectan adversary’s sources of strength and will to ﬁght without ﬁrst having to engage and defeat their military forces.’ 4The Air Force’s manual Strategic Attack , dated 12 June 2007, ampliﬁes these sentiments by stating that such bombing aims ‘to weaken the adversary’s ability orwill to engage in conﬂict, and may achieve strategic objectives withoutnecessarily having to achieve operational objectives as a precondition’. 5 The manual concedes that attacking the enemy’s will directlymay be difﬁcult, but also contends that ‘strategic attack is able toimpose systemic/functional and psychological effects that may achieve strategic objectives more directly than defeat of enemy ﬁelded 3Air Force Manual 1-1, Ba
