that have reappeared insubsequent applications of American airpower: a predilection forattacking enemy will ‘indirectly’ rather than by killing people; anoverwhelming faith in ‘precision’ bombing; and the conviction that bombing deﬂates will by disrupting normal, day-to-day life. Given that the air war against Nazi Germany provided the foundation for the current notions regarding ‘will’ that permeate Air Force doctrine,an examination of the efforts by American airmen to pinpoint and wreckGerman will offers useful insights for civilian and military leadersgrappling with how best to affect the resolve of potential nation-stateantagonists like Iran. Accordingly, this analysis examines the evolution,conduct, and effectiveness of America’s archetypal attempt to destroy an enemy’s will with bombs, and it further explores the ramiﬁcations of using such a distinctive approach to attack such an elusive target. Theinsights produced by this study will likely yield more questions thananswers, given the squishy nature of the subject under examination.Nonetheless, such analysis is a worthwhile endeavor because any futureAmerican air campaign is almost certain to have the goal of ‘breakingenemy will’ as either a stated or implied objective. Nazi Germany’s ability to endure widespread aerial devastation highlights the difﬁculty of determining the motivations that keep an enemy ﬁghting and the impact that bombs have upon those desires. The 6Ibid., 4, 25. 7Ibid., 32. 8Ibid., 4.America’s World War II Bombing of German Morale 403  File: --- clodfelter_will.pdf --- Page 5 --- initial supposition that Germany’s will to ﬁght equated to popular support for the war proved incorrect. In the end, the motivations ofthree groups blended together to produce a collective German will: thepopulace, government leaders, and the armed forces. Those compo-nents, which correspond to the elements most affected by Clausewitz’strinity of passion, chance, and reason, 9provide the fundamental ingredients of
