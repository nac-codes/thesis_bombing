Therefore our intention in deciding upon this method of attack must be to so reduce the morale of the enemy civilian population through fear – fear of death or injury for themselves and their loved ones – that they would prefer our termsof peace to continuing the struggle, and would force theirgovernment to capitulate.

Instead, he proposed attacking moraleindirectly by concentrating on the key elements that
