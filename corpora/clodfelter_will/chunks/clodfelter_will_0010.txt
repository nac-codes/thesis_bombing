acks on civilian morale precluded such a focus if an air campaign were to have areasonable chance of success. Instead, he proposed attacking moraleindirectly by concentrating on the key elements that linked together an enemy state’s industrial complex. ‘This method of attack has the greatvirtue of reducing the capacity for war of the hostile nation’, he surmised, ‘and of applying pressure to the population both at the same time and with equal efﬁciency and effectiveness.’ 20 The belief, widely shared among Tactical School instructors, that the industrial apparatus essential to a state’s war-making capability was alsonecessary to assure control of its populace was the key to the School’s‘industrial web theory’. In brief, its main points were: (1) In ‘modernwarfare,’ the military, political, economic, and social facets of a nation’sexistence were so ‘closely and absolutely interdependent’ that interrup- tion of this delicate balance could sufﬁce to defeat an enemy state; (2) Bombing, precisely aimed at these ‘vital centers’ of an enemy’s industrialcomplex, could wreck the fragile equilibrium and hence destroy theenemy state’s war-making capability; and (3) Such destruction wouldalso wreck the enemy nation’s capacity to sustain normal day-to-day life,which would in turn destroy the will of its populace to ﬁght. 21 19Major Muir S.
