. Known as AWPD-1 (for Air War Plans Division, Plan 1), itemphasized Germany as the main enemy and identiﬁed electric power,oil, and transportation as the three key elements of Hitler’s warmachine. The destruction of those target systems would, the plannersbelieved, also destroy the ‘means of livelihood of the German people’and their will to support the war. 25The planners estimated that wrecking German war-making capability would take six months of concentrated aerial assaults, and that such attacks probably could not begin until the spring of 1944 (assuming war began in early 1942)because of the time needed to produce an adequate bomber force. Although they stressed precision attacks against industry, the planners did not completely rule out the possibility of direct attacks on theGerman civilian populace. Their rationale for such attacks was twofold:they believed that raids on urban centers might provide the ﬁnal impetusneeded to make a battered Germany surrender, thus saving Allied lives that would be lost if the struggle persisted; and a coup de gra ˆce administered by airpower would demonstrate in convincing fashion thatthe independent application of airpower had won the war and providestrong rationale for an independent Air Force. AWPD-1 noted that‘timeliness of attack is most important in the conduct of air operationsdirectly against civil morale. If the morale of the people is already lowbecause of sustained suffering and deprivation and because the peopleare losing faith in the ability of the armed forces to win a favorable decision, then heavy and sustained bombing of cities may crush that morale entirely.’ Yet the planners also cautioned: ‘If these conditions donot exist, then area bombing of cities may actually stiffen the resistanceof the population, especially if the attacks are weak and sporadic.’ 26 24Memorandum, Lt.
