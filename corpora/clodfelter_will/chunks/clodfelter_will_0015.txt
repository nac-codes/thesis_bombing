rmen found that, even with sophisticated Norden bombsights, they had great difﬁculty hitting the desired target. Besidesthe terrifying distraction of German air defenses, bombardiers foundthat clouds often obscured the targets, particularly in winter. To maintain air pressure on Germany during overcast conditions, American air commanders turned to radar in late 1943 to locatetargets, but radar bombing was anything but precise. Eighth Air Forceoperations analysts estimated that on the 27 radar bombing missionsbetween the end of September 1943 and the end of January 1944, onlyﬁve percent of the bombs dropped fell within one mile of the aiming point. 28Radar bombing accuracy did not signiﬁcantly improve for the duration of the war.29 Despite the lack of precision, the intent of air leaders was not simply to strike the heart of vast urban areas, which were the only identiﬁabletargets using radar techniques.30Instead, air commanders remained 27Haywood S.
