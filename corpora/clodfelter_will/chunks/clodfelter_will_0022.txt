On that date, 928 bombers dropped more than 2,000 tons of bombs on targets in theBerlin area in a massive daylight raid supported by 23 groups of escort ﬁghters; 1,371 tons fell on the city center.

Once over Berlin, however, crews foundthe skies predominantly clear, and most bombed visually. Almost 1,000B-17s dropped 2,279 tons of bombs on the city, causing heavy damageto the Reichschancellery, Air Ministry, Foreign Ofﬁce, Ministry of Propaganda, and Gestapo headquarters, as well as to numerous railroad marshaling yards. 47The raid also killed an estimated 25,000 people.48 Against Leipzig and Dresden, the Eighth Air Force again attacked rail yards. In the attacks on Dresden on 14–15 February, clouds obscuredthe target, and crews mistakenly dumped their bombs on Dresden’smain residential district, which had been heavily bombed on the nightof 13 February by the RAF. Refugees ﬂeeing the Russians clogged the city, and between 25,000 and 35,000 civilians perished in the multiple assaults. 49 Technically, the attacks on Berlin and Dresden were aimed at military objectives. Two days after the Berlin raid, Spaatz revealed thathe had little faith in the notion that a single, massive bombing raidcould compel German surrender. He told Arnold: ‘Your comment onthe decisiveness of results achieved by airpower leads me to believe thatyou might be followi
