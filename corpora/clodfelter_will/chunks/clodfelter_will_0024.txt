plied: ‘Hit oil if visual assured; otherwise, Berlin – center of City.’51 Dresden’s marshaling yard bordered the city’s major residential district, virtually guaranteeing that bomb misses would kill civilians. Moral qualms and the ﬁrmly held conviction that attacks aimed at war-making capability were more productive than those aimed at theenemy populace combined to prevent American air leaders from launching a wholesale campaign aimed at killing German civilians. Air commanders continued to believe that the essence of German moralewas public support for the war, and that such support was fragile, butthey agonized over how best to attack it. In their minds, attackingcivilians indirectly – by terrorizing them rather than killing them, or by depriving them of needed goods and services – was the answer. Yet thedifference between attacks intended to terrorize, and those intended tokill, was a ﬁne one, and the distinction tended to blur as the war progressed.
