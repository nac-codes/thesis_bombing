istence’, the Survey observed.55To the typical German civilian, the disruption of the ‘industrial web’ created inconveniencesthat could be overcome; heavier attacks produced fatalistic attitudesand a focus on personal safety and the safety of loved ones. Massive raids, such as the ones on Hamburg by the RAF and Eighth Air Force at the end of July 1943, caused great chaos but temporary effects. The heavy bombing between 27 July and 3 August reduced the city’s population of 1,500,000 by more than half: 973,000 ﬂed, wereevacuated, or killed, while 110,000 moved out of the devastated citycenter to areas near the outskirts. By October 1943, 475,000 peoplehad returned, and 83,000 more arrived before the end of the war. Theproduction of electricity in Hamburg dropped from 100 percent on 1July to 14 percent on 5 August, but this supply was adequate for thecity’s slowly recuperating economic life. By the end of September, 77 percent of the city’s pre-raid workforce was back on the job, including 85 percent in the shipbuilding industry, 84 percent in the aircraftindustry, and 94 percent in the oil industry. 56 Still, the raids shocked Hamburg’s inhabitants, who afterwards referred to the week-long series of attacks as simply ‘The Cata-strophe’.57‘In Hamburg, we really found out the ﬁrst time that the morale of the German people can be shattered so much that the work inthe armament industry would collapse’, Albert Speer, Hitler’s Minister of Armaments, later stated.58At the time, Speer contended that six more raids like Hamburg would have brought German arms produc-tion to a total halt and ﬁnished the war.59 Evidence for Speer’s assertion is lacking, however. Allied air forces pummeled German cities with bombs, particularly during RAF BomberCommand’s efforts to create additional ‘Hamburgs’ in Berlin and 16other German cities between November 1943 and March 1944. TheBerlin raids alone cost Bomber Command the equivalent of its entire front-line strength, and the havoc wrought ‘w
