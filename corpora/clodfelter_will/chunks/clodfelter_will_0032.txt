use of all the means at its disposal, it served as a formidable deterrent to every sort of oppositionto the regime’, remarked the Strategic Bombing Survey.72 Many Germans actually supported the Gestapo because they believedthat it guaranteed the maintenance of social order.73Although bombing disrupted the ‘control functions’ of the SS and the Gestapo to some extent, it had a greater impact on resistance activities, especially those relying on communication or transportation.74Airpower, applied selectively or indiscriminately, could not shred the tightly woven fabricof complete subservience that comprised Nazi Germany. Given the totalitarian structure of the Nazi state, rampant national- ism, and the ever-increasing fear of Soviet occupation (factors thatreceived minimal attention from American air planners), bombing’sability to wreck German civilian morale was problematic. The ‘Thunderclap’ plan offered a different approach; attacking the top of the Nazi pyramid rather than its underpinnings. Portal contended thatthe essence of German morale was not civilian willingness to support thewar, but the will to ﬁght possessed by Nazi leaders. ‘Thunderclap’ wouldattack the leaders’ morale directly. However, the Combined BomberOffensive lacked the capability to carry out ‘direct’ assaults on Germanleaders. Besides the difﬁculty of determining an individual’s where-abouts, the Anglo-American air forces could not hit speciﬁc targets with any degree of certainty. Thus, the attacks on German leadership that actually occurred, such as USSTAF’s raid on government buildings on 3February 1945, were really ‘indirect’ assaults. The raids damaged thegovernment’s administrative apparatus to some extent, but the degree ofcontrol exerted by the Nazis at all levels of German society was such thatbombing could not sever their reins of power. Although bombing caused many Nazi leaders great consterna- tion, the raids did not cause them to abandon the war effort. Speer later remarked that ‘Ha
