thatbombing could not sever their reins of power. Although bombing caused many Nazi leaders great consterna- tion, the raids did not cause them to abandon the war effort. Speer later remarked that ‘Hamburg had put the fear of God in me.’ 75Joseph Goebbels, Hitler’s Minister of Propaganda, wrote on 12 March 1945:‘The air terror which rages uninterruptedly over Germanhome territory makes people thoroughly despondent. One feels soimpotent against it that no one can now see a way out of thedilemma.’ 76Yet Speer continued to work doggedly for German victory until late January 1945, and even then he ‘never did entirely abandon 72USSBS, Effects of Strategic Bombing on German Morale, Vol. I, 96. 73Peukert, Inside Nazi Germany , 198. 74USSBS, Effects of Strategic Bombing on German Morale , Vol. I, 103. 75Speer, Inside the Third Reich , 370. 76Joseph Goebbels, Final Entries 1945: The Diaries of Joseph Goebbels , ed.

The people will continueto do their duty and the front-line soldier will defend himself as far ashe has a possibility of doing so.’ 78In short, bombing could not remove the Nazi leadership from power.
