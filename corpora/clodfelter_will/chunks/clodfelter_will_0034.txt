generals was the decision that most made, when they received orders from the 20July 1944 conspirators in Berlin as well as from Hitler’s East Prussiaheadquarters in the aftermath of the Bomb Plot, to side with the German dictator. 80A military coup, however, would not necessarily have eradicated the rampant nationalism that made Hitler’s rise topower possible. Had the 20 July Plot succeeded, the peace terms initially offered by the new military government would have differedsigniﬁcantly from the ‘unconditional surrender’ required by the Allies.Notes historian Raymond G. O’Connor: Essentially, the new masters would have demanded acquiescence to Germany’s 1939 borders, no occupation of the country, no interference in internal affairs, no denaziﬁcation, no punishment ofwar criminals, and no demilitarization. So the Western Allies wouldhave had to accept a virtual pact against Russia and allow Germanyto retain all of the ingredients for mischief except one: the Fu ¨h r e r . 81 Allied leaders would probably have balked at such terms, and a successful coup could have triggered in-ﬁghting inside Germany between Nazi fanatics and German soldiers – the conspirators had carefully massed a ‘replacement army’ of 600,000 reserve troops inGermany to preserve order after Hitler’s overthrow.82Ultimately, 77Alfred C.
