c, when P-47 Thunderboltpilots spotted it snaking north. For two days in late August 1944 themedium bombers and ﬁghters of Brigadier Gordon Saville’s XIITactical Air Command mauled the German formation, destroyingthousands of vehicles and killing many men. Once the pursuing American Seventh Army arrived on the scene, the demoralized Germans surrendered in droves. 94Free French General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny painted a grim picture of the carnage inﬂicted by Saville’sairmen that had helped induce many of the 57,000 Germans to stopﬁghting: ‘Over tens of kilometers there was nothing but an inextricabletangle of twisted steel frames and charred corpses – the apocalypticcemetery of all the equipment of the Nineteenth Army, through whichonly bulldozers would be able to make a way.’ 95 While American air forces demoralized German troops in the West in the summer of 1944, a resurgent Soviet Air Force also helped to wreckthe morale of several German units along the Eastern Front. Unlike theAmericans, the Soviets had shunned the notion of strategic bombingand developed an air force devoted exclusively to supporting theirground troops. 96The simply designed and ruggedly built Il’yushin Il-2 Shturmovik two-seater ﬁghter-bomber epitomized the emphasis onground support, and the Soviets built 36,000 of them during the war.97 The aircraft had already demonstrated its ability to devastate opposingarmies at the Battle of Kursk on 7 July 1943, when Il-2s, in 30 to 40-strong formations, destroyed 70 tanks of the German 9th PanzerDivision in 20 minutes, and four hours of air strikes wrecked 240 tanksout of approximately 300 in 17th Panzer Division. 98 94Perret, Winged Victory , 318. 95Quoted in Martin Blumenson, Liberation (Alexandria, VA: Time-Life Books 1978), 115. 96The Soviet Air Force devoted a meager 5 percent of sorties to long-range operations, and most of those were accomplished for propaganda purposes.
