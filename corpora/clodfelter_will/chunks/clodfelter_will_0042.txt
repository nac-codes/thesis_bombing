pilots ﬂew 3,200 day-sorties against the Germandefenses on 24 June; Soviet infantry resumed the attack the next day, andby noon had captured the German positions. 100Between 28 and 30 June, the Soviets ﬂew another 3,000 sorties against the retreating German formations.101On the 28th, Soviet airmen attacked the retreating Fourth Army as it tried to cross the Berezina River bridge 25 separate times,causing casualties and chaos on each strike.102As the Soviet legions approached Minsk, thousands of German troops surrendered ordeserted, and thousands more ﬂed the city in a panic.103The chain of command and communications of Army Group Center collapsed, andairpower played a key role in wrecking its will to ﬁght. After the Allied ground offensives in the West stalled in autumn, a massive bombing effort focused on a section of the German front lines might have produced another breakthrough, while a massive applicationof Soviet airpower on a speciﬁc part of the Eastern Front might have doneso as well in the aftermath of Operation ‘Bagration’. Instead, for the nextseven months, the American heavy bombers focused on oil andtransportation targets inside the Reich, and Soviets continued to applyairpower only in concert with ground operations. Although the Americanraids signiﬁcantly degraded Germany’s ability to ﬁght, the conﬂict did not end until Allied ground forces had overrun most of the Nazi state. The bonds that tied together the will of the German populace, its governmentleaders, and the armed forces were simply too strong for a single episodeof collapse to destroy the nation’s collective resolve to keep ﬁghting. Yet occasions like ‘Cobra’ and the Rhone Valley indicated that airpower could crack military will in individual operational instances.Another example had occurred in spring 1943, when three weeks ofintense bombing by American and British aircraft had caused 11,000 99Earl F.
