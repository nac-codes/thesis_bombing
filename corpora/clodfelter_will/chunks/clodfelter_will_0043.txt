That loss ofwill may well have been the linchpin triggering a comprehensivecollapse in the nation-state’s overall desire to continue the war. Given that the aerial pounding of Nazi Germany’s domestic infrastructure, means of production, and leadership apparatus failed tostop either its public or government from supporting the war, the prospect of using bombs to break civilian will or the will of political leaders in today’s era of limited war remains problematic. An aim of‘unconditional surrender’, which permitted the obliteration of Germancities in an effort to destroy key industries or government buildings, is nolonger an acceptable American goal in war.
