irpower’s perceived effects against surface forces, rather thanagainst ‘core’ elements of an enemy state, might call into question theunderlying rationale for an independent Air Force. Air commanders like Arnold and LeMay had worked hard to achieve service autonomy based on the notion that airpower could singularly destroy an enemy’scapability and will to resist; in many respects, postwar air leaders havesought to justify their service’s independent status. It is time for them torealize, and for their doctrine to reﬂect, the complementary effects thatairpower can have on achieving a nation’s war aims, and that bombsmay affect the will of troops in the ﬁeld far more than they impact themorale of civilians and government leaders behind the front lines. As was true more than a half century ago, an enemy nation’s will to ﬁght remains an elusive target for American airmen, yet it is a targetthat they continue to emphasize. Air Force doctrine has equated enemywill with popular support, and it has also highlighted the will ofgovernment leaders as a key component of a nation’s desire to ﬁght.Although both of those elements help to comprise a collective resolve,the Air Force’s doctrinal guidance has omitted a third component thatis an essential part of an enemy’s overall willingness to wage war: the morale of its armed forces. Those three elements, the will of the populace, government leaders, and the armed forces, together form acollective will that dictates whether a country keeps ﬁghting. The example of Nazi Germany illustrates that, for a uniﬁed, autocratic state waging an unremitting conventional war, the aerialpounding of a populace and its means of subsistence is unlikely to stopthat people from supporting the conﬂict, nor are attacks aimed at Clodfelter, The Limits of Air Power: The American Bombing of North Vietnam (New York: Free Press 1989), 177–209; Wayne Thompson, To Hanoi and Back: The U.S. Air Force and North Vietnam, 1966–1973 (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Ins
