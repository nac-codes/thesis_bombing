onﬂict, the greatest airpower dividends interms of breaking morale will most likely come from bombs aimed atdeployed troops, and those positive results are likely to occur insingular instances. Multiplying those successful episodes offers theprospect of an overall collapse of the armed forces’ desire to ﬁght,which may in turn undermine the nation’s collective will. Clausewitz’s amorphous ‘will’ remains a vital part of an enemy’s power of resistance, and thus it is likely to remain a target for Americanairmen in any future air campaign. In this era of signiﬁcantly restrainedwar aims and signiﬁcantly enhanced technology, those airmen can bestfocus their efforts against the component of will that has shown itselfmost vulnerable to attack from the sky: the morale of those whose job itis to ﬁght.
