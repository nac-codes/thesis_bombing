lds at West Point Arnold distinguished himself just about as much as he did in the classrooms. Even without a slug of tobacco in his mouth, he was not exceptionally fast. But his five-foot- eleven-inch, 185-pound frame gave him enough strength to compete in the shotput at some of the interclass track meets. And his willingness to absorb punishment earned him a place as a substitute fullback and halfback on the academy football squad.
