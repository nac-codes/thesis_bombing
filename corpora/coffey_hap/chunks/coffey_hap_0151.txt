still engaged to someone else, and she was about to return to Europe for two years of study in Germany He went back to Governor's Island in January 1910 with little expectation that he would ever see her again  The flatness of the island terrain, about which he repeatedly complained, was the one thing that eventually helped relieve the tedium of his life there. Because it was so flat, Governor's Island became New York's first airport, attracting such pioneer aviators as Wilbur Wright and Glenn Curtiss.'® Wright, who had just returned from Europe, where even King Edward had deigned to examine his machine, used the island as the base for his flight up the Hudson, around Grant's tomb, and back Curtiss landed on the island at the end of his epic flight all the way from Albany with just one refueling stop. By this time, seven years after the invention of the airplane, aviation was causing considerable public excitement, and it was beginning to stir the imagination of Arnold, who had little else to occupy his restless mind. In the autumn, he and some  39 «= HAP  friends went to Belmont Park on Long Island for the first international air meet ever held in America. There he became conscious of the airplane as something that might be more than a toy, and he began to follow, with more than passing interest, the exploits of intrepid aviators like Alberto Santos-Dumont, Walter Brookins, Arch Hoxey, Grahame White, Eugene Ely, and Charles Willard.  Both the Wright brothers and Curtiss were now manufacturing planes, and each had teams of daredevil fliers at the show, competing with foreign fliers in the performance of figure eights, tight turns, dives, and other marvels of what at that time was considered acrobatic flying. No one did anything so daring as a loop, roll, or chandelle—in the aircraft of 1910, such maneuvers could not even be conceived. These aviators hadn't yet learned to cope with stalls and spins. Brookins, only nineteen years old at the time, impressed Arnold by c
