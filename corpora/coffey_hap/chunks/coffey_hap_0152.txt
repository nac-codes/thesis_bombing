Brookins, only nineteen years old at the time, impressed Arnold by completing the quickest 360-degree turn ever recorded. Brookins also crashed that day but he walked away from the wreckage  in his Wright “speedster. unharmed, making the airplane look like a much less dangerous conveyance that it actually was. On that score, Arnold was not deluded. One of his instructors at West Point, Thomas Selfridge, had become, in 1908, one of the first men ever to die in a crash of a heavier-than-air machine.  Arnold knew, of course, that the Army now had some interest in aviation. Captain Cowan's cable, asking him if he might like to become a flier, had apprised him of that.

Putting such a faint possibility almost though not quite from his mind, he decided to concentrate his energies on something just slightly more attainable—a promotion.
