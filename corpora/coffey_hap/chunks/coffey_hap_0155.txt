fliers at the show, competing with foreign fliers in the performance of figure eights, tight turns, dives, and other marvels of what at that time was considered acrobatic flying No one did anything so daring as a loop, roll, or chandelle—in the aircraft of 1910, such maneuvers could not even be conceived. These aviators hadn't yet learned to cope with stalls and spins, Brookins, only nineteen years old at the time, impressed Arnold by completing the quickest 860-degree turn ever recorded, Brookins also crashed that day in his Wright “speedster,” but he walked away from the wreckage unharmed, making the airplane look like a much less dangerous conveyance that it actually was.

Arnold knew, of course, that the Army now had some interest in aviation, Captain Cowan's cable, asking him if he might like to become a flier, had apprised. him of that, In 1907, the Signal Corps had estab. lished an Aviation Division, and for a while during his later months in the Philippines, Arnold had expected Cowan to arrange his transfer to it; but nothing had come of the matter, and despite Arnold's slowly developing interest in airplanes, he had little hope that he would ever fly one, Putting such a faint possibility almost though not quite from his mind, he decided to concentrate his energies on something just slight more attainable—a promotion, He had been a second lieutenant for more than three years and in the ordinary course of events he would have to resign himself to that bottom rank for another three or four years, especially since he had not ingratiated himself with his Infantry superiors, Even though he had now abandoned all hope of getting into the Cavalry, he was still convinced he had to get out of the Infantry  This was his mood when he discovered one day that the Ordnance Department h
