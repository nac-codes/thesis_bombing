The year before that, in response to a Signal Corps call for bids, Orville Wright had brought a plane to Fort Myer, near Washington, for a demonstration and it was during this demonstration that Lt. Thomas Selfridge, Wright's passenger, was killed, when some of the wing wires came ae and flew into the path of the propellor. It had taken Orville Wright several months to recover from his own injuries in the crash, but this had not discouraged him. In 1909, he and his brother had returned with another plane, the same catapult-launched model. This time their demonstration was so successful they had earned a $30,000 contract for the plane and the training of two officers to fly it. Since : officers—Lts.

Part of that money was earmarked for the purchase of the two planes and part of it would be used to give Arnold and Milling a complete training course in how to fly them. Arnold could now understand the curious two-year delay since he had informed Captain Cowan by cable from the Philippines of his willing- ness to learn to fly. Though the Signal Corps had organized its Aviation Service in 1907, it had taken four years before Congress was ready to accept the notion that the Army might need more than one airplane. But Congress was not alone in its reluctance to spend money on such an outlandish endeavor as flying. Most Army officers were certain they didn’t need any airplanes.
