You had to believe that to keep up your morale. Even today, when the airplane is ninety per cent of flying, and the pilot less than ten percent, you will find young airmen who insist, ‘Joe must have done something special {to account for his accident].’ All this influenced the subsequent ‘seat of  the pants’ flying tradition much longer than it should have."* (When  Arnold said this, he had already proven that intelligence was more im- portant to a flier than instinct by rapidly converting several hundred thousand young civilian groundlings into skillful military pilots during World War IL.)  In any event, Milling did consider himself a “natural” pilot and derived some satisfaction from the fact that he soloed after only five days of training and one hour and fifty-four minutes in the air. He felt that Arnold, who wasn’t ready until he had put in three hours and forty- eight minutes of flying time, “didn’t like that at all.”? Arnold might also have felt slighted when, after t
