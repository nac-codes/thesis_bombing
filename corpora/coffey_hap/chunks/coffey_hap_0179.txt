after only five days of training and one hour and fifty-four minutes in the air. He felt that Arnold, who wasn’t ready until he had put in three hours and forty- eight minutes of flying time, “didn’t like that at all."? Arnold might also have felt slighted when, after two days of flying, Orville Wright himself took an interest in Milling, going up with him five or six times in that first week, but never with Arnold. It was Wright who, on Friday of the  first week, came to Milling and said, “Now you can go alone.’  After flying around uneventfully “for ten or fifteen minutes,” Milling came back over the field and began spiraling down for his landing instead of making the usual long, straight approach. Wright, seeing this strange circular descent for perhaps the first time (it later became popular), rushed out onto the field, afraid his precocious student was about to crash. But when Milling landed safely, Wright became more than ever fascinated by his skills and thereafter “went flying with me nearly every day.” Milling admired Orville Wright almost to the point of idolatry. “It was from him that I learned all of my flying,” he later declared. “He was a great pilot, I think the greatest in the world.”  Arnold’s admiration for the Wright brothers seemed slightly less personal, more distant, but no less worshipful. On Sundays, the Wrights would invite both officers to dinner, and after stuffing themselves with food, the young men would sit transfixed, listening to the two brothers tell their story,  47 » HAP  “They never took themselves half so seriously as we took them,” Arnold observed. “Still, to Milling and me, sitting at their Sunday dinner table and listening to their quiet stories, what they had done was a miracle. ... Without any formal scientific training whatsoever, two ‘ordinary’ Americans from an ordinary town in the state of Ohio had not only grasped and advanced the whole known science of aerodynamics —they had become its admitted masters.”  On the days
