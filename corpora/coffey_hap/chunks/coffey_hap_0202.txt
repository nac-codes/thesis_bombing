st pilot ever to carry U.S. air mail.’* He flew a small satchel of letters from the Nassau Boulev  ard field to Hempstead, Long Island, a distance of five miles. Two months later, to avoid the Washing- ton winter, the entire College Park contingent, plus planes and equip- ment, moved in a nine-car train to Augusta, Georgia, where weather experts had promised them balmy southern air and satisfactory flying conditions in even the coldest months. No sooner had they arrived and pitched their tents than “a blizzard which would have done credit to Alaska descended on our camp. Icy winds howled, the tents were buried and collapsed, the four aircraft were knocked completely out of commis- sion and had to be repaired.”  In late January 1912, after the damage had been repaired, heavy rains began, followed by a Savannah River flood which made a lake of the landing field. Despite all this, they stayed in Augusta until April, and even got in some flying time between disasters. “We were more exper-  ienced now.” Arnold recalled, “and flew in winds which were often stronger than those that had kept us on the ground in College Park.” The winds were sometimes so strong that the Wright planes, at maxi- mum airspeed (forty-five to fifty miles per hour), would be moving backward over the ground, This was even more dangerous for the Curtiss plane, which was woefully underpowered. Captain Beck, after watching Arnold and Milling take off one day in a virtual gale, decided he could do likewise in his Curtiss plane, and soon crashed into a tree. Beck had two serious crashes in Augusta, and while neither of these mishaps injured him, both served to enforce the generally held convic- tion that no pilot should make plans for a long life. And if Beck's accidents were not enough, there was also the case of Lt. Frank M. Kennedy, whom Beck was teaching to fly the Curtiss plane. In February at Augusta, Kennedy suffered a crash during which his head plowed a five-inch-deep furrow in the ground. His
