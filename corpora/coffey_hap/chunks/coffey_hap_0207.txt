and sighting through its telescope. Though Arnold wanted to help him test it, his weight at the time—a trim 160 pounds—was too much for the plane when it was also carrying Scott and his bombsight; it simply wouldn't get off the ground. Arnold agreed, though, that with the 125-pound Milling at the controls, the plane should at least be able to clear the field, so it was Milling who tested the first bombsight.  He and Scott proved conclusively to everyone at College Park that the invention was worthy of development, but no one at the War Department was interested in it. In 1912 Scott took his invention to  France, where he won the Michelin Prize of $5,000 by first hitting a sixty-foot square twelve times out of fifteen from 650 feet, then a somewhat larger target eight times out of fifteen from 2,600 feet. Six years later during World War I, at a time when the United States hadn't yet developed a bombsight, Arnold learned that the Germans were using their version of Scott's invention against American troops,  Though the idea of firing a rifle from an airplane seems obvious now, it was not tried until 1910, when Lt. Jacob “Jake” Fickel, whom Arnold had known in the Philippines, persuaded Glenn Curtiss that it would be safe to let him take a few shots from a Curtiss plane with the manufacturer himself at the controls. In the late summer of 1911, during an air show at the Nassau Boulevard field on Long Island, Fickel repeated his feat wi  h Arnold as his pilot. This time, in competition against the British team of T.O.M. Sopwith (later to become famous as a yacht and aircraft builder) and Malcolm Campbell (later to be knighted for his auto speed records), the Arnold-Fickel team won handily, thanks to Fickel’s amazing skill in putting six bullets through a dinner plate on the ground from a moving plane 200 feet in the air. Once again, nobody at the War Department was interested  In September 1911, Arnold climaxed an eventful summer by  55 * HAP  ‘ih they taxied onto the
