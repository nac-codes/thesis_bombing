a, one of Wright's most dependable pilots and Arnold's original instructor, Al Welsh, had come to College Park from Dayton to work on the very problem that was soon to cause Arnold's crash—the problem of low aircraft load capacity. If airplanes were to have any military significance, they would have to be able to carry guns, bombs, radios, cameras, and perhaps other devices that hadn't yet been invented. Welsh had several ideas he wanted to test when he took off from the College Park field on the afternoon of June 12. The air was calm and he had with him as a passenger one of the school’s newly trained pilots, Lt. Leighton W. Hazelhurst, Jr. After reaching a height of about two hundred feet, Welsh put the plane into a dive, apparently to gain airspeed before going into a long climb. It was a maneuver often practiced in those days, although a modern flier might wonder why—except in the case of certain acrobatic maneuvers that call for a quick burst of speed, the momentum gained in such a dive would hardly provide enough energy to compensate for the lack of altitude, and a dive from two hundred feet is always dangerous. Yet even the most  skillful pilots didn’t seem to know that in 1912. Welsh was able to pull the plane out of the dive before he reached the ground, but perhaps because he was carrying too much weight, he pulled it out too quickly The frail craft simply couldn’t take the strain. It crumpled and crashed, killing both men instantly  Then on September 18, another day when the weather was fine, one of the school’s most skillful graduates, Lt. Lewis C. Rockwell, took to the air with Corp. Frank S. Scott as his passenger. The men were to stage a flying exhibition for the benefit of the Army's acting chief signal officer, Col. €  progress of his young fledglings. Rockwell had completed his perform-  orge P.
