to “a safe cross-country altitude,” each in turn pointed his plane toward Washington with high hopes, since the air was relatively calm and the visibility good. But the smooth air over College Park proved to be misleading. Above Washington the air was so turbulent that Milling had scarcely enough strength to control his kitelike little aircraft. And then, in addition to the fear that he might lose control, he found himself overcome by airsickness. Convinced that there  was no possibility of completing the required flight under these condi-  tions, he turned and flew back to base, landing at 9:56 a.m., just twenty-two minutes after takeoff  Arnold, passing over Washington two minutes after Milling, en- countered the same gusty turbulence and was equally distressed by it. Perhaps because he was thirty-five pounds heavier and proportionately stronger, he was better able to control his craft, but not by much. He had  to summon all his strength to maintain the plane’s equilibrium and  59 * HAP  follow the required course, which took him first over Washington Barracks, then eastward toward Fort Myer in Virginia. He was close to Fort Myer when he managed to spot the small force of Cavalry troops on a country road beneath him, but he was so busy controlling the plane he didn’t dare pick up the map in the seat beside him to pinpoint their location. Nearing exhaustion, he turned toward home and _ finally completed the forty-three-minute flight, landing at 10  By this time he was much too tired, however, to land in the precise spot designated by the judges. Feeling fortunate to be able to land at all, he brought the plane down 159 feet from the mark on the field  When he emerged from his plane, “his appearance was that of  physical exhaustion and nervousness.” A half hour later, when he appeared before the panel of judges, he admitted he was still very tired, especially in the muscles of his arms  Even though he was unable to pinpoint the location of the troops, there was no
