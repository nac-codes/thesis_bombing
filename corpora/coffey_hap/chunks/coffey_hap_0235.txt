ective that was out of sight, or even in sight but several miles away, it was almost impossible to judge exactly where the projectile had landed and what corrections would be needed for the next salvo, To American artillery officers, therefore, the significance of Arnold's re- connaissance flight was obvious: if one could spot enemy troops from the air, one could also spot other targets and help direct gunfire against them, But only if there was a means of communication between the airplane pilot and the battery commander  Thus when Arnold and Milling reached Fort Riley in late October, having traveled from College Park in a four-wheel-drive truck that was the only ground vehicle currently assigned to the Air Service, the mission facing them was to prove not only that they could pinpoint a shell-burst from an airplane but that they could in some way tell the battery where—farther or nearer, left or right—to place the next shell.  There were two possible ways to solve this communication problem, The first and probably most reliable way was the one they had already used—dropping their messages on yellow cards weighted by iron nuts fora mounted messenger to pick up and take to the battery, This was not avery rapid method and it depended on an accurate drop; if the wind carried the message card 00 far afield it might never be found, In an effort to make the method more precise, Milling and Arnold attached to cach of theit planes a stovepipe through which to drop the weighted card so it wouldn't be caught by the wing wires or bandied about by the prop wash:  The second possible method, one that Arnold intended to test, was the use of a “crude, one-way radio,” air-to-ground only, and witha range of no more than fifteen miles. Though there was already much talk about the potential military uses of radio, it was not yet considered very reliable, Ground-to-air messages would be sent up from the battery by panel code, but nobody knew whether Arnold and Milling would be able t
