On the third, Milling made two short flights despite a twenty-five-mile-per-hour wind, but both were aborted due to engine troubles. On the fourth, Arnold and Milling each made successful flights,  Arnold sending radio signals and Milling, in another experiment, send-  ing smoke signals back to earth.  Thomas M. Coffey * 60  sent them to Fort Riley, Kansas, for extensive reconnaissance maneu- vers, which would soon bring Arnold to the most grievous and disrup- tive crisis he had yet been forced to face.  Ever since the invention of cannon shortly after the discovery of gunpowder in the fourteenth century, artillery commanders through- out the world had been plagued by their inability to aim these powerful weapons accurately. When a field piece was fired at close range against a fortress wall or a hillside, it was possible to see where a ball struck or a shell exploded, and, if it was off target, make corrections accordingly. But against an objective that was out of sight, or even
