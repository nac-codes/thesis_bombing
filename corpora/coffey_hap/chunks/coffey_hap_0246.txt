ck during the trophy competition flight, he seemed to feel, perhaps because he had never experienced a crash, that he was better able than Arnold to cope with the dangers of flying such an unstable machine. It was not that he  more optimistic. He, too, expected to be killed, but he seemed able usually to talk himself into a state of calm when faced with danger. Speaking of himself and other pilots in those early days, he once said, “Everybody xpected to be killed, That's absolutely true. C  »0d Lord, I don’t know of anybody who didn't figure he'd be killed before he got through, and I still don’t see how in the devil I wasn't, when I look back and see how close I came to being killed, so many times.

On November 2, Arnold and a wireless operator made a thirty-three flight to Ogden, six miles northeast of the post, but this flight was ter-  veh  8 and November 3, Arnold and Milling had  minute  minated because “the cold was intense” in their completely open and unprotected cockpit. On the third, Milling made two short flights despite a twenty-five-mile-per-hour wind, but both were aborted due to engine troubles. On the fourth, Arnold and Milling each made successful flights, Arnold sending radio signals and Milling, in another experiment, send- ing smoke signals back to earth.  Thomas M. Coffey * 60  sent them to Fort Riley, Kansas, for extensive reconnaissance maneu- vers, which would soon bring Arnold to the most grievous and disrup-  tive crisis he had yet been forced to face.
