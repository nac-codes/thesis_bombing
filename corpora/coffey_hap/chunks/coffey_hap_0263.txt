Its high speed in landing is its only drawback. It is a very strong machine and has a larger factor of safety than any of the other models,”* But it was a subject about which Arnold remained difficult to convince. Wright wrote of the C-model: agraph No. I, if the machines are supported by trestles at the last uprights of the wings, our Model ‘C’ will stand a test far in excess of the load that is required of it in flight.
