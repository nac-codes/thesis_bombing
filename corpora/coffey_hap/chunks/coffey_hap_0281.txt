At the present time it is not able to take care of itself.” (This was an issue destined to keep coming up for the next thirty-four years. Though Arnold eventually did as much as any man to make the separate U.S. Air Force a reality, he would often find himself in trouble during those years because his views, especially on the timing of the move, didn’t always coincide with those of other air officers.)  In the midst of Arnold's testimony, Chairman Hay returned to his personal situation. “You say you have been relieved?”  “Yes, sir, upon my own request.”  “And how long do officers generally stay in the Service?” “That depends upon the temperament of the officer,” Arnold replied. “Lt. Milling has been in the service for some time. He started at  the same time I did, and it has not affected him as far as I can see, but his  * HAP  length of service has made him more cautious, that is all.
