ng watched George Marshall in action during the entire Batangas invasion maneuver, Arnold now entertained an awesome respect for him. “That man,” he said to Bee, “will one day be the Army Chief of Staff.”* In the years ahead, his admiration for Marshall would never diminish, nor was he the only person mightily impressed by this young lieutenant who had proved able to handle so complex a command situation. The news of that Batangas maneuver was to launch within the Army a legend about the ability and efficiency of George Marshall.  Arnold had been “at home” in Fort McKinley with his wife for only ten days when he was again ordered into the field on a maneuver to test the defenses of Corregidor, the now fortified island in Manila Bay. Bee, a bride for only five months, undoubtedly hated to see him leave her again, yet she could look forward to one compensation she would cherish the rest of her life—his almost daily letters. Arnold still had too much of his father in him to be able to show his love demonstratively in person, but his letters would always remain as proof that the love was there,  “I think I am getting more crazy about you every day,” he wrote from Corregidor on February 19. “I know that I love you more: so  please, dearest, be careful of yourself and take no chances. . . . It would  put me out of commission permanently if anything serious ever hap- pened to you. . . . Darling, I love you and want to see you more every minute I am away.”  While he was away, Bee traveled to Batangas for a few days by the sea. On the twenty-third, he wrote to her there: “Darling I hope that you arrived at Batangas without any difficulty. Do you know that you are becoming more necessary to my peace of mind and in order to be happy I am much more dependent on you all the time? I think that I am  81 * HAP  increasing my capacity for loving, for otherwise I can’t explain it. . . . I miss you terribly and I want to violate your new rule and make love with you on Monday, Tuesday
