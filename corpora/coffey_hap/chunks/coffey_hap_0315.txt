lipinos did burn some warehouses that night but didn’t get near the quarters. Quiet was restored and everyone went back to sleep, only to be aroused again by another call to arms. This time, Arnold, suddenly awakened by the bugle call, confused it with the fire call, which sounded similar. Ruefully he looked at Bee and said, “Do I take a bucket, or a gun?”" He didn’t need either—it was a false alarm. The revolutionists had returned to the hills. During all of his time in the islands, Arnold never did see one of them.  Early in 1915 the Arnolds were transferred to Batangas, where Hap was in charge of F Company in the Caribou Regiment of the 13th Infantry. They lived in tropical splendor on “a beautiful post overlook- ing the bay.” They had a magnificent view, an excellent officers’ club that held weekly hops (Bee had finally taught Hap to dance), and a beautiful baby with whom to share their love. They had many reasons to be happy, but unfortunately, Bee wasn’t feeling well. Her weight had dropped to ninety-five pounds and she couldn't eat. One doctor said she had tuberculosis, another said it was dengue fever or malaria. Finally Hap sent her north to the Philippine summer capital, Baguio, in the  mountains above Manila, hoping the cooler air would cure her, After a short time there, she became deathly ill, and one day she came out of a coma to find herself lying in a dugout canoe being paddled down river by an almost naked Filipino: it was the quickest way to get her to a hos- pital. When she got there her disease was diagnosed as an acute intest- inal disorder. She was operated upon by a doctor she later described as a butcher, and though she eventually recovered, she was left with adhe- sions that caused her periodic distress for the rest of her life.'*  Thomas M, Coffey * 82  “violated” her “rule” by making love with her every day.
