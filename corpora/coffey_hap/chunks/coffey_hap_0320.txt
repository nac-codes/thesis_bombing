on? Or, if so detailed, would he object to it?  With some apprehension, Arnold sent a cable to Washington asking what that meant  The return cable from Washington presented him with a Catch-22 choice: “If you apply for detail in the Aviation Section, Signal Corps, you will come in with the rank of captain, If not, you will be detailed and come in with the rank of first lieutenant.”"*  Bee’s first reaction was, “Oh gracious, no!”® She couldn’t imagine it. The glamour of flying no longer appealed to her. She knew now about the dangers and she didn’t enjoy the prospect of Hap’s returning to it. He was much more than a suitor now. He was her husband and the father of her child. All these considerations, together with her illness, put her “in a very bad state.” But when she got hold of herself and stopped to think that Hap was a soldier as well as her husband, she realized he should do whatever he decided he had to do.  Though Arnold may not have realized it at the time, he was facing  85 = HAP  the most pivotal choice of his career. And it was, of course, a choice —despite the cablegram, he could have refused to return to aviation if he had insisted. But while he had enjoyed his two tours of duty in the islands, he still disliked the Infantry. What were his prospects if he were to remain in it? A few tours of duty at various camps in the United States. Close-order drill. Barracks inspections. Hikes and bivouacs. Maybe a march through Mexico in search of Pancho Villa.

And he hadn't really lost his interest in airplanes —only in flying them. But would he have to fly? There were plenty of jobs for ground officers in the Aviation Section. And maybe it was time to rethink his fears about flying. The newer planes were vastly superior to that old Wright C in which he had almost killed himself
