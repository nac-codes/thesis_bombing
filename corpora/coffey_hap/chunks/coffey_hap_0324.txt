nk his fears about flying. The newer planes were vastly superior to that old Wright C in which he had almost killed himself three and a half years earlier.  After docking at San Francisco, Arnold took Bee and Lois to Watertown, New York, and reported to his new outfit, the 3rd Infantry, at Madison Barracks. He knew now what his choice would be. Two months later, at the end of May 1916, he reported to the Aviation Section’s Rockwell Field, North Island, San Diego—but not as a flying officer. He was to be the supply officer for the new aviation school there. The field was named in honor of Lt. Lewis C, Rockwell, a classmate at West Point whom Arnold had inspired to fly, and who had died before Arnold's eyes in a 1912 crash at College Park. The Aviation Section had adopted a policy of naming its facilities after those of its fliers who had died in crashes. Arnold could reflect chillingly on the likelihood that there would now be an Arnold Field someplace if he hadn't managed to pull out of his dive the last time he flew a plane  On the day Arnold received his orders to leave Madison Barracks for San Diego, the rest of his unit was ordered to the Mexican border. Bee, who had recovered her health after leaving the tropics, went down to see the troop train off for Texas because several of the officers on it were now her friends. She was standing beside the train, talking to the wives of some of these men, when one of them said to her, “Well, I'd rather see my husband go to the border than do what your husband's going to do,”**  By this time, Bee was pregnant again, and she was still uncomfort- able about the possibility that Hap might return to flying. Yet it didn’t seem likely that a man with his restless energy would be content to be a supply officer. She was determined not to interfere.  Thomas M.
