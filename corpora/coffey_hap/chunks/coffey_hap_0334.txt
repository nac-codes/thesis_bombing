Though Lahm had become a major just a day or two earlier, ain—refused to be  Dargue—very much his junior and still only a cap intimidated. He disclosed that he had in his possession the original permit for the flight, signed by Lahm  None of this would have been important if Bishop and Robertson had not been lost for nine days. The matter might not have become important if Glassford and Lahm had agreed to an immediate search for them. But for six days they delayed beginning the search (perhaps they hoped the two would be found quickly, and didn’t want to call attention to a flight they couldn't justify), and this became a cause célebre among the pilots. Every flier on the base could imagine himself downed in the desert without anyone looking for him. Arnold quickly embraced the  side of Dargue and the pilots, which was bound to be the losing side since Glassford and Lahm had the power of rank.  Though Bishop and Robertson were finally found, near the head of the Gulf of California, Arnold and Dargue by that time were destined to be reassigned as soon as Colonel Glassford could arrange it. And when they both subsequently testified to Army investigators about the matter, they were signing their own tickets to exile. Dargue was sent back to the Coast Artillery, where he had served previously; Arnold was sent to Panama, ostensibly to organize an air squadron there but more likely, as  89 * HAP  he later acknowledged, because “  my Superiors wished to get me as far  away from San Diego as possible  On January 29, 1917, the day before his departure,*' Bee gave birth to their first son, prematurely, after a seven-month pregnancy; but it was not easy to celebrate his arrival in view of her delicate condition and Hap’s imminent exile to Panama.
