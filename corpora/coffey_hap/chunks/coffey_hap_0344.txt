mechanics. Of the 55 planes on hand, Arnold considered 51 obsolete and 4 obsolescent.** None were combat planes. None had usable machine guns mounted on them, The United States didn’t own a single bomber, nor did it own a bombsight, although, as we have seen, an American, Riley Scott, had invented the bombsight most of the Europe- an nations were using. Despite the fact that German and Allied planes had been fighting each other and bombing each other’s lines for almost three years, the Army General Staff still considered the airplane useful only for reconnaissance.  A few days after the United States declared war on Germany, Billy Mitchell, stationed in France, decided the best way to awaken the American Army to its air needs would be “to get the French government to exert pressure on ours.” Accordingly, he inspired a May 24, 1917, telegram from French Premier Alexandre Ribot to President Wilson, outlining the French estimate of American air requirements on the western front. By the spring of 1918, Ribot asserted, the United States should have sent (in conjunction with land operations) 4 5000 pilots, and 50,000 mechanics with all necessary support personnel and material. Earlier, on May 1, the French had already disclosed confidentially that the Germans held air superiority over the front. They would not be knocked out of the air by anything less than heroic efforts.  The American air planners, including Arnold, were heartened by  )0 airplanes,  the Ribot telegram. Here at least was a concrete goal, put forward by a nation with three years of experience fighting the Germans. The French estimate would have to be taken seriously, and it was—by the White House, the Joint Army and Navy Technical Board, and by Secretary of War Newton D. Baker and Secr of whom approved it within three days. But when the Aviation Section  ary of the }  avy Josephus Daniels, all  prepared a bill for Congress that would implement this plan—a bill calling for procurement of 22,600 airplanes
