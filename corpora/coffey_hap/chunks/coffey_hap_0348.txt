On April 9, when the Somme offensive was finally stalled after a thirty-mile gain, the Kaiser launched the Lys offensive, followed by the Aisne, the Noyon-Montdidier, and finally the Marne. During each of these drives, and until they were finally stopped in the Second Battle of the Marne, the Germans came perilously close to breakthroughs that would have defeated the Allies. An effective Ameri- can air arm could have done much to relieve the German pressure in these offensives.  The American failure to build and send more than a token air force to Europe was a continuing source of such bitter frustration to Arnold that his characteristic impatience, with which only his close associates had been familiar, now became famous throughout the Air Service and among those civilians involved in aircraft production. From late 1917 onward he made several inspection trips to Detroit and other auto centers that were supposedly becoming aircraft centers. With each trip his impatience grew. Automotive engineers and executives, despite all  * HAP  his arguments, couldn't seem to get it into their heads that an airplane was a creature quite different from a car. Nor did they share his feeling of urgency. He would return to Washington from these trips and in ever-growing exasperation, after arguing all day with production ex- perts like Howard Coffin, director of the Bureau of Aircraft Production, and J.
