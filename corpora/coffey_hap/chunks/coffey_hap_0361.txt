ich he could give himself completely. But now that he had adopted that cause, it seemed to him that a lot of other people who should be embracing it were abandoning it. The war had proven to everybody, presumably even to the Army General Staff, that the airplane was more important as an offensive and defensive weapon than it was as a reconnaissance implement. Apparently recognizing this fact, the General Staff, in May 1918, had separated the Aviation Section from the Signal Corps and changed its name once more, calling it the Air Service of the National Army.
