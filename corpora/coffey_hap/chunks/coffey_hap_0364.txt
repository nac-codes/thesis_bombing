, in December 1918, the General Staff had presented that post to another ground soldier, Maj. Gen. C. T. Menoher of the Infantry, and he intended to keep it, leaving Mitchell with a very subordinate role as his assistant. It might be argued that this was Mitchell's own fault, that if he had wanted the job he should have hurried home to fight for it, as Arnold had advised, But the General Staff knew all there was to know about Mitchell, whether he was at home or in Europe, and the fact that  they chose someone else was interpreted as a sign that they didn't share his ideas and out of the public eye.

While they didn't relegate the Air Service to its previous insignificant status,
