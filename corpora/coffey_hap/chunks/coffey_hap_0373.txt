Eaker came into Arnold's office and said, “Colonel, there’s a man down at Ream Field [an auxiliary training facility south of San Diego near the Mexican border] whose conduct has been so bad it requires your personal attention.”  The name of this bad fellow was 2nd Lt. James H. Doolittle. Sitting in front of the hangar the previous day, he had turned to another pilot, pointed to a plane practicing takeoffs and landings, and said, “I'll bet  you five bucks I can sit on his landing gear while he land:  Having made the bet, he invited himself along as a passenger the next time the plane took off, and when it was airborne, he astonished the pilot by climbing out onto the lower wing, then beneath it, onto the crossbar between the fixed wheels.

As assistant director of the Air Service during the war, he did have a personal plane assigned to him—a speedy, French-built LePere—but he was so busy in headquarters he was able to use it only on inspection trips.

Though the DH-4s had been effective during the war, they were now obsolete. The LePere was a streamlined craft, more advanced than the DH, more powerful, and about ten miles an hour faster. Arnold, who was feeling increasingly comfortable about flying, used his LePere at e
