at order before it became public and, using it without referring to it, declared at a September hearing of the U.S. Senate Military Affairs Committee . in this country, our army aviation is shot to pieces and our naval aviation does not exist as an arm, under the new organization; they have stopped having a separate bureau for aviation and have distributed those duties among six or seven different departments.”  His remarks became a source of embarrassment to Assistant Secre- tary of the Navy Franklin D.
