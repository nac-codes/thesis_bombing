were full of life. Hap used to sit on the porch of their Presidio quarters in the evening and watch them play. They liked to show off in front of him, putting tin cans on their heads and shouting  “Happy Hooligan!” in imitation of one of the popular children’s comics  of the day. Hap was beginning to be weight-conscious because, while he had given up drinking, he hadn't given up sweet desserts. If the kids wanted jam or jelly on their bread, they soon learned to grab it quickly because they knew that when he said “Pass the jam,” he was capable of upending the jar  In the evening, he and Bee would play cribbage, or, if friends came over, they might all sit on the front porch and sing songs. This could be painful to the friends and the neighbors because, while Hap loved to sing, he couldn't carry a tune. “There's a Long, Long Trail A-winding” was one of the songs he most often abused. When Tooey Spaatz came to  visit from Sacramento, the two of them would play chess, Though Spaatz  would probably have preferred poker, which was his favorite game, he couldn't get Arnold interested in it  The friendship between these two men deepened each time they saw each other. One night when Spaatz was in town, Arnold threw a party for him, arranging in advance to have it end with a surprise. Though Prohibition was now two years old, there was no shortage of liquor in San Francisco, or in Arnold’s quarters. He was an enthusiastic host and despite his own abstinence enjoyed mixing drinks for friends. The night of the Spaatz party he mixed a lot of drinks for a lot of friends, and as the early morning hours approached, almost everyone was feeling mellow. It was then that he pulled a surprise on Tooey. A man pounded on the front door, announced himself as a Prohibition agent, and demanded entrance. Spaatz leaped to his feet and, while everyone in on the joke was laughing, ran for the kitchen. But as soon as the joke was over, Arnold found out it had been on himself rather than Spaatz.
