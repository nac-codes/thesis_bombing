San Francisco had apparently been local birds, flying merely for the fun of it. Not until forty-eight hours later did the Signal Corps birds reach their home  coops."*  Three months later, on a flight in his aging and somewhat battered LePere from San Francisco to March Field near Riverside, seventy-five miles east of Los Angeles, Arnold had an experience that did not help  Thomas M.
