up the stairs toward Bee, he shouted in his usual loud voice (which was getting louder all the time because the years of flying had damaged his hearing), “What the hell is the chaplain doing here?”  The chaplain stopped in his tracks, looked back to let the Arnolds know he had heard that, too, and hurried away.’*  The summer of 1923 was a tragic one for the Arnold family. First Billy Bruce contracted scarlet fever and was admitted to the base hospital in critical condition. Then baby John developed acute appen- dicitis just as his father was busy preparing for a visit to San Diego by Gen. John J. Pershing, Army chief of staff at the time. On July 30, while Bruce lay near death in one room of the hospital, two-year-old John died in another room asa result of a ruptured appendix.** The following day, Arnold had to greet the chief of staff and show him around the base as if it were a day like any other day.

Rockwell was then such a sleepy base that when he returned from a flying trip, he felt free to buzz his own house to let his wife and family know he was home.  He had more time than ever to spend with his family and to pursue other interests. There was a lot of wildlife in the hills and deserts around San Diego and Arnold, who loved animals, used to come home with live rabbits, ducks, mules, even stray dogs.

Having acquired two of them, “Big Red” and “Big Blue,” Arnold had a cart built with four Jenny airplane wheels, four seats, a dashboard in front, and a long platform in the rear. One Sunday early in 1923, he took the family and a crowd of neighboring children for a ride in the cart out on a dirt road between Coronado and the North Island Naval Base. B
