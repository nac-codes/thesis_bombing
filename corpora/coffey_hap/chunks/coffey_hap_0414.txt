And on September  sank the obsolete American battleships Virginia and New Jersey. While all of this was happening, Arnold's only accomplishment in the belea- guered cause of air power was to encourage two of his younger officers, Capt. Lowell Smith and Lt. J. P. Richter, in the first successful demon- stration of refueling in flight, an exercise that later proved useful in extending the range of planes on long missions.  Late in the year Arnold “managed to get back east” for a short time and found Billy Mitchell “down in the dumps” despite his public popularity and his many accomplishments. He had reasons to be discontented. In 1921, General Pershing had bypassed him once more, after the resignation of General Menoher, to appoint Gen, Mason Patrick as chief of the Air Service, and Patrick was still in command.

Many of the governing Army generals also disliked him, and a lot of congressmen were tired of his harangues. He needed someone to moderate him, and Patrick might have been able to fulfill that function if Mitchell had been willing to listen to him, but Mitchell interpreted resistance to his ideas as proof that his opponents were stupid, stubborn, and stultified, their minds enmired in the nineteenth century, He may have been right, but  113. =» HAP  these were the men he was trying to persuade, and it's difficult to persuade a man by telling him he’s stupid.  “Air power doesn’t seem to be getting anywhere at all,” he said to Arnold.
