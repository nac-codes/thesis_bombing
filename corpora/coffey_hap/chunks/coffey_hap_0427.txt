life of Hap Arnold (whom Lois quite significantly did not deny as her true father), nursed him back to health, and had become the mother of his child. Later, after a short period in the United States during which he was married, he returned to the Philippines with his bride, and together they found Mara with little Lois, whom they bought from the native princess for ten pesos.  Lois told this story whenever an occasion arose, not always in the same detail, but she would always end on a note of mock magnanimity: “Mother [meaning Bee] has always treated me as one of her own children, but they still, to this day, deny the story.”**  It is not unusual for children to imagine that they are actually princes or princesses, separated by some strange or tragic circumstance from their royal parents, and that these parents will one day come to claim them and take them back to some far-off land; but it is unusual,  and somewhat alarming, for a child to believe this literally, as Lois s  ‘ms  117 * HAP  to have done. Such a child today, in a family of substance, would probably receive psychiatric treatment, but in the 1920s, psychiatry was not as accepted, nor was treatment as available, as it is today. So Lois continued constructing her own reality, rejecting her mother as she increasingly idealized her father, while both of her parents continued to hope she would grow out of this disturbing phase.  At the Army Industrial College, Arnold became almost as much a teacher as a student because during the war he had gained extensive knowledge and experience in the subject he was now studying—the Army’s relationship with the manufacturers who produced Army mate- riel. To the surprise of no one who knew him, he was soon involved in another dispute. Army policy in 1924, as in 1917-18, was to rely on the automobile companies as prime contractors for the manufacture of military aircraft. But Arnold remembered what a fiasco this arrange-  ment had created during the war, and he said so.
