It was fortunate for the admirals during World War II that the Japanese didn’t have enough air power to get at the American battleships that remained after Pearl Harbor. Japanese pilots proved in Hawaii, and even more convincingly in Malaya two months later (by destroying Britain's Prince of Wales and Repulse), that they could sink battleships as easily as could any other pilots. If they hadn't run out of aircraft carriers and planes, America’s entire battle fleet would probably have suffered the same fate as theirs, The fact that, as late as 1945, the admirals hadn't acknowl edged the vulnerability of their proud warships indicates how far from acknowledging it they were in 1925, and how difficult a job people like Mitchell and Arnold had in trying to persuade them  Mitchell's strident impatience made the job even more difficult, to be sure, By 1925, the country was in an uproar over his battle with the Navy, his battle with the conservative Army generals, and his battle with his civilian boss, John W.
