ect it  boast, but by 192. seems astonishing that the Navy continued building battleships even up to 1945, after nearly all the German and Japanese battleships had been destroyed by airplanes, many of them by the Navy’s own planes. It was fortunate for the admirals during World War II that the Japanese didn’t have enough air power to get at the American battleships that remained after Pearl Harbor. Japanese pilots proved in Hawaii, and even more convincingly in Malaya two months later (by destroying Britain's Prince of Wales and Repulse), that they could sink battleships as easily as could any other pilots. If they hadn’t run out of aircraft carriers and planes, America’s entire battle flect would probably have suffered the same fate as theirs, The fact that, as late as 1945, the admirals hadn’t acknowl edged the vulnerability of their proud warships indicates how far from acknowledging it they were in 1925, and how difficult a job people like Mitchell and Arnold had in trying to persuade them  Mitchell's strident impatience made the job even more difficult, to  be sure. By 1925, the country was in an uproar over his battle with the Navy, his battle with the conservative Army generals, and his battle with his civilian boss, John W. Weeks, secretary of war in Coolidge’s cabinet Weeks, whose views reflected those of Coolidge, discounted Mitchell's assessment of air power. He wanted to keep peace with the Navy. After many attempts to silence Mitchell, he became exasperated beyond measure by Mitchell's remarks to the press and before the Congressional Select Committee of Inquiry into Operations of the United States Air Services, Finally, with White House approval, he decided to demote and banish the stormy nuisance. On March 6, 1925, Mitchell was relieved as assistant chief of the Air Service, demoted to the rank of colonel, and assigned as air officer at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio.  Gencral Patrick's position as Air Service chief was renewed at the same time, not
