of the Air Service, demoted to the rank of colonel, and assigned as air officer at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio.  Gencral Patrick's position as Air Service chief was renewed at the same time, not because his views differed from those of Mitchell, but because he played within the Army rules. While he may not have liked Mitchell, Patrick often supported him, and when Secretary Weeks was pressing for Mitchell's dismissal, Patrick suggested that instead of being fired, the man should be “admonished by the War Department for his  attitude and his methods,”' and told to stop using immoderate language For Hap Arnold, the removal of Mitchell was an irreparable loss  because, even though Patrick was a staunch supporter of air power, he  121 * HAP  didn’t seem to be a very effective one.
