were about to hire the couple who worked for the Miltons, she said, “You mean Maggie and Cheatham?”  “Yes,” he said. “What's wrong with them?”  “Nothing’s wrong,” she said, an expression of delight spreading over her face. “Maggie is just the best cook on the post.”  The arrival of Maggie Cheatham was an event of great significance in the Arnold household.
