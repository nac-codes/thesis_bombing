at Sacramento, California, and he did the job so well he won the same assignment the following year, when a similar maneuver was held at Dayton with nearly 700 airplanes. On April 17, 1930, during the California maneuver, he was involved in a minor  2 observation plane at  accident while taxiing out for a takeoff in an 0. Crissy Field. Forced to swerve away from another plane and partially blinded by the dust it had kicked up, he ran into a 25,000-gallon gas tank, which should not have been that close to the runway.’ The accident report assigned him only a small degree of blame, noting at the same time that he was a “superior” pilot, both in skill and judgment. He was flying frequently now, with no indication that he still suffered from his old fears; this mishap in San Francisco seems to have had no adverse effect upon him.  By 1930, aircraft design and performance were improving rapidly. Charles A. Lindbergh's successful flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927 probably did more to stimulate aviation than all of Billy Mitchell's preachments. But it was not until 1930 that aircraft wheels were first equipped with brakes. Adjustable-pitch propellors soon appeared, as well as metal fuselages and wings. Cockpits were beginning to fill up with sophisticated instruments, which allowed Jimmy Doolitle to make the first blind takeoff and blind landing. The first 200-mile-per-hour bomber—the twin-engined Martin B-10—was on the drawing boards. The Air Corps, though its appropriations were still meager, was getting help from the civilian air industry, reaping the benefits of technological advances developed by the aircraft companies for the growing airlines  There were 1,000 commercial airports in the United States by 1929, and 1,200 more were under construction. The government had desig- nated 25,000 miles of airways, mostly for airline use, and the aircraft industry was producing more than 7,000 planes per year. Though the passenger airlines were still dependent on governm
