Without knowing what he was doing, he jettisoned a flood of gasoline from the plane's tanks onto the concrete. At dinner that night, his father said, “Some damned fool dumped a tankful of gas on the flight line today.”  143. * HAP  He looked directly at Hank, who kept his eyes down and said nothing.  “Probably a good thing,” Arnold said at last. “If they had put that plane on the scrap heap with eleven hundred gallons of gas in it, we'd have had a hell of an explosion.”  But while Hank's scrapes usually arose from boyish curiosity, Lois’s waywardness was becoming a cause for deep concern.

But perhaps because of the rigid restraints upon them when he was present, his children would sometimes cut loose and become astonishingly wild when he was absent.
