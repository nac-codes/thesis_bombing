Like Craig, he had forbidden buzzing in his command, but he didn't mind doing it himself when the situation was right  Arnold's evident enthusiasm for flying during his years at March  Field indicates that he had overcome his earlier fears. Yet the strain of  153 * HAP  flying, combined perhaps with his general intensity, his love of rich, sweet food, and his refusal ever to relax, brought on an episode which must have frightened him at the time, and to which, it can be said in retrospect, he should have paid closer attention  On a flight later in 1933 back to California from the East, with two of his young fighter pilots flying on his wings, he stopped in Salt Lake City for refueling. The two young pilots, perhaps tired after the long formation flight west, wanted to lay over there until the next day Arnold, always in a hurry, and possibly eager to show these youngsters n't so old himself, decided they would fly on to March Field, and since he was the boss, they did so. But at dinner on Arnold’s first day  that he wa  at home, he seemed not to be hungry. His son Hank noticed that he just sat at the table, saying nothing and cating nothing.  Bee said to him, “Are you all right?”  “Yeah, I'm all right.”  But by that time he was turning gray. All the color had left his usually florid face and his breathing was labored.

Fliers, for fear of being grounded, don’t like to advertise their illnesses—especially illnesses which resemble heart attacks. If th
