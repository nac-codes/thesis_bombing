still on his wing, buzzed the tower at Crissy Field. As Beebe knew, Craig had strict rules against buzzing.  When they landed, two military policemen were waiting to put them under arrest and, in accordance with the commanding general's stand- ing order, take them directly to his office  As Arnold and Beebe settled into the back seat of the MPs’ ¢  Beebe stared at Arnold in wonder. If he was already in trouble, why had he compounded it by buzzing the tower?

He had charmed the older man so completely that Craig promised to visit March Field at his earliest opportunity and see for himself what the Air Corps was doing down there  Arnold was so elated when he and Beebe took off from Crissy for home that as they flew over the Tehac hapi Pass (after stopping for gas at Bakersfield), he went right down on the deck and, with Beebe c linging to his wing, flew all the way to Cajon Pass about fifteen feet above the ground.
