assumed it would be easy to arrange for the government to buy all of it. Actually, he didn’t succeed in that project until 1939, but in the meantime, he didn’t wait for legal niceties before using it, He set up his bomb and gunnery ranges there immediately, establishing an installation that is now the great test facility Edwards Air Force Base.  Arnold solidified a team of men at March Field who would be important to him for the rest of his career—men like Spaatz, Eaker, Hunter, McNarney, and Beebe. Spaatz was like a brother to him, in and out of his house all the time. On Sunday afternoons, they would sit in front of the fireplace playing chess and arguing about airplanes or air strategy.? One Sunday, during a game between Arnold, Spaatz, and Hunter, an argument arose as to whether it would be better to use 30- or 50-caliber machine guns in aerial combat. The heavier gun would be more effective, but its weight, and the weight of its ammunition, would diminish a plane’s airspeed. Would the extra power of the 50 aliber gun compensate for this loss of speed? As the argument heightened, the decibel count in the room increased—not only because of passionate convictions but also because all three men, after fifteen or twenty years of flying loud propellor planes, had become partially deaf.  Finally the argument reached a point where it could no longer be settled by words. The three of them interrupted the chess game and went down to the ordnance department to weigh the two guns plus their ammunition. When they returned, the argument appeared to be settled. They quietly resumed their chess game and had played for several  minutes when one of them said, “We forgot to weigh the linkage [the chain which feeds the machine gun bullets into the gun].” Without further ado they stood up and headed for ordnance again.  In late 1933 Spaatz was transferred to the Washington office of Gen.  Benjamin Foulois, who was then Air Corps chief. On February 10, 1934,  Arnold and March Field
