European air strategists as Guilio Douhet of France and Lord Hugh Trenchard of England.* But some of these men were misled, at that time, by the technology available to them. The fastest fighter plane they knew, the P-26, had an airspeed of only 220 miles per hour. The B-17, which was undergoing tests, was expected to fly at 250 miles per hour. This led many, though not all, Air Corps strategists to believe that the bombers of the future would be able to outrun the  fighters and therefore would be able to fly their missions unescorted. It  was a belief that persisted too long and was destined to cause grief  during World War II.
