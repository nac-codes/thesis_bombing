had already approved the appointment.  The matter may not have been decided quite so simply. Westover did admire Arnold, no doubt about that. Two years earlier after a v isit to C. note to Be  lifornia (Westover was then assistant chief), he wrote a thank-you  Arnold in which he said, “March Field certainly made a wonderful showing in the Quarterly Test, and on each of my visits I have been impressed by the fact that March Field has not alone a wonderful Commanding Officer and wife of a Commanding Officer, but also has acquired a way of doing things, both in the military and social way, as to make it stand out comparatively among Air Corps stations "7 A year later, Westover was instrumental in choosing Arnold to lead the 1934 Alaska flight, But Craig himself may have instigated Arnold’s selection as assistant chief, and he had two obvious reasons for doing so. First of all, he clearly admired Arnold and was as entertained as he was sometimes shocked by Arnold’s unorthodox methods.
