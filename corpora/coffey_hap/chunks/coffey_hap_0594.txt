e doubt that he settled on this conviction as early as he indicated.  Arnold enjoyed his association with the G.H.Q. Air Force because, under Andrews's direction, it seemed to be doing something. It offered a challenge. It invited experiment. It was attempting to develop, expand, refine, and clarify the function the Air Corps should fulfill in national defense. It was trying for the first time to decide in practical terms how air power could and should be coordinated for the nation’s maximum benefit. Arnold found the work satisfying and so did his men. They were now part of an increasingly tight-knit outfit that was getting something accomplished, and around that fact they built an esprit de corps. But just as some people had foreseen when the G.H.Q.

As for the rest of the Florida maneuver, Arnold didn’t see much of it because he was summoned to Washington by General  craig, who was now the Army c
