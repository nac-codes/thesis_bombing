self may have instigated Arnold's selection as assistant chief, and he had two obvious reasons for doing so. First of all, he clearly admired Arnold and was as entertained as he was sometimes shocked by Arnold’s unorthodox methods. Since their original misun- derstanding about the Long Beach earthquake relief, they had become fast friends. Secondly, Craig was sensitive enough to realize that the Air Corps was now almost bitterly divided into two camps. If the new chief was to come from the old chief's faction, then his assistant should be one of those fly boys from the G.H.Q.
