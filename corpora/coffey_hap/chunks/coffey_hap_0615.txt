Putt went along as copilot that morning, and Boeing test pilot Les Tower went along as an  observer."*  When Hill took the plane off the ground, it had barely become airborne before it fell off on one wing and crashed, Hill was killed immediately. Tower later died of his injuries. Putt survived with a deep gash on his head. The cause of the accident was easy to determine.
