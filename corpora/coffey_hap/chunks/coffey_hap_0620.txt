nold had managed to exert upon him, The  concluding section of the study said  175 * HAP  Until the international situation indicates the need for [such] long-range types of bombardment aviation as the Project A and the 4-engine [Boeing] models, no more of that type should be procured except for experimental purposes.  b. That a medium range bombardment type such as the B-18 model will fulfill all reasonable military requirements and can be justified from the standpoint of initial cost, maintenance, expense and operating facilities.  On August 3, 1936, Secretary of War Woodring further instructed Westover that he shouldn't order the B-17s already included in the budget for fiscal 1937 until the thirteen planes due for delivery by the Boeing Company in 1937 had been received and tested. Ar nold wrote a memorandum, dated September 11, 1936, recommending that at least twenty of the planes originally included in the 1937 procurement program be ordered without delay, but this recommendation was approved only with the same paralysing stipulations. The War Depart- ment had now begun a long series of delays and limitations that prevented the procurement of any more than the original fourteen Flying Fortresses until the latter half of 1939, when Hitler's invasion of Poland was imminent.

I looked toward Arnold for a little support but I got none. I personally
