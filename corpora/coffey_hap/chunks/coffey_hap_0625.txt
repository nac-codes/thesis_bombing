one in the Army ground forces believed in long-range air power during the period between 1936 and 1938:  there were no responsible quarters, either, who still doubted that the airplane had become an indispensable weapon. But that meant as direct troop support, aerial reconnaissance for the ground forces, communications and transport. Bombardment on its own, to some extent—yes. But the twin-engined B-10s and B-12s seemed good enough for that. No powerful sympathy for the “independent air mission”—the kind of strategic air campaign which the B-17s and B-24s over Germany, and the B-29s over Japan were to carry ut—existed in the War Department.'*  He seemed to be admitting in that passage that his own arguments for the “independent air mission” had not budged his friend Craig, who was commanding the Army  From the Navy, the /  ir Corps’ “independent mission” was receiving even less sympathy. The Navy felt that any money being spent on long-range bombers might better be spent on battleships or even carriers, which were now getting some Navy attention. And the Navy had the ear of President Roosevelt, its onetime assistant secretary. Roosevelt was not yet at this time  an air-power advocate.  There were two ways Navy people could have looked at the  long-range heavy bomber. They could have seen it as a support weapon  for their fleet, a land-based naval gun that could strike an enemy fleet hundreds  f miles away. Or they could have looked upon it as an  177 * HAP  t and si-  altogether uncontrollable weapon that threatened their fle phoned money from their annual budget. As it happened, Navy people chose the latter view, because to choose the former view would have been to admit that the long-range bomber, in enemy hands, could be an effective weapon against the American fleet. Therefore they had to pretend it wouldn't work.  This explains the Navy attitude about all the Air Corps tests, beginning with those Billy Mitchell conducted in 1921, proving that planes could sink
