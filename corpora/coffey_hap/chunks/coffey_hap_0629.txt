He may have argued privately with Craig about the B-17, but it is not surprising that he failed to dispute publicly Craig's decision to put the plane on ice, since it was Craig who had put him in the job he held. Arnold admitted in his memoirs that no one in the Army  ground forces believed in long-range air power during the period between 1936 and 1938:  there were no responsible quarters, either, who still doubted that the airplane had become an indispensable weapon. But that meant as direct troop support, aerial reconnaissance for the ground forces, communications and transport. Bombardment on its own, to some extent—yes.
