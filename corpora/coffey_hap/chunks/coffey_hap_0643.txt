d knew he now had a potential ally, or at least a man to whom he could “talk business.” No one had to tell Arnold about the qualities of this unique soldier. Here was the same George Marshall of whom Arnold had said, in the Philippines in 1914, “That man will one day be the Army Staff.”  Arnold said later that when Marshall arrived “he needed plenty of indoctrination about the facts of air life. The difference in George, who presently was to become one of the most potent forces behind the development of a real American air power, was his ability to digest what he saw and make it a part of as strong a ever known.”**  ief of  ody of military genius as I have  Arnold's evaluation of Marshall's military genius is one that many military experts now share. Perhaps because he did most of his work during World War II behind a desk, Marshall has never received the  181 * HAP  public recognition he deserved. But when military men speak of him, they often lower their voices in respect  It would, however, be interesting to know precisely what Arnold meant by the phrase, “the difference in George.” The difference in George as opposed to whom? To Arnold’s friend Malin Craig? It was perhaps admirable in Arnold that he did not publicly criticize his friends, and indeed, friendship aside, it is never easy for a brigadier general to criticize the chief of staff; but the result was that Arnold appeared sometimes to agree with a man whose views he didn’t actually  share. In the above passage he seemed to admit tacitly that his “indoctri- nation” of Craig hadn't taken hold. In his memoirs he wrote at things as they were in 1936-38, how did our little Army Air Corps  “Looking  stand in relation to the air power of other countries as the war clouds took definite shape? ...To be realistic, we were practically non- existent.”  In early 1938 the Air Corps had no more than 1,650 officers and 16,000 enlisted men.
