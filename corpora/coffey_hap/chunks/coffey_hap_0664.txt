He believed that the funds allotted to the Works Progress Administration, a Depression relief agency of which he was the director, could and should be diverted to the construction of new aircraft factories. Arnold, without disagreeing, pointed out also that the current painstaking, plane-by-plane mode of aircraft production would have to be changed, that the manufacturers would have to be persuaded to install production-line methods  While Hopkins went back to Roosevelt with all the ideas they had exchanged, including some vague notions about the number of planes the nation might need, Arnold continued working on Craig during their golf games and whenever else he could talk freely to him  Arnold was now functioning much of the time as acting chief of the Air Corps, because General Westover liked to get away from Washington to find out what was happening at his installations around the country and at the various aircraft factories with which the Air Corps was already doing some business. Though Westover enjoyed flying and insisted on piloting his own single-engine plane, accompanied only by a mechanic, many people in the Air Corps worried about him because he had started out as a balloon flier and had washed out seve
