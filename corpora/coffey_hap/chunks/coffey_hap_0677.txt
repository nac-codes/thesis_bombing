On October 5, 1938, the adjutant general sent Arnold a War Department budget memorandum which said “4-engine bombers will not be included in the estimates for FYs [Fiscal Years] 1940 and 1941  This meant either that Secretary Woodring, openly unsympathetic to Air Corps expansion, hadn't heard a word the president said at that historic September 28 meeting, or that he had decided to pay no attention to Roosevelt's orders, or that he assumed the money for Roosevelt's air force would come not from the Army budget but directly from the U.S. Treasury  Oddly enough, the latter would not have been a farfetched assump- tion.

He knew that if he wanted to expand American aircraft production, he would have to pretend he was doing it simply to strengthen American air defenses. He obviously did want to increase American air power, but as subsequent events proved, he wanted first to strengthen France and England
