meeting, or that he had decided to pay no attention to Roosevelt's orders, or that he assumed the money for Roosevelt's air force would come not from the Army budget but directly from the U.S. Treasury  Oddly enough, the latter would not have been a farfetched assump- tion. President Roosevelt's perception of Hitler's intentions, and the dire consequences to America if Hitler were to conquer Europe, had brought him to the conviction that the United States must find ways to intervene against German aggression.
