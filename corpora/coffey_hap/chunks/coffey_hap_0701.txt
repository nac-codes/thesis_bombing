and Arnold were resisting his efforts to send airplanes to France and England.  Arnold had first tasted Morgenthau’s power in late December 1938, when Morgenthau, after negotiating with Monnet, had arranged for a five-man aircraft-purchasing team from France to visit the United States. Permission was necessary because of the security policy of the Joint Army-Navy Aircraft Board, which stipulated that no secret parts or devices on U.S. planes could be released to a foreign country.
