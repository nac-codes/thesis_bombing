In any future war, would the corps have greater need for fighters or bomb- ers?!* Would bombers be able to defend themselves on long missions, or would they need fighter protection? When the national policy was defensive, how was it possible to justify investment in bombers, which were patently offensive weapons? On the other hand, how could a fighter, which was primarily a defensive weapon, damage the enemy enough to help win a war? These arguments were destined to continue until the grim realities of the air war over Europe imposed a somewhat tardy and therefore expensive solution. It was a solution w hich did not fit the prevailing theories of 1939.  Because almost all airmen believed in the airplane as an offensive weapon, the Air Corps strategy had always been based on offense, even  when the nation’s psychology was defensive.

He realized now that he had a lot of fighting to do before the Air Corps got enough planes with which to fight. Meanwhile he went to work getting the corps ready for the day when there would be enough planes.  It seemed to him that despite the current bottleneck, the day would eventually come when the corps would need as many as 100,000 pilots. At the moment, it was turning out only 750 per year.
