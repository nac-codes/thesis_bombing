Board members like Anderson, Sorenson, and Snyder argued, however, that these developments would not eliminate the need for fighters, but that the range of fighters would have to be increased, because unless bombers were escorted by fighters on long missions into enemy territory, the bomber losses would be prohibitive  This proved to be a minority opinion. The bomber advocates tended to disagree with it because they were imbued with the doctrine that the bomber would always get through. And fighter advocates, of whom Arnold's old friend “Miff” Harmon was a leader, took exception because they didn't believe the range of fighter planes could be significantly lengthened without sacrificing combat performance. In- creased gas loads and decreased ammunition loads, for instance, would lengthen the range of fighters, but a shortage of ammunition would make them vulnerable to enemy fighters, and the extra gas would make them more flammable when hit. The fighter advocates at Maxwell Field argued, therefore, that it would be useless to send fighters all the way with the bombers because they wouldn't be able to protect the bombers when they got there. The bombers, they argued, should be armed to protect themselves.  This argument prevailed in 1939, and for more than three years thereafter, because the technological limitations of the time made it difficult to refute. The result was the development of bombers that bristled with guns but because of this excess weight were limited in their bomb loads; and the development of fighters with ranges so short they could escort the bombers only for pathetically inadequate distances Arnold would one day be plagued by the fact that he accepted the majority view of his strategists on this question  With Hitler preparing to occupy Czechoslovakia (which he did on March 16, 1939), while France and England finally scrambled for weapons to resist him, the danger of war in Europe was inc reasing daily And in Washington, confusion reigned as the
