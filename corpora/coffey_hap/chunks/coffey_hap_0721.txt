The clouded future made everyone in America uneasy and prone to believe rumors, especially the young men who would have to fight any war that might come  Arnold’s son Hank was now in his third year at the Military Academy, which, being part of the Army, was almost as much a rumor  factory as it was a school. The rumors were piling up so fast there in the  199  HAP  Thomas M.

Air Corps Board members like Anderson, Sorenson, and Snyder argued, however, that these developments would not eliminate the need for fighters, but that the range of fighters would have to be increased, because unless bombers were escorted by fighters on long missions into enemy territory, the bomber losses would be prohibitive  This proved to be a minority opinion. The bomber advocates tended to disagree with it because they were imbued with the doctrine that the bomber would always get through. And fighter advocates, of whom Arnold’s old friend “Miff” Harmon was a leader, took exception because they didn't believe the range of fighter planes could be significantly lengthened without sacrificing combat performance. In- creased gas loads and decreased ammunition loads, for instance, would lengthen the range of fighters, but a shortage of ammunition would make them vulnerable to enemy fighters, and the extra gas would make them more flammable when hit. The fighter advocates at Maxwell Field argued, therefore, that it would be useless to send fighters all the way with the
