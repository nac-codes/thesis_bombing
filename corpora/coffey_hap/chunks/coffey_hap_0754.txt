Lindbergh, who already despised President Roosevelt with passion, rejected the feeler scornfully, but he retained his friendship with Arnold, whom he had come to regard as “a grand fellow.”  Arnold’s preoccupation with the need to create a large Air Corps soon put him in contention with Maj.

In building up the training he had to tear down the tactical."*  Spaatz considered Emmons “a very fine man,” but more conserva- tive than Arnold. “He couldn't have done Hap’s job in building up the Air Force. ...
