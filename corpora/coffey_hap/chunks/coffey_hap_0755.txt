ut the “bugs” in new models, pleading with Congress for more money, fighting off Morgenthau for delivery of planes, weeding out officers who didn't seem inclined to move fast enough, and trying to find out exactly what was happening in Europe, what kind of equipment and tactics the new Air Corps would have to develop if it was to match and surpass the European air forces.  To this end he increased his contacts with scientists like Vannevar Bush, Robert Millikan, C. F. Kettering, James B, Conant, Arthur Compton, Frank Lilly, and Theodor von Karman.  One day he invited George Marshall to come to lunch with several  of these distinguished men. Marshall was astonished to find himself in  Thomas M. Coffey 206  personality was difficult to resist. Marshall soon put Andrews to work on an Air Corps expansion plan and assigned a brilliant young major, Laurence S. Kuter, to help him with it  After becoming chief of staff, Marshall took another step toward making ground officers air-conscious by adding the study of air power to the Command and General Staff School curriculum, And when the Air Corps study group of which Lindbergh was a member (called the Kilner Board after its chairman, Brig. Gen. Walter G. Kilner) recommended on September 1, 1939, the development of a huge bomber, which was to become the B-29 “Superfortress,” Marshall enthusiastically joined Hap Arnold in endorsing it. “This establishes for the first time a special mission for the Air Corps,” Marshall said.* His statement had pivotal significance because it was the first acknowledgment by a commanding general of the Army that the Air Corps had a distinct offensive function of its own, in addition to its responsibility for support of ground forces.  Once this concept had been accepted, the development of the B-29  was a logical and necessary step. The expanding Air Corps, in its “special mission,” would eventually need a successor to the B-17; given the months and years it would take to develop such an immense
