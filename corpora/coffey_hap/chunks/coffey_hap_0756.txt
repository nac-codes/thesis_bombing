was a logical and necessary step. The expanding Air Corps, in its “special mission,” would eventually need a successor to the B-17; given the months and years it would take to develop such an immense and complex machine, there was no time to lose. Yet if Arnold had known in 1939 what headaches the B-29 would eventually give him, if he had known that it would one day put his entire career and reputation in jeopardy, he might have been more cautious in endorsing it  Lindbergh's participation in recommending development of the B-29 produced an ironic twist two weeks later, when Arnold felt the need to ease him out of his Air Corps work. By this time, Lindbergh had become an avowed isolationist, and he planned to make a nationwide radio speech the evening of September 15, pleading with Americans to stay out of the European war. On the previous day he showed the speech to Arnold who tactfully suggested, after reading it, that he discontinue his Air Corps activities while he was taking part in politics.*  After Lindbergh left his office, Arnold may have informed Secre- tary of War Woodring about the speech because the next day, Lind- bergh’s friend Col. Truman Smith went to Lindbergh with a White House “feeler,” which had descended from Woodring to Arnold to Smith  If Lindbergh would cancel his radio speech opposing American entry into the war, Smith said, the administration would create for him a  new cabinet post, “a secretaryship of air.” General Arnold had felt he  must pass the offer on, Smith added, because it had come from the  207 * HAP  secretary of war's office. But when Smith asked Arnold if he thought Lindbergh would accept it, Arnold had said, “Of course not.”  He was quite right. Lindbergh, who already despised President Roosevelt with passion, rejected the feeler scornfully, but he retained his friendship with Arnold, whom he had come to regard as “a grand fellow.”  Arnold’s preoccupation with the need to create a large Air Corps soon put him in contention
