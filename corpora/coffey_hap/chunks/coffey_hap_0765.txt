e enough to contain a full-scale airplane engine installation and should be capable of generating winds of at least four hundred miles per hour.”  Seeing the quizzical expression on Arnold’s face, von Karman added, “Of course, a tunnel of this size will require forty thousand horsepower. Maybe you don’t wish to invest in such a large and revolutionary piece of equipment?”  “On the contrary,” Arnold said, “that’s exactly what we do want, the hi stopped begging to be allowed to catch up to other agencies and started taking the lead.”  Von Karman returned to California and with Arnold’s authoriza-  hest combination of speed and size. It’s about time the Air Corps  tion went right to work designing a twenty-foot, 40,000-horsepower wind tunnel, which was soon built at Wright Field and was the first of its kind. When it was built, its first problem was already waiting: there was an acute need, as Lindbergh had already observed,’ for the dev elopment of better and more powerful aircraft engines  Early in 1940, General Marshall called General Arnold and several senior Air Corps staff officers into his office to hear a presentation of the  209 # HAP  Air Corps expansion plan on which General Andrews (as assistant chief  for operations and training) and several members of his staff had been working, Arnold and most of his men were familiar with the provisions of the plan because there had been a lot of give and take between them and the Andrews staff during its development, Tt was basically an Air Corps dream of its own expansion, Andrews was an Air Corps man and $0 was Major Kuter, the project officer. But while the plan contained few if any surprises for the Air men, Marshall himself had not yet seen it, and without his approval it would never become anything more than a dream,  Kuter made the presentation, which called for a huge expansion of the corps into a fifty-four-group organization, with all the procurement of planes and equipment, construction of air fields and fac
