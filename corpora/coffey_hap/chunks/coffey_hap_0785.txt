d over to the British. Marshall looked to Arnold and asked him how much training time his units would lose if those planes were surrendered,"  After making an unexplained calculation, Arnold said that those 100 planes, which the R.A.F, would use up in three days at its current  Joss rate, would cost the Army Air Corps six months of training time  Thomas M. Coffey 216  The Air Corps then had only 160 pursuit planes for 260 qualified pilots, and it had only 52 of the 136 heavy bombers it would have had were it not for the diversion to foreign countries. Marshall, after listening to this, sided with Arnold and turned down Morgenthau’s demand. Arnold heard no more of the matter but he could be sure the president was informed of it  Meanwhile, President Roosevelt,  1 May 16, had made a plea be- fore Congress that might give hope to the still puny Air Corps, and to the British if they could hold out long enough against Hitler. Arnold had prompted Marshall to encourage this plea, since he himself no longer had access to the president, and when he learned that Roosevelt's address was to be broadcast, he called in Tooey Spaatz and Ira Eaker, both now on his staff, and told them to listen to it.'* He himself would listen to it elsewhere.  When the president's address to Congress came over the radio, Spaatz and Eaker were both astonished at his concluding statement. “  should like,” he said, “to see this nation geared up to the ability to turn out at least fifty thousand planes a year.”  Arnold returned to his office to find both Spaatz and Eaker staring at him in consternation. How could he have let the president make such a preposterous statement, they asked him. The whole aircraft industry that year was turning out less than ten thousand planes  Arnold looked at them and smiled, “If I had asked for twenty-five thousand,” he said, “I would have gotten fifteen thousand. Now I've asked for fifty thousand, and if I don’t get twenty-five thousand, you  boys won't be here a year
