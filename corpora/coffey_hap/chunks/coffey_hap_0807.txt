Because Boeing couldn't make enough B-17s to satisfy him, he forced Boeing to license Douglas and Lockheed to build them. Then he made Douglas and Lockheed construct new plants in which to do the building. Because the labor supply on the Pacific Coast wasn’t big enough at that time, he made all the large companies build additional plants in Texas or the Middle West, where labor was plentiful  Dutch Kindelberger of North American built a plant between  Dallas and Fort Worth in March 1941 because Arnold had called him in and told him to do so.  “We had to finance it on our own money,” Kindelberger recalled “They [the Air Corps] didn't have any money for this. I was scared to death for a long while there because I didn’t even have a piece of paper I was building six hundred trainers for Hap, and building a factory [near] Dallas, and the net worth of North American was obligated several times over. And I hadn't any contracts yet.  Within three years, that plant near Dallas would be employing 43,000 workers and turning out thousands of P-51s and B-24s,  Donald Douglas has told a similar story. One day in late 1940.  Arnold called him from Washington and said, “Don, you're going to Tulsa to run a plant.”"” ss  “The hell I am,” Douglas said  “The hell you aren't,” Arnold insisted. “You're there now.”  Before he knew it, Douglas had a $36-million plant in Tulsa employing 16,000 people. By 1943, Douglas would also have a $45: million plant in Oklahoma City employing 20,000; a $33-million plant in Chicago employing 11,000; a $30-million plant in Long Beach employ- ing 40,000; a $20-million plant in El Segundo employing 21,000; and his original $30-million home factory in Santa Monica employing 44,000  By 1941, the demand for aircraft was so great that the big puaeoe. bile companies had gone into the business of building planes. Arnold  was still convinced, from his World War I experience, that they would never develop the knack for it, but William S Knudsen, an auto industry
