To keep an eye on the plane-making efforts of the auto makers, Arnold sent to Detroit one of the great aeronautical geniuses of all time, Maj, Jimmy Doolittle.  For several years, Doolittle had been a civilian working for the Shell  Oil Company, but he had never dropped his Air Corps connections. In 99, after a trip to Europe, he had come to Arnold with a  August 1 report that predicted the imminent outbreak of war, confirmed every- thing Lindbergh had said about Hitler’s air force, and described its  strength in terms that the war later proved uncannily accurate With  0 offered his services to the Air Corps.  this report, Doolittle had als Arnold had said, “but it will take  “] want you back on active duty, an act of Congress to get you back.”  Doolittle was then a reserve major and the Arm Jaw to call field-grade officers back to extended active duty Congress had revised the law, thanks largely to Arnold's lobbying, and Doolittle was the first field-grade reserve officer to return to uniform. Arnold had immediately sent him to the Allison Engine Corporation in ather self-satisfied subsidiary of General Motors, which  yy was forbidden by By July 1940  Indianapolis, a r ig out engines that were not very good.

Doolittle was the ideal man for it and he did the best he could. While he was at Allison, he also  conducted instrument-flying experiments with the P-40, which resulted procedures for bad: weather flying, There airplanes that Doolittle couldn't do, but  theirs was the on!  in a whole new set of training
