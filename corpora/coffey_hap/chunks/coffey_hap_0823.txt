And the ability to see thirty or forty raging fires atone time in a large city had an impact on us, and to see the calm of the next day, and to see business and commerce progressing as usual, had another unusual effect on us. We came to a sort of opinion, an intuitive opinion, that the British didn't know what they were in for. We sold them short, in other words. We thought they didn’t realize the magnitude of all the real effect of this night bombing. Well, it turned out that they were right and we were wrong.”"*  On the seventeenth, Air Vice Marshal Sir Richard Peirse, command- er in chief of Bomber Command, flew Arnold and Quesada over Cambridge to look at German bomb damage and repeated to him substantially what Slessor had said—that daylight bombing was impos- sible. This was an astonishing statement coming from Peirse because he was considered one of Britain's foremost advocates of precision bomb- ing, a modus operandi that American air strategists were now accepting as sacred doctrine. Since Peirse’s appointment the previous € Ictober, his planes had been concentrating their attacks on two specific targets that had to be hit precisely if they were to be damaged at all—oil installations and invasion barges. But after a few daylight attempts they were now flying only at night, when precision was impossible, With their American planes they had received an American invention, the Sperry bombsight, and had tried it, but Peirse and his aides insisted it was useless because it required a more than-twenty-second straight course on the target ap- proach, with n
