Since Peirse’s appointment the previous ¢ Ictober, his planes had been concentrating their attacks on two specific targets that had to be hit precisely if they were to be damaged at all—oil installations and invasion barges. But after a few daylight attempts they were now flying only at night, when precision was impossible, With their American planes they had rec eived an American invention, the Sperry bombsight, and had tried it, but Peirse and his aides insisted it was useless because it required a more than-twenty-second straight course on the target ap- proach, with no evasion to escape antiaire raft fire.  Arnold was not convinced of the uselessness of the bombsight but decided he had better have the problem studied “I think the British  have much to learn about bombing,” he noted in his diary, “but who am Hence, the study as  1 to question two years of bombing in a real wa  soon as I get back.” On the eighteenth he had to borrow a dinner jac ket from Air Corps  Col.
