From the day they invaded China in 1931, the Japanese had been regarded by the United States as a potential enemy. The China cam- paign (still in progress ten years later); the notorious Axis Pact between  nt of Japan’s army  Japan, Germany, and Italy; the massive enlargem and navy; and the growing possibility that the Japanese might try to capture the oil fields of the Dutch East Indies made it imperative that the United States prepare contingency plans to stop them.
