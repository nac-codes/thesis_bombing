All four agreed that 1941, with war approaching, was not the time to separate the Air Corps from the Army. The Air Corps was simply unable to take responsibility at that point for all the peripheral services the Army was providing for it. But Arnold's vigorous campaign for an independent air force in the closing days of World War II and Marshall's active support of that campaign after the war indicate that the two men had agreed, perhaps as early as 1939, that this would be a desirable goal when the right time arrived During July of 1941 Andrews continued his efforts to bring Knert to Panama as a brigadier general, but Brett remained “obdurate in his opposition.” In a phone conversation between Andrews and Arnold on July Arnold said he had talked to  Knerr about the move (presumably at the June  Andrews again asked for Knerr  lunch) and felt  convinced that Knerr didn’t want to go.
