duty was approved, at which point a new snag developed: the Surgeon General rejected him on medical grounds. The reason: “It is not the policy of the War Department to place returned officers on active duty who have had mental or nervous conditions of such significance as to lead to retirement.”  Under the circumstances, the Surgeon General's judgment seemed unfair. Hugh Knerr’s subsequent service during World War I proved that it was an uninformed judgment. But meanwhile, throughout 1941, the decision kept Knerr off active duty  On September 24, 1941, Arnold wrote another memorandum, this time to Secretary Stimson, complaining once more that too many heavy bombers were going to England, especially in light of the fact that the British didn’t like America’s best heavy bomber, the B-17. He asked that medium and light bombers plus pursuit planes be sent to England because they would be more useful there, and that heavy bombers be kept at home to build an American strike force.

On June 5, he ran into Arnold at lunch in Washington. Arnold mentioned the letter from Andrews and asked Knerr if he did indeed want to return to duty. Knerr said he did. Then for some inexplicable reason he added, “as soon as war is declared.” Shortly thereafter, in a letter to Andrews, Brett, presumably under Arnold’s orders, said he couldn't make Knerr a brigadier general  While Andrews was trying “to find a way to get around” Brett, Knerr and Andrews exchanged letters that revealed some important currents of feeling within the Air Corps during the years of its struggle for expansion  On June 18, 1941, Knerr wrote to Andrews about his continuing campaign, waged in letters and magazine articles, for an independent air force. He felt he was making some progress, but “the biggest problem left is to devise a means that will ensure
