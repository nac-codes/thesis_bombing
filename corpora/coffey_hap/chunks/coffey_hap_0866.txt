re of autonomy, foreclosed the possibility of creating an indepen-  237 HAP  dent air force at that time, and virtually stilled the debate on the subject  Knerr, referring to the organizational change in a note to Andrews, said, “Arnold beat us to it.” He might better have said Arnold, Marshall, Lovett, and Stimson had beaten them to it. All four agreed that 1941  with war approaching, was not the time to separate the Air Corps from the Army. The Air Corps was simply unable to take responsibility at that point for all the peripheral services the Army was providing for it, But Arnold's vigorous campaign for an independent air force in the closing days of World War II and Marshall's active support of that campaign after the war indicate that the two men had agreed, perhaps as early as 1939, that this would be a desirable goal when the right time arrived.  During July of 1941 Andrews continued his efforts to bring Knerr to Panama as a brigadier general, but Brett remained “obdurate in his opposition.” In a phone conversation between Andrews and Arnold on July 27, Andrews again asked for Knerr. Arnold said he had talked to Knerr about the move (presumably at the June 5 lunch) and felt convinced that Knerr didn’t want to go. Arnold’s remark may not have been as disingenuous as it must have sounded, since he could easily have interpreted Knerr’s words “as soon as war is declared” to mean “not now.”  An assessment of all the available evidence indicates that Arnold, while admiring Knerr’s ability, had reason to feel less than warm toward him. He may very well have been dragging his feet about returning Knerr to active duty. But he had too much respect for Andrews to refuse the request when Andrews put it to him directly. In August, Knerr's recall to duty was approved, at which point a new snag developed: the Surgeon General rejected him on medical grounds. The reason: “It is not the policy of the War Department to place returned officers on active duty who have had mental
