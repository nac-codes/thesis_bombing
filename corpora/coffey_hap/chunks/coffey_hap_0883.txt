rom Washington, Arnold, with Gene Beebe as his pilot, flew first to Knoxville, where he inspected an aluminum plant Shortages of aluminum still seriously hindered the expansion of the aircraft industry. On the sixth, they arrived at Hamilton Field, north of San Francisco, where Arnold assembled the officers scheduled to fly the B-17s to the Philippines that night. The first leg of the journey would be to Hawaii; the early birds would arrive in the morning, the later ones about noon. Arnold wasn’t worried about that leg of their trip, but it seemed to him at least possible that by the time these men reached the South Pacific, Japan might have dec lared war. So he gave the crews a short talk, warning them that they might run into trouble might have to  use their guns “somewhere along the line” before they reached their  Thomas M.

Arnold believed, as did most American military men, that if the Japanese did launch a war, they would begin by attacking the Philippines. And he was still as woefully short of planes on the islands as he was every place else—he had a total of only twenty-six B-17s in the Philippines.
