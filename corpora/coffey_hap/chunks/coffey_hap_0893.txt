be sitting in tidy rows on the airfields when the Japanese attackers arrived. Arnold called the Philippine air commander, Gen. Lewis H. Brereton. He couldn't explain it either. He said they didn’t have enough airfields for dispersal. Arnold called the Hawaiian air commander, Gen, F. L. Martin. He said General Short had ordered the planes to be grouped tightly together on the ground so it would be easier to guard them against possible sabotage. The Japanese bombers had found this tight grouping delightfully convenient, Martin also said many of the air crewmen were being used for other purposes. Trained mechanics, for example, were assigned to military police and patrol duties,  None of this made any sense to Arnold. At home that night he found it difficult to explain the debacle to Bee because he still didn't understand it himself  Why weren't the planes dispersed, she wanted to know, Why weren't there more airfields in the Philippines?  “Because MacArthur wouldn't have them,” he said to her, “He  insisted that if we got an increase of squadrons and wi  the Army had to have the same increase, and Congress wouldn't go for it.”  The more hideous aspects of the situation were now bearing down upon Arnold, For three years he had been warning President Roosevelt that if too many planes were sent to England, the United States might end up without air power at a moment when it would be most sorely needed, That dire prediction had now come true. The Army Air Forces were facing a long, hazardous war with only 159 four-engine bombers on hand and a total of only 1100 planes that could even claim to be combatworthy. These included P-40 fighters that, as Arnold knew, were obsolescent and might soon be made obsolete by the Japanese Zero, In Hawaii and the Philippines, the two cornerstones of American Pacific defense, the Zero already had the better of the P-40. Of course, the Zeros had been airborne during the battles while most of the P-40s were on the ground—presumably the P-40
