that instead of sending Air Forces units, the Americans should simply send bombers, which could be immediately incorporated into the R.A.F. Though Arnold could see this as another move to siphon off American aircraft, thus further delaying the development of a real American air force, and though he had no intention of letting it happen, he refrained from arguing the issue at this meeting. Portal also said he thought it was the Navy’s job to attack Japan. This was a clear implication that whatever strength the Air Forces had to offer should be spent in the effort against Germany. Arnold didn't argue this issue either.

Though the admirals had consistently and stubbornly resisted the allocation of raw materials and factory space to heavy bombers rather than to warships, they could be expected to demand their share of these heavy bombers as soon as they realized how useful a big, long-range plane could be in attacking Japan  This first meeting between the British and Americans as wartime allies produced some generalized agreements on aims and strategies.
