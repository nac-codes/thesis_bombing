time with the Navy  The first of his serious Navy troubles in wartime began on February 14 when King formally asked him to allocate to the Navy four hundred B-24s and nine hundred B-25s (twir can “Mitchell” bombers) for submarine patrol. To Arnold it appeared that the admirals, after years of belittling and resisting the very idea of  engine, twin-tailed North Ameri-  an air force, had suddenly decided they wanted one, now that they were beginning to see what such a force would look like and how useful it could be.** He saw this innocent request as the Navy's first move toward the formation of a second American air force, which would duplicate the functions of the Army Air Forces. But these were beliefs he couldn't state flatly because he couldn't prove them. Nor could he deny that there was an acute need for long-range bombers to find and attack submarines; he had been preaching that doctrine for years. How then was he to foil this  attempted Navy raid on his still-small bomber force On February land-based planes had long been recognized as the Army's responst-  (1) that  he drafted a letter to King sayin  bility; (2) that the Army already had the personnel, facilities, bases, maintenance, and supply organizations to operate suc h planes; (3) that the Army also had pursuit planes designed to protect these bombers in and (4) that the Army, recognizing the  submarine menace, was willing to perform the antisub function itself,  flight and on the grounc  under Navy supervision if necessary. The principle had been estab- lished, he reminded King, that the mass of the nation’s air striking power should be under ‘one command. King’s request violated that principle since it would establish two separate air forces with all the attendant difficulties of coordination  On March 5, King wrote a surprisingly mild answer. Perhaps Arnold misunderstood the intended mission of these heavy bombers They were needed in northern climes because seaplanes didn’t work in icy seas. As to w
