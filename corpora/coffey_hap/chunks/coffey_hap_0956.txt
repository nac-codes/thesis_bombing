easy man to overcome. In time they would hear more from him on the subject of diversion to his Pacific theater. They would also hear more from Douglas MacArthur about diversion to his Pacific theater. MacArthur and King didn’t agree about many things—they assuredly did not agree about whose theater the Pacific was—but they were both certain that the Pacific was the primary theater in which to fight the war. And they were a hard pair to resist.  In the midst of the planning for Bolero and the efforts to satisfy the demands for air strength in so many theaters, Arnold held a 10:00 a.m. staff meeting one Sunday in early March to find out why he was receiving  conflicting reports about plane deliveries from factories to Air Forces  units.  One reason, as it turned out, was his own helter-skelter method of gathering information. He was constantly on the phone with manufac- turers or Air Forces people in the field, trying to find out for himself what was happening. It was perhaps a good way of keeping informed about certain things, but it was a poor method of compiling statistics. His hit-and-miss figures seldom agreed with those of his materiel division. And to complicate matters further, the two sets of figures weren't likely to agree even if they were both accurate because there were two ways to calculate aircraft deliveries  Ordinarily a plane was not put on the “accepted” list until it had been delivered in flying condition. But quite often a manufacturer would collect on his parking lot a backlog of planes, complete except for some part, possibly even as important as the engine, which was to be made and supplied by a second company. In many instances, it was not  only fair but necessary to consider these planes “accepted” so the  265 « HAP  manufacturer who had completed his job could be paid, and thus finance his future output  Though Arnold knew all this, he found it hard to accept the notion that at any given time he didn't know exactly how many airplanes he had
