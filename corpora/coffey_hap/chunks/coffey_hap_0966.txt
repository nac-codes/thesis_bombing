The need for technological and mechanical advances was so appar- ent as the early combat reports began arriving in Washington that Arnold decided to launch a new Air Forces proving ground under his direct control at Eglin Field, Florida. Though it might duplicate some of the work being done at Wright Field, he didn’t care because he was perpetually annoyed at the Wright Field engineers, They were always telling him why his ideas wouldn't work. He wanted an agency that would find out whether his ideas worked by trying them. He chose Gen. Grandison Gardner, a veteran of the materiel division, to  command the installation, and a few days after it opened he flew down  from Washington with Gene Beebe to try out one of his ideas—skip- bombing against enemy ships. It seemed to him that if a plane came in low and dropped its bomb into the water before reaching the ship, the bomb would skip or ricochet into the side of the ship, where it was most vulnerable  Gardner, after experimenting with the idea, decided it wasn’t quite  269 HAP  practical as Arnold had conceived it because the skipping dissipated the  impact of the bomb, But from Arnold's idea, the men at Eglin developed a similar technique that did increase the effectiveness of bombs against ships.*  With the inauguration of the Newfoundland—Greenland—Iceland air route to England and the construction
