Forces fields throughout the world, Whenever the Army took a new piece of territory, there was an immediate need for an air base on it. But most warplanes were now too heavy to land and take off safely on fields that, after a rain, could suddenly become quagmires, and the installation of paved runways was a lengthy process. Arnold and Reybold conceived the idea of pierced steel planks, about ten feet long and two feet w ide, which locked into each other to form a long steel carpet over a flat field.*  This steel carpet made an awesome racket when a plane landed on it or  took off from it. But it could be installed in two days and it was an  effective substitute for a paved runway  In early March, responding to President Roosevelt's insistence “that japan proper, in the form Arnold called in Jimmy  we find ways and means of carrying home to J;  of a bombing raid, the real meaning of war,’ Doolittle and told him to select a plane that “would go 2000 miles carrying 2000 pounds of bombs and take off short.” The plan, Arnold said, was to bomb Tokyo with planes that would take off from a Navy carrier and then fly across Japan to land at an American base in China,  After Doolittle had spent some time and thought on the project and had selected the B-25 as the best plane for it, he went into Arnold's office one day and said, “I know more about this mission, I know more about the aircraft, I know more about the crews than anyone else. I would like to lead it.”  Arnold said, “I need you badly here, Jimmy. I'd rather see you stay on my staff.”  Doolittle did not conceal his disappointment. Finally Arnold said, “Well, I'll tell you what. If it’s all right with Miff [Harmon], it’s all right with me,”  Doolittle saluted, ran as fast as he could to the chief of air staff ‘s  Thomas M.
