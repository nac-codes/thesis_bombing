rk. He wanted an agency that would find out whether his ideas worked by trying them. He chose Gen. Grandison Gardner, a veteran of the materiel division, to command the installation, and a few days after it opened he flew down from Washington with Gene Beebe to try out one of his ideas—skip- bombing against enemy ships. It seemed to him that if a plane came in low and dropped its bomb into the water before reaching the ship, the bomb would skip or ricochet into the side of the ship, where it was most vulnerable  Gardner, after experimenting with the idea, decided it wasn’t quite  269 HAP  practical as Arnold had conceived it because the skipping dissipated the  impact of the bomb, But from Arnold's idea, the men at Eglin developed  a similar technique that did increase the effectiveness of bombs against ships.*  With the inauguration of the Newfoundland-Greenland-Iceland air route to England and the construction of bases in those frigid loca- tions, Arnold felt the need to prepare the men who would be stationed there, Asa result, Eglin Field established the “Arctic, Desert and Trop- ic information Center,” which became a permanent Air Forces school.  Another Arnold idea, which he developed with Gen. Gene Reybold, chief of the Army Engineers, soon proved useful at new Air Forces fields throughout the world, Whenever the Army took a new piece of territory, there was an immediate need for an air base on it. But most warplanes were now too heavy to land and take off safely on fields that, after a rain, could suddenly become quagmires, and the installation of paved runways was a lengthy process. Arnold and Reybold conceived the idea of pierced steel planks, about ten feet long and two feet wide, which locked into each other to form a long steel carpet over a flat field.* This steel carpet made an awesome racket when a plane landed on it or took off from it, But it could be installed in two days and it was an  effective substitute for a paved runway  “that  In early March
