Gen Millard F. “Miff” Harmon, to command it. (He replaced Harmon with the obscure but efficient Maj. Gen. George E. Stratemeyer.) Time after time, Arnold had told his personal pilot, Col. Eugene Beebe, about his disappointment at having to spend the entire First World War in Washington. He was determined that in this war the outstanding men around him would see action, even if it meant recurrent disruption of his own staff. Eaker, Spaatz, Hunter, Harmon, Kenney, and others already overseas were the vanguard of a long parade of Arnold associates he would send to combat theaters  One day in June, he said to Beebe, who had been hinting subtly that he would like overseas duty, “You can go now, but find me somebody who can take over the flying part of your job.”**  After choosing an ideal replacement—Capt.
