uraging news. Arnold, who had visited the Ford plant himself on July 31, was not surprised. He was more than ever convinced that auto companies didn't know how to make aircraft. And he had also become ambivalent about the B-24. He told Lindbergh the combat squadrons greatly preferred the B-17. “When we send 17s out on a mission, most of them return. But when we send the 24s out, a good many of them don’t.”** The B-24, with its small-surface but aero- dynamically efficient Davis wing, could fly faster and carry a heavier load than the B-17, but when something went wrong, it also dropped faster because it lacked the advantage of the B-17's larger, kitelike wing  surface.  In the spring and summer of 1942, Arnold realized that an enormous need had arisen for quick transportation of men and supplies to war theaters throughout the world and that he had to do something about it. His response was to create what soon became the largest airline the world had ever seen—the Air Transport Command.  At that time, the Ferry Command was already “in business,” flying  combat planes and some personnel, first to England, then to all theaters  281 * HAP  outside the Western Hemisphere. And the Air Service Command was “in business,” flying mostly supplies and equipment to such places as Iceland, Greenland, and the Caribbean, But there was so much duplica- tion of work and the two agencies got along so poorly with each other that Arnold decided to consolidate them, by stages, into one large military airline  To command the operation he appointed a man of proven ability,  Col. Harold George  and at the end of April he made him a brigadier  general. But George's experience was largely as a pilot and a military planner. He had flown one of Billy Mitchell's bombers that sank the German battleship Ostfriesland in 1921; and both at Maxwell Field and in Washington he had been a leader in the development of the Air Forces’ basic war strategy. He had never run an airline and he needed help from
