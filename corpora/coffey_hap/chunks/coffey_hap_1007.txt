Whenever they needed a directive  pold’s  to get something done, Arnold would give it to them, But Ar cooperation arose not only from his realization of the need for military transport but from his long-time vision of aviation as a means of mass transport, He had often spoken to his sons about the days to come when air travel would be as common asa bus ride, By developing the A.T,C into a worldwide airline, he was pointing in that direction, creating a model for today’s great worldwide airlines systems, And he was soon pleased with the two men he had chosen to run it.
