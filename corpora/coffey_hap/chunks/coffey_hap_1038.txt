e entire trip. Though Kenney had been in Australia only a month, after replacing Brett, he assured Arnold he was having no trouble with MacArthur now, and didn’t intend to have any (As Arnold later learned, Kenney had already amazed MacArthur by airlifting a whole brigade of troops to Port Moresby, on his own initiative, when the Japanese threatened the airfields there.) “We're going to win it out here,” he said, “and I'm going to get along with General MacArthur.”  Arnold’s half hour alone with Kenney pleased him more than the  two hours he spent with the histrionic supreme commander of the  289 * HAP  Southwest Pac What MacArthur said that day, as reported in Arnold’s diary, does not make him seem, in retrospect, as astute as he was reputed to be. The Japanese, he declared, were better fighting men than the Germans. He didn’t have enough troops to hold them. The  Australians were not even good militiamen. The Japanese could take  New Guinea and the Fijis any time they pleased, after which they would control the Pacific for a hundred years. And their move into the Aleutians was part of an eventual move into Siberia. As for the European war, no second front could be established from England because it would be impossible to build enough bases to provide air cover. And any move into North Africa was a waste of effort,  With this last assessment, at least, Arnold could agree. He wasn't completely surprised at the other extraordinary attitudes because Delos Emmons, now the Hawaiian air commander, had recently visited Mac- Arthur and had reported some views of his that were even more outlandish. The Japanese, MacArthur had told Emmons, would take the ew Guinea, Hawaii, then South America. And the  Solomons, Fiji, United States was in greater danger of invasion by them than by the  Germans because the U.S. Navy couldn't stop the Japanese.  Arnold in his diary did not comment on MacArthur's predictions, most of which must have seemed insupportable even in those difficult
