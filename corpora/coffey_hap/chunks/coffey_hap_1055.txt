e Lancasters; and that they still wanted the Eighth Air Force to begin nighttime rather than daytime bombing. But he was convinced they would change their minds about both the B-17 and day bombing once the African campaign was over and the Fortress fleet in England could be built to its intended strength. Arnold had never envisioned the Eighth Air Force attacking targets in  Tmany with a force as small as it now had in England. He had hoped by now to have several hundred B-17s over Europe, but the diversion of planes to the Pacific, and to Churchill's own Torch operation, had kept the size of the Eighth Air Force down to less than one hundred heavy bombers.' The  whole concept of daylight precision bombing depended upon fleets so  295 » HAP  large and with so much fire power and bomb power that enemy defenses would be unable to cope with them. In his view, the daylight bombing theory hadn't yet been tested because he hadn't yet been able to send over enough planes to try it properly.

Tom Hardin of the A-T.C. were waiting to greet them. Smith was in Africa because Arnold had  learned, in early December 1942, that the Navy planned to develop an air transport service, which, in effect, would duplicate the A.T.C.? A day or so later, Arnold met Smith in the Munitions Building corridor and said, “I want to see you.”  They went into Arnold’s office where he said, “We've got to do something about Dakar.” With North Africa under Allied control, the West African port of Dakar assumed great importance as a landing place for transatlantic cargo and passenger planes. “I understand there's four hundred thousand tons of shipping in the harbor and they've got a railroad and an airport. You'd better go over there and take them over.”  “Suits me,” Smith said. “  “I won't give you a letter, :  ve me a letter.”  " Ar
