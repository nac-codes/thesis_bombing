Far from dropping bombs on Germany, American daylight bombers have not ventured beyond Lille  anwhile, the American public has been led to believe that a really serious contribution has been made by the American Air Force  Addressing himself in this memo to the American daylight bombing methods, Churchill Wrote  Considering the American professional interests and high reputa- tions which are engaged in this scheme, and the shock it the American people and to the Admini  ild be to ration if the policy proved a glaring failure, we must expect most obstinate perserverance in this method  And in a January 10, 1943, memorandum to Sir Archibald Sinclair, the secretary of state for air, who also had reservations about the American air effort but was now trying to soften the prime minister's criticisms, Churchill wrote  I have never suggested that they [the Americans] should be “dis- couraged” by us, that is to say, that we should argue against their policy, but only that they should not be encouraged to persist  obstinately and also that they should be actively urged to become  capable of night bombing  Arnold did not know about these harsh assessments Churchill had been making privately of the American air effort in England.
