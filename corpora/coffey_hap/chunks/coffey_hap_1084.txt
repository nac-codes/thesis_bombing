From Chennault he got a clear picture of the air situation in China “but to my astonishment, in spite of his Air Corps and Tactical School training, he was not realistic about the logistics of his operation.”  The next day, after a fight to Chungking and a chair ride up a steep stairway to a mansion which Stilwell called “the Peanut’s Berchtesga- den,” Arnold met Chiang Kai-shek for the first time.’ During their almost three-hour luncheon talk, Chiang kept hammering on the same theme. He didn't like the present setup. He wanted Chennault to command all air forces in China, independent of Stilwell and Bissell. Chennault was the one outstanding air tactician in the Far East. Someone else could handle his administrative work for him if he took command  Chiang also wanted a firm commitment for five hundred more U.S. planes, And he didn't care to talk about logistics. It seemed to Arnold he “wanted to build up the Chinese Air Force in numbers, regardless of whether or not there was gasoline for the planes to use.”  Later that afternoon, at a larger conference, Sir John Dill presented the Combined Chiefs’ plan for the reconquest of Burma. Chiang didn’t seem interested  The next morning, Sunday, February 7, Chiang wanted to see Arnold alone.

If, as the Combined Chiefs said, they considered China impor- tant, why didn’t they send
