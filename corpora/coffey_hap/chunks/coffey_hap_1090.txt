He decided to detour and land there, just to see how the boys were doing, to make sure they didn't feel forgotten at this remote outpost. When Peterson set down their B-17, the desert wind was blowing clouds of fine sand, but the commanding officer, a nonflying lieutenant named Pike, was right there to greet them.* He had about twenty men living in tents and eating at an improvised mess hall.
