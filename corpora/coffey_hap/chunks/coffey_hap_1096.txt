some shopping. (By the time she was through shopping, the A.T.C., at the prodding of the State Department, had to provide a four-engine C-54 cargo plane to carry all of her luxuries back to China for her.)'' When Arnold returned home from New York, he was exhausted, but he wasn’t ready to admit it. He had already slipped back into his seven-day-week routine. Early in the afternoon of Sunday, February 28, he went to the White House for a discussion of his China trip with the president. Marshall was also there, as were Sir John Dill and General Somervell. After the meeting, in midafternoon, Arnold went home to Fort Myer for a rest. Bee was there, with David, which should have been comforting to him but was not; the fact that he and Bee now saw so little of each other had raised barriers between them which made it more difficult for them to get along when they did see each other,  Arnold had been home only a short time when he complained of  chest pains.'* Bee became concerned, but when she tried to talk to him  about it, he was uncommunicative. As his condition apparently wors-  305 = HAP  ened, she became alarmed and, without his consent, called the post medical officer of the day, Dr. Lee B. Martin, a young captain, who came immediately.  When the doctor arrived, Arnold did not welcome him. He was not sick, he said.  Mrs. Arnold insisted he was sick. “He's very stubborn,” she said to the doctor, “I can’t do anything with him.”  Martin perceived quickly that the two were not getting along well. Arnold seemed reluctant even to speak to his wife. He obviously hadn't wanted her to call the doctor. Perhaps he realized that a serious illness on his medical record might force his retirement. He was reluctant also to speak to the doctor, but Martin examined him anyway.  Had there been any incident that preceded the onset of the chest pains, Martin asked.  He had been at the White House that afternoon, Arnold said, and yes, he had been involved in a rather heated argument.
