ed, he rushed the production of P-51s with his customary urgency.  (The P-51s did not arrive in England quickly enough, however, to alleviate the pain of the second Schweinfurt mission{ Within two weeks after Arnold returned to Washington, he was again becoming impatient for more action against Germany. On September 7, 9, 15, 16, 23, and 26, Eaker’s Fortress fleet, not yet recovered from the battering at Stuttgart and hampered by more bad weather over Germany, hit targets in France, but never with more than $00 planes. Arnold couldn't under- stand this, He had sent almost a thousand B-17s to England. Why was Eaker dispatching only 300 at a time: ‘To us here in the United States,” he wrote to Eaker September 20, 1943, “it looks as if the employment of large numbers of heavy bombers has not been followed through by your . Since my visit to England the impression in  headquarters and staff my mind is that you still figure on employing small numbers of 300 or maybe 400 at a tim Despite Eaker’s explanations, Arnold seemed unable to accept the fact that so many of the bombers he had sent to  Europe were lost or damaged beyond repair.  Eaker on September 27 sent his Fortresses back to Germany in the hope of bombing Emden by radar through an overcast, but only 305 bombers could make the trip and the results were indifferent.

What are your views as to  the possibility of using your entire force during the bad weather now approaching for bombing within as well as on top of the over- cast?”  Another message said: “When North African fighter groups escort bombers it is a matter of h
