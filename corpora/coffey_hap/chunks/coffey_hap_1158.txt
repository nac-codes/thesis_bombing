On the fourteenth, he sent 291 Fortresses back to Schweinfurt. Those bombers soon found themselves up against several hundred German fighters in what still ranks as the most horrendous air battle of all time. Despite constant attacks from every angle, the B-17s flew across Germany and inflicted even more damage on the Schweinfurt ball-bearing plants than they had done in August. But again 60 Fortresses failed to return home. These 60, added to the 100 lost since October 4, represented a depletion of Eaker’s force that he could not afford  Arnold, expecting an adverse reaction in Washington, sent Eaker an extraordinary cable the next morning. Apparently forgetting the cable  he had sent four days earlier, which described the German fighter forces as “still-growing,” he now wrote:  It appears from my viewpoint that the German Air Force is on the verge of collapse. ,..We must not (repeat) must not symptoms of impending German collapse substantial evidence of collapse?  miss any Can you add any  In view of what the German air force had done to the B-17s at Schweinfurt the previous day, Eaker was hard put to supply any such optimistic evidence.
