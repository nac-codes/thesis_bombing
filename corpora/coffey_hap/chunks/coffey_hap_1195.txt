In late January, he wrote to Spaatz: not too far distant, send out a big number—and I mean a big  can’t we, some day and  number—of bombers to hit something in the nature of an aircraft factory and lay it flat?”*  The Eighth Air Force had expanded so rapidly in recent months that on February 20, Spaatz and Doolittle were able to send out more than a thousand heavy bombers—a far cry from the 300 or so Eaker had ious year. On that  been able to put together for his biggest raids the pr day, Spaatz and Doolittle from England, followed by Eaker in the Mediterranean, began a concentrated six-day assault, which the newspa- pers at the time called “the Big Week.” They sent over Germany an average of almost a thousand bombers a day during that week, escorted by 17 fighter groups, many of them flying P-51s. The losses were heavy—226 bombers and 28 fighters—but not prohibitive for such a large force: roughly six percent compared to the 20 percent Eaker had often lost the previous year, when he was forced to send his bombers unescorted. And aerial photos showed that the damage, especially to German aircraft factories, had been enormous.
