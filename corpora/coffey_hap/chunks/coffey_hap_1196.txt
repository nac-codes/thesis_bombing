now  Thomas M. Coffey $36,  general (after a B-17 crash that almost took his life), was in charge of training, and he had embarked on a plan to prepare 452 crews. But with so few B-29s in which to train anyone, he had managed to check out only sixty-seven first pilots by the beginning of 1944.*  At the Cairo Conference, after Chiang Kai-shek agreed to build B-29 bases in time for their expected April 15 arrival (two months before they were scheduled to go into combat), Arnold thought he had at least taken care of that aspect of the operation. But on his return home, he learned from his own sources in China that Chiang, while acknowledging his promise, couldn’t get excited about the time element involved, The days were passing and no one in China was recruiting coolies to work on the runways, which would have to be built entirely by hand labor.* Someone would have to go over there and get things moving. The logical choice for the task was K. B. Wolfe, who now knew more about the needs of B-29s than anyone else. So Arnold sent him But unfortunately, Wolfe was also needed in Kansas, where the new B-29s were being prepared for operations and the crews were being trained.  Arnold must have been getting tired of the very mention of B-29s when, one day in January, Rosie O'Donnell, now chief of Arnold's council, came in and told him he wanted to fly one of them.
