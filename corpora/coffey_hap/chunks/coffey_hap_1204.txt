they were  In late February, Arnold received separate letters from Stilwell and Stratemeyer in the China-Burma-India theater expressing doubts about the plan to bomb Japan with B-29s from bases in China. Arnold, in a February 28 memo to Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg of his staff, said, “Both of these letters are on the ‘can’t be done’ side, and I am not ready to accept either one. I cannot see my way clear to send these B-29s out there to carry ona series of bombardment operations against Hongkong, Formo- sa, Indochina and Siam, as B-24s can perform these missions. The B-29s are built for long-range missions and our plans should be prepared accordingly ‘o  Yet he himself was beginning to wonder at this time whether the B-29 would ever be able to do the job for which it was designed. “It is highly possible and maybe even probable,” he concluded in the memo to Vandenberg, “that we are expecting too much from these operations.”  Thomas M.

Arnold’s immedi-  ate suggestion to Giles was cosmetic but shockingly unsubstantial  a. Double the number of crews but retain the same number of operating missions so that the attrition will be distributed over double the number of people  b. Increase the number of airplanes so that we will always have a standard number of about 250 in operation and in that way our losses will not become so noticeable.'®  If Arnold had done no more than make this suggestion, his solution to the problem would have deserved a high place in the annals of cynicism. But in fact, he was simply proposing a stopgap measure. To find a more substantial remedy, he immediat
