not go very well any more,” he noted in his diary. The house in which he was ensconced, sitting on two hundred manicured acres, had been built by Henry VIII  as a hunting lodge.**  Arnold didn’t spend much time there. He was up at 7:30 the next morning and off to Eisenhower's headquarters for a briefing on the ted. He found Ike “very optimistic” and was pleased to hear from Ike's staff that the German Air Force over Normandy was “not so hot.” He had doubted British intelligence reports that indicated German air strength was still formidable. Now he learned that no German planes had tried to bomb the ships concentrated in ports in the south of England before the invasion, or to hit the invasion forces during the Channel crossing, or to attack the congested beachhead after the landings. To Arnold this was the ultimate proof that American daylight operations had been effective. The Germans were short of planes because the B-17s had knoc ked out their aircraft factories and, with the help of the long-range fighters, had shot down the bulk of their fighter force.  On the tenth, the Gombined Chiefs of Staff met in the cabinet wat office and, after discussing the invasion progress, turned their attention to the Pacific war. The British wanted to know how they could help. Then the question arose as to why MacArthur should be allowed to pursue his personally satisfying plan to invade the Philippines. Why not bypass the Philippines and move directly toward Japan or Formosa’ Admiral King, speaking for the Navy, argued for this Central Pacific course of action, and Arnold agreed with him because the Air Forces ) strikes against Japan. Until such island  invasion, which was progressing as well as had been ext  would need bases for their B- bases were available, he would pursue his intention of hitting Japan from China, but if he could establish bases on Saipan, Tinian, or Guam, for instance, he would eliminate the almost insurmountable supply problem  Thomas M.
