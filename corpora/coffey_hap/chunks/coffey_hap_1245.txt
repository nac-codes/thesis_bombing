In September, he again hired California Institute of Technology scientist Dr. Theodor von Karman, this time to head a committee that would work out some answers to long-range problems, He made it ¢ lear to von Karman that he didn’t want the Air Forces ever again to be caught unprepared, as it had been in 1939 and 1940.  “We have won this war,” he told von Karman, “and | am no longer interested in it. I do not think we should spend time debating whether we obtained the victory by sheer power or by some qualitative superiori- ty. Only one thing should concern us. What is the future of air power and aerial warfare? What is the bearing of the new inventions such as jet propulsion, rockets, radar and other electronic devices?  The jet fighter plane, plans for which he had brought back from England early in the war, had been manufactured by Bell Aircraft and  was now undergoing extensive testing. It was America’s first jet airplane. Arnold had also directed Gen. Grandison Gardner at the Eglin Field, Florida, proving grounds to build a prototype
