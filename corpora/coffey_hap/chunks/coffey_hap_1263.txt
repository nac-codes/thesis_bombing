The purpose of this cruise was to find out if the 21st was ready for the more arduous trip from Saipan to Tokyo. Hansell discovered it was not quite ready.

On October 12, the vanguard of O'Donnell’s 73rd Wing took off for Saipan. On landing they found a morass of disorgani- zation.

The first thing he did, as LeMay recalled, was to give us hell for taking so long to get there.” Saunders survived, after months of surgery, but his combat career was at an end, and his removal to hospital deprived LeMay of an important source of advice about B-29 problems in China and India  Fortunately, the plane itself was now showing signs of improvement. A new baffling system had cut down the excessive engine heat, and several less critical bugs had been eliminated, especially in the latest models, But LeMay still had some big decisions to make about the operation and he didn’t have much time to make them.
