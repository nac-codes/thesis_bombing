Gen, Barney Giles, was let in on the secret  One morning, Arnold called Giles into his office and said, “We're going to meet with General Marshall.”  When they entered Marshall's office, Marshall dismissed his secre- tary and an aide who happened to be there. Then he carefully closed all the doors and turned to his visitors.  “Giles,” he said, “we're going to let you in on a very close-top-secret project  But first Giles had to raise his hand and take an oath that he would not divulge anything said in that room, or ever discuss anything about the project, except to people who were connected with it.
