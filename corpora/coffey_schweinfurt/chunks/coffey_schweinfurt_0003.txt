minds of a small group of Army Air Forces officers. They had at their disposal only about 50 heavy bombers that they could certify as battle-worthy, and even these would need modifica- tions before they were actually ready to face the experienced German fighter pilots awaiting them in the skies over Europe.  The most advanced American heavy bomber, the Boeing B-17— known as the Flying Fortress—had been in production since 1935. But a shortage of funds, and other limitations placed upon its de- velopment, had prevented the B-17 from approaching its potential as a weapon. Indeed, the British, after trying it out against the Germans, had pronounced it woefully inadequate. This was the plane on which American Air Force strategists depended to prove the validity of their concept of aerial warfare. It was the plane on which they had to depend because there was no other. The newer North American B-24 Liberator was even less advanced in its development.  While the worth of America’s best bomber was questionable in December, 1941, the worth of the American Air Forces’s strategic  concept was considerably more so. The Americans, having equipped the B-17 with as many as ten 50-caliber machine guns, plus the new and remarkably accurate Norden bomb sight, intended to attack precisely defined German military and industrial targets in broad daylight. The British, who had defeated German attempts to bomb England in daylight, and who had failed in their own daylight mis- sions against the continent, were appalled at the American intention to try the same strategy. But they had been unable to persuade the Americans to follow their example and prepare for night bombing of German cities.  The A.A.F. and the R.A.F. were at an impasse over this critically important question of strategy when, on February 22, 1942, Brig Gen. Ira C. Eaker arrived in England with a pathetically small staff of six to launch the newly created 8th Air Force Bomber Command Eighteen months later, on August 17, 1
