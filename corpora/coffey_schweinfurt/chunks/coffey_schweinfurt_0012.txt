ry fuel tanks to extend the operating radius of the P-47s.! But only a few such tanks had been made available, and they were less than satisfactory  Today, August 17, 1943, these seven groups of Fortresses, under the command of Col. Curtis E. LeMay, were on their way to attack the Messerschmitt factory at Regensburg, sixty miles southeast of Nuremberg. This mission was part of the biggest bombing operation in the history of the American Army Air Forces and the deepest penetration of Germany since the United States had entered World War II. The Regensburg aspect of this operation was a sizable and significant undertaking in itself. The target was worthy: as a briefing officer had pointed Out before takeoff, the Regensburg Mes- serschmitt plant was then turning out two hundred of the deadly ME- 109s each month, nearly 30 percent of Germany’s single-engine fighter production. If the mission developed as planned, LeMay’s force, after attacking this installation, would not fly directly back to England but south to Africa in a shuttle experiment designed to show Hitler that almost all of his *‘Fortress Europe’’ was vulnerable to 8th Air Force bombs  Perhaps even more significant was the function of LeMay’s force today as a decoy. The men who planned this operation hoped that the planes of the Fourth Bombardment Wing would lure most of the German fighters to the Regensburg area so that an even larger force scheduled to take off nine minutes later, 230 B-17s of the First Bombardment Wing, could slip through the German defenses. The objective of the larger force was to attack one of the most crucial targets in Europe: five ball-bearing factories clustered around the railroad yards in the Bavarian town of Schweinfurt, where almost two-thirds of Germany’s ball and roller bearings were manufactured. If these plants could be destroyed, most of Germany’s war industries would soon be paralyzed because without bearings, no airplanes, trucks, trains, tanks, ships, or submarines, no
