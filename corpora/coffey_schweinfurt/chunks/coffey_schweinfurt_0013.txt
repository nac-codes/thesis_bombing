were manufactured. If these plants could be destroyed, most of Germany’s war industries would soon be paralyzed because without bearings, no airplanes, trucks, trains, tanks, ships, or submarines, no artillery gun emplace- ments, no precision machinery of any kind could be produced. Both British and American war planners believed that the destruction of the Schweinfurt factories, if it could be accomplished, would be disastrous to Germany.  As LeMay’s decoy armada approached the islands of Zeeland on the southwest coast of Holland, he already knew that this Schweinfurt force had been delayed in takeoff by the bad weather, and he was annoyed at its tardiness. His own planes had managed to get off the ground. It was true that the morning fog had been even more dense inland where most of the First Bombardment Wing groups were based than near the coast where LeMay’s groups were based, but that explanation did not satisfy him  Expecting no favors from the English weather, LeMay had made his crews practice instrument takeoffs, and he credited this training for the fact that his wing was en route to its target while the Schwein- furt force might, for all he knew, be still on the ground, as in fact it was. LeMay later declared that if the First Bombardment Wing ‘‘had been concentrating on the same sort of bad-weather instrument- takeoff procedure which we had been developing for a solid month, they might have been able to get off the ground as we did.’’? But that morning over the Channel he had other concerns. First of all he wanted to know what had happened to the two groups of P-47s that were supposed to overtake and protect his force, at least for the first hundred miles or so into the continent  Riding as a copilot in the lead plane of his armada (a 96th Group B-17 piloted by Capt. Thomas F. Kenny), he looked back in vain, and perhaps in some anger, for the Thunderbolts, or *‘Jugs,”’ that should have been cruising 5,000 or 6,000 feet above and behind him. LeMay was not
