ad chosen’ the 100th because its commander, Col. Neil B. Harding, was an old friend. When LeMay tried to convince him he should go with one of the other groups, Lay had insisted on the 100th. Though LeMay had finally agreed, Lay realized now why the Wing commander had been so reluctant. The 100th, flying at the absolute rear of the armada and at the lowest altitude (17,000 feet), would be the most vulnerable both to flak and to fighter attack.  When the twenty-one planes of the 100th Group crossed the Dutch coastline at 10:08, they were ‘‘tucked in’’ as close as possible to the twenty-one planes of the 95th Group (led by Col. John K. Gerhart), which was at the front of the Third Combat Wing. Colonel Lay’s B-17, named Piccadilly Lily, led the very last element of the 100th. He found himself remembering ‘‘just a little affectionately’’ the headquarters desk he had forsaken when he applied to General Eaker for combat duty.  Nine minutes into the continent, as the task force passed the small town of Woensdrecht, the first few cloudlike puffs of antiaircraft fire burst harmlessly at some distance from the nearest plane. (Flak bursts looked so much like puff clouds that one rookie bombardier, after his first mission, had said his bomb pattern would have been better were it not for those turbulent little clouds above the target.) About eight minutes later, over Diest, someone on the interplane VHF radio, probably a gunner in one of the lead planes, called out, ‘‘Fighters at two o'clock low!’’ (Under the clock-face system of designating direction, ‘‘twelve o’clock’’ means straight ahead; ‘‘six o’clock,’’  5  straight behind. ‘*Two o’clock”’ signifies ahead and sixty degrees to the right.)  When Colonel Lay saw these fighters, two of them, climbing above the horizon, he entertained the momentary hope that they might be from one of the two P-47 groups he had expected but hadn’t yet seen. Before he could take much comfort from this hope, the two planes sped through the Second
