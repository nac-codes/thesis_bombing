slowly by clusters of parachutes, German yellow mingled with the American white. He became aware of all the uncomfortable things happening to him. His mouth was going dry; his stomach seemed to be freezing up; he felt as if his buttocks were biting holes in his parachute. And at moments he wasn’t sure he was capable of moving. He wished he were flying the plane because he knew that would give him a function on which to concentrate and thus bring him a measure of relief from the horror of watching the guns of the fighters flying straight at him. Murphy, perhaps sensing his discomfort, turned the controls over to him. The fear became more bearable now, even though Lay was certain he would soon be dead.  As the besieged B-17s droned steadily deeper into Germany at their 160-mile-per-hour cruising speed, the enemy strategy became  8  that the tanks themselves, made of pressed paper, were too easily broken. The pilots had an even more serious complaint. They re- ported that with as little as seventy-five or a hundred extra gallons of fuel in this kind of belly tank, the P-47 couldn’t climb above 20,000 feet. A better auxiliary tank would have to be found before American fighters could accompany the B-17s on long-range missions into Germany. Until then, the Flying Fortresses would have to continue going alone, as they were doing today, with only their own machine guns to protect them.  Zemke’s group, during its short sojourn with the bombers, spotted fifteen to thirty enemy aircraft and got close enough for an ‘‘inconclu- sive engagement”’ near Hasselt, ten miles from the Belgian-German border, but could claim no kills. By this time the Germans had already developed the intelligent strategy of waiting until after the American fighters had been forced to turn back before attacking the bombers. Today the pilots in Zemke’s group observed that the enemy “‘appeared unwilling to mix it’’ with them, staying ‘‘either below the bombers or well to the side.’’ Other reports indicat
