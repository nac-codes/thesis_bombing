By the time the B-17s turned for home, the fighters that had met them on the way in would be refueled, rearmed, and ready to hit them on the way out  It was this new strategy that had given rise to the gloomy joke among the bomber crews that they were escorted all the way. Until today, the joke had been an exaggeration. Today it appeared to be an understatement.  At his headquarters in Bushy Park, fifteen miles southwest of London, Gen.
