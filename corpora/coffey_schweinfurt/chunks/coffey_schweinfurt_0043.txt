These were the kinds of fear with which he had to cope today after putting into motion what was conceived as the biggest single mission in the history of the U.S. Army Air Force.  It would be easier for him if he were in the cockpit of one of those bombers ready to take off for Schweinfurt. Then he could do more than sit helplessly at his desk awaiting reports from his bomber commander (Brig. Gen. Fred L. Anderson), wondering if the Re- gensburg diversionary strategy was doomed by the weather, wonder- ing if LeMay’s force should have been recalled instead of being sent on alone, wondering if the Schweinfurt planes would ever get off the ground, if the big mission against Germany’s vital ball-bearing factories, planned since the previous autumn and already postponed once, would have to be postponed again.

As the great air battle between LeMay’s Flying Fortresses and the German fighters moved across the skies of west Germany, the odds against the Fortresses seemed to lengthen.
