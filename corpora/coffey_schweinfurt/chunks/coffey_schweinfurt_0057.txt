crashed through the roof and cut rudder cables. The fifth hit the No. 3 engine, which immediately died, then burst into flames.  The crew of the Phartzac needed no more convincing. They were almost unanimously certain that the only place this riddled airplane could now take them was straight into the ground. In their opinion, the time had come to abandon it, and they began offering this opinion to the pilot on the intercom.  Cleven knew these men only casually. They were not his crew. (As squadron commander he didn’t have a crew of his own. When he went on a mission, he chose a plane, moved its pilot into the copilot seat and sent the copilot to the navigator’s compartment where he could fire one of the guns.) This crew had completed about a dozen missions as a unit and they were considered a good team. But they had never seen anything like what they were seeing today. Even before the shells had begun exploding among them, the action around them had tightened their nerves. Now, their plane was all but torn apart, with gaping holes in the front and sides letting in 35-below- zero air at 160 miles per hour. One engine was on fire. The electrical system was so badly damaged it could go out at any moment. The rudder pedals were useless. And in the radio compartment, one of their men, Smith, who was married just before the group left the States and whose wife expected a baby at Christmas time, had lost so much blood from the stumps of his shorn-off legs that there was no hope of saving his life  Under these circumstances, the desire of the crew to bail out seemed justified, and one might have expected their pilot to agree.

He simply never consciously experi- enced it. Being killed, or even shot down, was something that might happen, but he didn’t really believe it would happen to him. So he gave it very little
