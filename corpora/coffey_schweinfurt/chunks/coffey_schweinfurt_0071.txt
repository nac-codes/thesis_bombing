oup to fly it  The B-17 had grown directly out of the American concept of strategic daylight precision bombing. By the early thirties, Army Air Corps planners realized that, to make such a concept work, they would need the toughest, best armed, longest ranging, and most complicated warplane ever devised. In 1934 they had granted the Boeing Aircraft Company a contract to develop such a plane, and the graceful, four-engine Flying Fortress of 1943 was the direct descen- dant of the bomber Boeing undertook to design. But in nine years, so many changes had been made in it that only the 104-foot wing span remained the same.  The original length of 68 feet had been stretched to 74, and the original height of 18 feet had been raised to 19 with the addition of a long, gradually rising tail section that included a rear gunnerâ€™s com- partment below the rudder. This sleek, modern, and very distinctive tail, however, was only the most obvious of the changes the Flying Fortress had undergone during its development. The original Boeing Model 299 had four 750-horsepower engines, a speed of 230 miles per hour at 14,000 feet, a ceiling of 28,000 feet, a range of 2,100 miles, an empty weight of 12 tons, and a fully loaded weight of 21 tons. It carried five .30-caliber machine guns. The B-17F, in which General Williams and most of his men were waiting to take off today (a few crews were in B-17Es), had four 1 ,200-horsepower engines, a speed of 325 miles per hour (maximum) at 25,000 feet, a ceiling of  25  37,500 feet, a range of 4,420 miles empty (2,000 miles with two tons of bombs), a weight empty of 17!/2 tons, and fully loaded of 241/2 tons.3 It carried nine .50-caliber machine guns plus one .30-caliber.  By 1943 standards it was a giant of the sky. It was equipped with the recently developed Norden bomb-sight that under ideal condi- tions, and without harassment, made it possible to lay a bomb precisely on target from 30,000 feet. It also carried the most ad- vanced radar equipmen
