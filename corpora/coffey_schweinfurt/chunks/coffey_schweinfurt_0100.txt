instance, and three-fourths of its ball-bearing production. But because of demands for aircraft in other American theaters of operation, Eaker had re- ceived in mid-August fewer than 800 B-17s. He had been stripped of four of his groups because they were needed to support the invasion of North Africa, and he had just recently avoided having others taken from him. At the same time, his losses over Germany continued to mount. By the end of July 1943, he had an effective force of only 275 heavy bombers.  Though the rate of replacement arrivals was increasing daily, the losses were severe enough to seemingly dictate a curtailment of operations, at least until the range of his fighters could be increased. Eaker could ill afford a hiatus, however, because in so many impor- tant quarters it would be interpreted as a proof of failure. On the other hand, if his B-17s could paralyze the ball-bearing plants at Schwein- furt today, the strike would have to be interpreted as a proof of success. He wished these planes had been able to get off on schedule, and he wished he’d had more of them to send. But in a three-square- mile target area, he was confident that 230 B-17s would be enough to do the job  In the underground Combat Control Center of Germany’s Twelfth Air Corps at Zeist, Holland (near Utrecht), and at other western fighter-defense bases, operations staffs had been working nervously, speedily, and without relief since early morning when coastal radar indicated widespread activity above the American airfields in East Anglia.!5 This activity was, of course, the assembly of the 8th Air Force’s Fourth Bombardment Wing on its way to Regensburg. Since those early warnings, fighters from defense-corridor bases in Hol- land, France, and Germany had engaged the Regensburg force in a relentless battle all the way to its target and had inflicted severe losses. But they had failed to turn back Colonel LeMay’s armada, and so the Regensburg Messerschmitt plant was now more than half
