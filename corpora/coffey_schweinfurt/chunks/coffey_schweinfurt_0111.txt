Wray, a combat veteran and the original 91st Group commander, to make sure each group understood its importance.! R.A.F. experts had found, after flying captured ME-109s, that this airplane operated best at 17,000 feet and worst between72 1,000 and 23,000. The B-17 operated best at 23,000, hence the stipulated 23 ,000-foot floor in the flight plan. But as Colonel Gross looked at the cloud layers ahead, he estimated his planes would have to fly higher than 26,500 feet to get above them. If so, they would have to navigate on instruments and might not be able to see their target. He decided, therefore, that despite the advantage it would give the German fighters, he would keep his task force under the clouds unless the ceiling descended further and drove him down into the flak fields below 17,000 feet.  This was a fateful decision for which Gross would later be criticized, but with no enemy aircraft yet visible, with eight squad- rons of British Spitfires (ninety-six planes) pulling up alongside to escort his bombers almost to Antwerp, and with two American fighter groups scheduled to escort them as far as Aachen, he appar- ently felt the risk at 17,000 feet was acceptable. With the task force approaching the clouded coastline, the descent to 17,000 began.  When the lead group, the 91st, crossed the Dutch coast, no enemy aircraft had arrived. The 384th Group, the lowest and rearmost element in Colonel Gross’s task force, was not so fortunate. Maj. Thomas P. Beckett, air commander of the 384th, found that as soon as the task force descended to 17,000 feet, ‘‘the fighters got to us. Although we had fighter escort (the Spitfires), enemy fighters kept hitting us anyhow.’’2  Lt. Philip Algar’s plane, Lucky Thirteen, in the low squadron’s tail-end position, was already taking frontal attacks as the 384th flew  41  over the waterways of Holland; and the bombardier, Lt. James McClanahan, at his machine gun in the plexiglass nose, was an- nouncing the German arrivals over the
