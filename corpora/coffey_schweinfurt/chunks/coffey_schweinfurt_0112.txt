rontal attacks as the 384th flew  41  over the waterways of Holland; and the bombardier, Lt.

By listening to his voice, the whole crew could tell how close the Germans were; the closer the enemy came, the higher his vocal register. When they were bearing in upon him, he would be scream- ing at them as he fired.3  One of the German fighters, approaching from eleven o’clock high, released a 20-mm. cannon shell that ripped into the plane just behind pilot Algar on the left side.
