l of holes that Preston did not expect their luck to hold. He was especially concerned about the high group on his right; too much distance separated it from his group. Unless this composite high group were to close in, his own top element could not possibly give it the protection it needed on its flank. Since the high group was not under his command, he couldn’t order it to come in tighter, but he was especially concerned about it because it in- cluded six planes from his own 379th. His group had already suffered such heavy losses during its less-than-three months of combat that he was determined to reverse the trend. He didn’t want to see any 379th planes go down needlessly, and he feared the worst if this composite high group remained too far out.  Preston's fears soon proved to be justified. At 2:45, a B-17 in the high squadron of the composite group was hit by a German fighter from the rear. The big bomber went into a steep dive and exploded when it hit the ground. No parachutes appeared.  Five minutes later, a second plane from the same high squadron  49  went into a plunge after an attack by several fighters. On the way to the ground it broke apart. Four crewmen emerged, but not in time to get their chutes opened  Ten minutes later, at 3:00 p.M., a third ship from the same squadron fell out of formation with one engine on fire and fighters surrounding it. All three of these planes and their crews had been furnished to the composite group by Preston’s 379th  It was apparent now that the decision to fly the mission at 17,000 feet would be costly. Silhouetted against the cloud layer just above them, the B-17s had become sharply defined targets not only for the German fighters but also for the antiaircraft guns on the ground. The antiaircraft fire had been sporadic and may not by itself have brought down any of the bombers, but it had punctured many of them with shrapnel. Some of the German fighters were using the clouds as cover, darting out for sudden attacks,
