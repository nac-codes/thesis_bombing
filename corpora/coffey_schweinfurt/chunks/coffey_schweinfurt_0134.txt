r after a fixed time, exploded in quick succession—pomp! pomp! pomp!—close enough to put holes in the side of the plane but just far enough from Algar to leave him unscathed.  The 384th, in the coffin corner of the Second Combat Wing, had fighters coming at it from all directions. Algar, looking around, saw an engine catch fire on the lead Fortress of the group’s high squadron. The plane’s pilot, experienced enough to be a squadron leader, pulled away from the formation, apparently trying to spare the other planes in case he exploded, and also trying to get away from the lower squadrons so that if his men had to bail out, they would not be chewed up by propellers. Unfortunately, this squadron had several new, inexperienced pilots. When their leader pulled out of formation, they followed. Algar, aware of the confusion, told the squadron on the radio to get back in forrhation and let their leader go. Then he pushed his own throttles forward and moved up to the squadron leader’s position. When the errant planes came back to the formation, they fell in on Algar’s wing. Though this was only his seventh mission, he suddenly found himself leading a squadron  Despite the carnage, one combat wing still had not lost a plane. Ironically, it was the most vulnerable rear wing, led by Col. Maurice Preston and his 379th Group. But so many of the fifty-three planes in this wing were already shot full of holes that Preston did not expect their luck to hold. He was especially concerned about the high group on his right; too much distance separated it from his group. Unless this composite high group were to close in, his own top element could not possibly give it the protection it needed on its flank. Since the high group was not under his command, he couldn’t order it to come in tighter, but he was especially concerned about it because it in- cluded six planes from his own 379th. His group had already suffered such heavy losses during its less-than-three months of combat that he was
