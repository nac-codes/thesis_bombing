the Initial Point (the spot at which the bombardier takes over for the straight-and-level run to the target) when another of its planes, piloted by Lt. Eugene M. Lockhart, faced a crisis.!5 This Fortress had already sustained damage to its left wing-tip and right horizontal stabilizer. Now it developed a malfunc- tion of the supercharger on the No. 3 engine. Unable to keep pace with a full bomb load, and watching the formation pull slowly away to leave him at the mercy of the attacking fighters, Lockhart ordered his bombardier, Lt. Robert Sherwin, to salvo the bombs, and he ordered the rest of the crew to throw out any equipment they didn’t think they would need. Thus lightened, the plane again moved gradually forward on its three good engines to resume its place in the formation.  As the 91st neared the Initial Point, the plane with the reputation for always coming back, Dame Satan, began to look as if it wouldn’t. Dame Satan’s bombardier, Lt. Ted Winslow, was ready to assume control of the ship when an FW-190 flew directly at him from twelve o'clock level.'* At the last possible moment the German pilot fired his cannon and swerved from his collision course. One shell hit the supercharger on Dame Satan’s No. 2 engine. Another shell or bullet hit one of, the bomber’s fuel tanks. Within moments, Dame Satan began losing speed and altitude, falling back despite the fact that the pilot, Lt. Jack Hargis, had now pushed all three working throttles full forward.

But even after the plane was relieved of this weight, it continued to fall back. Alone with only three engines operating and fuel leaking from one tank, Hargis had no choice but to turn for home and hope for good fortune.  It seemed a bleak hope, especially when the vulnerable Dame Satan began to attract fighters. The damaged Fortress st
