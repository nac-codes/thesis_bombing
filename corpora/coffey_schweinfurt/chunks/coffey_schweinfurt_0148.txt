hird  i by Maj. William S. Raper and his 306th Group, added so re smoke and flames to the scene that when Col. Maurice trived with his Fourth (and last) Combat Wing, what he saw ce the bed of a gigantic furnace. !® He had no idea where his ould do the most good. All he could do was turn the plane  56  of the target, dropped his bombs. On his signal all the other planes in the 91st Group did likewise. As the group banked westward toward home, its crews could see the first cluster of explosions among the factories.  For the groups behind the 91st, precision would be more difficult. By the time they arrived, smoke and fire would be spreading a cover over the target. If the first bombers had missed, then all the others, guided by their explosions, might also miss, thereby rendering the entire mission useless. Lieutenant Slayton, aware of this possibility, was relieved to know that his bombs had landed where he aimed them.  Only eighteen B-17s remained in the shattered 381st when it approached the target, and as if the group had not suffered enough, one of these was hit, probably by flak, on the bomb run. With its No. 3 and No. 4 engines silenced, it fell out of formation and went into a long glide. The seventeen surviving planes of the 38 1st dropped their bombs and followed the 91st westward  In the Second Combat Wing, the 384th, flying the low, coffin- corner position, was absorbing the heaviest punishment. As Maj. Thomas Beckett led his battered group toward the target, only eleven of its original eighteen planes remained in the formation.

Corwin Miller, gravely wounded over Holland more than an hour and a half earlier, still lay bundled in blankets on the bomb-bay catwalk. Lapsing into and out of consciousness, he
