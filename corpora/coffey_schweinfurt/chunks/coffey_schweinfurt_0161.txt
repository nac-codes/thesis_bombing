The men huddled anxiously around their sand-bagged guns while Wehner went into his ‘‘com- mand post’’ hut and dived under the bed.  During the breaks between waves of bombers, Wehner got up and looked out. Dense smoke and dust were rising around all the factories and throughout the northern sections of the city. The southernmost parts of the Kugelfischer plant and the surrounding area seemed to be demolished. Hundreds of bombs had fallen.

The bombers were still at their original altitudes as they passed overhead and disappeared. Wehner’s antiaircraft guns hadn’t even been able to take a shot at them  For twenty-four minutes the attack continued.
