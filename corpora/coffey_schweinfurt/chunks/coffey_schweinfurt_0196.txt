they crossed the coast near the mouth of the Deben River, north of Felixstowe, but it had only a few more miles left in it if Weitzenfeld could believe his fuel gauges  Williams was in the cockpit with the young captain when they spotted a tiny-airstrip for fighters, probably an auxiliary field, just outside Martlesham. It had no paved runways, and its short length did not indicate that it ever expected to feel the weight of a B-17.  Williams, having been the operations officer of the first group ever to fly B-17s, was quite experienced at landing them on grass because in those days (1936) there were few paved runways. Knowing that Weitzenfeld had probably never landed a B-17 on grass, the general tapped him on the shoulder and offered to take control.  The young captain, firmly in command of himself and his ship, turned to the general and declined with thanks. He would rather do it himself.  Thereupon he made a perfect approach and a perfect landing. As  75  soon as the plane’s fuel tanks were filled, they took off again for the 91st Group’s base at Bassingbourn.  At American air bases throughout East Anglia, the B-17s began returning about 5:30 p.M. From then onward, the men awaiting them on the ground began to grasp, with alarm and then anguish, the extent of their losses. One after another the groups limped home, the gaps in their formations immediately apparent to their anxious ground crews. Some of the missing were not actually lost. Several stragglers landed at other bases because they couldn’t make it all the way. Some simply came in late, on two or three engines, or, nursing their meager gas supplies, had been forced to leave their formations because they could not keep pace. One pilot, Lt. Elton Hoyt of the 379th, was on his final approach at Kimbolton when his last engine died. He made a perfect ‘‘dead stick’’ landing. Another, Flight Officer Randy Jacobs of the 384th, had to make a crashlanding at Grafton-Underwood because he ran out of gas just a few m
