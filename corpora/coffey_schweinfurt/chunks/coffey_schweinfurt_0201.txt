Lay was also astonished at the condition of the base, but that was hardly in the forefront of his mind. After the soul-shaking experiences he had just survived, he was so happy to be on the ground that even this forlorn place looked good to him.!9 From his copilot’s seat at the rear of the armada he had seen the worst of the day’s action, and even though he didn’t yet know the precise number of lost or badly damaged planes, he knew that the toll had been dreadful  When Lay began talking to LeMay about his experience, LeMay seemed flabbergasted.
