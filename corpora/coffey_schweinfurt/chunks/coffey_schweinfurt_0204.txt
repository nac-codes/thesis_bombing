After the soul-shaking experiences he had just survived, he was so happy to be on the ground that even this forlorn place looked good to him.!9 From his copilot’s seat at the rear of the armada he had seen the worst of the day’s action, and even though he didn’t yet know the precise number of lost or badly damaged planes, he knew that the toll had been dreadful  When Lay began talking to LeMay about his experience, LeMay seemed flabbergasted.

Though he knew the air battle had been fierce and his force had suffered losses, he had no way of realizing their extent because he couldn’t see what was happening several miles behind him and also because he had trained his men to maintain radio discipline, to avoid comforting the enemy by broadcasting harmful information.

By this time he was aware that he had lost 24 of the 146 planes with which he had left England  When LeMay’s message arrived at 8th Air Force headq
