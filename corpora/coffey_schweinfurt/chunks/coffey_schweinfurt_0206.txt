se.22  rmany secret  z  ball-bearing shortage was threatened. Ever since he had assumed the enormous responsibilities of his present job eighteen months before, he had been worried about the ball-bearing situation. It seemed to him that ball-bearing production was one of four or five areas of endeavor in which the German war effort was crucially vulnerable. The others were oil production, synthetic rubber, chemicals, and communica- tions. If the allied air attacks were to be concentrated on any one of these industrial sectors, Germany’s ability to make war might be decisively curtailed.  The ball-bearing industry was even more vulnerable than the  €’ others because so much of it was concentrated in those five factories  rae”  Ss  clustered around the railway yards at Schweinfurt. On September 20, 1942, a month after the Americans began their daylight bombing, Speer had called Hitler’s attention to the importance of the Schwein- furt factories, and two days later he had suggested to Hitler that the Schweinfurt antiaircraft defenses be increased. Hitler had agreed, but very little had been done about it.  Speer had subsequently suggested that ball-bearing production be dispersed; Hitler, apparently trusting him and probably not very keenly interested in the subject, had acquiesced without any special reaction. The only move Speer had yet been able to make toward decentralization of the industry was to expand other ball-bearing factories at Steyr, Erkner, and Cannstatt. Would this be enough? He didn’t think so.  Speer remained mindful of the possibility that the Americans might attack Schweinfurt. He had watched carefully and with grow- ing concern as they gradually expanded their operations and im- proved their techniques. He had developed a fearful respect for the devastation either the American or the British bombers could inflict. And after the British destruction of Hamburg July 24 to 27, his respect developed into alarm. At a Central Planning conference July 29,
