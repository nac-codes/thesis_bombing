were to be concentrated on any one of these industrial sectors, Germany’s ability to make war might be  decisively curtailed.  The ball-bearing industry was even more vulnerable than the others because so much of it was concentrated in those five factories clustered around the railway yards at Schweinfurt. On September 20, 1942, a month after the Americans began their daylight bombing, Speer had called Hitler’s attention to the importance of the Schwein-  furt factories, and two days later Schweinfurt antiaircraft defenses very little had been done about i  he had suggested to Hitler that the be increased. Hitler had agreed, but t.  Speer had subsequently suggested that ball-bearing production be dispersed; Hitler, apparently trusting him and probably not very keenly interested in the subject, had acquiesced without any special  reaction. The only move Speer  decentralization of the industry  factories at Steyr, Erkner, and Ca didn’t think so.  had yet been able to make toward was to expand other ball-bearing nnstatt. Would this be enough? He  Speer remained mindful of the possibility that the Americans might attack Schweinfurt. He had watched carefully and with grow- ing concern as they gradually expanded their operations and im- proved their techniques. He had developed a fearful respect for the devastation either the American or the British bombers could inflict. And after the British destruction of Hamburg July 24 to 27, his respect developed into alarm. At a Central Planning conference July 29, Speer said: ‘‘If the air raids continue on the present scale, within three months we shall be relieved of a number of questions we are at present discussing. We shall simply be coasting downhill, smoothly  and relatively swiftly. The urgent  question is simply, can we produce  more single- and twin-engined fighters? And what can we shut down for that purpose? Otherwise, we may as well be holding the final  meeting of Central Planning.’  Three days later, Speer told Hitl
