Speer left the Fiihrer that morning, no drastic measures had been decreed. Even the question of ball-bearing-plant dispersal, though agreed upon, was not completely settled. Speer was certain that various components of the Schweinfurt plants should be dis- persed to a number of other communities; but even with Hitler’s tacit approval would he be able to disperse them? If he were to dismantle and relocate the currently operating factories he would lose at least three or four months’ worth of sorely needed production. And in order to move them, or even parts of them, to other communities, he would have to win the approval of the politically powerful gauleiters (local leaders) of those communities. These men were close to Hitler’s heart. Many of them were his cronies. They were the core of his Nazi constituency. And they were not likely to welcome into their towns or cities factories that might attract American bombers. For the present, Speer could only launch a tentative move toward dispersal and try to find some gauleiters who would accept ball-bearing fac- tories. At the same time, he would have to hasten the reconstruction of the damaged plants and hope the Americans, not fully aware of the importance of what they had done, would forgo any attempt to do it again  83  cl tof hm aya wl ls el i  1 even though it was almost an hour’s drive from head- vas mid-afternoon before General Eaker arrived with the had chosen to accompany him—Brig.
