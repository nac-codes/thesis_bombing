You'd better get dressed and go see the colonel.”’  Ten minutes later, Smith was in the office of the 351st Group commander, Col. William A. Hatcher, Jr., who said to him, ‘‘Read that twix from 8th Air Force headquarters.”’  The telegram said: *‘Please select a highly qualified crew to come down to Bovingdon [a base near London] and stand by for General Eaker and party to proceed to Africa.”’  “*That’s you,’’ Colonel Hatcher said to Smith.  “*But as I recall,’’ Smith said, ‘‘our only airplane still usable last night was Spare-ball.””  This B-17 had earned its name because it was used only as a spare.

What would the commanding general say if he showed up for the flight with a movie star along just for the ride. Reluctantly, Smith shook his head at Gable and went looking for his regular crew.
