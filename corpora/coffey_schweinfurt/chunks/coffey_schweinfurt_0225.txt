would the commanding general say if he showed up for the flight with a movie star along just for the ride. Reluctantly, Smith shook his head at Gable and went looking for his regular crew.  Three hours later, Smith and his men, in the despised B-17 called Spare-ball, landed at Bovingdon, which was the 8th Air Force head-  85  quarters field even though it was almost an hour’s drive from head- quarters. It was mid-afternoon before General Eaker arrived with the two men he had chosen to accompany him—Brig. Gen.

Eaker shook hands with every member of Smith’s crew, then said, ‘‘Let’s go.’’?  Due to the German fighters that patrolled the Atlantic off the coast of France, their route would not be direct. Like all Africa-bound planes at that stage of the war, Spare-ball had to fly first to a field near Land’s End in Cornwall, at the western tip of England, then, after waiting until dark, along a southwesterly course down the Atlan- tic, skirting France widely enough to be outside the range of the JU-88s.  Despite Eaker’s outward composure, his mind was occupied with some heavy concerns as he took off for Africa.
