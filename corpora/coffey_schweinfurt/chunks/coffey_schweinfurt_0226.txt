town. While he had no way of knowing how perilously severe Germany’s production chief, Albert Speer, considered this damage to be, Eaker had no doubt that Schweinfurt had been hard hit. And according to indications from LeMay, the Messerschmitt plant at Regensburg had been almost destroyed. It was fair to assume that the raids had been highly successful in damaging the German war effort. But that conviction could only partially comfort Eaker. He was now living painfully with the knowledge that he had lost a total of sixty B-17s in the two attacks—a prohibitive 16 percent of those dis- patched. In addition, early reports indicated that twenty-seven of the Schweinfurt planes had been so badly damaged they might never fly again, and ninety-five of the surviving planes had sustained lesser damage.  Eaker did not yet know how many of LeMay’s planes would have to be junked as a result of the Regensburg raid. This was one of the unpleasant facts he would discover when he reached Telergma  86  Bombardment Wing’s shuttle from Regensburg to Africa. The sergeant said, ‘‘This is different, Captain. This is some kind of a special mission. You'd better get dressed and go see the colonel.’  Ten minutes later, Smith was in the office of the 351st Group commander, Col. William A. Hatcher, Jr., who said to him, *‘Read that twix from 8th Air Force headquarters.”’  The telegram said: ‘‘Please select a highly qualified crew to come down to Bovingdon [a base near London] and stand by for General Eaker and party to proceed to Africa.”’  “*That’s you,’’ Colonel Hatcher said to Smith.  “‘But as I recall,’’ Smith said, ‘‘our only airplane still usable last night was Spare-ball.””  This B-17 had earned its name because it was used only as a spare. Nobody wanted it. One of its engines habitually spewed oil onto the wing, and the mechanics couldn’t figure out what was wrong. No one had flown it to Schweinfurt. The group was just able to supply the quota without it.  “*That’s the plane you've g
