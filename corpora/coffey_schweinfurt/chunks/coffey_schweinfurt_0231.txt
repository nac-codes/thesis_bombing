neral Eaker awaiting them with a sizable party. In addition to his own aides, he had with him General Spaatz, General James Doolittle (commander of the Twelfth Air Force), General Roosevelt, and Colonel Lauris Norstad. As Captain Smith warmed up his engines, carefully testing his bad one, he came to the chilling realization that if this plane failed to hold up for another hundred  87  miles, he might become a famous footnote in the history of the war—the pilot who flew the plane in which three famous generals and a President’s son were killed. But Spare-ball, still spewing oil, carried them all safely to the desolate base at Telergma, where Colonel LeMay was waiting to greet them. He had set up a head- quarters in a tent. Here the generals and their staffs retired to con- fer  Eaker’s first question to LeMay was, ‘*Curt, when will you be able to go back?’’3  “*As soon as we can hang some bombs and put some fuel in these crates,’’ LeMay assured him. But it would not be that easy. For the first time, Eaker learned the worst. As for the bombing results, LeMay was convinced, after talking to his men, that the Regensburg Messerschmitt plant had been “‘totally destroyed.’’ The losses, how- ever, were sobering. Besides the twenty-four B-17s that had failed to reach Africa (six of these had gone down in Italy or the Mediterra- nean), at least twenty and possibly more would never fly again. And perhaps twice that number were so badly damaged that they needed repairs  LeMay still lacked precise damage figures because there was no maintenance organization on this desert base. His own crews were doing the work. But LeMay was not discouraged, nor did he spend much time complaining, even though he did wish that Colonel Norstad had been able to let him know about the change in conditions at Telergma. The morning after his arrival LeMay had directed his men to get to work immediately, cannibalizing the derelict planes for parts with which to repair the salvageable ones. Hard-nosed
