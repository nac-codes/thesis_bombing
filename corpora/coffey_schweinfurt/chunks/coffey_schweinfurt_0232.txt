Hard-nosed as ever, he still intended to bomb German installations at Bordeaux on his way back to England. The only thing he couldn’t say for certain was how long it would take to get ready.  Eaker, at this meeting and during the subsequent inspection of the men and planes, was greatly impressed with LeMay’s qualities of leadership, his refusal to surrender to circumstances. But Eaker could also see that this force was no longer in combat condition.  ‘There will be no mission,’’ he said to LeMay. ‘‘ Your men will not be subjected to hostilities on the return to England.
