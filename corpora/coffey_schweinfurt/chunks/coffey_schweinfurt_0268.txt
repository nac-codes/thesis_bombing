British proposal and had reiterated the American determination to bomb German targets in the daytime. Arnold had also given Harris a fascinating insight into the American Air Forces’s problems with the American Navy. And he had emphasized the possibility that the British might damage themselves if they insisted on diverting B-17s to coastal patrol.9 Harris’s conversation with Arnold prompted an extraordinary cable, marked ‘‘MOST SECRET,”’ which Harris sent January 29, to R.A.F. Chief of Air Staff Portal in London:  Arnold asks me to tell you that so far as he can judge at present, he aims to get up to 20 heavy bomber groups into U.K. this year. He hopes to achieve at least 16 but this is likely to be adversely affected by certain tendencies now growing in force e.g. in spite of lip service to the agreed grand strategy [the U.S.-British overall war plan], the Far East looms ever larger and more insistently in the thoughts of the highest ones in the land. Added to this, the Navy has now realized the limitations of the flying boat and covets the heavy bomber in quantity. Recent successes against Jap. ships lend weight to their case and in any event they have always opposed the bomber plan by fair means or foul. They are con-  102  cerned only with having seas safe for sailors to sail on and do not think as far as winning the war or even making land safe for landlubbers to live or fight on. Our proposal to sidetrack 250 B- 17s to Coastal Command has made the airmen here very hot under the collar. ‘‘We are thereby flying straight into the Navy’s hands.””  As to what he wants to do about it, Arnold was not clear, but in general he expressed an urgent desire that you should fight every proposed diversion of H.B.s from the bomber force and from direct action against German territory to the last ditch. I told him he would be preaching not only to the converted but to the very leader of the sect, but that I would nevertheless inform you. He implores your backing in the fight
