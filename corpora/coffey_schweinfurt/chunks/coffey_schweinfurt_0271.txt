th were aware of its almost global importance. Both believed firmly that the outcome of the war depended on the proper use of air power. Harris received Eaker’s arguments sympathetically but could not embrace them. It was essential that the maximum force be brought to bear against Hitler as quickly as possible.

Couldn’t the 8th Air Force join the R.A.F. in night raids, Harris wondered, at least temporarily, until it was strong enough to launch its own day raids?  Eaker had anticipated this proposal also, and he was wary of it.
