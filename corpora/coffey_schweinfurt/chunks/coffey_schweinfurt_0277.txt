Surprisingly, the argument between these two men was not only polite; it was also friendly. They had liked each other from the start, and each understood the national military policies that governed the other. But while they were more than cordial, they were both intense When they finished, neither had been swayed from his position Harris was too gracious, however, to leave the matter at an impasse.
