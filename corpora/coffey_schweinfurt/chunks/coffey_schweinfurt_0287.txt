of the German cities the R.A.F. had bombed. These were specially processed pictures taken  109  by British reconnaissance planes as soon as the smoke cleared the day after a raid. In some, there were buildings with flames still flickering. An observer of these photos could peer straight down into the empty, gutted shells as if from only a few hundred feet directly above.  It was such an impressive display that people spent hours looking at it. South African Premier Ian Christian Smuts had spent the whole evening at it when he visited the Harrises. The air marshal, usually wearing his favorite plum-colored, velvet smoking jacket and waving one of his favorite Lucky Strike cigarets from the end of a holder, provided a running commentary with the pictures to prove the R.A.F. strategy was the one that would win the war against Hitler. Harris had already ‘‘converted’’ several American war correspondents by treat- ing them to this performance.  In his discussions with Eaker, Harris persuasively stressed the time element. Weeks and months could be saved if the newly arriving American heavy-bomb groups would simply affix themselves to the R.A.F. for night raids. The Americans, after all, were just getting started at this job of fighting Hitler. They didn’t realize how clever the Germans were. The British had been at the job for more than two years, and it was only natural that they had learned a few things. They had now got their system working pretty smoothly, and the most effective contribution the American bombers could make toward winning the war would be simply to mesh in with it  Eaker would point out that they had already agreed on separation of effort. Military airdromes were so close together in England even now that the air space was congested every night the R.A.F. sent out its bombers. It would become perilously crowded if the 8th Air Force were to begin sending its fleets up into the dark skies at the same time. On the other hand, congestion would never become
