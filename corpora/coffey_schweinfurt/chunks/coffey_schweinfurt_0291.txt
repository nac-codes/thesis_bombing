cific military or industrial target would damage the German war effort much more than a larger bomb dropped at night on the house of one or two German workers. The ten B-17 machine guns were heavy, of course, but if they could hold off German fighters so that the bomber could reach an important target in full daylight when the bombardier could see it, they would be worth their weight. The 8th Air Force B-17s, unlike those the British had tried, would have the remarkable Norden bomb-sight, which would enable them to  112  daytime operations? It would be a waste of all that armament and all that extra equipment to use the plane at night.  On the subject of the Flying Fortress, Harris tried to be tactful. He knew it was going to be the basic heavy bomber of the 8th Air Force, and therefore he couldn’t dismiss it as if it had no merit. In fact, he believed it had some very good features.

But despite all the B-17’s merits, he and most other British air experts had grave reservations about it  The previous October 30, Air Vice Marshal R. H. Peck, one of Portal’s deputies, wrote a letter to Air Vice Marshal Robert Saundby at Bomber Command that illustrated the then-current R.A.F. attitude toward the B-17. :  “*A pernicious article has appeared in a recent issue of the ‘Satur- day Evening Post’ in America,”’ Peck wrote to Saundby. “‘It takes the line that the Boeing Fortress is the finest bomber in the world and that the stupid British have refused to take advantage of its qualities, refused to order it and cannot make effective use of it. I have been requested to produce a counter to this mischievous propagan- da. . . . Would it be possible for you to get one of your staff to give me some notes on the limitations of the Fortress as we have found them? What has gone wrong with it and why w
