en the smallest of targets. Such sophisticated equipment would be wasted if the planes were consigned to night raids in which bombs were dropped indiscriminately on populated areas.  The argument that the 8th Air Force should simply tack itself on behind the R.A.F. was the same argument America’s World War I commander, Gen. John J. Pershing, had encountered when he was asked to tack his infantry forces on behind the French and the British. Pershing had held out for establishing a separate American force, and his policy had proven itself by saving thousands of American lives.  With Pershing’s successful example behind him, Eaker would be foolish not to follow it, especially since the U.S. Government, including the President and all the senior military men, favored a repetition of it. The U.S. Air Force, in committing itself to the B-17, had bought thousands of planes, thousands of expensive bomb- sights, and hundreds of thousands of machine guns it would not need if it were to opt for a night bombing effort. The course ahead was almost fixed in concrete as far as Eaker could see, and it was a course he personally approved. Yet he could not ignore in Harris’s argu- ments the weight of British experience against the Nazis. It was difficult to answer Harris when he said, in effect, we know what we’re talking about because we’ve been through it. At such times, Eaker would say, ‘‘All right, then, if you want me to do it your way, the fellows for you to talk to are the Combined Chiefs of Staff. We get our directives from them.”’  Harris knew this, but he also knew it was American Air Force pressure that had persuaded the Combined Chiefs to accept the concept of daylight bombing. He conceded that the B-17s would have more and better guns than the British night bombers and would be able to fire from more angles. ‘‘You have side guns, for example, which we don’t have. We have only tail guns. But all your guns still can’t protect you from fighters because fighters are faster,
