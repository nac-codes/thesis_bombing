be able to fire from more angles. ‘‘You have side guns, for example, which we don’t have. We have only tail guns. But all your guns still can’t protect you from fighters because fighters are faster, more maneuverable.’’ U.S. bombers, Harris said, would be under continu- al attack for all the hours into and out of the target, besides which they'd be sitting ducks on their bomb runs when they would have to keep a straight path at a constant elevation.  “I just don’t think you can do it,’’ he insisted. ‘‘I don’t think Americans appreciate the German defensive effort on the so-called West Wall, how much antiaircraft they have, how intense the opposi-  113  tion, and what the rate of loss will be. God knows I hope you can do it. What a wonderful thing it would be if we didn’t give those fellows any rest. But we know something about daylight bombing. We tried it, and we couldn’t do it. The Germans tried it against us, and they couldn’t do it.’”  As for the B-17, he reminded Eaker of the two that Arnold had sent to the R.A.F. ‘‘We sent them across and got the hell shot out of them.’”  ‘That doesn’t prove anything,’’ Eaker replied. *‘Bomber losses are always in direct proportion to the size of the force. And we don’t intend to send one or two B-17s against the West Wall defenses. We're going to send them in sufficient numbers to overpower the defenses.””  Harris listened with respect, but he was not convinced  114  distinguish and hit even the smallest of targets. { equipment would be wasted if the planes were ¢ raids in which bombs were dropped indiscriminz areas.
