tinued over a period of years.?  When Harris took charge of Bomber Command, it had only 378 serviceable planes, and only 69 of these were heavy bombers. It was not surprising that he continued his attempts to convert Eaker to his night-bombing gospel. The bomber offensive, he pointed out, was the only allied operation that was helping the desperate Russians, who had already lost nearly half their country to the German army, and who might quickly lose the rest of it if the coming summer’s German drive were not stopped. The nightly threat of British bomb- ers was at least forcing Hitler to keep his fighters and most of his antiaircraft artillery at home, where they couldn’t add to the Russian burden. But even more important than helping the Russians, the bomber offensive, by disrupting German arms production, was bound to help the British and American soldiers who would one day, perhaps within the year, be invading the continent  Eaker was not disposed to deny any of this, but he in turn pointed out that if a night bomber offensive was that useful, a day bomber offensive would be even more so because its bombs would fall accurately on the very targets that were most important to destroy The British, up to now, were sometimes so inaccurate at night that they would bomb the wrong city or would bomb dummy “‘cities’’ set up by the Germans to mislead them—the same kind of dummy “‘cities’’ the British had used successfully at times, complete with dim blackout lighting patterns and papier-maché buildings, to divert the German bombers from London and other real cities  119  The R.A.F., Harris would remind him, was already adopting very good new radar measures to improve its aim.  But the British would never be as accurate at night, Eaker would insist, as the Americans were going to be in the daytime.  On April 13, the two men interrupted their argument long enough for a joint birthday party, both having been born the same day, Harris in 1892, Eaker in 1896. That afternoon, Ea
