er introducing Marshall to his men in the crowded conference room, the only room they had that was large enough to accommodate twenty people, Eaker spent an hour outlining the progress and prob- lems of the 8th Bomber Command during its first seven weeks  As usual, Marshall listened more than he talked. He was so forbiddingly dignified that he did not prompt light conversation. He didn’t encourage familiarity. Few men called him George. Even President Roosevelt, notoriously informal with most people, ad- dressed him as General Marshall. Yet Eaker found him an easy man to talk with because he gave such complete attention to everything that was said. And in turn, he could quiet a room and gain full atten- tion for himself simply by giving some indication he was ready to speak—squaring his shoulders or taking a slightly deeper breath.

Upon hearing what Eaker and his men had to say and the questions they raised, he assured them that the original American war plan, affirming the policy of daylight precision bombing by a separate U.S. force, was still in effect. He then wanted to know when they would be ready to begin operations.

Eaker assured Marshall that he already
