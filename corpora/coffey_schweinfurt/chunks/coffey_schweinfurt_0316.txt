a project for 1942 was premature but was proposing it because he feared an invasion might never take place unless preparations for it were begun immediately.)  Eaker assured Marshall that he already had the destruction of the Luftwaffe well fixed in his mind, together with the reduction of German weapons manufacture, as the prime purpose of the 8th Air Force mission in Europe.  Marshall was apparently satisfied with this general assurance. He said nothing about getting the job done before September.

As he knew, the 8th Bomber Command’s first airplanes weren’t even scheduled to arrive until July.  In a letter Marshall wrote to Portal a month later (May 8), he included some remarks that illuminate his thinking at the time and help to explain his obviously impractical proposal for a second front in 1942:  Until, and unless, we actually initiate combined offensive operations—ground as well as air—the pressures from other fronts for more matériel, planes, and the shipping involved, will be constantly increasing.

Unless a determined stand on this issue is taken now, I am convinc
