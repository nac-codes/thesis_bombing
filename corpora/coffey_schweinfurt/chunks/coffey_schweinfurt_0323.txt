tely or otherwise will have the effect of diverting them from their main purpose. . . . They will not easily be turned from their determination to use their pursuits primarily as escorts to their bombers.  Not yet discouraged, the British, at the same time, were at work on another approach to American intractability, which they naturally perceived as a critical problem in view of their own very limited resources and Hitler’s growing strength. What they most fervently wanted the Americans to do was to build Lancaster bombers instead of Flying Fortresses. They considered the Lancaster the world’s best bomber because it could carry the heaviest load. (In a modified version, it was eventually able to carry a six-ton bomb.) Equally important, the American adoption of the Lancaster would be the  124  simplest possible way to settle the day-night bombing controversy. The Lancaster could not take as much punishment as the B-17 and therefore had to be used at night.

He finally said one day, with a smile on his face but with his exasperation beginning to show, ‘You fellows keep this up and we [Americans] will all be in the Pacific.’’ This was one possibility that frightened the British, who were well aware of the desire, widespread in America, to finish the Japanese first and let Hitler wait his turn Gradually the R.A.F. made a slight shift in position. They had more experienced aircrews than they had planes, whereas the Americans were only in the process of training the bulk of their crews, none of whom had seen battle against the Germans.

This was a difficult plea to ignore because at the Washington Conference in December,
