with that many planes, the United States should raise an issue over allocating ‘a mere five thousand”’ to the British. He wanted to hit the enemy, and he wanted to do it right away. The greatest possible number of bombs must be dropped, and he meant within the next few months not a year in the future. What did Arnold think of those sentiments?  126  simplest possible way to settle the day-night bombing controversy. The Lancaster could not take as much punishment as the B-17 and therefore had to be used at night  While Arnold was countering the Lancaster campaign in Washing- ton, Eaker was doing likewise in London. Eaker was hearing it not so much from Harris, however, as from Portal and other members of the Air Staff. He finally said one day, with a smile on his face but with his exasperation beginning to show, **You fellows keep this up and we [Americans] will all be in the Pacific.’’ This was one possibility that frightened the British, who were well aware of the desire, widespread in America, to finish the Japanese first and let Hitler wait his turn Gradually the R.A.F. made a slight shift in position. They had more experienced aircrews than they had planes, whereas the Americans were only in the process of training the bulk of their crews, none of whom had seen battle against the Germans. Until the American crews were ready, would it not be sensible to send over every available plane immediately and let the British crews fly them?  This was a difficult plea to ignore because at the Washington Conference in December, right after the American entry into the war, General Arnold had agreed with Portal that the R.A.F. should receive ten thousand American airplanes (of all types) in 1942.
