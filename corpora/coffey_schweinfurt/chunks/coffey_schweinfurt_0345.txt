thousand to four hundred men. Eaker was ready to get on with the job im- mediately in the most direct possible way, by resigning his own commission, but the other two talked him out of it. The friendship among the three men, which began at Rockwell, had continued through the years. Eaker, after two years of study under Air Corps auspices at Columbia University Law School, served under Arnold in 1924, when Arnold was Air Corps Chief of Information. Eaker served with Spaatz on the Air Staff from 1925 to 1927, and in 1929, when Eaker was chief pilot on the Question Mark endurance flight, Spaatz, who was five years his senior, commanded the project. In 1919, when Eaker ended his service at Rockwell Field to take a temporary assignment in the Philippines, he had said to Spaatz and Arnold just before leaving, ‘‘Bear in mind, if I stay in the service, I want to come back and join you.’’ During the two decades between the wars, there never was a year when the three did not get together someplace. Arnold, being older than the others, was usually in a command position, and whenever possible he would ask to have them assigned to him.  Spaatz had forever endeared himself to Arnold as a result of an incident in 1920. When the Army stripped its officers of their tempor- ary war ranking and returned them to their permanent ranks, Arnold, a colonel, became a captain overnight, but Spaatz, a major, kept his rank because he had earned it in battle. The following morning, Arnold acknowledged the fact that Spaatz was now his superior by switching desks with him. When Spaatz came into their office, he was horrified at this sudden reversal of roles. Rather than assume command over his former superior, he immediately arranged to have himself transferred to another base.  Arnold, Spaatz, and Eaker had all been members of the young and zealous Air Corps officer group that idolized Col. William ‘‘Billy”’ Mitchell and supported his campaign for the rapid development of  133  American air pow
