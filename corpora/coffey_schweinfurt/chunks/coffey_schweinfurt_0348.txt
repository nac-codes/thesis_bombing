Eaker served with Spaatz on the Air Staff from 1925 to 1927, and in 1929, when Eaker was chief pilot on the Question Mark endurance flight, Spaatz, who was five years his senior, commanded the project. In 1919, when Eaker ended his service at Rockwell Field to take a temporary assignment in the Philippines, he had said to Spaatz and Arnold just before leaving, ‘‘Bear in mind, if I stay in the service, I want to come back and join you.’’ During the two decades between the wars, there never was a year when the three did not get together someplace.

All three championed the views not only of Mitchell but also of other early air advocates such as Gen. Guilio Douhe
