With R.A.F. fighter planes acting as mock enemies, the American gunners got an idea what it was going to be like when they had to fire their .50-caliber machine-gun bullets into the mouths of 20-mm. cannons. Eaker was beginning to realize  136  Eaker, who had talked to Harris about the letter before it was sent, appreciated the spirit of Harrisâ€™s argument.
