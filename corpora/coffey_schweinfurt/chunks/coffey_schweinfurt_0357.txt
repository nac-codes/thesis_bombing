ORCH) during the autumn of 1942. Though General Eisenhower had been selected to command this operation, he, being a Marshall disciple, did not favor it. He once referred to the day it was decided, July 24, as ‘‘the blackest day in history.’’ Eaker tended to agree because he could see the probability that planes earmarked for the 8th Air Force might now be sent to Africa. Within a few days he heard from Arnold that the reality would be worse than that. Arnold informed Spaatz and Eaker not only that they would be deprived of two of the next three B-17 groups they expected but also that they would lose the 97th Group with which they were expecting to begin operations.  As a result of the TORCH decision, the 8th Air Force lost its ‘‘first priority’’ rank among American air forces around the world, and all of its bombers were classified as “‘available’’ for the North African invasion. This reevaluation did not mean the 8th was to be completely dismantled. The Combined Chiefs had stipulated that both the R.A.F. and the A.A.F. would continue to receive enough airplanes for a ‘‘constantly increasing intensity of air attack’’ against Ger- many. But it was difficult to imagine how this attack could constantly increase if most of the planes went to Africa.  While Eaker protested in vain against the African invasion, which he considered an unfortunate diversion from the main campaign against Hitler, he decided at the same time to get his planes into action as quickly as possible and make the maximum use of them before he lost them. He ordered Colonel Armstrong to prepare the 97th Group for its first mission August 10, 1942.  On August 5, Eaker and Spaatz went to Eisenhower’s London headquarters and presented their plan for this mission, which he  137  approved. Eaker was ‘‘tremendously impressed’’ by the Theater commander's ‘‘keenness for air operations and his evident interest in our personnel.’’ Eisenhower said he wanted to be notified when the planes would be returning from
