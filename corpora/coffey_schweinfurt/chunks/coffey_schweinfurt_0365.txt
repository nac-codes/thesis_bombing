and Eaker would hurry up and begin successful operations.  While Arnold fretted in Washington and Eaker anxiously watched for a change in the weather, Sir Charles Portal in London was quite calm about the coming American air offensive. The brilliantly analyt- ical but ascetic and undemonstrative R.A.F. Chief of Air Staff wrote an internal policy memorandum (August 13) in which he said about the coordination between Harris and Eaker:  Fortunately they are located close together and are firm friends and I do not think there will be the slightest difficulty in fitting in their programmes. Spaatz may tend to interfere with Eaker to start with but I think he will soon discover that it is unprofitable to do so and Eaker will then be left with the same freedom as Harris already enjoys.  In this same memo, however, Portal made it plain that he still had little faith in daylight bombing when he referred to ‘“‘those night operations which they [the Americans] will undertake with their medium bombers, and possibly later with their heavies if they find that day bombing is too expensive.””  Harris still firmly believed that day bombing would be too expen- sive, but he had virtually given up arguing with Eaker about it. He told one of his aides, Group Capt. Dudley Saward, that he thought the Americans were about to suffer some bad casualties, but that they might as well try it because they knew more about day bombing than they would be able to learn about night bombing in several years.’  At 11:00 A.M. on the morning of August 17, with the weather clearing rapidly, Brigadier General Eaker began his first operations conference and ordered the 8th Air Force Bomber Command's first combat mission that afternoon. The operations conference didn’t take long. The mission would be against the railroad marshaling yards at Rouen, France, sixty-five miles northwest of Paris and thirty-five miles inland from the English Channel. Eaker and staff had planned it so minutely and had discussed it
