bend in the Seine and then the village of Sotteville. The Americans had still seen no fighters, and no flak had come up to greet them. Directly over the rail yards, Eaker watched the B-17’s five 600-pound bombs drop, one after another. But he had to go to a side window to see them land because some sensible crew-member closed the bomb-bay doors the moment the load was gone. As the formation turned right after the bomb run, the burst of the bombs was visible. It seemed that from each plane’s string, a long, mushroomlike pall of smoke and dirt arose. Two such bomb clouds flanked the roundhouse while four more were well spaced along the marshaling yard. Two bursts were short of the target; two more were to the right of it, but within the complex of railroad buildings.  Shortly after the B-17s turned for home, German fighters—three FW-190s—arrived to harass them. As the first of these pulled up sharply from below, it seemed to be aiming its guns at Eaker’s plane, but its bullets came closer to the plane just astern. The two other Focke-Wulfs, also approaching from below, attacked the last B-17 in the formation, and Eaker could see the bottom turret gunner in that plane return their fire. But when the German fighters retired, neither side appeared to have been damaged. From the radio operator’s gun opening, Eaker looked out and counted his planes. All twelve were still in formation, though one seemed to lag slightly as black smoke trailed from its left outboard engine.  An hour and a half later, all twelve were safely back home on the  143  ground and the 8th Bomber Command had survived its first combat action without a loss. In his report to Spaatz, Eaker mentioned the need for tighter formations and more gunnery training. The crews, he said, were alert and vigilant. As for the Flying Fortress, he was convinced it had ‘‘excellent defensive firepower.’’ He didn’t think it should be used extensively above 25,000 feet ‘‘due to extreme crew discomfort’’ from the cold.
