97th’s planes had been put out of commission.  The 301st and 92nd Groups were also suffering from the spark- plug and generator shortage. They didn’t have enough tow-target planes or sleeves for gunnery training. Practice bombs for the 301st had arrived only the previous day; and the crews hadn’t even had a chance to learn to fly the close formations Eaker had found necessary in combat.  Spaatz suggested that they invent their own tow-targets, and if they didn’t have practice bombs, they should use 100-pound high explo- sive bombs on the practice ranges. He wanted the two new groups in action as near as possible to immediately  Though Spaatz may have felt it was his job to hustle Eaker, he was generally sympathetic to Bomber Command’s growing problems. He realized that in any new military organization, the maintenance and supply systems could create even more trouble than combat. An- ticipating his needs, Eaker had petitioned the British for a parts and repair facility and had been given an already-existing depot at Bur- tonwood in Lancashire, complete with a staff of technicians accus- tomed to working on the R.A.F.’s American-made aircraft. But unfortunately, Lancashire soon proved to be too far north and west to be convenient to East Anglia, where all the American operationa! bases were. Since there was still a shortage of trucks (or lorries) and since all the signposts had been removed from British roads in 1940 (to confuse the Germans in the event of an invasion), drivers had endless difficulties finding the little country towns near which the bases had been built.

They sent their own trucks to Burtonwood, driven by Americans who had been in England only a  149  ‘yoda va avin wily a  a tei tii ond ic ahhlon  (tc tion  ‘ith wee "heohin ita crak wiht hoon stat ‘pba bets iia sie ea lt a slain: siti sheng  when it was developing enough force to make an impression
