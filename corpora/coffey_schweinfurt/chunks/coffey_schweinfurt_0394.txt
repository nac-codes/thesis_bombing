nd methods. His reply (September 26) to Sinclair’s impatient letter was painstakingly  153  patient. There were, he told Sinclair, six American heavy-bomber squadrons (B-17s) operational. (The British squadron was roughly equivalent to the American group. Actually seven U.S. groups were now in England, but only three had seen combat.) Some of these groups, Slessor pointed out, were being prepared for what he called “ta certain operation’’ that severely restricted their use. This ‘certain operation’ was the planned North African invasion, still so secret he didn’t want to mention it on paper. He was very understanding, however, about the problems it had already created for the 8th Air Force  General Spaatz has suffered a setback by having to set aside his first units operational for the certain operation. He has now to start again at the beginning breaking in new units as they arrive. He is wisely doing this gradually . His crews arrive without ade- quate operational training, and in particular his gunners need more firing. We are now going into the difficult but important problem of getting them adequate range facilities.  Slessor still held out hope of an enormous U:S. air effort in Europe, but he could lend no comfort to Sinclair’s hope that the 8th Air Force would eventually convert to night bombing:  They intend to do precision bombing of Germany by daylight.  . They believe that with their good defensive armament they can do it when they get sufficient numbers. Their early operations lend some support to this belief—the B-17 has shown that it can defend itself and take an enormous amount of punishment. It has yet to be proved whether it is possible to carry the war deep into Germany by day. But they believe they will, and I personally am inclined to agree with them once they get really adequate numbers. . . . No, they have not yet bombed outside our fighter cover because they have not yet passed through Phase 1. But they have had several notable fights without
