have not dropped a single bomb in Germany. Is it true that they have not dropped a single bomb outside the range of our single seater fighter cover? . . .  What is their operational policy? . . . When do you think they will drop their first bomb on Germany? Will they start next month?  Is there any possibility that they will join in the night bombing of Germany? Is there any possibility that they will be able to damp the flames of the Flying Fortress sufficiently to bomb Germany? Do they contemplate the use of the Flying Fortress at night? If so, will it be sufficiently modified before the end of this year?  Air Marshal Slessor, to whom Sinclair addressed this letter, was more sympathetic toward American policies than any other high officer in the R.A.F. He had spent time in Washington, and he had spent time at 8th Air Force headquarters in Bushy Park, talking to Spaatz and Eaker about their hopes, problems, and methods. His reply (September 26) to Sinclair’s impatient letter was painstakingly  153  patient. There were, he told Sinclair, six American heavy-bomber squadrons (B-17s) operational. (The British squadron was roughly equivalent to the American group. Actually seven U.S. groups were now in England, but only three had seen combat.) Some of these groups, Slessor pointed out, were being prepared for what he called **a certain operation’ that severely restricted their use. This ‘‘certain operation’’ was the planned North African invasion, still so secret he didn’t want to mention it on paper. He was very understanding, however, about the problems it had already created for the 8th Air Force:  General Spaatz has suffered a setback by having to set aside his first units operational for the certain operation. He has now to start again at the beginning breaking in new units as they arrive. He is wisely doing this gradually . His crews arrive without ade- quate operational training, and in particular his gunners need more firing. We are now going into the difficult
