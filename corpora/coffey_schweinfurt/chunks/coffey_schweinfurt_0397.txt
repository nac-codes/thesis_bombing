units as they arrive. He is wisely doing this gradually . His crews arrive without ade- quate operational training, and in particular his gunners need more firing. We are now going into the difficult but important problem of getting them adequate range facilities.  Slessor still held out hope of an enormous U.S. air effort in Europe, but he could lend no comfort to Sinclair’s hope that the 8th Air Force would eventually convert to night bombing:  They intend to do precision bombing of Germany by daylight.  . They believe that with their good defensive armament they can do it when they get sufficient numbers. Their early operations lend some support to this belief—the B-17 has shown that it can defend itself and take an enormous amount of punishment. It has yet to be proved whether it is possible to carry the war deep into Germany by day. But they believe they will, and I personally am inclined to agree with them once they get really adequate numbers. . . . No, they have not yet bombed outside our fighter cover because they have not yet passed through Phase 1. But they have had several notable fights without fighter escort, in which they have given a good account of themselves. . . . Their bombing has been ex- tremely accurate as a rule. And I think we have seen enough of their performance in this and other theaters to be sure that their air crews are fine material. . . . General Spaatz intends to get into  154  Germany before the end of this year, and I think as good a guess as any would be . . . sometime in the first half of December.  Slessor also included an almost naked warning in this letter to Sinclair. There was a significant danger, he pointed out, in pushing the Americans too far away from their cherished policies. He was not certain that if their day bombing failed, they would then wholeheart- edly embrace night bombing:  I think that those Heavy groups already in this country when that situation arose would probably be modified and trained for night work
