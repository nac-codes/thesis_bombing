t Slessor had written a long letter impressing this attitude upon Sinclair (their official channel to Chur- chill) was so alarming that on the following day (September 27) Portal himself wrote a letter to Sinclair embracing an opposite view- point and showing only in isolated instances an effort to accommo- date Slessor’s ideas:  156  Germany before the end of this year, and I think as good a guess as any would be . . . sometime in the first half of December  Slessor also included an almost naked warning in this letter to Sinclair. There was a significant danger, he pointed out, in pushing the Americans too far away from their cherished policies. He was not certain that if their day bombing failed, they would then wholeheart- edly embrace night bombing:  I think that those Heavy groups already in this country when that situation arose would probably be modified and trained for night work. Whether they would attempt to build up the force I think is doubtful. . . . It would involve a fundamental readjustment of American air policy, with all its consequential repercussions on equipment and training. And I think it might well involve a sharp swing away from this theatre towards the PACIFIC.  Slessor’s immediate superior, Chief of Air Staff Portal, was not so sanguine about American prospects for success. By coincidence he asked for Slessor’s comments the same day (September 26) on a note he had prepared about the U.S. bomber force. In this note, Portal began by xnowledging that to him the great question was still “‘DAY”’ or ‘‘NIGHT.’’ He believed a good night bombing force could be quickly turned into a day bombing force, but it would be difficult to turn a day force into a night force because it would involve production as well as training. The hope that America might yet switch from the B-17 to the Lancaster was still with him:  The Americans will not get a night bomber force by the beginning of 1944 unless they start now. Are they going to start or are they going to
