(P) [Slessor] appears to have about whether the Americans will ever achieve their objective. I am particularly dubious on two points.  First, although it is quite easy to pick off small targets by day when you are not seriously opposed, it is an entirely different matter when you are being harassed all the time by fighters and fink... .  Secondly, there is the question of their ‘ammunition range’’ when unescorted. The Ruhr is 300 miles away, and assuming that the American fighters can go in 200 miles the Fortresses would have 200 miles to fly unescorted. Berlin is 550 miles and would involve 700 miles’ unescorted flying. . . . I do not believe that with uncontrolled wobble-guns they can shoot well enough to defend themselves for nearly three hours against fighter attack with the ammunition that the Fortress can carry.  My own prophecy . . . is this? The Americans will eventually be able to get as far as the Ruhr, suffering very much heavier casual- ties than we now suffer by night, and going much more rarely. They will in effect do area bombing. . . . I do not think that they will ever be able regularly to penetrate further than the Ruhr and perhaps Hamburg without absolutely prohibitive losses.  On the other hand, I have no doubt that if by the end of 1943 we had a force of 3,000 American heavy and medium bombers prop- erly trained for night flying to our standards,
