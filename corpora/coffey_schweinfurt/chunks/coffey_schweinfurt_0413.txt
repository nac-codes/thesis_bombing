more enthusiastic, that the big bombers of the United States are all right. They always were.  In time, with equal numbers, our large bombers may be able to accomplish just as much destruction with fewer raids at high altitudes as the British have done at low altitudes and lose fewer planes. It is still debatable, but the American big bomber is beginning to prove itself.’”  Churchill, in his minute to Portal, asked bluntly, ‘‘Is there the slightest truth in these American claims? What is the Air Ministry view?’’ Portal, after assigning aides to investigate, answered the Prime Minister the next day, October 13:  The Air Staff do not believe that anything like the numbers of enemy fighters claimed by the Americans on Friday were actually destroyed by them.  Our opinion is that not more than 60 German fighters were operating between Lille and the coast during the attack.  The British fighters escorting the greater part of the American bombers claim to have destroyed four Germans over Lille. The experts who analyse German R/T [radio transmission] traffic after a battle, have what they consider to be good indications of the shooting down of 10 Germans. They say that since they can only intercept part of the traffic, it is almost certain that more than 10 were shot down and judging by past results they put the probable number at about 20. Subtracting the 4 shot down by fighters, this would leave 16 for the Americans. . . .  If the Americans did in fact shoot down 16 Germans for the loss of 4 bombers, this is a very fine performance which is in no way spoilt by the excessive claim. It is unavoidable that when a German fighter catches fire or its pilot bails out after ten different air gunners have shot at it, three or four may honestly claim it and each obtain confirmation from someone else. . . .  Friday’s exploit by no means justifies the optimism in the  164  twenty damaged. This was impressive evidence that the B-17 could take care of itself. The fighters it had faced
