ys later in a “‘personal minute’’ on the subject to Portal. With it he enclosed a Reuters News Agency dispatch from the United States that was printed in the Yorkshire Evening Post that day (October 12):  American newspapers are naturally elated today about the un- precedented feat of the United States Flying Fortresses and Liberators in last Friday’s daylight raid on Lille in northern France, when the bombers shot down 48 German fighters and probably destroyed 38 others. [These were adjusted figures.]  The New York Mirror says: ‘‘The Lille raid established Ameri- can Flying Fortress and Liberator bombers as veritable battleships  163  of the air, self-sufficient for both offence and defence. The pursuit ship is becoming obsolescent and will be replaced by the many- gunned air cruiser.”*  The New York Times said: ‘‘There are suggestions from En- gland, reluctant at first, but now more enthusiastic, that the big bombers of the United States are all right. They always were.  In time, with equal numbers, our large bombers may be able to accomplish just as much destruction with fewer raids at high altitudes as the British have done at low altitudes and lose fewer planes. It is still debatable, but the American big bomber is beginning to prove itself.’”  Churchill, in his minute to Portal, asked bluntly, ‘‘Is there the slightest truth in these American claims? What is the Air Ministry view?’’ Portal, after assigning aides to investigate, answered the Prime Minister the next day, October 13:  The Air Staff do not believe that anything like the numbers of enemy fighters claimed by the Americans on Friday were actually destroyed by them.  Our opinion is that not more than 60 German fighters were operating between Lille and the coast during the attack.  The British fighters escorting the greater part of the American bombers claim to have destroyed four Germans over Lille.
