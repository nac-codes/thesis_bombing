increased from 90 to 196. In August, 108 Allied ships, more than one-half-million gross tons, were sunk, and the losses continued to increase through September and October. Ina telegram to Roosevelt’s assistant, Harry Hopkins, October 16, Churchill pleaded for help:  I am... . oppressed with the heavy U-boat sinkings and the biting need for more long range aircraft to harry the U-boats in their passage out and home from the Biscay ports and Northabout between Iceland and the Faroes, and to strike at the packs collect- ing round the slow convoys in mid-Atlantic. It would be of the greatest possible help to us if you could give us at least another 50 Liberators . . . to help the direct offensive against U-boats.  The 8th Air Force had already been invited to join the anti-U-boat campaign by attacking the submarine pens along the coast of France Both Spaatz and Eaker welcomed this operation because the sub-pens seemed to offer very promising, high-priority targets that could be attacked with relatively small forces. Eaker, in his August 27 bomb- ing-accuracy report to Spaatz, had said, ‘‘The present submarine menace can be almost entirely eliminated, not by searching for individual submarines in the sea lanes, but by destroying the sub- marine effort in the factory, in the yards where it is built, and in the bases from which it is launched.*”  165  The October weather kept frustrating his attempt to test this theory. Between the 9th and the 20th, eleven missions were initiated then canceled. Finally, on October 21, sixty-six B-17s and twenty-four B-24s set out to attack the submarine shelters at Lorient on the south coast of Brittany, at the top of the Bay of Biscay.  Though the ceiling had risen, the clouds had not dissipated, and only the thirty planes of the 97th Group were able to find an opening through which to bomb. As they descended to 17,500 feet for their bomb run, FW-190s arrived and shot down three of them in quick succession. Despite this untimely interru
