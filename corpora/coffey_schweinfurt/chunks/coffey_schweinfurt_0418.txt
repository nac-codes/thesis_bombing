were able to find an opening through which to bomb. As they descended to 17,500 feet for their bomb run, FW-190s arrived and shot down three of them in quick succession. Despite this untimely interruption, they were able to place twenty-one of their thirty one-ton bombs within a thousand yards of the aiming point. They scored direct hits on five concrete submarine shelters  When these results were confirmed by R.A.F. reconnaissance photos a few days later, Eaker had to temper his optimism about destroying the submarines in their pens. Despite the five direct hits, the American bombs had not done the slightest damage to the shel- ters. The concrete protecting the submarines proved to be more than twelve feet thick. When Eaker talked to Spaatz about this discovery, it was with considerable pessimism.9 Even a two-ton bomb was not likely to penetrate that much concrete. But neither Spaatz nor Eaker could cancel the campaign against the sub-pens now that it had begun. On October 26, they both talked to Eisenhower and found that he was counting on them to continue bombing the pens in support of the African invasion fleets.  Even if Eisenhower had been inclined to excuse them from bang- ing their bombs uselessly against the sub-pens, Churchill would not have tolerated it. The Prime Minister was becoming so excited at the prospect of driving the Germans out of Africa and thereby reopening the Mediterranean to British shipping that he wanted all possible resources devoted to the African campaign. Influenced partly, perhaps, by Portal’s slashing arguments September 26 and October 13 against American air strategy, he had now decided that the 8th Air Force as then constituted had little chance of inflicting significant damage within Germany’s borders. If the Americans were going to do any good at al! in the near future, they would have to be persuaded to devote their full air effort to the support of the North African campaign. On October 22, Churchill read to his Chiefs of St
