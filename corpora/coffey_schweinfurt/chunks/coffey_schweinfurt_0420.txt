boats  The 8th Air Force had already been invited to join the anti-U-boat campaign by attacking the submarine pens along the coast of France Both Spaatz and Eaker welcomed this operation because the sub-pens seemed to offer very promising, high-priority targets that could be attacked with relatively small forces. Eaker, in his August 27 bomb- ing-accuracy report to Spaatz, had said, ‘‘The present submarine menace can be almost entirely eliminated, not by searching for individual submarines in the sea lanes, but by destroying the sub- marine effort in the factory, in the yards where it is built, and in the bases from which it is launched.**  165  ‘youl tat ft  i  wit Navel veel  v i iad  Sati tls  yeaa  idle hs  relives  y  complete sincerity, and the dangers of daylight bombing will increase terribly once outside Fighter protection and as the range lengthens  The shift in Churchill’s thinking about what to do with the Ameri- can Air Force embarrassed Sinclair and Portal because he was now using their own arguments against American air policy in an apparent effort to take the 8th Air Force away from the project which was dearest to them—the bomber offensive against Germany—and de- vote it instead to a project which had become dear to him—the invasion of North Africa—but which the Air Ministry disapproved. Sinclair and Portal, like Eaker and Harris, regarded the African campaign as an unfortunate diversion from the one campaign they felt could win the war: the bombing of Germany. While Sinclair and Portal might not like the way the Americans intended to go about it, they very much counted on the 8th Air Force to join the R.A.F. in some kind of massive effort against Germany.
