The Americans have such vast resources of production that they can afford to pick and choose, chop and change, to an extent unpardonable over here. We ought to press them by every means to adopt a highly selective attitude and think less of target numbers than of producing the right designs. Especially we should urge them to take up night bombing on a large scale. . . . We should urge them to build Lancasters for us or, if this is impossible, supply parts on a great scale for a Canadian assembly plant. We should urge the development of the Mustang (P-51 fighter plane) with the right engines.  In Churchill’s telegram to Hopkins (October 16) ‘‘on these delicate subjects,’’ he was no more delicate than in his address to his Chiefs of Staff. After insisting that the United States should develop night bombers and should produce Mustang fighters powered by advanced Rolls Royce engines, which ‘‘in Portal’s view would be far ahead of anything in the fighter line you have in hand,’’ he suggested to Hopkins that he should not believe everything he heard about the B-17:  I must also say to you for your eye alone and only to be used by you in your high discretion that the very accurate results so far achieved in the daylight bombing of France by your Fortresses under most numerous Fighter escort mainly British, does not give our experts the same confidence as yours in the power of the day bomber to operate far into Germany.
