Sinclair and Portal, like Eaker and Harris, regarded the African campaign as an unfortunate diversion from the one campaign they felt could win the war: the bombing of Germany. While Sinclair and Portal might not like the way the Americans intended to go about it, they very much counted on the 8th Air Force to join the R.A.F. in some kind of massive effort against Germany.  When Churchill asked Roosevelt in mid-September for a faster build-up of the 8th Air Force in England, pretending even to support day bombing in his desperation to attract more planes and crews, the men at the Air Ministry could agree completely with his strategy because they presumed the newly arriving planes would be used against Germany. But Portal, in his October 13 minute to Churchill discounting American gunnery claims and deploring pessimistically the American daylight policy, did not take into account Churchill’s growing concern about the submarine menace and the grave danger it presented to the African invasion fleet.

Their position was delicate, however, because the
