of German power. It is in your power to crystallise American opinion and to unite it behind those schools of thought which want to attack Germany and want to do it by building up an overwhelming force of bombers in this country.  Instead, however, of uniting those schools of thought, . . . you will throw these forces into confusion and impotency if you set yourself against their cherished policy of daylight penetration.  In the opinion of the Air Staff, and in my own inexpert opinion, this policy of daylight penetration has a chance of success, if only they can get the numbers and if only they are not rushed by impatience into taking on heavy opposition with half-trained gun- NETS... 25  If it succeeds it will be possible in the earliest months of next year for us to send a thousand bombers over Hamburg one night, for the Americans to follow up with 500 or 600 bombers the following day and, if the weather is kind, for us to follow up with a large force of heavy bombers the next night—and then to go on bombing one city after another in Germany on that scale . Ifit fails, it will at least do a lot of damage to the German fighter force in the process... .  The American Air Force in this country are determined to try out this theory. They are not irresolute; they are being hampered by diversions of their best trained crews to ‘‘Torch’’ and by the slow arrival of their bomber squadrons. Already, however, they have got as far as Lorient outside the shelter of our fighter cover, and bombed their target with astonishing accuracy. . . . Itis their firm intention to drop bombs on Germany in daylight next month. It would be a tragedy if we were to frustrate them on the eve of this great experiment.  To ally ourselves with the American Navy against General  169  Spaatz and General Eaker and the United States Air Force in this country, and to force them into diverting their highly trained crews to scaring U-boats instead of to the bombing of Germany would be disastrous.
