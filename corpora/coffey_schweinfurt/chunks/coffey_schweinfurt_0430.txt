I hope that, having got them on the trade routes for this purpose, they will remain there and help to control the Bay of Biscay, both against U-boats and enemy blockade runners. The alternative would be to take more Lancaster squadrons from Bomber Command, which I have been trying my best to prevent for a long time past.

He and Portal agreed that, in Portal’s words, “no reply is called for.’’ But they could not resist answering Chur-  171  chill two days later, in effect, when they sent him their comments on his week-old Air Policy statement.

They are convinced that they will be able to
