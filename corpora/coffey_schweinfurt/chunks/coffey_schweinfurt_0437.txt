The weather had kept his entire force on the ground since October 21. In two months, since September 7, his bombers had been able to fly only three missions. (By this time Churchill must have begun to think that even his six-missions-a-month prediction was too optimistic.) Final- ly, on November 7, Eaker was permitted by the weather to send his  174  cities excessively, the planes under his command never dropped a bomb that Churchill (and indeed the entire British and American nations) did not approve and applaud. Every mission Bomber Com- mand launched was covered by Churchill orders. Stung by the pun- ishment of British civilians in the Battle of Britain and painfully aware of how close the people in east London came to rebellion as a result of the German bombs they had to absorb at the height of the blitz, Churchill was convinced that the punishment of German work- ers would greatly diminish their industrial output, eventually paralyze the German war effort, and perhaps even give rise to a rebellion against Hitler. Churchill did not intend ever to suspend this offensive. Under Portal’s inadvertent influence, however, he had come to the conclusion that the American contribution to it was likely to be almost worthless. In a letter to Portal (November 2, 1942), he bluntly said so, citing some of Portal’s earlier words to strengthen his points:  The number of American Air Force personnel [in England] has risen to about fifty-five thousand So far the results have been pitifully small. . . . Far from dropping bombs on Germany, the daylight bombers have not ventured beyond Lille. Twenty-one bombing raids have been carried out on France and two on Hol- land, and in almost every case they have required very strong British Fighter escort. . . . The claims of the Fortresses are prob- ably exaggerated three fold (see minute from C.A.S. [Portal] attached). A reasonable estimate is that they have actually shot down twenty-eight enemy aircraft for the loss of eight Fortresses
