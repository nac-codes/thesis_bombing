Because his formation demanded for the sake of accuracy a straight bomb run without any evasive action to avoid flak or bullets, it suffered a costly debut when he tried it out on the first mission of 1943—January 3 against St. Nazaire.2 Gale-force head- winds prolonged the bomb run that day for more than nine minutes. So many planes were hit that nine of them fell before reaching home. LeMay’s ideas, however, were not blamed for these heavy losses. His formation was such an obvious improvement over the old one that the only question about it was not whether to continue it but how to refine it.  General Spaatz had gone to Africa with Eisenhower, and General Eaker had taken over as 8th Air Force commander. His replacement as bomber commander, Brig. Gen. Newton Longfellow, soon found an unfortunate situation developing in the 306th Group at Thurleigh. The very popular commander of this unit, Col. Charles ‘‘Chip’’ Overacker, was so solicitous of his men that their discipline began to suffer.
