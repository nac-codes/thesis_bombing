a father, Overacker sometimes let them get around him. LeMay, on the other hand, was the kind of man no one could get around. It was not because he was a nice guy that his men referred to him as ‘‘Iron Ass.”” He was so tough they feared him. Yet many of them later credited him with saving their lives by forcing them to meet his standards.  Longfellow and Eaker, perceiving that the standards of the 306th were falling below those of the other groups, decided a change would have to be made. Again, Eaker called upon Col. Frank Armstrong, one of his six original staff members. The previous August, when troubles developed in the 97th Group, Armstrong had taken charge of it, led it on the 8th Air Force’s first mission, and soon made it the Bomber Command’s best group. After the 8th had five missions to its credit, Eaker, addressing Spaatz on the importance of leadership, had said, ‘‘It is not accidental that the three operations which Colonel Armstrong has led were completely successful, while the two opera- tions led by other officers resulted in one aborted mission and one with serious injuries to two aircraft.’’ Eaker thought so  177  highly of Armstrong he had held him back when the 97th Group left for Africa. Now he sent him to Thurleigh to command the 306th. It might take a while for the men there to get to like him, but in the meantime, they would respect him.3 (This incident later became famous as the central theme of the novel Twelve O’clock High, written by another of Eaker’s original six, Capt. Beirne Lay, Jr. and by one of General Spaatz’s staff officers, Maj. Sy Bartlett.)  The four intact B-17 groups still with the 8th Bomber Command (91st, 303rd, 305th, and 306th) had now flown an average of eight missions per group, and Eaker had long since decided they were ready for their first trip to Germany. But since mid-December, Germany had been cloudy every day. On the few occasions the Fortresses could get off the ground, they had no choice but to head south for
