th sides as the best of the widely used fighter planes in World War II  It was this plane that Churchill (October 16, 1942) told Harry Hopkins the Americans should hasten into production because Portal had told him it would be *‘far ahead of anything in the fighter line you have in hand.’’¢ Unfortunately, the American Air Force Test Facility at Wright Field, Ohio, had already decided the plane was unworthy of development, not only because it was underpowered but also because its liquid-cooled engine would presumably be more susceptible to bullet damage than an air-cooled radial engine. It is difficult to imagine how this conclusion was reached in light of the combat successes of the liquid-cooled German ME- 109 and the British Spit- fire. The Spitfire used the Rolls Royce Merlin engine. The Wright Field refusal to take the Mustang seriously was a chief reason that radial-engine P-47 Thunderbolts were now arriving in England in- stead of Mustangs. Eventually this technical assessment by Air Force experts at Wright Field would be recognized as one of the most unfortunate mistakes of the entire war. Reliance on their judgment delayed for at least six months the acknowledgment by high Air Force officials of the need for mass production of the P-51. Had the Merlin-powered Mustang been hastened into production as soon as possible after British tests proved its merits, it might have appeared in the skies over Europe, protecting the American bombers, during the early months of 1943.  Though Eaker knew about the British modification of the Mustang and realized it was a superior plane, he needed fighters so badly he took what he could get. To wait now for P-51s would cause another  179  intolerable delay. And to suggest that American factories convert from Thunderbolts to Mustangs would be to court an even longer delay. It would create an uproar within an already harried American aircraft industry. The Thunderbolt was undoubtedly a good airplane.  Eaker the pated the  refore
