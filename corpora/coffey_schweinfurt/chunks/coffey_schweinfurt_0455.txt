Eaker, not wishing to lose this option, thanked Winterbotham for the Prime Minister’s kind offer but suggested that the 8th Air Force Intelligence chief be chosen as his surrogate for Ultra secrets.  Churchill had been cordial to Eaker whenever they met, and this indication of personal trust, even though the American general de- clined to take advantage of it, was very gratifying to him. He would have been mistaken, however, to suppose it signified an acceptance of American air policy by the Prime Minister.
