profitable to the war effort if we were to continue our daylight bombing while the R.A.F. continues its night bombing.”’ Churchill took in hand the piece of paper and sat down on a long couch, motioning for Eaker to sit beside him. He began reading the brief, half to himself, half aloud, mumbling some of the words and enunciating clearly others that seemed to appeal to him. Eaker noticed with satisfaction that when he came to the sentence about bombing the devils around the clock so they would have no rest, he “‘rolled the words off his tongue as though they were tasty morsels.”” After Churchill finished reading, he showed no indication that he was convinced. He still ‘‘regretted that so much effort had been put into the daylight bombing,’’ and he still thought the Americans would now be delivering more bombs to Germany if they had begun with night operations. As for the question of accuracy at night, new scientific methods were being developed to take care of that. Eaker augmented verbally the case he had put on paper by stating it in greater detail. Churchill was impressed by the ‘powerful earnest- ness,’’ the ‘‘skill and tenacity’’ with which the American general made his points. He mentioned the immense preparations that had already gone into the build-up of the 8th Air Force in England.

The British had been led to believe a year earlier in Washington that within four or five months American aircraft would be making very heavy deliveries of bombs. Eaker said it was quite true they had not yet struck their blow. He  188  1. Day bombing is more accurate and can destroy obsc important targets the night bombers can’t find.
