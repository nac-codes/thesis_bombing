rale of our bomber forces, due to the failure to build them up. . . .  I have done a lot of thinking on this situation and I urge that a cable such as the enclosed be sent by you to the War Department. If you agree to send it I should like authority to pass to my units a copy of the cable you send, in order to show them the efforts you are making to support them.  The cable Eaker had provided for Andrews’s signature was hardly a modest proposal. It began by pointing out that the only U.S. force which could hope to fight the German war machine in Germany during the coming year was the 8th Air Force:  Its experiment in daylight bombing has been markedly success- ful even with the very small force which has been available. It could be a tremendous factor in the depreciation of the German war machine and German civil morale if built to significant propor- tions, a minimum of three hundred heavy bombers operational at once  Eaker knew that such a force was out of the question at the moment, but he had better ask for 300 if he hoped to get even 150. His average daily combat strength in February had been 84 planes and 74 crews. And it would surely be better to ask for them over Andrews’s signature than over his own.  At the same time, Eaker was enlarging his campaign by enlisting the British. On the last day of the month, Portal sent Arnold a cable that was almost certainly inspired by Eaker:  I told you in my message of 19th February how great an impor- tance I attached to building up our day and night offensive against Germany. This offensive is of the highest strategical importance and is hitting Germany hard at a time when the Russian successes on the eastern front, the hard struggle in the Mediterranean and the constant air fighting in the west have so stretched Germany’s resources that the strain on her industrial organization and on the civil population generally is intense. . . .
