M. Andrews, a highly respected senior Air Force officer, to replace General Eisenhower as commander of all Ameri- can forces in the European Theater of Operations. Eaker, who had worked under Andrews on several occasions before the war, wel- comed him happily to London and began immediately to enlist him in the 8th Air Force build-up campaign. The paper bombardment began February 27 with a letter to Andrews that included an apparently solicited letter from one of Eaker’s preenlisted advocates, and, in addition, a ready-made cable that Eaker hoped Andrews would send to General Marshall over his own signature. Eaker’s letter said:  193  Enclosed is a personal letter to me from Brigadier General Frank Armstrong which I commend to your reading.

The cable Eaker had provided for Andrews’s signature was hardly a modest proposal. It began by pointing out that the only U.S. force which could hope to fight the German war machine in Germany during the coming year was the 8th Air Force:  Its experiment in daylight bombing has been markedly success- ful even with the very small force which has been available.

Eaker knew that such a force was out of the question at the moment, but he had better ask for 300 if he hoped to get even 150. His average daily combat strength in February had been 84 planes and 74 crews. And it would surely be better to ask for them over Andrews’s si
