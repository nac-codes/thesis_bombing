And it would surely be better to ask for them over Andrews’s signature than over his own.  At the same time, Eaker was enlarging his campaign by enlisting the British. On the last day of the month, Portal sent Arnold a cable that was almost certainly inspired by Eaker:  I told you in my message of 19th February how great an impor- tance I attached to building up our day and night offensive against Germany.
