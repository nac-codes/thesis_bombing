no shipping in March or April. This makes it appear that we are not to build up an increased force of heavy bombers to be available this spring. . . . There is only one thing that we require here to do a job—the job that will hurt the enemy most, and that is an adequate force. . . .  We have, to date, received but 24 replacement crews and 63 replacement aircraft. We have lost 75 planes and crews in 2,206 sorties. We feel, therefore, obliged to save our force for days when we can deliver maximum effort under favourable conditions, until we can get a larger force, and until the flow of replacements matches expenditure. We never have, and never will, let one of these days pass without operating at maximum effort.  One outcome of the Casablanca conference was the appointment of Lt. Gen. Frank M. Andrews, a highly respected senior Air Force officer, to replace General Eisenhower as commander of all Ameri- can forces in the European Theater of Operations. Eaker, who had worked under Andrews on several occasions before the war, wel- comed him happily to London and began immediately to enlist him in the 8th Air Force build-up campaign. The paper bombardment began February 27 with a letter to Andrews that included an apparently solicited letter from one of Eaker’s preenlisted advocates, and, in addition, a ready-made cable that Eaker hoped Andrews would send to General Marshall over his own signature. Eaker’s letter said:  193  closed is a personal eter tome from Brigadier General Frank Anntrong which commend to your reading It eflects the very setous depression in morale of our bomber forces, due tothe failure to build them up. have done alot of thinking on this situation and Tug that a cable such asthe enclosed eset by youtothe War Department.
