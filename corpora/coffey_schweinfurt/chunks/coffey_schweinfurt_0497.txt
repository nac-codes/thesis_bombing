e British couldn’t believe the Americans were that good, and Eaker was inclined to go partway toward agreeing with the British. He knew that several gunners, shooting at the same fighter and seeing it fall, would all claim it. But aside from instituting the R.A.F. rules for allowing claims and intensifying intelligence questioning after each mission, he was loathe to discount the figures publicly. He believed he would be a poor commander if he said to a man who had just risked his life to reach a target, ‘‘I don’t believe your report.’’3 In speaking to his crews, which he did once a week at one air base or another, he had said on several occasions that he supposed some of them were shooting at the same fighters and therefore, through no fault of theirs, double-claiming some kills.

Both men were in expansive moods that day. Harris told the newsmen the British and Americans were serenely and completely cooperative with each other.

Since wartime conditions had prevented her from accompanying Eaker to England, she was not yet acquainted with Lady Jill Harris, but the two had at least one thing in common: both
