for the American air effort, giving the distinct impression that he no longer disapproved of daylight bombing. After dinner he let drop a gentle hint that he wished it would develop more quickly. He proposed that they send a cable to Arnold in Washington which would say: ‘‘We are dining together, smoking your cigars, and  199  waiting for more of your heavy bombers. Signed Churchill, An- drews, Harris, Eaker.’”  In a letter to Arnold after this dinner, Eaker said, “‘It was quite evident that he [Churchill] is fully in accord with the day bomber offensive.’’+ Here, in fact, was another example of the ease with which Churchill could give misleading impressions of his actual thinking. Unknown to Eaker, the Prime Minister just two weeks earlier (March 13) had sent another minute to Portal that showed he still had heavy doubts about the American policy. Commenting on a note from Air Marshal Arthur Tedder, the British Mediterranean air commander, Churchill wrote to Portal:  The real question is not whether ‘‘the American heavy bombers can in fact penetrate into Germany by day without prohibitive losses,’’ but how often can they do it and what weight of bombs can they discharge for the vast mass of ground personnel and material involved.  Once again Portal had quickly come to the defense of American day bombing. He pointed out to Churchill that it ‘tis bound to be more accurate and ton for ton will probably do as much industrial damage and kill far more Germans than our average in night raids.’ Churchill was still not convinced. He gave the opposite impression, however, at that 8th Air Force dinner in his honor.  When Eaker mentioned during his optimistic March 24 press conference that ‘hundreds of United States bombers will be operat- ing from Britain by the middle of this summer,”’ it was fortunate that he hadn’t quoted any exact figures. On that very day, Amold was sending him a letter that hedged on his earlier build-up hopes:  I sincerely appreciate your problems and
