list the British and their prestige in his design. Arnold’s March 24 letter to Portal was his opening move. He gave it for hand delivery to a well-instructed member of his staff, Col. C. P. Cabell, who took it to London and, before delivering it, discussed it thoroughly with Andrews, Eaker, and several of Eaker’s men.  It was a few days before Cabell reached London and a week before he took the letter to Portal, along with one signed by General Eaker. Eaker’s letter introduced Cabell, who was there, he said, to discuss  205  ‘‘an idea close to General Arnold’s heart.’’?

If armed with this evidence General Arnold will then be in a position to present it to the Combined Chiefs of Staff and obtain from them, we hope, an agreement and directive which will make the build-up of our air forces in this theater to that size first priority of the U.S.  Portal was receptive because he understood sympathetically Ar- nold’s need for such a document, and because he knew it would not be designed to affect British operations in any substantive way. He assigned one of his men to a committee of American officers whom Andrews and Eaker had selected, and this nominally Anglo- American committee went to work drafting a document they called the Combined Bomber Offensive Plan. They thrashed out the details with the help of Arnold’s operations analysts’ report, a lot of informa- tion from the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and careful attention to Arnold’s instruction. As soon as they were finished, they submitted their plan to Eaker, who made some changes, wrote a summary,
