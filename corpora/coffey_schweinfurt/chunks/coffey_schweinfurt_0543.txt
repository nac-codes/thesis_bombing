had an edge on the FW-190 ‘‘in firepower and in any combat where they start with an initial height advantage.”’  At the time of Lovett’s visit, the P-47s had experienced very limited contact with the latest (G-model) ME-109, but the pilots were much impressed by it. ‘“The majority of the experienced pilots feel that the 109G has a definite edge on them in all the important fighter  217  characteristics and they will, therefore, have to adjust their tactics accordingly.””  Their suggestions for improving the P-47 included larger propel- lers to increase climb rate and general performance, water injection boosters for emergency power, a canopy bulge for better rear visibili- ty, more flexible rudder controls, and ‘‘belly tanks with adequate pumps to operate at altitudes of 30,000 feet or over.’ As a result of his visit, Lovett had come to some specific conclusions about the use of fighters in the European Theater:  It is increasingly apparent that fighter escort will have to be provided for B-17s on as many missions as possible in order particularly to get them through the first wave of the German fighter defense, which is now put up in depth so that the B-17s are forced to run the gauntlet both into the target and out from it. The P-47s can serve as top cover if satisfactory belly tanks are de- veloped for them. The ideal plane, however, now in production is the P-38 for long escort duty. Its two engines are a definite advantage and, strangely enough, its ease of recognition is a definite protection to both B-17s and the escorting fighters themselves.  In time, the two-engines on the Lockheed twin-fuselage P-38 and the large size of the plane were to create problems for it against the smaller but more maneuverable German fighters. Lovett’s predic- tions for it were too optimistic. The last paragraph of his memo, however, contained a seemingly offhand remark that would one day prove to have greater import than anything else he had said:  High hopes are felt for the P
