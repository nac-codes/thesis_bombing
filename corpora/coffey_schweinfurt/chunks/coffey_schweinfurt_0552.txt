s supposed to be 300 to 400 miles with the 200-gallon drop-tanks Eaker had got from the States. This range took into account the high use during formation flying, at least twenty minutes for actual combat, and a comfortable reserve if the planes cruised at about 75 percent of maximum power.?!  In practice, the P-47s with drop tanks had shown a range of only about 170 miles, and Hunter’s policy of sweeping an area rather than patroling a corridor was only one factor responsible for this limita- tion. More important was his understandable fear that if his planes took off overloaded with extra gasoline, they would be too slow to cope with the Germans, and his pilots would be burned up as well as shot down. This consideration had led him at first to oppose the use of any auxiliary tanks. When he eventually agreed they were necessary, he remained unenthusiastic about them. In fact, no one was very enthusiastic about the type of auxiliary tank available at that time. Besides lowering the plane’s speed and maneuverability, the tank was difficult to install and didn’t work very efficiently at high  222  altitudes. But Eaker was certain that if used cleverly it could be more helpful than it was. He wanted the fighters to climb to maximum ceiling and fly as far as possible on their drop tanks, even avoiding combat if necessary until those tanks were emptied and released.  It was standard operating procedure for Hunter’s pilots to drop their heavy belly tanks as soon as they reached ceiling, even though as much as eighty gallons of gasoline remained in them. The pilots were in a hurry to get rid of them because they were also eager to use up, before going into combat, the fuel in another auxiliary tank, which was directly behind their seats. This tank’s proximity to the pilot made him uncomfortably aware of being a potential human torch, and the weight of the gasoline there altered the plane’s perfor- mance unfavorably by shifting the center of gravity.  While a fighter pilot
