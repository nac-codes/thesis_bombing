him uncomfortably aware of being a potential human torch, and the weight of the gasoline there altered the plane’s perfor- mance unfavorably by shifting the center of gravity.  While a fighter pilot undoubtedly increased his risk to some degree by engaging in combat with the tank behind him full of fuel, the bomber crews were already increasing their risks by flying missions unescorted most of the way. And it was the bombers that were doing the primary, essential job of attacking important enemy installations. What was the purpose of the fighter planes if not to protect them? What good were the fighters when the bombers were getting credit for almost all of the enemy planes shot down? Hunter, concerned about his young pilots, fended off these arguments, insisting that his men wouldn’t be able to accomplish what Eaker expected of them until they had more experience.  Because Eaker had no one in England qualified to replace Hunter, he had been slow to resolve this issue.?? But in early June, faced with the evident build-up of German fighter strength in western Europe, he decided he had to settle the matter. He asked Arnold to send him a new fighter commander and suggested two candidates. One was Maj. Gen. Barney M. Giles, at present an aide to Arnold; the other was Maj. Gen. William Kepner, a tough, able fighter expert.  By the time Eaker sent his unsolicited request for a new fighter commander, more than a month had elapsed since Arnold’s sugges- tion that he find a new bomber commander. Eaker soon received a letter (June 11) not from Arnold but from Giles, who apparently wanted to warn him about Armold’s frame of mind. Arnold had returned from Florida only a few days earlier and, according to Giles, looked in the best of health. ‘‘No doubt the badly needed rest did him a great deal of good.’’24 As Giles very well knew, however, despite  223  the vacation, Amold’s heart condition was still precarious and his patience was limited. Though Giles didn’t mention it in hi
