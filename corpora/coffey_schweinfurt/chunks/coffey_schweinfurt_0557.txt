would be no more action, were cleaning their guns when the last wave of German fighters struck. Arnold was not in a good mood as he sat down to write Eaker June 15:  All reports I have received have admitted that your maintenance over there is not satisfactory and yet you have not taken any steps to recommend removal of those responsible, nor have you attempted to put in men who can do the job.
