, force, and executive ability to carry out this plan.”  Within the next three days, Arnold had received an answer from Eaker explaining once more why he could send out only 250 planes in one day, how much work was required to maintain aircraft in combat, how long it took to repair and patch bullet-riddled planes, and how easy it was to run short of combat crews. But Arnold also knew by that time the sorry results of the June 11 Wilhelmshaven raid in which  225  one of the lead planes, hit by flak on the bomb run, almost collided with several others, scattering the formations behind it and thereby also scattering the bombs. And he had time to learn about the disastrous strike against the Kiel submarine yards two days later in which fighter resistance was so strong only sixteen planes managed to bomb the harbor area and twenty-six were lost, some of them because crewmen of the 94th Group, nearing home and convinced there would be no more action, were cleaning their guns when the last wave of German fighters struck. Arnold was not in a good mood as he sat down to write Eaker June 15:  All reports I have received have admitted that your maintenance over there is not satisfactory and yet you have not taken any steps to recommend removal of those responsible, nor have you attempted to put in men who can do the job.  Arnold realized, he said, that the new planes had to be modified and the damaged planes had to be repaired. He knew it took time to get crews ready for operations, but he didn’t know how there could be a shortage of them:  I do know that we have been sending over quite a few combat crews month after month. I also realize that when you lose a plane over Germany, the crew goes with it, but I cannot accept the fact that when a plane is shot up the whole crew is knocked out. There must be some salvage and from this salvage we should be able to make up crews which can operate.  In a handwritten afterthought, he threatened that if Eaker had no partial crews to buil
