From Arnold’s viewpoint in Washington, it was hard to accept explanations for all the difficulties developing day by day in England, especially since they were of a size and type never before encountered by an American air combat unit. He was convinced the maintenance problem was basically a personnel problem and that the men under Eaker were to blame.  On the 12th, Arnold fired off to Eaker a cable ‘further relative to”” a previous cable on the “low percentage of airplanes your organiza- tion has been able to keep in commission.’’ If Eaker was already having maintenance trouble with his present force, he asked, how much more trouble would he have when he received “‘the very large additional number of ‘airplanes assigned to your theater within the next few months?’’ What Eaker needed, he insisted was a ‘‘clearcut supply and maintenance plan’’ and ‘‘an air service commander with sufficient initiative, force, and executive ability to carry out this plan.’”  Within the next three days, Arnold had received an answer from Eaker explaining once more why he could send out only 250 planes in one day, how much work was required to maintain aircraft in combat, how long it took to repair and patch bullet-riddled planes, and how easy it was to run short of combat crews. But Arnold also knew by that time the sorry results of the June 11 Wilhelmshaven raid in which  225  cone ofthe lead planes, ht by flak onthe bomb run, almost collided with several others, satering the formation behind it and thereby also searing the bombs, And be had time to learn about the cisasttous strike against the Kiel submarine yards two days later in which fighter resistance was so stong ony sixteen planes managed to bomb the harbor area and twenty-six were los, some of them because crewmen of the 94th Group, nearing home and convinced thee would benomore action, were cleaning their guns when the last wave of German fighters stuck, Armold was nt in a good mood ashe sat wn to write Eak
