over the city, however, because it was known that there were fewer antiaircraft batteries along that route. The Germans did not waste antiaircraft artillery defending the populations of occupied cities, especially since they were aware of the Allied policy to leave such cities alone.  Realizing it was the safest route, Gen. Robert Williams, comman- der of the First Bombardment Wing, had expressly directed the three groups to fly over Brussels on the way to the airfield.!  As they moved through the clear blue skies above the city, the B-17s encountered no flak, no opposition of any kind since the German fighters stationed at the field were apparently many miles  231  away, attacking the St. Nazaire force. With Col. Budd Peaslee and his 384th Group in the lead and two other groups in a column of formations behind, the Fortresses flew directly across the center of Brussels on their bomb run. The bomb-bay doors of all the planes were open. The bombardiers in every plane had taken control and were carefully checking their bomb-sights, ready to release their loads the moment the lead bombardier in each group released his load.  Just ahead now, in one of Brussels’ better residential districts, was a beautiful rectangular green park surrounded by fine homes. The 384th Group passed this park and Colonel Peaslee, in the lead plane, was looking back at it when he noticed a terrible mistake in progress. One of the two groups behind his had released all of its bombs, presumably on the signal of that group’s lead bombardier. The park and the houses at its edge suddenly exploded *‘in a mighty series of bomb bursts.’’ Peaslee’s bombardier shouted over the interphone, **‘My God!

When the three groups reached home, Peaslee didn’t yet know which of the other two had committ
