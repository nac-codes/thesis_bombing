e range of the B-17, more than seven hundred mil: was not, however, outside th  engage. We have here complete target data on each of these. My proposal is, therefore, that I send two officers, one especially qualified on the Intelligence side and the other on the Operations side, for conferences with you and your staff to work out the joint plan for doing this job.  Asan afterthought, Baker also asked Spaatz to send back ‘‘as soon as possible our three Liberator (B-24) groups now with you.”” He adn't yet forgotten the four groups taken from him for the African invasion (including also one B-17 group), but his request for thei return was pro forma.
