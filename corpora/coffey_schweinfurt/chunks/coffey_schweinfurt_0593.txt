and Kiel (where they dropped 200 tons of bombs and three quarters of a million propaganda leaflets over the shipyards), and on the 30th, it was Kassel. This time only 186 B-17s took off, and 12 did not return. The weather was clear the next day, but the 8th Air Force was quiet. After six missions in seven days, 100 planes were gone and 1,000 men were either dead, missing, or wounded. Eaker had not underesti- mated the price he would have to pay for this offensive. The survivors needed a rest.  An indication of how badly the men needed a rest can be found in the fact that about seventy-five of them suffered emotional break- downs during July 1943. Fear was the basic cause. Nearly all crew members suffered some degree of fear at one or more stages before, during, or after a mission. But fear was only one of several horren- dous problems the bomber crews encountered.  Almost as hazardous was the need to avoid flak by flying at high altitudes where the air was as frigid as it was thin. The B-17 was nota pressurized airplane. There was no such thing at that time. At 20,000 feet, the men had to use oxygen masks. Nor could the plane be heated when several of its guns had to be fired through open windows. The result was that for every three men wounded in combat, four were disabled by frostbite. Flight surgeons estimated that more than half of  242  engage. We have here complete target data on each of these. My proposal is, therefore, that I send two officers, one especially qualified on the Intelligence side and the other on the Operations side, for conferences with you and your staff to work out the joint plan for doing this job.  As an afterthought, Eaker also asked Spaatz to send back ‘‘as soon as possible our three Liberator (B-24) groups now with you.’’ He hadn’t yet forgotten the four groups taken from him for the African invasion (including also one B-17 group), but his request for their return was pro forma. He must have realized by now that he would have to go to
