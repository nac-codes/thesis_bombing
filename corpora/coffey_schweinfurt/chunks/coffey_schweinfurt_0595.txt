to be known in the 8th as “‘Blitz Week.”’  The Forts returned to Germany the next day to hit Kiel, Hamburg, and Warnemiinde. This time the Germans were ready. Nineteen  241  bombers were lost, and clouds limited the accuracy of the bombing. The clouds were even heavier on the 26th, completely frustrating more than 200 of the planes that took off. But 92 others attacked a rubber factory at Hanover with such accuracy that 21 direct hits were recorded and smoke arose to a height of 22,000 feet. Unpromising weather gave the crews a rest on the 27th. The following day 302 B-17s went after aircraft factories in Kassel and Oschersleben. Clouds held the First Wing to limited success at Kassel, but the Fourth Wing, led by Col. Fred Castle, one of Eaker’s original six staff officers and now commander of the 94th Group, had better luck against a Focke-Wulf plant at Oschersleben. After bad weather scattered the Wing’s formations, Castle found that he had behind him only his own group plus a few planes from the 96th. Moving persis- tently forward, they managed to find a break in the clouds just as they approached the target, and their bombs caused a month’s production loss—possibly 50 FW-190s. Fifteen B-17s failed to return home that day  On the 29th, the Forts returned to Warnemiinde and Kiel (where they dropped 200 tons of bombs and three quarters of a million propaganda leaflets over the shipyards), and on the 30th, it was Kassel. This time only 186 B-17s took off, and 12 did not return. The weather was clear the next day, but the 8th Air Force was quiet. After six missions in seven days, 100 planes were gone and 1,000 men were either dead, missing, or wounded. Eaker had not underesti- mated the price he would have to pay for this offensive. The survivors needed a rest.  An indication of how badly the men needed a rest can be found in the fact that about seventy-five of them suffered emotional break- downs during July 1943. Fear was the basic cause. Nearly all crew members s
