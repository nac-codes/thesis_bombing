The older men in the barracks would take delight in describing what a 20-mm. shell could do to a man’s brains, or what his feet would look like a few days after they were frozen. When new men went to their first briefing, veterans would tell them to be sure and shut the door because they wouldn’t be coming back. And it was a special pleasure for the veterans to go through a new arrival’s belongings and ask him which items he woul bequeath them when he was shot down.)
