o nausea, tremors, or diarrhea. One copilot, after seeing his pilot killed, put his arms over his eyes and ignored the controls. A gunner, on the wing of a plane ditched in the Channel, leaped into water covered with flaming gasoline when he could have scrambled over to the other side of the fuselage where there was no fire on the water. But the kind of man who experienced his emotional breakdown in action was rare. Most of the breakdowns came gradually, after an accumulation of difficult experiences or a period of brooding apprehension.  One first lieutenant, a pilot who ‘‘broke down’’ during “‘Blitz Week,’’ had flown sixteen missions before succumbing to the pressure = His first, to Lorient April 16, had been a rough introduction to combat. Two of his engines were shot out and he had a difficult time getting home, but he made it without injuries to any of his crew. The next day he went to Bremen, where the Germans put a lot of holes in his ship, but again he brought it home safely. Most of his missions were rough. He went to Bremen twice and Kiel twice, as well as Lorient, St. Nazaire, and Wilhelmshaven. But he seemed to hold up well until his fifteenth, to Paris July 14, when he again lost two engines and again managed to bring his plane home. He now became aware of his nervousness and tried to do something about it. He spent a week at a luxurious rest home the 8th Air Force had opened for tired crews, a place called Stanbridge Earls on a large estate near the south coast. The week there made him feel so much better that he returned to combat  His sixteenth and last mission was the July 24th raid against  246  seven days.

New arrivals in England, insecure and defensive, covered their apprehension by acting ‘‘either overly self-assured or particularly diffident, usually the former.’’ They
