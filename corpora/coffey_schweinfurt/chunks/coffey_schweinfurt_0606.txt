during a tour of combat duty. New arrivals in England, insecure and defensive, covered their apprehension by acting ‘‘either overly self-assured or particularly diffident, usually the former.’’ They were either ‘‘loud and continuous’’ or ‘‘mouse- quiet.’’ They either sought advice excessively or refused to take advice. They drank more than usual and, above all, they denied that they were afraid or that they would ever be afraid. Many of them were contemptuous when they heard experienced men speak of their fears. (The veterans often launched cruel psychological attacks upon this overconfidence among the rookies.

After four or five missions, most new men began to lose their defensive mechanisms. Having experienced combat, they ‘‘spoke of the change in themselves and shamefacedly deprecated their former ‘cocky’ attitude.’’ Now they talked about their fears, and some of them could talk about nothing else, “‘feeling quite hopeless about their chances of survival.’’  After about ten missions, most men, aware now that they could deal with their fears, passed into a third phase, which was likely to continue to the end of their combat duty.
