at they would ever be afraid. Many of them were contemptuous when they heard experienced men speak of their fears. (The veterans often launched cruel psychological attacks upon this overconfidence among the rookies. The older men in the barracks would take delight in describing what a 20-mm. shell could do to a man’s brains, or what his feet would look like a few days after they were frozen. When new men went to their first briefing, veterans would tell them to be sure and shut the door because they wouldn’t be coming back. And it was a special pleasure for the veterans to go through a new arrival’s belongings and ask him which items he would bequeath them when he was shot down.)  After four or five missions, most new men began to lose their defensive mechanisms. Having experienced combat, they ‘‘spoke of the change in themselves and shamefacedly deprecated their former ‘cocky’ attitude.’’ Now they talked about their fears, and some of them could talk about nothing else, ‘feeling quite hopeless about their chances of survival.’’  After about ten missions, most men, aware now that they could deal with their fears, passed into a third phase, which was likely to continue to the end of their combat duty. They were now ‘“‘effective, careful fighting men, quiet and cool on the ground and in the air.”” But they were paying a heavy emotional price: ‘““They were drained of most feelings other than those having to do with combat. No values existed other than those meaningful in combat."’  Among the majority of men, the greatest tension occurred between briefing and takeoff, especially if the weather was bad and they had to await a decision about whether the mission was on or off. Surprising- ly, while the men were sweating out these decisions, most of them preferred to go rather than stay. They would rather face the German guns than return to their barracks with nothing accomplished. This  245  tt  ev tile a dwg,  itu nd riyelacmat iy  pc tit  satay att eh fat a dydolpruyns
