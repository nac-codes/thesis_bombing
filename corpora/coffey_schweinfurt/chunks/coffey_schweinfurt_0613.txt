Neither did the flight surgeon. The copilot was sent to the Central Medical Board for evaluation.  A second lieutenant navigator had flown four missions before reporting to his flight surgeon that he had “‘lost his nerve.’” The first mission, which was routine and uneventful, hadn’t bothered him. On the second, his plane was hit by flak and lost two engines. Another crew member, wounded by flak in the neck and shoulder, apparently panicked and bailed out.

The reality of the scene was so much more hideous than his previous conception of combat that he couldn’t adjust himself to it. His plane returned to base without further damage, however, and he prepared to continue his tour of duty.
