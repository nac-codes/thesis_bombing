because they themselves ate quite well at the officers’ mess.  Gibson’s job was to fill out the statements of effects for all members of lost crews. Under an officer’s supervision, he had to go through the personal property of every missing man, as soon as it was determined that his plane would not return, and make a list of every item—socks, 6 ea.; shirts, 4 ea.; mirror, 1 ea.; photographs, 3 ea.;  250  uninjured but stuck in the tail section, plunged earthward with it, end over end.  Unable to smash his way through the rear plexiglass bubble, he attacked the metal fuselage skin with his feet. He finally managed to get his body through but his shoulders became wedged. Then in some way that he could never explain, he broke free, opened his parachute just before reaching the ground, and landed without injury in the middle of a British antiaircraft installation  The plane had crashed only a hundred yards away, and when he reached it, he could see his fellow crew members (presumably all dead except one other man who had parachuted) burning inside. With the help of British soldiers, the tail gunner tried to pull out one of the bodies, but they were forced back by a new burst of flame.  That night in a British barracks the tail gunner lay sweating, shaking, and sleepless. Next morning, when his commanding officer arrived and they inspected the wreckage, he saw the charred remains of his crew. Thereafter, he slept poorly and dreamed of plane crashes. He had to force himself to get into an airplane. Whistling and whining noises reminded him of the sound of the tail section hurtling toward the ground. Enclosed spaces heightened his anxiety. Yet in spite of all this, he embarked with another crew on his tour of missions. He didn’t want to be considered ‘‘yellow’’ or a ‘‘quitter.’’  On one mission, his plane was badly battered by flak. It came home from another on two engines with holes in one wing and the fuselage. On this mission, which he flew as a waist gunner, some cont
