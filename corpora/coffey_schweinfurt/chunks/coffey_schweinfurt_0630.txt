for flying poorly armed, lightly built planes like the Lancaster, which the Americans considered ‘‘flimsy kites’’ compared to their heavy Fortresses. The R.A.F. fliers, on the other hand, admired the Yanks for invading the continent in daylight, when the Germans could so easily find and attack them  The Americans did sense some ‘‘snobbishness’’ in the British fliers, who tended to be condescending to the Yanks, perhaps be- cause they had been in the war longer and thought they knew more about it. The Americans believed that the condescension grew out of the British class system.
