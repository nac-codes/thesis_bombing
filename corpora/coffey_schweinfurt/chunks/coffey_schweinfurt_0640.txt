erson stimulated a wire to him from Harris on that old familiar theme, the horrors of diversion  [am certain that given average weather and concentration on the main job we can push Germany over by bombing this year. But to do so we must keep diversions cut to the bone. On every front but this one the United States and ourselves now regard it as reasonable, as well as necessary, that we should vastly outnumber our opponents locally in the air. . . . But here we and the U.S. 8th Bomber Command still remain as residuary legates in air re- sources while charged with the execution of the first, most difficult  256  iin the weather were alerted; on red.  jouble mission igland and the ombined thrust, h day.

United States are still making no adequate effort to implement their agreed bomber reinforcement of 8th Bomber Command. . . . I hope you will do your utmost to make them keep their allocations to 8th Bomber Command up to plan and to make up present leeway. I have found the best approach to leading Americans here to be an expression of astonishment that, while boasting of complete air supremacy everywhere else, they continually leave their 8th Bomber Com- mand in this prime theater always far below planned strength and hopelessly outnumbered. Outnumbered is a true and, to these people, a startling expression. . . . Eaker and Ander- son wish particularly to get these facts put over at this juncture.?3  Eaker had learned long ago that the best way to get concessions from his superiors in Washington was through the British, but how many times could he get away with that ploy? On August 16, he learned that he had gotten away with it once again. Portal, in a telegram to Harris
