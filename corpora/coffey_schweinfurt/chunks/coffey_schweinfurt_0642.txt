And when on August 16, the meteorologists forecast sunny skies over central Germany the next day, the teletypes began to chatter in orderly rooms at all the East Anglia bases. The Regensburg-Schweinfurt mission of August 17, 1943, was begun, the mission that poured enormous devastation on the Messerschmitt factory and the vital ball-bearing plants; but it was so costly to the 8th Air Force that it left still undecided the wisdom and practicality of the daylight bombing policy.  258  and most strenuous item of inter-Allied still making no adequate effort to impl reinforcement of 8th Bomber Commar your utmost to make them keep their Command up to plan and to make up pr the best approach to leading Americans astonishment that, while boasting of everywhere else, they continually leay mand in this prime theater alw: strength and hopelessly outnumbe and, to these people, a startling expressi son wish particularly to get these facts 5  Eaker had learned long ago that the be from his superiors in Washington was th many times could he get away with tha learned that he had gotten away with i telegram to Harris through the War Cabine had averted the new crisis:  Please inform Harris that the questi ments to 8th Bomber Command, an further diversions and restoring the thi Africa, was brought up by me at the C.( attitude, which was largely
