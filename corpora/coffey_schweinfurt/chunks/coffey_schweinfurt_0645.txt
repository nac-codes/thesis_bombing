Works the power house, a single-story machine shop, a multi-story machine shop and a large group of office buildings and stores received hits. At the Fichtel & Sachs plant at least two bombs burst directly on a single-story machine shop, with three more on adjoining build- ings. Direct hits were scored on two machine shops of the Works IT plant of the V.K.F., and other buildings received blast damage. At Works I of the V.K.F., part of the manufacturing buildings were destroyed  This report and the aerial photos were, however, inconclusive. The organization of ball-bearing factories was complicated, and the de-  260  By the time General Eaker got back to England August 23 after assessing the damage to Colonel LeMay’s Fourth Bombardment Wing in Africa, he had a fairly full picture of how much the Schwein- furt-Regensburg mission had cost the 8th Air Force. On the Schwein- furt operation alone, 36 Flying Fortresses were shot down and 27 so badly mauled they would never fly again, constituting an actual loss of 63 aircraft. Another 95 were damaged to some degree. On the Regensburg operation the toll would be much higher than he had realized because maintenance facilities were lacking in North Africa. For LeMay’s mission against Bordeaux en route home to England (August 24), he had only 60 airworthy planes. He had to leave another 60 in Africa because he couldn’t get them repaired. Though some of these might later be salvaged, they must now be considered lost, bringing the Regensburg toll to 84 aircraft (plus 3 more on the Bordeaux raid). This raised the aircraft toll for the entire Schwein- furt-Regensburg mission to 147. And more than 550 of the crewmen in those planes were either killed or captured.  The pressing questions were whether the results at Schweinfurt and Regensburg justified this great expense, and whether such enormous  259  losses could be sustained even if the results were excellent. Recon- naissance photos showed that the Regensburg results were perha
