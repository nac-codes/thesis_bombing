he carefully avoided boasting about the 8th Bomber Command’s accomplishments at either Schweinfurt or Regensburg. He wrote instead about the help the R.A.F. had given the 8th Air Force since its ‘‘feeble beginnings’ and about ‘‘the little success we have had to date,’’ while thanking the British for their cooperation and promising to press forward with them to greater accomplish- ments.

His immediate assessment of his most ambitious operation to date could hardly bring him much comfort. Shaken by his losses, he didn’t even have the satisfaction of realizing his victory. Only the Germans were aware of that.

General Anderson sent him the preliminary reports, and Eaker, on his return to England, sent Arnold all the briefing and debriefing data.  Eaker was soo
