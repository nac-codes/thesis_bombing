rned the full price of the August 17 operation? General Anderson sent him the preliminary reports, and Eaker, on his return to England, sent Arnold all the briefing and debriefing data.  Eaker was soon relieved to learn there would be ‘‘no upbraiding”’ from the Air Force Chief .3 Amold perhaps regretted the loss as much as Eaker and Anderson, but he showed no indication of discourage- ment. On the contrary, since new B-17s were now arriving in En- gland at a steady if not abundant pace, he expected Eaker and Anderson to press on with their offensive as if nothing untoward had happened.  Eaker appreciated Arnold’s support but was taken aback by his expectations.

They ‘‘felt they had been let down,”’ Williams observed, *‘after their bloody fight to pave the way.’’ But however much the men might gripe, they would fly again when they were commanded to do so. To get their planes into the air would require more than a command. ‘‘Four groups of this Air Division were so decimated by losses during this week,”’ Williams reported, ‘‘that a total of only six combat boxes [15-18 planes per box] can be flown until suitable replacements are made operational.’’  Not
