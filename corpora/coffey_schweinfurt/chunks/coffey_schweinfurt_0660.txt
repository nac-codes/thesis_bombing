h radar device called H2S. The results were indifferent, and for five days thereafter the 8th flew no missions. On October 2, when an even larger force returned to Emden in another attempt to use H2S, the results were worse. If these two experiments were indicative, radar bombing would never replace visual contact bombing.  During all this time, Schweinfurt was ever present in Eakerâ€™s mind. Exactly how good a job had his men done there in August? Neither the British nor American experts could answer this question accurately, and perhaps for this reason, doubts were rising in many minds about how effective the Fortresses had really been against the ball-bearing plants on that epic raid. Had they done as much damage as the 8th Air Force claimed? Some people in the R.A.F. were skeptical. Reactions from Washington had been reserved. Each week since August 17, reconnaissance planes had returned to photograph the stricken factories, and each week Eaker, Anderson, and their staffs studied the pictures, listened to the expert analyses, read the reports, asked questions about the buildings still standing, and even more anxious questions about the buildings that had been knocked apart but were now, with astonishing dispatch, being put back to- gether again. What people said about German efficiency was obvi- ously true. When they wanted to do something in a hurry they were phenomenally quick. The speed with which they were rebuilding the Schweinfurt plants raised the question of how soon they would be back at full production.  266  But even more significant, the speed of rebuilding demonstrated to Eaker what a well-chosen target Schweinfurt had been. It seemed to him that if the ball-bearing plants were that important to the Germans, they could not be allowed to resume operation unmolested, despite the awesome cost of bombing them. It would be nice to wait until the long-range fighters arrived to escort the bombers, or at least until satisfactory drop tanks had been developed
