The group surgeon had noticed an immediate drop in the morale of the crews on the night of August 17, after their return from Schweinfurt, ‘‘as soon as stories were compared and total losses realized.’’8  Even the commander of the 381st, Col. Joseph Nazzaro, who had not flown that mission, was ‘‘visibly affected’’ by it. He told the surgeon he was more tired that night than when he himself had flown long missions. Looking at Nazzaro, the surgeon could believe it. He had noticed in the colonel ‘‘the personal feeling for his men that is sometimes lacking in commanders.’’ But there was very little Naz- zaro could do to relieve the ominous mood of his men.
