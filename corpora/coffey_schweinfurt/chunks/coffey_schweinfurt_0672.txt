were of any importance. They were designed simply to make the Ameri- cans think there were enemy spies around them, and perhaps there were. But if so, they were wasting a lot of time on trivia. As for Lord Haw Haw’s major stories about the war, and especially about the air war, they were not very convincing to men who were taking part in it.  The barracks at Kimbolton were never warm enough, because there wasn’t enough coal for the stoves, a circumstance that gave rise to raids on the coal bins of other barracks. Capt. Derwyn Robb of the 379th found that he was usually chilled, but the damp British cold was no more discomforting to him than were the air-raid alarms. !? It seemed to him that the minute he got his ‘‘sack warmed”’ and was on the verge of sleep he would hear the sirens start their ‘‘eerie screech- ing in the distance.’’ As the German bombers came closer, ‘‘succeed- ing towns would set theirs to wailing until our own blasted you awake.’’ The loudspeaker would then announce, **Air raid warning ted!’’ which was merely an alert to make certain all blackout curtains were closed. If the Germans kept approaching, the next announce- ment would be ‘‘Air raid warning purple!’’ which was an order to take shelter. To do so, a man had to get up, get dressed, and go out in the cold. Most of the veterans didn’t bother. Having lived through German gunfire at point-blank range on mission after mission, they couldn’t get very excited about German bombs dropped in the dark from 10,000 feet. Some of the men didn’t even seem to care. They expected to die anyway, and they were fatalists about it. What difference did it make whether it happened in their planes or in their sacks?  Capt.
