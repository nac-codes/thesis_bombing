all Americans rich. He had been told by an Englishman he met that when the Canadians came, the British “‘was gettin’ a piece of ass for a shilling.’’ But the Canadians “‘gave ’em two shillings. And when the God damned Yanks came over, they didn’t know where to stop. They were liable to give ’em a few pounds.’”  That was not Rand’s style. He preferred to meet nice girls in pubs, and he found them very approachable. Some of the British men might resent the way the Americans dressed and the way they flashed their money, but the girls didn’t. And as for the men, Rand didn’t have any trouble. Not many men enjoy making trouble for steelworkers from Youngstown.  The 94th had bounced back after finding itself in a sorry condition after the June 13 mission to Keil. That was the day nine of its planes were shot down in the Channel on the way back because the gunners, thinking they would see no more Germans, were cleaning their weapons when a squadron of JU-88s arrived. A week later, General Eaker had decided the group needed a new commander and had sent one of his original six staff members, Col. Frederick Castle, who had been nagging him for a chance to be airborne rather than chairborne The group did not welcome Castle when he arrived. Many of the men  277  were cynical, not only about their chances of survival but also about the prospect of being commanded by a desk officer. Before the end of July, Castle had turned that feeling around by personally leading the 94th, plus thirteen planes from the 388th, on a mission against a Focke-Wulf fighter plant at Oschersleben. The clouds were so heavy no other groups could even find the target, but Castle’s planes broke through a small opening and bombed so effectively that reconnais- sance photos indicated a whole month’s production, perhaps fifty FW-190s, had been lost. Thereupon, life had become easier for Castle at Bury St. Edmunds. He had won a lot of respect, and the 94th Group records were steadily improving.  Lt. Ted Winslo
