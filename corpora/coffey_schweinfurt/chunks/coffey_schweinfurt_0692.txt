ght have to go back there, and they didn’t like the idea. Schweinfurt still stood out as the supreme symbol of horror in the entire 8th Air Force. Even new men who had arrived since August shuddered at the thought of it once they heard the stories. Lt. Bruce D. Moore, a navigator, had joined the 91st a few days after Schweinfurt to learn that several good friends from training days had died that day. Another friend who had survived it, Lt. Charles Hudson, a bombardier, had described the mission to Moore, making him wonder if there weren’t some way he could get into another business.  After Moore’s first four missions, between late August and early October, he was even less enthusiastic about the occupation he had chosen. On each mission, at least one man in his plane had been wounded and at least one engine had been shot out. The plane had been on fire once, and Moore had once blacked out from lack of oxygen. Yet no one claimed any of these missions was as tough as Schweinfurt.  With the numerical strength of the 8th Air Force building up once more since Schweinfurt, the bombers were beginning to invade Germany again. It was only the short run to Emden so far, on September 27 and October 2. Emden wasn’t so bad. The P-47s could now go that far even with the puny drop-tanks they were carrying. But the B-17s couldn’t spend the rest of the war hitting Emden. Every man in his right mind knew they would soon be going deeper into Germany. Would they have to go back to Schweinfurt? Moore, like most of the men in the 91st and like most of the men in the 8th Bomber Command, was afraid they would, but he preferred not to think about It.  On October 3, forecasters indicated the weather would be good over western Germany the next day. General Anderson at 8th Bomber Command had 361 heavy bombers (B-17s and B-24s) wait- ing for this word. On the morning of the 4th, the B-24s, 35 of them, took off on a diversion flight while 326 B-17s headed straight for Frankfurt, with more P-47s
