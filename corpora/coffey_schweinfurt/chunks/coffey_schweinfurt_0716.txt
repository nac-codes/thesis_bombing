’m short one group,’’ Peaslee said. ‘*You will take over the lead. I'll fly high on you, and I'll retain air command from that position.’*!2  While Peaslee’s 40th Combat Bombardment Wing was executing a slow 360-degree turn to let Milton’s Ist Wing move forward, Peaslee at last located his missing 305th Group. It was attached to the lst CBW as the low group.  The 305th had taken off six minutes late, and after completing assembly over Chelveston, had been unable to find the two other groups of the 40th CBW, the 92nd and 306th. Maj. C.G.Y. Nor- mand, the 305th leader, had led his seventeen aircraft to Daventry, then to Spalding without finding the rest of the wing. He had tried but failed to contact Peaslee by radio. He did however encounter the Ist CBW, and by this time was so desperate for company he slipped into its low position, which was open because the 38 1 st Group had not yet caught up to it. This meant that when Major Shackley’s 38 Ist finally  289  did catch up in mid-Channel, its assigned low position was already occupied. Shackley found room for his sixteen planes next to the 351st Group in the high position. This move probably saved the lives of many of Shackley’s men.  The arrival of a fourth group for his lst CBW offered some comfort to Colonel Milton and the men of the 91st Group because they had been able to muster only eleven planes that day and four of them had already aborted.!3 The 91st was just seven planes strong when Peas- lee ordered it to take the lead, and the veterans in those seven planes were suddenly reinforced in their memory of August 17. The 91st had been the lead group that day, also, as the wreckage of ten of its planes along today’s route would testify.  Capt. David Williams, lead navigator for the entire task force August 17, found himself in the same position today since he was in Colonel Milton’s plane as the 91st Group navigator. Thinking back as he looked ahead, Williams had only one thing for which to be thankful: at least
