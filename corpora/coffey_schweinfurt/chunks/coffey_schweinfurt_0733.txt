As it fell, nine parachutes eventually  appeared  At the same time, more news came from the rear: “We have two aircraft lagging badly—back about three hundred yards,”” Before Peaslee had time to react to this report, the pilot of his plane, Captain McLaughlin, directed Peaslee’s attention ahead, be- low, and to the left. A bomber in another group, probably the 305th,  297  had just been hit by a rocket. The plane’s right wing folded upward; the fuselage opened *‘like an eggshell,’’ and aman with one arm torn away fell out to begin hurtling earthward. For a moment, Peaslee could see the pilot, still at the controls; then the entire plane burst into lames and dropped out of sight below the left wing of Peaslee’s plane  Peaslee noticed that, while the attacks were becoming even more intense, his gunners had stopped shouting out reports about them. It was pointless to talk about ‘‘bogies’’ here or “‘bogies’’ there when the ‘‘bogies’’ were everywhere. The interphones fell silent. The battle was becoming too desperate to talk about.  The entire First Division was now under constant siege by about two hundred German planes. The FW-190s and ME-109s plunged out of the sun to attack from ten o’clock to two o’clock level—alone, in pairs, in line abreast, and in line astern, sometimes as many as six or seven at once, though usually in smaller groups.

The single-engine fighters, coming from the front, would fir
