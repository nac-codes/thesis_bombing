had just been hit by a rocket. The plane’s right wing folded upward; the fuselage opened ‘‘like an eggshell,’’ and a man with one arm torn away fell out to begin hurtling earthward. For a moment, Peaslee could see the pilot, still at the controls; then the entire plane burst into flames and dropped out of sight below the left wing of Peaslee’s plane  Peaslee noticed that, while the attacks were becoming even more intense, his gunners had stopped shouting out reports about them. It was pointless to talk about ‘‘bogies’’ here or *‘bogies’’ there when the ‘‘bogies’” were everywhere. The interphones fell silent. The battle was becoming too desperate to talk about.  [he entire First Division was now under constant siege by about two hundred German planes. The FW-190s and ME-109s plunged out of the sun to attack from ten o’clock to two o’clock level—alone, in pairs, in line abreast, and in line astern, sometimes as many as six or seven at once, though usually in smaller groups. Lt. Edwin Millson, firing his bombardier’s gun from the 379th lead plane, dreaded these concerted attacks by larger groups because he feared they might indicate a change of tactics by all the German fighters Millson felt the B-17 formations could survive if the Germans kept hitting ‘‘in oneseys and twoseys,’” but that if they were to make all their attacks in organized squadron strength, they might succeed in breaking up the armada.  The single-engine fighters, coming from the front, would fire their cannons and machine guns all at once, then break off into half-rolls or sudden dives within a few yards of collision points. Some of them, just before attacking, would engage in mock dogfights with each other to create the impression that they themselves were under attack by P-47s.  The twin-engine fighters came in mostly from the rear, between five o’clock and seven o’clock level, to a range of fifteen hundred or a thousand yards, whereupon they would lob their shells or rockets into the formations.
