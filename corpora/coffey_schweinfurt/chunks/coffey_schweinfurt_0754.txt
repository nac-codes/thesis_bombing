Even though great clusters of American bombers had gone down, greater clusters were still com- ing. Despite the heroic efforts of more German fighters than had ever before accepted an enemy challenge, the air was still full of For- tresses, and he could do nothing about it. He and his comrades had failed to stop them. Schweinfurt would soon be punished again for this failure.  Lt.
