over, dropping their bombs despite the German fighters that harassed them, Schweinfurt’s smoke and fire increased. The damage grew.  312  In the 94th Group toward the rear of the Third Division, Sgt. Leo Rand, on his first mission, was firing his left waist gun and thinking how wrong the briefing officers had been that morning. The route with the least flak? Bunch of shit. Least fighters? Another bunch of shit. P-47 escort? A crock of it. The only escort he had seen was squadron after squadron of German fighters, from the coast all the way to the Initial Point, which the 94th was now approaching. During his less than two hours of combat, Rand had already fired so many bullets he was up to his ankles in empty shells, and he had been fired upon through his big, square waist window, by ‘‘a whole shitpotful’” of German planes.

His first burst hit the engine, which quickly died though the damage to it was not apparent. Rand was still firing when the German pilot flipped open his canopy and bailed out. His parachute opened prematurely, just as he cleared his disabled fighter, but before Rand had stopped firing. Another burst from his machine gun raked across the man’s torso, cutting him in half with the perforating power of perhaps  313  twenty-five bullets.

He’d have plenty of time later to worry about being court-martialed.  At the front of the Third Division, the lead plane of the 45th CBW, carrying Col. Archie Old,
