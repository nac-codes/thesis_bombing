The No. 3 engine was losing power. Downs told Rourke to watch it. McFann, in spite of these difficulties, was keeping the aircraft in level flight. Whenever he needed advice or instruction, Downs would let him know what to do, either with a nod, a word, or a gesture. But as they came upon dense clouds near the French coast, McFann realized he didn’t know exactly where he was. And now they learned that their radio was also out.

Everyone agreed this was unthinkable because they had two wounded men aboard as well as Bolick’s body. McFann, then, would have to land the plane with Downs’s help and advice. But while McFann had flown a plane straight and level a few times, he had never landed one.  All of this planning would be academic unless they could get through the clouds, find out where they were, and locate an English airfield. It looked as if England was again completely overcast McFann flew until he and Downs agreed they must have reached it, even though they could see no land through the thick cloud cover Then Downs told McFann to begin flying a triangular course, twenty seconds per leg. If someone in British radar noticed them, he would know they were in distress and send up Spitfires to lead them down through the clouds  Fortunately the system worked. In due time a pair of Spitfires popped up through the clouds and signaled them to follow. During the descent, Downs had to take over because the clouds required instrument flight.
