his men were determined to find out. To help it fly on two engines they had discarded everything in it that was unattached. Now, to help it fly on one, they detached and jettisoned every fixture they could pull loose. With its single motor at full rottle, the straining plane crossed the continental coast and skimmed the Channel waves as its radio operator, T. Sgt. Willard Wetzel, broadcast an alert to the British air-sea rescue service that they might need help. In mid-Channel, the crew could make out the English shore ahead despite the gloomy weather. They might yet get there. Five miles from land they were still flying. But now the plane had nothing left. Before its demise, it gave Brennan just enough time to warn his men. As it settled toward the waves, he was able to get its tail low and head high so it would die proudly and at the same time let them down safely. When it hit the water, Brennan and his entire crew scrambled into life rafts to await rescue.  The weather that greeted the returning Fortresses over England was an appropriate finale to all the other miseries they had suffered that day. The clouds were so thick that scores of planes landed at whatever fields they could find. And five of them, after struggling to get home, couldn’t land at all. One 92nd Group plane crashed at Alden Maston. One from the 303rd crashed near Riseley. Three from the 284th went down over England, one near Blatherwycke, one near Corby, and the third right over home base at Grafton-Underwood. Fortunately, the crews of all these planes were able to bail out.  When Colonel Peaslee landed at Podington in the lead plane of the 92nd Group, only eleven planes were left in his formation.
