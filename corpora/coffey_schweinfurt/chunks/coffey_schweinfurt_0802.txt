ed their ratio of incendiaries with the result that huge fires were raging in all five of the target factories. Kugelfischer had taken at least fifty-three direct  325  hits, and all but one of its main buildings were damaged. When Wilhelm Stenger came out of the command shelter after the bombers had gone, he found that a phosphorous fire bomb had ignited a petroleum tank in front of the factory’s highest building (five stories), and the flames had leaped to the building itself. The company’s outmatched fire brigade was battling both blazes with no help be- cause the city firemen were more than busy in town. As workers emerged from the shelters, they wandered back and forth in bewilder- ment, realizing they should do something but not knowing what.  At Fichtel & Sachs, a smaller plant, fifteen or more direct hits had spread destruction from wall to wall and had virtually obliterated three large shops. Even at Deutsche Star Kugelhalter, which suffered the least, the main works building was shattered by a bomb blast within its very center. Another bomb destroyed a warehouse. At VKF Werke I, all the westerly buildings including the powerhouse were on their way to total destruction by fire, and four buildings to the east were damaged by explosives.  At VKF Werke II, all buildings were damaged and seven were more than half destroyed. When Heinrich Weichsel emerged from his bunker there, he found the most serious fires in the ball plants, where the oil in and around the machines had ignited. These machines were now useless. While assessing the damages, Weichsel thought he heard a voice. It turned out to be a gasping man. A bomb had lifted a heavy press and pinned two men beneath it. One had been crushed to death but the other had taken only part of the weight and was still alive. Weichsel summoned the medics, who freed him and carried him away  Weichsel now walked through the factory in a daze. Some of the fires were still unattended. The desolation was so general it was
