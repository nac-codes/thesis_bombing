himself what had happened at Schweinfurt. In the two months since the August attack Speer had not succeeded in doing very much to ward off the dangers of further attacks. The factory dispersal plan had remained nothing more than a plan. Despite numerous discussions, the only accomplishment had been to order more new machines and to start building a few small component factories in towns around Schweinfurt. While the afflicted factories were being patched up, he had been forced to call on the German Army and Air Force to relinquish for war-production uses all the ball bearings they had in storage. These reserves had lasted until early September, long before the factories at Schweinfurt had returned to anything approximating full-scale production. At that time, output was still so sparse that ball bearings were delivered each day, as soon as they came off the line, from the factories to the waiting assembly plants. Sometimes the desperate assembly plants sent men with knapsacks to pick up how- ever many bearings the factories had ready. Attempts were made to increase the ball-bearing purchases from Sweden and Switzerland, but these countries, which were already sending Germany more bearings than they pretended, were willing to increase the volume only minimally, even under extreme German pressure, because they feared they might lose their neutral status in the eyes of the Allies. During those days, Speer and his associates anxiously wondered “‘how soon the enemy would realize that he could paralyze the production of thousands of armament plants merely by destroying five or six relatively small targets.”’  Speer did not know that Gen. Ira Eaker at 8th Air Force headquar- ters in England was of the same mind but had been able to do nothing about it until he had restored the crew and aircraft losses he had suffered at Schweinfurt in August. In late September and early October, as new planes and men were strengthening the American force, the bombed-out Schweinfurt factor
