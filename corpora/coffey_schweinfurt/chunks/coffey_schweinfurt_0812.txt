Nothing was said about doing like- wise with the ball-bearing factories. The subject of ball bearings was not mentioned.  When Hitler relayed Goering’s announcement that Schweinfurt had been hit again, Speer sensed immediately that his original hunch had been wrong. The Americans apparently knew what they were trying to do after all. But had they managed to do it? On that question he didn’t trust Goering, who hated to tell Hitler bad news, and whose primary concern in any case was not production loss but Luftwaffe performance. Speer would agree that it was desirable to knock down American bombers, but on August 17, when sixty of them had been knocked down, more than three hundred others had survived to plaster both Schweinfurt and Regensburg. How many had gotten through to Schweinfurt today? That was a more important question than how many were strewn across the German countryside.  Speer was so uneasy he asked Hitler to recess the armaments meeting, then hurried to a telephone with one of his aides to call his contacts in Schweinfurt. As Speer stood by, the aide tried and failed He was told that all communications to the stricken city had been shattered. Because the call was being made from Hitler’s headquar- ters by a man as important as Albert Speer, the operators could hardly be accused of a half-hearted effort, yet they were unsuccessful in all their attempts to reach the town or any of the ball-bearing plants.

All the factories, he said, had been hard hit. The oil baths had caused serious fires in the machine
