ccessful in building the Air Force was that he never lost sight of the fact that the money came from the American people. To those who worked under him he might be irascible at times, but to the people and their Congressmen he was always ‘‘Happy”’ Arnold, a smiling, white-haired, fatherly man whom any mother might rea- sonably trust as her son’s commander. Arnold undoubtedly realized that in the public mind the loss of sixty U.S. planes with six hundred American boys would make a deeper impression than the destruction of five German ball-bearing factories. Many Americans had never even seen a ball bearing. It was not easy to dramatize the importance of such a product, but he apparently felt he had to do so. An element of doubt had arisen. Even the R.A.F., during four years of war, had fever lost sixty planes on one mission. Arnold could sense the doubt because he felt some of it himself. Like any military commander he was reconciled to losses, yet he wondered how long the 8th Air Force could sustain losses like this.3 It worried him, but he didn’t dare show it.  Three days later (October 18), Arnold felt obliged to conduct a news conference to assure the public that the Schweinfurt mission had been worth the cost. This time his remarks were not quite so shrewdly conceived. He said that on such an operation high losses were to be expected and he gave the impression that even a 25 percent loss ratio might be acceptable. Since the number of attacking B-17s had not been announced, some reporters naturally concluded that this 25-percent figure applied to the Schweinfurt raid, thus making it seem to have cost even more than the actual 19 percent. He also suggested that the Germans might have been forewarned of the attack, a supposition that had been rumored but was apparently without foundation. (Monitored German radio conversations be- tween pilots and ground control, even up to the time the American  335  planes were approaching Frankfurt, indicated an expectation that
