without foundation. (Monitored German radio conversations be- tween pilots and ground control, even up to the time the American  335  planes were approaching Frankfurt, indicated an expectation that Frankfurt would be the target.) Arnold then concluded his press conference with an overoptimistic remark. ‘‘Now,"’ he said, ‘‘we have got Schweinfurt.’’ These words might haunt him if his men ever had to return there.  When Eaker and Anderson read in the British papers what Arnold had said, they were both disturbed. On October 19 Eaker gently remonstrated with him in what may have been an imprudent letter to write to his commander. There was nothing in the enemy reaction, he said, that would indicate previous warning. And as for the 25-percent oss figure, he thought it might be well to remember that ‘‘our overall osses are still below 5 percent. From the standpoint of maintaining crew morale, I am anxious that our crews do not feel that their leaders anticipate enormous losses.”’  Eaker and Anderson were clearly displeased by Arnold’s state- ments, but whatever damage his remarks may have done was uncor- rectible. As the days passed after the second Schweinfurt mission and there was no announcement of new missions, people began to wonder if the 8th Air Force losses had been even worse than Eaker had admitted. Why was nothing happening? Was the 8th reduced to impotence? Dispatches from England blamed continuing bad weath- er for the inactivity, but not everyone was convinced.
