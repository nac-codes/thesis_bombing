If, as Arnold suggested, a security leak had enabled the Germans to predict and counter an 8th Air Force opera- tion, what was being done about it? And how did anyone know for certain that the B-17s had done as much damage at Schweinfurt as Eaker had claimed? Unfortunately for Eaker, there was no absolute proof.
