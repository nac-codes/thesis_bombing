What Speer did not know was that despite the success of the October 14 attack, General Eaker couldn’t possibly repeat it within two weeks. The sixty bombers he had lost that day, added to the eighty-eight he had lost in the previous week’s operations, were a prohibitive depletion of his force. And it was evident now, not only to Eaker but even to his superiors in Washington, that his bombers had to have fighter escorts all the way to their targets. During October, bomber replacements were arriving so quickly that by the end of the month, Eaker and Anderson were capable of sending out five hundred at a time. Yet it was not until November 3 that the next mission was launched. While the weather could be blamed for day- to-day postponements, it was not primarily responsible for the cur- tailment of operations after the second Schweinfurt mission. The need for long-range fighters was now fully acknowledged. The B-17s would not go deep into Germany again until they could be escorted all the way  When more than five hundred Fortresses took off for Wilhelmsha- ven November 3, they were accompanied by P-38s, which at least had the virtue of being able to go that far, even though they were a poor match for ME-109s and FW-190s. On this day they wouldn’t meet many German fighters, because Wilhelmshaven was known to be covered by a thick cloud layer. The purpose of the mission was to try once more the new British radar device, H2S, which might make it practical to bomb through
