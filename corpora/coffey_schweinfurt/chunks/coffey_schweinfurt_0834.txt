because Wilhelmshaven was known to be covered by a thick cloud layer. The purpose of the mission was to try once more the new British radar device, H2S, which might make it practical to bomb through clouds. The Wilhelmshaven harbor was an ideal target on which to test H2S because radar could pick up land-water boundaries precisely and make an identifiably shaped harbor easy to find. The bombing at Wilhelmshaven that day was fairly accurate under the circumstances though not up to the standards the B-17 groups had gradually established. Expectations of a weak fighter defense were well founded, however; the bombers were virtually unchallenged by the Luftwaffe, and the P-38 received only a cursory test as an 8th Air Force bomber escort. But it had already  340  him: ‘‘Where only explosive bombs went off, there is only a hole and the machines are full of dirt. They can be repaired. But where there was fire, that was the end of the machines because the shafts burned out.’’ And in this raid, fires had been general throughout all the factories.  Speer w that he flew to Schweinfurt October 18 to see the damage for hfmself, and afterward, on that same day, he conducted a meeting at Nurem- berg to determine what could be done about it.‘ First he appointed his “‘most vigorous associate,’’ Dr. Philip Kessler, as special commis- sioner for ball-bearing production. Then with Kessler he worked out methods to reduce the transit time from factory to assembly plant and set in motion the development of a porcelain substitute for metal bearings in nonprecision machinery. But more important, Speer and Kessler pushed the immediate reconstruction of the stricken factories and at the same time made serious plans to begin the industry dispersal about which they had been talking since the August Schweinfurt attack. This time they would have to go through with the dispersal despite the temporary disruption it would cause and despite the reluctance of the gauleiters to welcome potential targe
