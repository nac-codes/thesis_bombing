And if the German fighters decided to attack the bombers anyway, they were not likely to enjoy the experience with the quick and well-armed Mustangs on their tails. The air war over Europe was about to undergo a decisive change, and the Germans, when they saw the Mustang, began to sense it. Hermann Goering, after his capture in 1945, admitted to Gen. Carl Spaatz that when he saw the first P-51 over Germany, he feared that the war was decided.  General Eaker could now see an increasingly triumphant future in store for his 8th Air Force.
