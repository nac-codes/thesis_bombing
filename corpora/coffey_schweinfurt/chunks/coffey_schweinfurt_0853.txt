his new assignment. Who was Colonel Holt? Eaker had never heard of him, but after talking to Sir Charles Portal, he decided he would stop and see the man on his way to the Mediterranean  More than two hundred people came to the R.A.F.’s farewell dinner at the headquarters in Bushy Park. Portal and Harris were the hosts. The senior members of the 8th Air Force staff had also been invited. At least fifteen people made brief talks. The next day, Air Chief Marshal Harris and Lady Harris, Eaker’s first firm friends in England, came to see him off at the Bovingdon Air Base. Harris, still uncertain why the American general was being transferred, felt some concern that Eaker might think their differences of opinion about bombing policy were a factor in his removal.!° He did not mention this to Eaker, however, when they said goodbye in one of the hangars. An R.A.F. guard of honor was standing at attention as he boarded his plane—a Flying Fortress that had been fitted out for him  Capt. William Smith, now his pilot, had the engines running Smith, who had fallen in love with a beautiful Red Cross girl in England, was no less reluctant than Eaker to go to Africa. As the plane took off, Eaker sat silently among the staff members accom- panying him. Alone with his thoughts, he said very little to anyone on the entire trip. Still bitterly disappointed by his transfer, he could not overcome his feeling that the Mediterranean was a secondary theater and that he was taking over a secondary command  When his plane landed in Casablanca, Eaker went immediately to see ‘‘Colonel Holt.’’ He found himself entering a familiar villa, the one he had visited the previous January during the Casablanca confer- ence.!! **Colonel Holt’’ was the secret pseudonym for Winston Churchill when he traveled. He was in Africa now recovering from a bout of pneumonia. Eaker found him in the same two-story living room where they had argued about the American daylight-bombing  347  ss na hi  rough  py hsp  ter
