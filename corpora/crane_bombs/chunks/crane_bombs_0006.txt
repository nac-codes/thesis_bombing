project; he also furnished me with insightful critiques of my work. Numerous others deserve mention. Colonel Robert Doughty and the sol- dier-scholars of the History Department at USMA provided a rich supply of ideas during discussions and seminars. Dr. Kenneth Werrell and Dr. Jesse Stiller gave me the benefit of their criticism in analyzing my early work, as did Colonel Paul Miles. Dr. Werrell also contributed significantly to the original  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 17 --- PREFACE   x v book. Dr. Ronald Schaffer deserves special mention; not only did we have some valuable discussions at historical conferences but also he generously provided me with much important source material from his own research. I received help with photographs from Larry Dodd of the Northwest and Whitman College Archival Collections, Alan Aimone from Special Collec- tions Division of the US Military Academy Library, Gary Johnson at the US Army Heritage and Education Center, and Melissa Kaiser, Tim Cronen, and Nick Parrella of the Smithsonian. Michael Briggs, Larisa Martin, and Karen Hellekson at the University Press of Kansas were invaluable in sharpening my prose and ideas. My parents also gave me support and encouragement during this long and arduous effort, and unfortunately my father, who will always remain my image of a World War II veteran, did not live long enough to see this latest version. I am very grateful to Mike Briggs and his staff at the University Press of Kansas for allowing me to create this revised edition, and Rob Ehlers for prodding me to look more closely at the activities of the much-neglected Fifteenth Air Force. That inclination was reinforced by Dr. John Geis and his staff at the Air Force Research Institute, who kindly allowed me access to their impressive THOR database of American bombing operations, and archivist Maranda Gilmore at the Air Force Historical Research Agency, who doggedly tracked down 455th Bomb Group information for me.
