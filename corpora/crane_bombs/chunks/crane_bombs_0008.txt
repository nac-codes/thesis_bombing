aps the most heated debate has focused on the intentional bombardment of civilians to break their morale, a practice called morale bombing or terror bombing. Basil Liddell Hart, the noted British military historian, called the practice of indiscriminate Allied area bombing of cities “the most uncivilized method of warfare the world has known since the Mongol devastations.” An American counterpart, Walter Millis, termed such tactics “unbridled savagery.”3 Many American historians, including me, have perceived a dif- ference between the practices of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the United States Army Air Forces (AAF), however, especially in the European theater. While the British embraced a policy of indiscriminate night area bombing as their only realistic option, the Americans pursued daylight aerial offensives against well-selected military and industrial targets that were justified by both “strategic judgment and morality.”4 Reflecting the Clausewitz quote above, the RAF targeted will, while the AAF aimed to destroy means. During World War II, the United States Army Air Forces did enunciate a policy of pinpoint assaults on key industrial or military targets, avoiding  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 20 --- 2  CHAPTER  ONE indiscriminate attacks on population centers. This seems to differentiate US policy from the policies of Germany, Great Britain, and Japan, all of which resorted to intentional terror attacks on enemy cities during the war.5 Schol- ars who have cited the official AAF history emphasize the intention of Amer- ican leaders to resist bombing noncombatants in Europe for both military and ethical reasons.6 Many of these writers contend that US airmen regarded civilian casualties as an unintentional and regrettable side effect of bombs Two contrasting views of Allied strategic bombing of Germany in World War II: a section of Munich razed primarily by British night raids (above) and a destroyed oil reﬁnery at Harburg hit by American daylight bombers
