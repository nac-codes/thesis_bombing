not inspired and shaped to a greater degree by technology. Because of the limitations of the bombers of the 1930s, when precision bombing was developed, he argued, wartime technology was “more demonstrably than usual . . . the offspring, not the parent, of doctrine,” leading to vague and un-  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 23 --- INTRODUCTION   5 realistic assumptions about the potential of pinpoint strategic bombardment and diminishing utility and support of the doctrine as the war went on.11 Doctrine, however, is supposed to be developed to meet national goals, perform battlefield missions, or counter a perceived threat, and technology is then designed to implement the doctrine. Technological developments may force modifications in doctrine; ideally they should not drive it. Other- wise, the result is something like the Army’s infamous Sergeant York Air De- fense Gun, an expensive piece of sophisticated equipment whose capabilities were shaped more by technological possibilities than by an accurate appraisal of the evolving threat of enemy aircraft.12 The entire family of US armor and antiarmor weapons in World War II illustrates the problem of allowing cur- rent technology to define tactical doctrine. Developed by technical experts to be light and mobile, American tanks and tank destroyers were employed to maximize mobility. However, they could not support the army’s overall strat- egy and doctrine of firepower and direct assault, which was required by the conditions of European combat. This flaw affected US ground operations throughout the war.13 Allowing current technology to define doctrine can also limit the scope of doctrine without providing guidance or flexibility for later developments. A study of the evolution of military doctrine in the three decades after World War II by the US Army’s Combat Studies Institute concludes that “the great value of doctrine is less the final answers it provides than the impetus it creates toward developing innovative a
