fter World War II by the US Army’s Combat Studies Institute concludes that “the great value of doctrine is less the final answers it provides than the impetus it creates toward developing innovative and creative solutions” for future prob- lems.14 The commander of the AAF, General Henry “Hap” Arnold, under- stood this process. In his final report to the secretary of war in 1945, he emphasized, “National safety would be endangered by an Air Force whose doctrines and techniques are tied solely to the equipment and processes of the moment.” The Air Force must keep “its doctrines ahead of its equip- ment, and its vision far into the future.”15 It is always better to have technol- ogy chasing doctrine, not the other way around. It can be argued that the technology for precision bombing really did not exist until the smart bombs of the Vietnam War. The destruction of the French embassy during the 1986 air strike on Libya; the few televised misses with guided munitions and admitted poor accuracy with unguided weap- ons during DESERT  STORM ; the targeting of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999; and the continuing debates over civilian casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq demonstrate that the ideal of pinpoint accuracy under all combat conditions has still not been reached.16 Yet the pursuit of accurate bombing remained a primary goal throughout World War II, influencing American  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 24 --- 6  CHAPTER  ONE tactics and technology during that conflict and setting precedents for later wars, including DESERT  STORM , in which the US Air Force first provided an impressive demonstration of advances in precision methods and munitions in military briefings and media clips. When examined in comparison with the bombing results of other air forces in World War II, the intent, if not always the effect, of American air attacks was consistently to achieve the most precise and effective bombardment possible in pursuit of the destruction of the enemy’s cap
