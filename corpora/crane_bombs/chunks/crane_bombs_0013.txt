d War II, the intent, if not always the effect, of American air attacks was consistently to achieve the most precise and effective bombardment possible in pursuit of the destruction of the enemy’s capacity to resist in order to end the war as quickly as possible. Wartime improvements in bombing accuracy, as well as the eventual impact on the German economy, demonstrate that such a goal was realistic, not a dream always to be abandoned in favor of military expediency. Changing conditions influencing combat capabilities and effectiveness in the Euro- pean and Pacific theaters did lead to the AAF’s acceptance of greater risks for enemy civilians by 1945, but in Europe at least, the operational record shows that the avoidance of noncombatant casualties in accordance with precision doctrine remained a component of American bombing, especially outside Germany, even if one of decreasing influence. Military doctrine is simply a condensed expression of an accepted ap- proach to campaigns, major operations, and battles. The general purposes of doctrine during and after World War II remained basically the same: “to provide guides for action or to suggest methods that would probably work best” and to facilitate communication between different elements by defin- ing terms and providing concepts.17 Historically, American field command- ers have felt free to interpret doctrinal guidance generally as they pleased. Indeed, the Soviets taught that “one of the serious problems in planning against American doctrine is that the Americans do not read their manuals nor do they feel any obligation to follow their doctrines.”18 This is certainly an exaggeration, but field commanders have rightly assumed that doctrine is basically a set of guidelines that permits much situational leeway. Tradition- ally, these same field commanders have been given considerable freedom from strict command and control, far in the rear. Even the official AAF history of World War II admits that “air force comman
