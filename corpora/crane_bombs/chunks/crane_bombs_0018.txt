objective was to win the war in the shortest time with the most efficient use of resources and the fewest possible American casualties. Mission requirements usually prevented any sense of morality from being “an overriding criterion” on aerial opera- tions, although one planner stated that his group “took some comfort that our proposals would be much less costly in terms of the lives of civilians.”22 The need for Allied cooperation also tended to mute ethical arguments be- cause the British so strongly supported attacks on civilian morale and the Americans did not want to cause a rift or aid German propaganda. Although it is hard to determine moral positions from official records and correspon- dence, it is probably true that ethical restraints were not the most important limitations on terror bombing by the USSTAF. Such considerations, how- ever, cannot be completely discounted. At the same time, it must be noted that psychological effects have always been an important part of air warfare. Like the bayonet or the tank, the airplane has a shock effect that is intended to unnerve an enemy and break the will to resist. Unlike those other weapons, however, the long range of the airplane encompasses vast regions of the enemy’s rear area, inhabited mainly by civilians. Once factories became acceptable bombing targets as part of the enemy’s capacity for making war, factory workers could no longer be seen as noncombatants. Once the trend to recognize some civilians as belligerents began, it was only a matter of time until the justification would be made, as in Japan, that everyone supported the war effort in some way. The temptation to exploit and magnify the psychological effects of bombing civilians would also be hard to resist. American airmen, even those most devoted to precision doctrine or morally opposed to bombing any civilians, expected that the destruction of economic and industrial infrastructure  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 28 --- 10  CHAPTER  ONE would
