echnological solutions or by a single operation to produce a deathblow became especially strong after the success of Operation OVERLORD in Europe and as the invasion of Japan approached.24 With the exception of some officers like LeMay, devotion to precision-bombing doctrine remained strong in the field, especially with those officers who had helped develop it, though its applications changed as the military situation evolved. Contrary to many American doctrines in our military history, this one was uniformly known, understood, and believed by most of the soldiers who were supposed to follow it. Indeed, it often seems that precision bombing was better un- derstood in the field than in Washington. In his memoir, Wartime , Paul Fussell claims that “precision bombing became a comical oxymoron relished by bomber crews with a sense of black humor,” although he provides no real evidence to back up this statement about American strategic bombing.25 In reality, aircrews and their leaders were convinced of the effectiveness and appropriateness of their tactics and missions and were usually quick to ex- press dissatisfaction with any perceived deviations from proven and accepted [128.59.222.107]   Project MUSE (2024-10-07 01:45 GMT)  Columbia University Libraries  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 29 --- INTRODUCTION   1 1 techniques and procedures, though admittedly such complaints lessened as the end of the war approached. This continuity in doctrine is not really evident unless one focuses on day-to-day operations. Though archival sources such as the papers of Spaatz or Arnold provide invaluable topical information, letters or documents are grouped by subject more than by time period, and even unit histories can be narrow in focus. The best source for a full understanding of the milieu of European air operations is the daily operational diaries of Frederick L. An- derson, USSTAF deputy commander for operations. Each daily file contains bound packets of correspondence that
