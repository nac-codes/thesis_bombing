the milieu of European air operations is the daily operational diaries of Frederick L. An- derson, USSTAF deputy commander for operations. Each daily file contains bound packets of correspondence that passed in and out of USSTAF head- quarters, including letters from Arnold and Spaatz, press releases, and battle reports from the field. This concentrated operational- and tactical-level doc- umentation describes the course of the air war in great detail and shows the continuity and persistence of precision-bombing doctrine even while temp- tations to use terror bombing increased.26 The mission reports and monthly summaries of individual bombardment groups are also very revealing about the way operational directives were actually executed. Yet in the Pacific theater, a unique combination of military problems and an innovative commander less committed to prescribed doctrine pro- duced a far different response to these temptations. This contrast makes the European record even more remarkable, especially when one considers the need to cooperate with an ally dedicated to terror bombing. Though adverse weather, technological limitations, or enemy countermeasures such as flak or smokescreens often made it difficult to achieve the standards of precision-bombing doctrine, most AAF airmen did live up to the spirit of it. Moreover, in the Pacific theater, Brigadier General Haywood Hansell, Le- Mayâ€™s predecessor, was replaced because he would not swerve from the tenets he had helped develop. Most critics of precision bombing have been asking the wrong question, because it is impossible to determine accurately the specific ethical motiva- tions for strategic air attacks from the documentation available. On the nar- rower issue of the application of precision bombing practices in the field, an impartial observer must conclude that in general most American airmen did the best they could to win the war with consistent application of a doctrine that favored military and industrial tar
