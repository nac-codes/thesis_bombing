ield, an impartial observer must conclude that in general most American airmen did the best they could to win the war with consistent application of a doctrine that favored military and industrial targeting over terror bombing. Their in- tent was to spare noncombatants while reducing enemy means to resist, and they succeeded better than many historians are willing to concede. Perhaps the survivors of strategic-bombing attacks understood this bet-  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 30 --- 12  CHAPTER  ONE ter than the historians. As one German who lived through the American bombing and the RAF-induced firestorms in Hamburg commented, “The Americans were regarded by us as soldiers. Their attacks were during the day- time and were nearly always directed on military targets, even if the civilian population sometimes suffered heavy casualties because of them. They flew in good visibility and risked the aimed fire of our Flak. Hence [we had] a certain respect for the ‘Amis’ as we called them.”27 Yet it is undeniable that for a number of reasons strategic-bombing prin- ciples and precedents from Europe contributed to “the slide to total [air] war” in the bombing of Japan. Military conditions were different in the Pa- cific theater, as were perceptions of the enemy; command and control was much looser also. According to the official history of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “The division of the Pacific Theater between two major commands [Nimitz and MacArthur] complicated the problems of war and undoubtedly reduced the efficiency with which the war was fought.”28 As the Army and Navy pursued competing strategies, the AAF also mounted an essentially independent campaign. Perhaps the most important difference from the Eu- ropean theater was that in the Pacific, the air commander who instituted the firebombing campaign had not been involved in the development of strate- gic-bombing doctrine, had learned “not much” when he attended the Air Corps Tactical School, and “was always mor
