instituted the firebombing campaign had not been involved in the development of strate- gic-bombing doctrine, had learned “not much” when he attended the Air Corps Tactical School, and “was always more practical than theoretical.”29 Once LeMay decided on the burning of Japanese cities as the solution to his operational problems and the practice became accepted by leaders in Wash- ington and in the field, the next step in the escalation to total war—dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima—was indeed, to use Sherry’s words, only an “incremental decision.” An ironic legacy of strategic bombing in World War II, evident in more limited conflicts such as the war in Vietnam and the campaigns against Iraq, is that even though international opinion might focus on the image of the mushroom cloud obliterating cities or on B-52s carpet bombing enemy pop- ulations, the American military ideal in both doctrine and practice has re- mained the pursuit of precise destruction of enemy capacity. The military ethics and accuracy espoused in doctrinal literature on air operations to- day and first demonstrated so convincingly during Operation DESERT  STORM evolved directly from the effort and intent of the experience in World War II. And since that 1991 conflict the expectations of the American public and political leaders about the precision and potential of airpower have exceeded the dreams of even the most idealistic airmen who shaped the AAF, cre-  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 31 --- INTRODUCTION   1 3 ating the potential for a dangerous policy–capability mismatch.
