Gorrell, to prepare a history and final report on US air activities in Europe during the war.

From his investigations he developed a bombardment plan in Novemb er 1917 characterized later as the “earliest, clearest, and least known statement of the American conception of the employment of air power.” His work so impressed Brigadier General Benjamin Foulois, chief of Air Service, AEF, that the general recommended the plan to Pershing in December. As Tami Biddle has pointed out, it is ironic that this “American conception” heavily relied on innovative analysis done earlier by Lord Tiverton, of the British Air Staff’s Directorate of Flying Operations. He was the first airman to look systematically at a comprehensive plan to eliminate enemy capacity with a bombing campaign focused on key industrial target sets. Gorrell’s Novem- ber proposal included verbatim excerpts from one Tiverton had written in September.4 Gorrell collected all available materials, including his own 1917 plan, “a truly striking forerunner of the doctrine which matured years later at the Air Corps Tactical School.” Some of that later doctrine even used the same wording and metaphors of Gorrell’s document.5 His plan aimed to “wreck Germany’s manufacturing centers” with a round-the-clock campaign of day and night bombing. Targeting chemical plants would cut artillery shell out- put, and bombing aircraft engine plants would limit airplane production. He stated: “The object of strategical bombing is
