appear again in World War II.7 As Gorrell accumulated material for General Patrick, the colonel realized that he needed a more systematic analysis of the effects of aerial bombing on the enemy. Air Service officers under the supervision of the Air Intelligence Section of General Headquarters, AEF, were sent out to survey bombed towns and to interview inhabitants. Teams were to determine whether day or night bombing was more effective in damaging both material and morale. In general, the information was scanty and incomplete, but the report’s sum- mary provided many ideas for future consideration. Though bomb damage as a whole was relatively slight, bombing did affect the morale of fighting forces as well as the civilian population. In addition, government employ- ees could not perform their work because of bombing, transportation of troops and supplies was hindered, and the manufacture of war material was hampered to some degree. The Germans were also forced to spend much time and effort defending their homeland. The effects on civilian morale described dealt mainly with loss of sleep and lowered worker performance; the idea of a Hamburg or a Tokyo firestorm was far in the future.8 Yet the bombing survey did provide a disturbing preview of attitudes that would help create those holocausts. It mentioned that the casualty figures of 641 killed and 1,242 wounded in twenty-two German cities “may not be considered very important, inasmuch as most of these were civilians,” but it further explained that helping the wounded and the dependents of those killed could entail considerable additional expenses to the government.9 Many of the Allied raids that produced these casualties were motivated by similar German attacks, especially on England, where attacks by dirigibles and bombers had killed 1,414 people and wounded 3,416. The British were incensed at what they perceived as “willful murder,” but a captured Zeppelin commander denied the accusations in terms that could have b
