ers had killed 1,414 people and wounded 3,416. The British were incensed at what they perceived as “willful murder,” but a captured Zeppelin commander denied the accusations in terms that could have been echoed by American airmen in World War II. “You must not suppose that we set out to kill women and children,” he tried to explain. “We have higher military aims. You would not find one officer in the German Army and Navy who would go to war to kill women and children. Such things happen acciden- tally in war.”10  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 35 --- DEVELOPING  DOCTRINE   1 7 The conclusions and criticisms in the bombing survey could be seen as a portent for the precision-bombing theory to come. Despite the inferences about benefits of attacks on civilians, the British and French were criticized for inaccurate bombing as well as for “the unintelligent choice of targets,” in particular “the bombing of a town rather than some definite objective of military value in the town.” Arguments against the bombing of cities were based on practical considerations, not ethics. Directly targeting civilian mo- rale “is not a productive means of bombing. The effect is legitimate and just as considerable when attained indirectly through the bombing of a fac- tory.” Instead, the three most important objectives for bombing were war industries, railroad lines, and troops in the field. The survey concluded that the industrial bombing attack should be concentrated night and day on the enemy’s most important and vulnerable economic sector and that commu- nications lines were best hit immediately preceding and during major oper- ations. Many of these attitudes and practices would be evident in the next American air war.11 THE INFLUENCE  OF THEORISTS Gorrell’s exhaustive work eventually ended up at the library of the ACTS, where it undoubtedly influenced the officers who developed precision- bombing doctrine between the wars. A progression of theorists also made their mark on American
