Squier was an attaché in London when World War I began, and he kept his American col- leagues well informed on developing theory and the conduct of the air war.13 Service with Squier and exposure to Trenchard were not the only theo- retical influences on Americans such as Mitchell. As the Germans bombed London with Zeppelins and Gothas in 1917, Field Marshal Jan Smuts pre- dicted that in the future “aerial operations, with their devastation of enemy lands and destruction of industrial and populous centers on a vast scale, may become the principal operations of war.”14 French and British airmen exposed their allies to a European outlook on airpower that was perhaps most clearly expressed by the Italian Giulio Douhet, sometimes called the “Father of Airpower Doctrine.”15 Mitchell may have met Douhet on a trip to Italy in 1922, though the American never attributed any special influence on his thinking to the Italian.16 The outspoken Douhet had been imprisoned by his government for a  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 37 --- DEVELOPING  DOCTRINE   1 9 year during World War I for criticizing staff policies.
