impressed by the reported effects of German bombing on the population of London.19 Douhet’s effect on the development of American bombing doctrine has been hotly debated, with skeptics of its precision focus contending that the Italian’s writings had a particularly strong influence on AAF teachings and practices. Billy Mitchell may have incorporated some of Douhet’s ideas, but he tailored his concepts to the American situation. By 1930 Mitchell did  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 38 --- 20  CHAPTER  TWO consider cities as attractive targets, but only for disruption, not destruction. “It will be sufficient,” he wrote, “to have the civilian population driven out so they cannot carry on their usual vocations. A few gas bombs will do that.”20 When for publicity he advocated Douhet’s views in 1933, Mitchell was no longer a major influence on those individuals developing AAF doctrine. Whether because of his earlier military experience in the ruthless guerrilla war in the Philippines or from his incessant desire for publicity, Mitchell tended as time went on to become more extreme in support of terror bomb- ing and more out of touch with mainstream views. Ironically, although re- signing from the service after his court-martial gave him more freedom to advocate airpower publicly, it also lessened his influence and connection with those actually developing American air doctrine.21 By 1923 Army Air Corps schools had access to Douhet’s writings, but his theories on mass-area bombings of civilians did not gain any wide ac- ceptance. The Italian expanded his theories with publications in 1926, 1928, 1929, and 1930, and the comprehensiveness of his ideas “has made it a too convenient reference for anyone who would ascribe the origins of American ideas on strategic bombing to a single, overriding influence.” At best, “Douhet must rank as no more than one of the multiple influences on Mitchell, his colleagues, and their successors, as they slowly evolved a strate- gic bombard
