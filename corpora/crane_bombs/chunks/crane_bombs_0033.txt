Be- fore his writings appeared, the dominant strategic schools of thought were the Continental School, following the land power theories of Clausewitz that focused on destroying enemy armies, and the Maritime School, based on Mahan’s sea power teachings with the goal of dominating critical sea lanes and choke points. Douhet is given credit for founding the Aerospace School, emphasizing that airpower alone can be decisive and that by con- trolling the air and destroying the enemy’s war-making potential it can make protracted wars obsolete. Probably a more accurate epithet for Douhet is the “Father of Airpower Strategy.” Though it is hard to find the exact sources for the ideas American airmen generated between the wars, the Army Air Corps did pursue an aerospace strategy as it developed its own precision-bombing doctrine.23 In the years preceding World War II, Douhet’s ideas had a more signif- icant impact on some European air forces. In England, influential writers such as J. F. C. Fuller and Basil Liddell Hart echoed Douhet’s opinion that civilians could not withstand aerial bombardment.

By the end of 1941 the RAF was the only means available for the British to strike back at Germany, but daylight raids were proving too costly and night bomb- ing too inaccurate for pinpoint targets.
