he only means available for the British to strike back at Germany, but daylight raids were proving too costly and night bomb- ing too inaccurate for pinpoint targets. Faced with the need to take some offensive action to meet public demands for retaliation and to justify the large resources invested in an independent air service, Sir Arthur “Bomber” Harris’s Bomber Command adopted a Douhetian strategy for mass night raids on German cities to “dehouse German workers” and break civilian morale.24 In contrast, the RAF’s American allies developed a different aerial strategy based on daylight precision bombing of key economic and military objectives. THE CREATION  OF PRECISION -BOMBING  DOCTRINE Although Mitchell’s doctrinal ideas moved closer to Douhet’s in the 1930s and the contrasting official Army position remained that airpower was only an auxiliary force to assist ground troops, a small group of officers at the ACTS were creating their own strategic-bombing doctrine—precision at- tack on critical points of specified industrial target systems to destroy the war-making capacity of enemy states.25 This development would soon have added impact because these same airmen would plan America’s air war in World War II and also figure prominently in executing it. There are two prerequisites for creating new military doctrine. First, higher authorities must realize the need for change and support new ideas. Second, a small and creative group of thinkers must work together to syn- thesize a body of thought expressing a new approach to war. Organizational doctrine arises from an evolutionary process influenced by interpretations of military history, environmental factors like geography and technology, and the fundamental beliefs of a society.26 In the 1920s and 1930s the Air Corps’ leaders sought a coherent doctrine that would be acceptable to the American people and to politicians and that at the same time would be offensive in na- ture, thus necessitating an independent air se
