leaders sought a coherent doctrine that would be acceptable to the American people and to politicians and that at the same time would be offensive in na- ture, thus necessitating an independent air service. While congressional and War Department boards continued to relegate the air arm to auxiliary status, the faculty at ACTS pursued their new doctrine. The theory of precision bombing had begun to take shape in the early 1930s, when Colonel John F. Curry was commandant of the school; he performed the essential function  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 40 --- 22  CHAPTER  TWO of shielding his faculty from Washington while providing much freedom of thought and expression.27 Rising Air Corps leaders such as Carl Spaatz and Frank Andrews supported and contributed to the new ideas being created, as did ACTS instructors (and future generals) Laurence Kuter, George Kenney, Kenneth Walker, and Haywood Hansell. However, the officers most respon- sible for solidifying precision-bombing doctrine into a coherent form were Harold George, Donald Wilson, and Robert Webster.28 George, Wilson, Webster, and other ACTS instructors did not work in a vacuum; they had many lessons from the 1920s to draw on. Everyone ac- knowledged that the public opposed terror bombing of civilians, and this led to military corollaries. “No nation will use its air forces to bomb cities, just for the purpose of destroying the morale of the people by instilling them with fear,” an infantry lieutenant colonel wrote in 1928. “Such action could only bring on the nation the active resentment of the rest of the civilized world, a thing that no nation can afford.” Army and Navy officers as well as members of Congress continually attacked the practice of strategic bom- bardment as a violation of international law.29 Precision-bombing doctrine, attacking factories instead of women and children, offered a way for the Air Corps to be decisive in war without appearing immoral.
