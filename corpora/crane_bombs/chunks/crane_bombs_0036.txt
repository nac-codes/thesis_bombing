29 Precision-bombing doctrine, attacking factories instead of women and children, offered a way for the Air Corps to be decisive in war without appearing immoral. Moreover, improve- ments in technology made the doctrine feasible. Air Corps maneuvers in 1929 impressed observers with the “invincibility of the bomber,” and Walker especially became an outspoken advocate that “the bomber will always get through.” Accurate daylight bombardment began to receive increased em- phasis during the next decade, with the development of the Norden and Sperry bombsights and the B-17 airplane. Precision bombing also called upon a traditional American respect for marksmanship that dated back to frontier days. Moral, legal, cultural, technical, strategic, and tactical reasons combined to shape the theory of precision bombing of industrial targets by the 1930s. Mark Clodfelter has argued that the new doctrine was also shaped by the impetus of Progressive reform so prominent in American politics in the early decades of the twentieth century. Though many Progressives such as Herbert Hoover were engineers who shared a similar practical and sci- entific worldview with airmen, there is no evidence that Air Corps officers identified with such political impulses or parties. Perhaps Progressive ideas might have attracted sympathetic members of Congress to support interwar budgets for new aircraft, but such a reform rationale did not influence the airmen who would fly them. The best that can be said for Clodfelter’s the- ory is that the idea systems surrounding Progressivism and precision bomb- ing arose from similar roots: a desire to utilize modern organizational and  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 41 --- DEVELOPING  DOCTRINE   2 3 engineering expertise rationally to solve serious contemporary problems, whether political or military.30 Perhaps the most important rationale for the new doctrine was the belief that aerial bombardment of specific industrial objectives constituted the most eff
