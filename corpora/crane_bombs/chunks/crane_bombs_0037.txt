y problems, whether political or military.30 Perhaps the most important rationale for the new doctrine was the belief that aerial bombardment of specific industrial objectives constituted the most effective and economical way to wage war, a conclusion drawn from the work of George, Wilson, and Webster. Without their efforts, precision-bombing theory might not have been so coherent, and it definitely would not have been such a powerful influence on the AAF in World War II. One writer has called the precision-bombing concept “one of those rare creative ideas that generate in several minds at about the same time.”31 It seems to have begun with instructor Donald Wilson, chief of the Air Force section, when he observed in 1933 that the operation of a whole railroad system could be stopped by the lack of one lubricating ingredient. He then applied his observation on a larger scale and looked for specific structures in industrial nations that supported their capability to wage war. Because the War Department, in accordance with public opinion, prohibited any study of offensive actions against other nations, ACTS had no strategic air intelli- gence. Wilson therefore looked at the American industrial and social fabric for vulnerabilities, assuming that they would pertain to other industrialized nations. The study could also be used to shape US defenses and thus be within War Department guidelines.32 When Wilson left ACTS in 1934, his inquiry was expanded by two cap- tains in the Department of Air Tactics and Strategy, Harold George and Bob Webster. In a detailed analysis of American transportation networks, power systems, and factories they found that the number of critical targets was rel- atively small and vulnerable to accurate bombardment. They then turned to cities, “the most politically and morally sensitive target system of all.” After studying New York, they estimated that the destruction of only seventeen tar- gets within its transportation, water, and electrical sy
