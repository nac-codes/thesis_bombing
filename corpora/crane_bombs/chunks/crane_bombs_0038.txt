st politically and morally sensitive target system of all.” After studying New York, they estimated that the destruction of only seventeen tar- gets within its transportation, water, and electrical systems would render the city uninhabitable. They also concluded that “with very precise bombing, this could be done without vast destruction or mass casualties.”33 The changes in Air Corps thinking were reflected in ACTS texts. In 1926 the position that an air force was auxiliary to ground forces was abandoned in favor of a Trenchard-style independent, offensive strategy in the manual Employment of Combined Air Forces. The document declared that the enemy’s population and vital points were the true objectives in war. Expressing ideas similar to Douhet’s, it argued that air attack was “a method of imposing will by terrorizing the whole population” and preferable to costly land combat; but, as Gorrell had argued, it maintained that large-scale killing was not  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 42 --- 24  CHAPTER  TWO necessarily required to affect morale. Though this document has been used as evidence of Douhet’s influence at ACTS, with its concentration on “com- plete destruction of vital parts of the enemy’s sources of supply,” the manual is much more in keeping with Gorrell’s work.34 A 1931 text claimed that “with the exception of operations against an en- emy force, a large proportion of the operations of an air force will be against strategical objectives . . . the enemy’s system of supply, reinforcement and evacuation.” The course material did not neglect cities, but it called them “political objectives,” whose population can be attacked directly with gas or explosives or “indirectly” through their water, food, or power supplies. Air forces should not be used against political objectives “except as the result of a careful estimate of the results to be accomplished, when weighed against the suffering of women and children, and the effect of public opinion in neutral
