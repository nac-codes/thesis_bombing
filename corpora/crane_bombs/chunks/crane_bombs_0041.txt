ed against them to recover from attacks and develop countermeasures. Wars would be so much easier if people were not involved. The fourth bad assumption is a spin-off from the previous one, as the over- emphasis on the offensive power of unescorted massed bomber formations without considering that they might actually have to fight through complex and effective defensive systems almost lost the air war. Fifth, while the new theory did not dwell very much on psychological impacts, it did assume that eventually all the physical destruction would contribute to destroying the will to resist as well. Sixth, the emerging doctrine saw modern industrial states as “brittle and closed economic systems,” not open and adaptable as they turned out to be. Seventh, states were seen as rational actors basing political decisions on pure cost–benefit analyses, without nagging distracters like emo- tional or bureaucratic factors. Eighth, the “frailty and manipulability” of pop- ular morale was greatly exaggerated, without consideration that the backlash against bombing might actually increase support of the government and the will to resist. Last, Faber argues that air planners were guilty of the practice of “mirror imaging,” which confused enemy vulnerabilities with our own. Although his fifth and eighth items actually applied to the British more than the Americans, his list is worth pondering, and the impact of those erroneous assumptions would be evident throughout the course of the air war.38  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 44 --- 26  CHAPTER  TWO PRECISION  DOCTRINE  BECOMES  OFFICIAL  POLICY The teachings at ACTS had a strong impact on the Air Corps. Though former ACTS instructors did try to influence higher military educational institutions such as the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leaven- worth, airmen coming to ACTS had rarely been exposed to any coherent air doctrine taught by another military school.39 The primary flying school at Randolph Field and the advanc
