School at Fort Leaven- worth, airmen coming to ACTS had rarely been exposed to any coherent air doctrine taught by another military school.39 The primary flying school at Randolph Field and the advanced school at nearby Kelly Field were designed to give practical flying skills to newly commissioned airmen. There was not a true basic-training program for officers, and specialized training of Air Corps officers in the 1930s was largely limited to Army extension courses. It was hoped that West Point, which produced a large proportion of the new avia- tors, would provide its graduates with some sort of theoretical base.40 Air Service and Air Corps officers were continually frustrated by the ground-oriented nature of the instruction at West Point. Even as late as 1939, the observation mission dominated practical instruction conducted at Mitchell Field on Long Island.41 In classes on military theory, cadets dis- cussed Clausewitz, Saxe, Jomini, Frederick, Marlborough, Gustavus, and Schlieffen but not Douhet or Mitchell.42 Aerial warfare in the 1930s could not be ignored, however, and the bombing lessons from conflicts in China and Spain received much attention in class. Generally, such discussions focused on the tactical ground support role of air operations, which was in keeping with official Army policy and prob- ably reflected a lack of Air Corps instructors as well. Lessons from the Sino- Japanese War showed that aircraft were “very effective in pursuit, useful in artillery spotting, helpful but not decisive in driving infantry from defensive positions.” The best target was troop concentrations. The bombing of cities was dealt with in great detail, however, and conclusions supported the new doctrine evolving at ACTS. “The mistaken Japanese policy of indiscriminate airplane bombing” aroused people in Shanghai and brought them together against Japan; a handout for students stated that “frightfulness united them as no peacetime propaganda could have.” The chief result of
