acks as “contrary to principles of law and humanity.”46 By 1939 higher-level military schools such as the Army War College were teaching America’s senior leaders that despite European acceptance of wan- ton air attacks on defenseless civilians as inevitable, such tactics were consid- ered “butchery in the eyes of a trained soldier” and signs of “a state of moral chaos among nations.” Moreover, bombing cities required too many air re- sources, and even if these were available, results were uncertain. Communi- cations (transportation and signal facilities) and industrial installations were the best targets for strategic airpower. A 1940 staff study at the War College on the “Desirability of Cities, Towns, and Villages as Bombardment Objec- tives” concluded, “There is no historical evidence that aerial bombardment of cities, towns, and villages has ever been productive.” It recommended that such targets should be bombed only “where they contain definite objectives, military or political, the destruction of which will be productive of decisive military results.”47 After Mitchell’s death in 1936, émigré aircraft designer Alexander P. de Seversky became the best-known American air theorist. A keen observer of the lessons of modern warfare in early World War II, he was also a former Russian naval officer who had been strongly influenced by the sea power theories of Mahan. Civilian morale was not a direct objective but would be affected by the results of an aerial blockade of the enemy homeland that precision bombing made possible. He mentioned industrial targets, but he focused more on destroying social structures without the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, going beyond George’s and Webster’s work to meld Douhet’s theories with precision techniques, expanding on the ideas men- tioned in the 1935 ACTS text. “The will to resist can be broken in a peo-  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 46 --- 28  CHAPTER  TWO ple,” he argued, “only by destroying the essentials of the
