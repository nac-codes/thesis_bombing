Seversky did not advocate such tactics, but he did feel that the public should be prepared for them. His ideas circulated widely among air service officers and in numerous jour- nals.48 Walt Disney even made Seversky’s influential book, Victory through Airpower , into a movie and thus exposed the American and British public to his views on strategic-bombing doctrine.49 However, Seversky’s ideas did not accurately reflect the mature preci- sion-bombing doctrine that ACTS was teaching and that would guide the AAF into and through World War II, a philosophy that focused on destroy- ing “carefully selected targets in the industrial and service systems on which the enemy people, their industries, and the armed forces are dependent.”50 The clearest and most important enunciation of that doctrine came in an August 1941 document known as AWPD/1. Army Regulation 95-5 of June 1941, creating the AAF, gave the new orga- nization limited autonomy, but despite a growing appreciation for airpower in official circles, the actual role of strategic bombing was unclear.51 The AAF’s opportunity to establish its role in winning the war came in July 1941 when President Roosevelt sent a letter to the secretaries of War and the Navy “requesting the preparation of the Over-All Production requirements required to defeat our potential enemies.” Because the services could not agree on a joint strategy, they each estimated their own requirements.
