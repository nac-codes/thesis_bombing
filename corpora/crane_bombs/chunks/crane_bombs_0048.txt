of attacks, but it did state that “the entire bombing effort might be applied toward this purpose when it becomes apparent that the proper psychological conditions exist.” This one-time exception to general policy was sanctioned only as a way to end the war quickly, but late in the war this concept of an aerial Todestoss (deathblow) would prove a potent lure for American leaders, also helping to sanction the use of the atomic bomb.54 After review by Spaatz and Arnold and discussions with General George C. Marshall, Army chief of staff, and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, AWPD/1 was accepted as part of the overall reply to the president’s assign- ment.

Though the Pacific theater was not addressed, a strategic air offensive based on precision-bombing doctrine was written into official policy. Like Gorrell’s initial work, this plan had also been developed in response to a need to pre- dict production requirements, not to create strategy. Yet with the impetus of AWPD/1, the air assault on enemy war industries and transportation lines that Gorrell’s study had envisioned over two decades earlier would soon be- come reality.55  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 49 --- 313. FROM DOCTRINE TO PRACTICE: EXECUTING THE AIR OFFENSIVE AGAINST GERMANY The US Army Air Force will concentrate its efforts upon the systematic destruction of selected vital elements of the German military and industrial machine through precision bombing in daylight. The RAF will concentrate upon mass air attacks of industrial areas at night, to break down morale. . . . There is, of course, a tremendous amount of incidental damage to be expecte
