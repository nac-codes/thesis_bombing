There is, of course, a tremendous amount of incidental damage to be expected from the hundreds of bombs which drop near the aiming point but do not strike the particular part of the target selected. —AWPD-42 , 9 September 19421 AWPD/1 had been a projection if war came.

The Navy would never agree to that, and such an approach would not have been able to shift with war’s changing fortunes.
