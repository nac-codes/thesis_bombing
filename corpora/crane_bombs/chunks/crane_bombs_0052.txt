Marshall got a chance to see their copy. Fearing the wrath of the Army chief of staff, Hansell asked Gen- eral Arnold to get him back to England immediately, and within an hour, the planner was airborne. As it turned out, AWPD-42 was never accepted by the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, though it did influence production priorities.5 Nevertheless, its vision of strategic bombing was furthered by an almost simultaneous directive from the AAF and RAF in the United Kingdom, which announced a combined offensive of American day and British night bombing. The “Joint American/British Directif on Day Bomber Operations Involving Fighter Co-operation” was the result of negotiations with the RAF to arrange fighter support for Eaker’s Bomber Command. The document indicated that the British would support the American attempt to execute its daylight precision-bombing doctrine and foreshadowed the agreement that would be reached in January 1943 at the Casablanca Conference. There an adept presentation from Eaker, now commanding Eighth Air Force with Spaatz taking over the Northwest African air forces for Operation TORCH , convinced Winston Churchill and others not to force the Americans to join the RAF’s night bombing campaign and instead to exploit the many ways that day and night raids complemented each other. Executing both reduced airspace congestion and put twenty-four-hour pressure on the Luftwaffe; fur- ther, fires from daylight attacks could act as markers in the dark. Eaker also explained the difficulties in transforming the Eighth to conduct night opera- tions and argued that because of better visibility and better bombsights, day bombers could hit smaller targets and were five times more accurate than the best night bombing. Therefore, the same installation could be destroyed with a force only one-fifth as large. In response to questions about the perfor- mance of his bombers up to now, especially their small numbers and lack of any attacks on Germany, Eaker projec
