stroyed with a force only one-fifth as large. In response to questions about the perfor- mance of his bombers up to now, especially their small numbers and lack of any attacks on Germany, Eaker projected a bright future, where the success of Operation TORCH  would require the diversion of fewer air assets, new air-  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 52 --- 34  CHAPTER  THREE craft would arrive including more long-range fighter escorts, blind-bombing techniques would circumvent bad weather, and crews would continue to get more experienced.6 The Combined Chiefs of Staff issued CCS 166/I/D, usually referred to as the Casablanca Directive, on 21 January 1943. It described the aims and operations for the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO) from the United Kingdom, describing missions for both the night raiders of RAF Bomber Command and the daylight bombers from the AAF. The overall objective recognized the desires of both air campaigns; “the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic system, and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where the capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.” Hedging its bets, the CBO would target both means and will. For the former, objectives in pri- ority were German submarine construction yards, the German aircraft in- dustry, transportation, oil plants, and other targets in enemy war industry. This generally reflected AWPD’s products, except that the current U-boat threat to the British Isles made that a top priority for the CCS because it threatened the buildup of American resources in the United Kingdom, if not its very survival. Those objectives could be altered as the strategic sit- uation developed. In addition, the directive mentioned other targets with special political or military significance, such as French submarine pens in the Bay of Biscay, Berlin, and targets to assist amphibious operations in the Mediterranean or Northwest Europe.
