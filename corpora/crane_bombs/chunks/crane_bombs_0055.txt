bombing accuracy and available munitions would destroy critical targets quickly and permanently, and that intelligence could properly select those vital objectives. It took until 1944 for American intelligence organiza- tions to truly mature. In the meantime, the rush to build up bomber aircraft came at the expense of the maintenance and support structures necessary to repair all the damage from enemy fighters and flak as well as provide routine services. There were replacement aircrew shortages as well. The Eighth’s resource plight was exacerbated by the siphoning off of units to support General Dwight Eisenhower’s Mediterranean operations. Not only did Spaatz take considerable heavy bomber assets with him initially but also Eisenhower was continually requesting more bomb groups whenever a major operation hit a snag, such as when he got three B-24 groups diverted after the near debacle at Salerno when he invaded Italy. Light and infrequent at- tacks on coastal cities with U-boat facilities did little damage while allowing the Germans to develop their daylight defensive system. Further problems resulted from CCS decisions at the Trident and Quadrant conferences in May and August 1943. While endorsing the CBO, eventually designated as Operation POINTBLANK , as a necessary preliminary to the invasion of western Europe, scheduling that landing for 1 May 1944 complicated priorities for the buildup of forces. Not only would ground divisions now be competing for resources but also the AAF had to set up an expeditionary tactical air force to support them on the Continent.8 Hardened submarine pens proved an especially frustrating target system, but by 1 July other countermeasures were winning the Battle of Atlantic, and the American air campaign shifted its primary focus to the German aircraft industry. Under the right visual bombing conditions, results could be fan- tastic. A raid on Marienberg on 9 October knocked the aircraft plant com- pletely out of action for four mo
