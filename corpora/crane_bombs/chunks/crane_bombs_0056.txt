e German aircraft industry. Under the right visual bombing conditions, results could be fan- tastic. A raid on Marienberg on 9 October knocked the aircraft plant com- pletely out of action for four months. Fifty-eight percent of bombs fell within 1,000 feet of the aiming point and 83 percent within 2,000 feet. However, conditions were rarely right, especially in fall and winter weather.9 A close examination of the iconic attacks on the ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt reveals much about the Eighth Air Force’s shortcomings at that time, and also about the unique Clausewitzian friction of air war in 1943.10 As the maturing intelligence apparatus shaping Eaker’s operations focused increasingly on attacking the aircraft industry, they realized that antifriction  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 54 --- 36  CHAPTER  THREE bearings were a tempting vulnerability for the production of all armaments. The target was first identified by a special Committee of Operation Analysts established by General Arnold in late 1942 to include civilian experts in developing industrial intelligence. Their initial March 1943 report recom- mended fighter production as the first targeting priority, and ball bearings second. When it was sent to the United Kingdom, it was quickly accepted by both the British and Americans, and endorsed by Portal. Although air- craft factories needed over two million ball bearings a month (one medium bomber engine required over a thousand), tanks, motor vehicles, and weap- ons all required them as well. This target system seemed particularly suscep- tible to a “knockout blow” because it was concentrated primarily in six cities, and about half of all production came from a single facility at Schweinfurt.11 The first of forty raids on the ball-bearing industry came exactly one year after the first American heavy bomber operation from the United King- Submarine pens such as these in Hamburg were generally invulnerable to any bombs except some especially large RAF
