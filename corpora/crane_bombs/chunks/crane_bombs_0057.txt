exactly one year after the first American heavy bomber operation from the United King- Submarine pens such as these in Hamburg were generally invulnerable to any bombs except some especially large RAF ordnance. Though land–water contrast made them good targets for radar-directed bombing, American airmen experienced much frustration trying to cause any meaningful damage.

The attacking force of 376 B-17s was the largest ever dispatched by the Eighth Air Force. (The British had already executed a 1,000-bomber raid on Cologne as early as May 1942.) The ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt and Messerschmitt aircraft complex at Regensburg were the most important tar- gets on the bombing priority list; they also required the deepest penetration into Germany to date. Eaker thought his force had been pushed into the dangerous mission before it was really ready. The plan called for Colonel Curtis LeMay’s Third Bombardment Division, with long-range tanks, to at- tack Regensburg and then fly to North Africa. The First Bombardment Divi- sion would hit Schweinfurt, following ten minutes behind. German fighters would have to choose which force to engage, and where. After a couple weeks of delays, weather forecasts on 16 August finally predicted good flying con- ditions over Germany and North Africa, and the mission was scheduled for the next day. Unfortunately, but not atypically, English bases were socked in by clouds the next morning. LeMay had trained his crews to take off in such conditions; he got his force airborne, but the other air division remained on the ground. The Regensburg force could not delay and headed for the target. Brigadier General Frederick Anderson, commander of VIII Bomber Command, decided to hold the Schweinfurt force for three and a half hours, to
