TIDE By the time that D-day occurred, the issue in the air war was no longer in doubt. The back of the German air force had been broken not by precision bombing to cripple its supporting industrial structures but rather by a brutal campaign of attrition that destroyed aircraft and killed experienced pilots. This would not have been possible without the advent of the P-51 Mustang, which could fly deep into Germany and then outperform any fighter oppo- sition except jets, as well as operational and tactical adjustments that maxi- mized opportunities for that attrition to occur. Before the Eighth Air Force made these changes, there was a major com- mand shakeup as the new year opened, orchestrated by General Arnold, who had become increasingly critical of Eaker’s performance. At the Second Cairo Conference in early December 1943, Arnold complained bitterly to the CCS about the Eighth’s aircraft availability rates and targeting priorities. In a swirl of meetings involving the president and General Eisenhower, the AAF commander hammered out an agreement on a new arrangement to control the American strategic bombing campaign over Europe, after aban- doning hopes to get a single Allied strategic air force commander. On 1 January 1944, Lieutenant General Carl Spaatz took over the USSTAF, with a headquarters built on the existing Eighth Air Force structure. Spaatz was concerned his transfer would upset the RAF-AAF balance in the Mediterra- nean, which reinforced Arnold’s decision to move Eaker to be Air Officer Commanding, Mediterranean Allied Air Forces. Major General Jimmy Doo- little, who had been in charge of the Northwest African Strategic Air Forces, would be brought in to command the Eighth, while Major General Nathan  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 58 --- 40  CHAPTER  THREE Twining would be sent from the Pacific to take over the newly created Fif- teenth Air Force, operating from airfields in Italy.16 It is not surprising that Eisenhower wanted to bring his team
