THREE Twining would be sent from the Pacific to take over the newly created Fif- teenth Air Force, operating from airfields in Italy.16 It is not surprising that Eisenhower wanted to bring his team with him, especially considering that USSTAF would eventually be assigned to him to support the invasion. Though the shift was presented to Eaker as a move up to greater responsibilities, he knew he was really being fired by someone who had been his friend for twenty-five years. He fought angrily to keep command of the Eighth Air Force.

The smaller Fifteenth actually had some better results early in Janu
