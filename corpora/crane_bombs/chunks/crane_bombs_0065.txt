By the time production output could be restored, shortages in avi- ation fuel and chaos in the rail system would keep planes undelivered or grounded. For more immediate impact, during the month of February the Luftwaffe lost more than one third of its single-engine fighters and almost a fifth of its pilots.22 Although USSTAF quickly made up its losses in men and mat√©riel, this was not p
