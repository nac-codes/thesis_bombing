contribution for air operations against Pantelleria and Sicily. Studying the effects of attacks on the rail systems in Sicily and Italy, which had really not been that successful yet in achieving operational and strategic impact, he wrote a paper for the Allied Expeditionary Air Force in January entitled “Delay and Disorganization of Enemy Movement by Rail.” He advocated an attack on the seventy-six most important servicing and repair facilities in Northwest Europe, promising to paralyze movement throughout France. Spaatz had his own proposal, developed during Big Week by the Economic Objectives Unit of the Economic Warfare Division of the US embassy in London. It asserted that attacks on German oil pro- duction and stocks were the surest way to hasten German defeat, and they would impede enemy mobility not just in France but in every area of the European theater. Not surprisingly, Bomber Harris wanted to continue just bombing cities.25 After dealing with the conflicting plans and personalities, on 25 March Eisenhower decided that the transportation plan had the best chance to achieve the effects he wanted, though he would later have to overcome re- sistance to it from Churchill, who feared too many French civilian casu- alties from attacks on marshaling yards. Alfred Mierzejewski gives Tedder the primary credit for getting a plan implemented that would have such a significant impact on the war. Allied intelligence continually overestimated  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 63 --- FROM  DOCTRINE  TO PRACTICE   4 5 the capacity and resilience of Germany’s railways, and among air leaders, only Tedder seemed to realize their vulnerability. In addition, he had the bu- reaucratic skills to work effectively within Eisenhower’s headquarters to be heard. Spaatz also managed to get permission to launch some oil attacks, first with Fifteenth Air Force raids in April that considerably reduced capacity at the Ploesti refineries, and later with more widespread attacks includin
