By then the transportation assault had shifted to focus heavily on bridges, which proved to be a key vulnerability of the system in France.26 Once control of the heavy bombers reverted back to air commanders in September, the assault on oil and transportation systems continued, with devastating effects on the German economy and Axis military capability. Although those target systems had always been included in prewar concepts to bomb the Reich, it was the impetus of the planning to support OVERLORD that really thrust them to the forefront of the strategic air campaign. The Americans had over 7,000 fighters and bombers to throw into battle, while Bomber Command’s 1,500 heavy bombers could carry up to ten tons of bombs each.
