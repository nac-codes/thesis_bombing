riction against so-called blind bombing of the  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 65 --- FROM  DOCTRINE  TO PRACTICE   4 7 Reich. A new Eighth Air Force directive on “Attack of Secondary and Last Resort Targets” decreed that because any city large enough to be identifiable on a radar scope had viable military targets, it could be classified as an ac- ceptable secondary target if primary objectives were obscured by the same overcast. The Fifteenth issued similar guidance, stressing that “under no cir- cumstances will bombs be returned to bases after being carried over German territory.” Restrictions about bombing Axis-occupied areas remained much stricter.28 Although these policies accepted greater risk for German civilians, they also increased pressure on the Reich’s deteriorating transportation net- work and drew inexperienced German pilots into weather conditions for which they were not prepared. Though Richard Davis considers the target category of marshaling yards to be just a “euphemism for area bombing,” he admits that “the bombardment of marshalling yards also broke the back of the German war economy,” a position echoed in Mierzejewski’s superb anal- ysis of the demise of the Reich.29 There is no indication that any American leader or airman envisioned such attacks as targeting civilian morale either, which is also a normal feature of typical area bombing such as the RAF prac- ticed. AAF area bombardment still targeted capacity. The apparent stalemate in fall 1944 after the breakout from Normandy and the surprise German offensive in December also spurred ground command- ers to put more pressure on airmen to increase their operations. It should not be forgotten that even while Speer was declaring an end to the industrial war, American soldiers were still struggling to eliminate the remnants of the Bulge. There was no way that air commanders could have avoided bombing in poor visibility while they had so many aircraft and soldiers were dying on the ground. In
