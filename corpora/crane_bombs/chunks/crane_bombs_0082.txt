contrast to the previous week, seventeen aircraft sustained significant battle damage on this raid, mostly from flak. The group finally lost an aircraft in combat on 19 March. Thirty-three bombers led the Second Bombardment Division to hit the aircraft assembly plant at Neuburg. They ducked 1,500 feet to get under haze at the target but then mounted an excellent visual attack. On the way home one B-24 lost two engines and headed for France, never to be heard from again. On the 20th one squadron sent out eleven planes as part of a Fourteenth Wing mission  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 73 --- FROM  DOCTRINE  TO PRACTICE   5 5 against the oil refinery at Hemmingstadt. The lead bombardier adjusted im- properly for smoke obscuring the target, and all the bombs went past it. By this time in the war enemy fighters appeared reluctant to engage the large bomber formations surrounded by hungry Mustangs, so on the 21st the group mounted two missions to blast airfield installations to clear the way for strafing runs by USSTAF fighters, who were also hunting for jets. Again gremlins rode along with the 44th Group. Thirty-five bombers hit Achmer airfield in the morning, but only one squadron had excellent results because the others bombed out of sequence. Twelve more aircraft headed out in the afternoon for the airfield at Essen. Late in the bomb run, a flak hit severed the lead aircraftâ€™s electrical circuits for the autopilot and bombsight. Before the bombardier could adjust, all bombs were away, landing about 4,000 feet east of the target. The next day an attack by thirty-two bombers on Schwa- bisch Hall airfield went much better, with superb results, though one aircraft was lost when it crashed on takeoff. Weather was finally improving, allowing much more visual bombing. Thirty bombers pummeled the Rheine marshaling yard on the 23rd. The next day again featured two missions. Twenty-seven group B-24s led the Fourteenth Wing on a critical supply drop for ground forces that
