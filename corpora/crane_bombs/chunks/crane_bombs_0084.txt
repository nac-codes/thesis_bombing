B-24s out of an improvised airdrome at San Giovanni, twenty miles southwest of Foggia, Italy, beginning in February 1944. “The Vulgar Vultures” consisted of the 740th, 741st, 742nd, and 743rd bomb squadrons. During December the unit had not been drawn into the tactical missions to support Allied ground forces fighting in the Bulge and instead had continued to hit oil and transportation targets. It usually flew as part of the 304th Bomb Wing.34 January 1945 was an unproductive month for the Vultures. Twenty-seven group B-24s flew their first mission of the new year on 4 January as part of 132 bombers blasting the Porto Nuovo marshaling yard in Verona, with excellent results. Thirteen aircraft were crowded off the bomb run and had to hit the secondary objective, the marshaling yard at Vicenza. Results there were also good. One bomber crash landed from flak damage. Twenty-six bombers took off on the 8th to attack a storage depot at Linz, Austria, but after an eight-hour flight bad weather forced them all to return with their bombs. No missions could be flown for another week, until twenty-nine B-24s launched to attack the Florisdorf marshaling yards at Vienna, a heav- ily bombed city.35 Only nineteen planes were able to get through to bomb with H2X through overcast. Bombs were widely scattered. Nine aircraft were turned back by weather, and another could not release its bombs. The mis- sion against the railroad bridge at Broz, Austria, on the 19th did not go much better. Twenty-eight B-24s took off. Five had to turn back because their leader could not open his bomb bays, two had mechanical problems and had to return early, and another crashed from engine failure. The other twenty Liberators bombed through overcast with unobserved results. The next day was worse. Twenty-six aircraft heading for Linz again had to turn back be- cause of impenetrable cloud banks at the head of the Adriatic Sea. On the last day of the month, the group launched thirty-seven aircraft against
