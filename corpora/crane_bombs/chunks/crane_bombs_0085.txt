aircraft heading for Linz again had to turn back be- cause of impenetrable cloud banks at the head of the Adriatic Sea. On the last day of the month, the group launched thirty-seven aircraft against the oil refinery at Moosbierbaum, Austria. Again they had to bomb with H2X, and again results were unobserved. The good news was that only two bombers had been lost that month, with only one due to enemy action. The weather did not get much better in February.

Nineteen used H2X to bomb through overcast and a smoke screen, but fourteen in the second attack achieved fair results with a visual attack through a hole in the clouds.

The next day the Fifteenth launched small “lone- wolf ” individual attacks on Moosebierbaum in total overcast. Three Vultures participated, but like everyone else, they missed the target. The group finally got good weather on the 13th, and results were much better. Again two forces were sent out, designated “red” and “blue,” usually Vienna was not onl
