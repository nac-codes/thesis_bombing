the formation, and thirty- eight achieved only fair results against their secondary target of the shipyards at Fiume, Italy. The next day’s weather was even worse, as twenty-eight bomb- ers headed for the marshaling yards at Amstaten, Germany, had to turn back with their bomb loads. Headquarters then gave the group a broad range of possible targets to hit in order to get some bombs delivered despite the weather. About half of twenty-eight planes dispatched on the 19th attacked alternate objectives of harbors at Fiume or Pola with poor results, while the rest just brought their loads back. Twenty-eight Vultures had to hit their sixth priority alternate target the next day, the shipyards at Trieste, but 80 percent of the bombs landed within 1,000 feet of the aiming point—a fine demonstration of precision bombing in the right conditions. The Fifteenth mounted another maximum effort against Viennese marshaling yards on the 21st. Twenty-one B-24s from the group contributed to blocking the main rail lines in the central marshaling yards using H2X, but six other bombers had to return early because of various equipment failures. On the 22nd, the Fifteenth Air Force participated in Operation CLAR- ION, hitting smaller transportation targets throughout Germany, Austria, and occupied Italy. Weather continued to interfere. Two waves of forty-three Vultures were supposed to hit marshaling yards at Straubling, Germany, but instead they had to attack their alternate objective, rail yards at Bischof-  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 77 --- FROM  DOCTRINE  TO PRACTICE   5 9 hofen, Austria, with good results. Twenty-eight bombers dispatched to attack the marshaling yard at Gmund, Germany, the next day returned with their bomb loads when they could not acquire targets through the heavy overcast. Considering the directive about not bringing bombs back from the Reich, it must be assumed the aircraft turned back before reaching their objective in southern Germany, or else they just i
