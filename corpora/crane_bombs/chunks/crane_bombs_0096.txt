vealed that 67 percent of the population favored unqualified and indiscriminate bombing of Japanese cit- ies, and only 10 percent responded with an outright no.5 The same justifica- tion of tit for tat that motivated earlier Luftwaffe and RAF raids on London and Berlin seemed to be evident here.6 Subsequent surveys produced similar results. A majority of Americans favored urban bombing even if it brought Axis retaliation against US cities, implying either a deep commitment or a resignation to total warfare and reflecting the intense anxiety about a war that appeared to be going so disastrously. For religious reasons, most Ameri- cans expressed resistance to bombing Rome, but by early 1944 three-quarters of those polled approved bombing historic religious buildings and shrines if military leaders believed such attacks were necessary.7 The only significant flurry of US protest against strategic bombing came in response to a pamphlet, “Massacre by Bombing,” written by a British cit- izen, Vera Brittain, and published in America by the Fellowship of Recon- ciliation, a small pacifist group. She contended that mass bombing just sped up the slaughter and destruction normally occurring only on fighting fronts, produced a downward spiral of moral values, did not induce revolt or break morale, and caused destruction that would cripple postwar Europe and sow the psychological seeds of a third world war. She also noted that the British in bombed areas were less likely to support RAF attacks on enemy cities than their compatriots who had been spared.8 Her work did not attract significant attention, however, until March 1944 when the New York Times reprinted ex- cerpts along with an introductory petition signed by twenty-eight prominent educators, professionals, and clergy (mostly the last). The article, “Oblitera- tion Raids on German Cities Protested in US,” caused intense public reac- tion, and over 200 articles were written condemning Brittain.9 The paper received “unusually
