Alfred Hassler wrote “Slaughter of the Innocent” in Fellowship in February 1944, and German American Ger- hart Segar was condemned for his editorials in Neue Volkszeitung and for his commentary on “Town Meeting of the Air,” when he stated that American pilots were exhibiting “totalitarian thinking” by “finding satisfaction in blow- ing up women and children.” The national religious press, especially Catho- lic journals, were also often critical of indiscriminate bombing.14 In one of the most penetrating critiques, Father John C.
