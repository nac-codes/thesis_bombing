sential to civilian life, and obliteration bombing of civilian areas, however repugnant to humane feelings, are still justifiable on Christian principles, if they are essential to the successful con- duct of a war that is itself justified.”16 The majority of public opinion on killing enemy civilians was probably accurately represented by the reactions to Brittain’s article, ranging between avid support for vengeful urban attacks and resigned acceptance of a regretta- bly unavoidable practice. The average American might not have been aware of the extent of the destruction that bombing wreaked on cities; posters de- picted Allied bombers attacking factories instead of people, and periodicals described B-17s dropping explosives down industrial smokestacks. Even if Americans had known the exact results of bombing, it would not have made much difference. Most families had experienced the deaths of loved ones, friends, or neighbors; if bombing enemy civilians would speed victory and save American lives, it had to be done. ATTITUDES  OF LEADERS  IN WASHINGTON Many Americans were comforted, however, by the belief that the AAF avoided indiscriminate killing of civilians whenever possible. In turn, AAF leaders perceived a public opinion in line with the position of publications like the New Republic , which stated that it did not approve of terror bombing but added that to the best of its knowledge most bombardment was directed at military objectives.17 A subtle, important interaction was maintained be- tween public perceptions of American strategic bombing and the attitudes of the leaders carrying it out. Air Force planners interpreted public opinion as favoring precision attacks on industrial and military targets without indis- criminate civilian casualties, one of the influences that shaped AAF bomb- ing doctrine. Military reports and news releases designed to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of pinpoint bombardment in turn shaped public opinion. This use of info
