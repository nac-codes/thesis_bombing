In keeping with the impression given in his early writings that he would try almost anything if he had enough aircraft, Arnold commented favorably on plans to bomb volcanoes around Tokyo and schools of fish off the coast of Japan.37 He was fascinated with pilot- less flying bombs like the German V-1s and wanted to retaliate for German booby traps in North Africa by dropping explosive devices in fountain pens and pocketbooks onto German territory. Foreshadowing a tactic eventually adopted by the Japanese, Arnold also had his staff investigate a plan to use “Vinylite” film balloons to drop incendiaries on Japan.38 There seemed to be little consideration for ethics in Arnold’s decisions, but he did espouse the traditional moral position of air power theory that bombing would cost fewer lives than land warfare and end the war quickly. Like other air leaders, he sincerely believed that the decisive power of mod- ern aerial technology could prevent a repeat of the deadlocked carnage of World War I and achieve swift and relatively bloodless victory. He told his commanders that “when used with the proper degree of understanding, [the bomber] becomes, in effect, the most humane of all weapons.” He also real- ized the politica
