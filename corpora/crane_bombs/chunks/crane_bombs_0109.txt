sue in op- position to British attempts to enlist American participation in terror attacks and deviations from precision bombing. Russell Weigley calls him “a pillar of common sense,” whom ground commanders could always talk to. Although Spaatz believed that “we have proven the precision bombing principle in this war,” he realized that with the limits of technology, “our precision . . . is in a relative not a literal sense,” and he continued to strive for “pickle barrel ac- curacy.”46 He also had a more realistic view of Arnold’s publicity campaign, and though he supported his chief, he was wary that “the people back home are getting the idea now [April 1944] that the War is won and apparently we have unintentionally given the impression that more has been accomplished than has actually been accomplished.” While Arnold pushed for optimistic reports of the triumphs of air power, Spaatz wanted to “lean a little on the side of understatement” to avoid false confidence at home and mistrust of superiors by the airmen who had to engage the German fighters supposedly destroyed by the AAF.47 Weigley also claims that “Spaatz was an airman genuinely troubled over the moral questions raised by aerial bombardment.”48 The USSTAF com- mander wrote in his diary after the dropping of the atomic bomb, “I have never favored the destruction of cities as such with all inhabitants being killed.” In an often-quoted 1962 interview, however, he claimed, “It wasn’t for religious or moral reasons that I didn’t go along with urban area bomb- ing.”49 One must be careful in interpreting this statement; Spaatz was em- phasizing in the interview that the AAF bombed strategic military targets because that was the quickest way to win the war, not because the United States was morally superior to the British. From the beginning of the war, Spaatz condemned efforts to “belittle the RAF and their bombing effort” even though he was not “an enthusiastic supporter of all they do.”50 Spaatz  File: --- cra
