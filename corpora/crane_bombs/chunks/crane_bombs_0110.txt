From the beginning of the war, Spaatz condemned efforts to “belittle the RAF and their bombing effort” even though he was not “an enthusiastic supporter of all they do.”50 Spaatz  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 93 --- ATTITUDES  OF LEADERS  AND  THE PUBLIC   7 5 had helped develop precision-bombing doctrine and pursued it doggedly in Europe. Although he did emphasize the efficiency of such tactics, he also continually expressed concern over civilian casualties caused by bombing. Richard Davis argues that Spaatz’s devotion to precision bombing actually limited his ability to appreciate joint operations, and especially the difficul- ties and utility of ground operations. However, he did the best he could to develop a capable all weather force. As Davis writes of Spaatz, “He used the most modern radar, employed electronic countermeasures, took full advan- tage of ULTRA, and pushed his commanders and their men and machines to their limits in order to exploit all the force available to him. Once he had created this available force, it had to be employed.” His dilemma was “how to wield an expanding force of limited accuracy against an opponent who had large reserves of manpower and machine tools without causing excessive or unnecessary collateral damage.” Davis, like Schaffer, believes that Spaatz’s use of so much blind bombing and his decision to relax bombing restrictions that protected German civilians departed from the doctrine and ethics he espoused, but Davis concedes, “To Spaatz, to most of his fellow soldiers, to his government, and to the people his government represented it was better to err on the side of excessive force by pulverizing the Reich, than to leave it the strength to resist and kill Allied soldiers.”51 Spaatz’s primary objective was to make the maximum contribution to winning the war in Europe. He cooperated with the ground effort when required, but he believed that precision bombing of economic targets, espe- cially oil, made the best us
