He cooperated with the ground effort when required, but he believed that precision bombing of economic targets, espe- cially oil, made the best use of his bombers. His subordinate commanders supported his goals and AAF doctrine, though their attitudes demonstrated varying degrees of concern for morality, efficiency, and public opinion, de- pending on their background and training. Lieutenant General Jimmy Doolittle, commander of the Eighth Air Force in 1944–1945, seemed to share Spaatz’s attitude toward morality in strategic bombing.

At the age of ninety-six, he took the time to dictate a reply to a letter from a young schoolgirl asking about his own heroism and famous people he had known. His son, John, typed for him, “The General does not consider
