per fighter escorts, and poor selection of target systems, American daylight bombers in 1942 had not been able to match the night efforts of RAF Bomber Command, which included 1,000 plane raids. Eaker made the presentation that convinced Churchill and others of the merits of a CBO involving round-the-clock bombing, thus pre- serving the AAF’s chance to vindicate precision-bombing doctrine. Arnold also often sent Eaker to make presentations to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the AAF. Eaker had written books and articles with Arnold, and the latter fre- quently asked his editorial advice. When an article criticizing daylight bomb- ing appeared in Reader’s Digest and caused a stir, Eaker wrote an official reply defending American air strategy that was released by the War Department.57 His comments to Arnold and other sources reveal that Eaker was not as committed to precision bombing as Spaatz or Anderson. He advised Arnold to put in a prewar Saturday Evening Post article that it was “probably uneco- nomical to bomb civil populations unless in extreme cases such as London or Paris, where it would be done for the morale effect in the hope for a short war.” He admitted in a 1972 interview that he was not “completely sold” on daylight precision bombing when he took over the Eighth Air Force in En- gland in 1942; he viewed his operations as a test of the concept, though he felt that Arnold and Marshall were “relying on him to make it w ork.” If he had failed to save daylight precision bombardment at Casablanca, he was pre- pared to shift his forces to night bombing in three to six months after install- ing flame dampeners, taking out unnecessary machine guns, and retraining crews.58 He proved quicker to fully embrace the new nonvisual bombing tech- nology than Spaatz, which contributed to the Fifteenth Air Force’s superiority in such missions while it was under his control as the commander of Medi- terranean Allied Air Forces. In late 1944 General Spaatz criticized diversion
