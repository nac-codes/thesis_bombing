ributed to the Fifteenth Air Force’s superiority in such missions while it was under his control as the commander of Medi- terranean Allied Air Forces. In late 1944 General Spaatz criticized diversions of Eaker’s Fifteenth Air Force from oil targets, but Eaker advocated dispersed attacks to destroy German morale, suggesting that such tactics might also pull defenses away from oil targets. When Eaker did oppose terror attacks in early 1945, his position was based on his fears about the political and historical ramifications of “throwing the strategic bomber at the man in the street.”59 DIFFERENCES  WITH  THE BRITISH The attitudes of American leaders committed to daylight precision bombing were bound to clash with the views of their RAF counterparts dedicated to  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 97 --- ATTITUDES  OF LEADERS  AND  THE PUBLIC   7 9 “dehousing” German workers and obliterating whole cities. From the early days of the war, US military attaches in England had been sending reports criticizing the inaccuracy of night bombing, yet AAF personnel understood the rationale for RAF tactics.60 They knew that aircraft capabilities and Ger- man countermeasures rendered British daylight precision attacks ineffec- tual, but public pressure demanded that the RAF strike back at Germany. Night raids on urban areas seemed the only viable alternative. If the British had possessed the long-range escort fighters that eventually made daylight bombing practicable, their campaign might have developed differently. But by 1942 AAF leaders realized that British aircraft, with their heavy bomb loads, inaccurate bombsights, and sparse defensive armament, were primar- ily adapted to night attacks and that the heavily armed American planes, with smaller bomb loads, good bombsights, and no flame dampers, were chiefly suited to daylight operations.61 Until they could prove the viability of their own tactics, AAF leaders were wary of criticism.
