British leaders or journalists who criticized daylight bom- bardment were often invited to go on American missions. Joint statements were issued to emphasize the complementary nature of RAF and AAF cam- Eighth Air Force B-24 Liberators bombing harbor installations at Dunkirk, France, on 15 February 1943.
