a Calling Europe,” warning the French that though the United States had “only the greatest sympathy” toward them, “all factories in France that are working for Germany are susceptible to being bombarded.” Because bombs dropped from high altitudes often fell short of or beyond the target, “all those who live within two kilometers of facto- ries working for Germany are advised to move.” Even with this warning, casualties from a raid on Lille dismayed Spaatz; later in the month, to avoid similar results, he gave orders to his Eighth Air Force that if their primary military target was obscured, they could not attack Paris as an alternate objec- tive.63 The responsibility for political matters such as bombing in occupied countries was left to the British Air Ministry, and on 29 October their of- fice issued a restrictive bombardment policy that limited targets in occupied countries to military objectives located far away from populated areas.64 The 29 October directive established a double standard that would exist throughout the war, allowing far more latitude for air attacks within Ger- many than in occupied zones. The policy presented no problems to the RAF because they were targeting German morale and cities. In contrast, confident in their own accuracy, chafing to attack the enemy and its support structures, and seemingly unappreciative that air power had “political as well as military” effects, the Americans were not happy with the restrictions that limited attacks against lucrative targets in occupied countries.65 Such objec- tives were much closer to British bases, not as heavily defended as targets in Germany, and provided better opportunities to perfect daylight-bombing techniques with less risk. Not only the airmen were unhappy.
