risks “which must be the lot of any individ- ual who participates directly in the war effort of a belligerent nation.” This policy applied to German workers as well as to the French and showed a con- sistency in thought independent of political considerations. Axis employees were no longer viewed as noncombatants, an important step in the escalation to total war. Yet it must be noted that this combatant status applied only to workers in factories being bombed; the AAF strategic campaign, unlike that of the RAF, did not target any laborers in their homes.67 Although the Brit- ish seemed willing to bomb any German, anywhere, the Americans wanted to target any Axis worker in any factory supporting that war effort. However, motivated largely by Winston Churchill’s concerns about the backlash from bombing of occupied areas, in this case the British seemed more concerned about civilian casualties than the Americans. One can only speculate whether Spaatz would have been more receptive to Portal’s pleas than Eaker, but when Spaatz returned to England and was named commander of the newly created USSTAF in December 1943 he continued bombing precision targets near conquered cities. Also in January 1944 Doolittle, who had commanded the Northwest African Strategic Air Force, replaced Eaker as commander of the Eighth Air Force. Spaatz and Doolittle continued to debate the British over the issue of civilian casualties in occupied countries, this time concerning the air campaign to support the impending cross-Channel invasion.

The plan was supported by Deputy Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Tedder and Allied Expeditionary Air Force Commander Air Chief Marshal Leigh- Mallory. Spaatz’s planners develope
