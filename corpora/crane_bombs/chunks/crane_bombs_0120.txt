Spaatz’s planners developed a counterproposal to attack the Ger- man oil industry, and the USSTAF position was also eventually favored by Bomber Harris. The Transportation Plan offered greater promise of “imme- diate effect on the success of OVERLORD  in its initial period,” and Eisenhower eventually adopted it. However, the plan also threatened considerable civil- ian casualties and evoked severe protest from USSTAF personnel.68 Spaatz resisted the Transportation Plan for many reasons. Because so much unused capacity existed in the rail system, damage to French and Belgian lines would really not restrict key troop movements. From his own experience in  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 101 --- ATTITUDES  OF LEADERS  AND  THE PUBLIC   8 3 Italy, Spaatz knew that the destruction of choke points such as tunnels and bridges was the best method to block movement and isolate the battlefield, and Anderson wrote letters to the British to recommend this course of action. USSTAF also believed that attacking oil targets promised the quickest way to cripple the German economy and end the war and made the most efficient use of strategic bombers. However, Spaatz, especially, complained most vocif- erously that the Transportation Plan would “jeopardize the good will of the French and Belgian people by the resultant loss of civilian lives in the attack of rail centers in populated areas and all for a very slight effect.” This senti- ment was shared by Churchill, who also worked hard to resist the plan and who succeeded in delaying its implementation for a while.69 Americans were completely left out of the planning and target selection for the Allied Expeditionary Air Force transportation attacks, and the USS- TAF director of plans, Brigadier General Charles Cabell, believed that this was all part of a scheme
