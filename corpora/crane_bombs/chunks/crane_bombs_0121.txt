He and Spaatz feared that bombing the French might even jeopardize their support, needed for the invasion. The two airmen sent letters to Eisenhower and cables to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for “fact-finders” to ensure that the US government would “not accept any responsibility for that loss of friendly civilian lives, except with the best of knowledge as to its extent, with full understanding of its implications, and without any illusions as to the gain to be expected from it.” When Spaatz’s pleas were ignored and Eisenhower overrode any objections, the USSTAF commander did what he could to limit civilian casualties. He emphasized “very strongly” to his subordinate commanders that there was “great need for care in all operations against French targets.” He directed that “the best lead bombardiers would be used, no indiscriminate bombing would be permitted, no H2X [radar] bombing permitted, and crews must be impressed with the need for air discipline in order to avoid needless killing of French personnel.”70 Through his efforts, civilian casualties were considerably reduced.

Similar inter-Allied disputes would arise over Balkan targets as well, which will be discussed later in the book. Civilians in occupied zones appreciated Allied efforts to free them from Germans who claimed they were defending those areas, but understandably the civilians did not like suffering from er
