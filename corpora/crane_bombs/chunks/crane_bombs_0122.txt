Civilians in occupied zones appreciated Allied efforts to free them from Germans who claimed they were defending those areas, but understandably the civilians did not like suffering from errant bombs and bombing.

They were among the first of between 8,000 and 10,000 to die from air attacks in the Netherlands, ironically most from Allied attacks on Nazi targets. A prayer often recited there could have been said in France, Belgium, Norway, and many other countries throughout Europe, by any civilians en- during Allied bombing and German oppression: “Lord, please liberate us from our protectors, and protect us from our liberators.”71 The attitudes of American leaders toward the bombing of urban areas were affected to varying degrees by concerns for ethics, efficiency, and public rela- tions. Perhaps the best summary of a collective AAF approach appears in a letter titled “Suggested Reply to Letter Questioning Humanitarian Aspects of Air Force,” composed in response to the letter from a concerned mother to the AAF commander (see appendix). It is impossible to determine who wrote the reply (it was probably composed by Lawrence Kuter on Arnold’s staff), but it had traveled from Arnold to Spaatz to Anderson and been reviewed by each man. The letter combined the themes of public relations, ethics, and ef- ficiency stressed by those leaders. It began by emphasizing that air warfare dif- fers from more traditional forms only in its massive potential for destruction. “Law cannot limit what physics makes possible. We can depend for modera- tion only upon reason and humane instincts when we exercise such a power.” It pointed out, however, that “the precision which is the keynote of America” was more efficient than terror bombing and at the
