J. F. C. Fuller2 In his influential work Men against Fire , S. L. A. Marshall wrote that “war is always an equation of men and machines. Efficiency comes of a proper balancing of the equation.” There are limits, however, “to the uses of the machine in war,” and ultimately its effectiveness depends on “the efficiency, intelligence, and courage of the relatively few men who must take the fi- nal risks of battle.”3 Many observers, though, would agree with Herman Melville that the technology of modern war has reduced the importance of soldierly qualities and produced an impersonal combat with no sense of humanity. One scholar argues that American airmen “were technicians and professionals who happened to be waging war” and that few saw themselves as warriors. They possessed an elite status and image, they were most con- cerned with mastering technique, and “their consuming goal” was complet- ing their quota of missions. Their existence on the ground and in the air “created a curious sense of unreality and alienation” that also contributed to their sense of detachment from both the enemy and the real effects of AAF bombs. Other writers, however, acknowledge the risks airmen accepted and  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 104 --- 86  CHAPTER  FIVE lived with: “The constant presence of death was bound to affect the way air officers felt about killing people of enemy nations.” Accordingly, airmen were fatalistic and hardened to losses, whether their own or the enemy’s.4 The AAF did get preferential treatment at induction centers, especially earlier in the war, ensuring that their recruits generally scored higher on the Army general-classification test and mechanical-aptitude test than those soldiers sent to other branches. These test results were used along with more evaluations to classify candidates further into categories such as ground crew or aircrew. Standards for officers’ positions such as pilots, bombardiers, and navigators were even more stringent. This process
