ons to classify candidates further into categories such as ground crew or aircrew. Standards for officers’ positions such as pilots, bombardiers, and navigators were even more stringent. This process did reinforce a sense of the superiority of the AAF over branches such as the infantry, though the actual quality of air recruits diminished as the war went on because of the large numbers of men required by the expanded AAF. The airmen’s perception of their elite status was also shaped by the greater proportion of officers and higher ratings of enlisted men who flew as well as by the recognition from the press and the general public of the courage and contributions of combat flyers.5 Yet the basic differences between infantrymen and airmen were environ- mental, not genetic. Most “grunts” of World War II would not have claimed to be warriors and were most concerned with completing a disagreeable job and going home; moreover, their attitudes about noncombatants were simi- lar to those of the airmen. American servicemen tended to be much harsher with civilians of Axis nationalities than with those citizens of occupied areas, though soldiers and airmen usually found it hard to stomach the sight of any dead civilian. To maintain their sanity, infantrymen often rationalized such casualties by blaming enemy artillery. Aircrews rarely had to view dead or wounded enemy civilians, but many fliers would have agreed with a former World War II bomber pilot, later a Tulane professor, who claimed, “I don’t believe that I could have faced seeing people killed close up.” Airmen who returned from the first great fire raid on Tokyo and who had observed from low level the carnage they caused “handed in their reports with hands that shook, with shock and horror still reflected in their eyes.”6 Despite such reac- tions, B-29 crews carried out more incendiary raids because the airmen were convinced that such attacks were the only way to destroy strategic objectives and end the war quickly.
