Despite such reac- tions, B-29 crews carried out more incendiary raids because the airmen were convinced that such attacks were the only way to destroy strategic objectives and end the war quickly. Although airmen did not face the constant exposure to danger experi- enced by frontline infantrymen, air combat was particularly intense, espe- cially in Europe. On missions an aircrew was more concerned with survival than with technique; they fought many enemies. Aerial combat has been  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 105 --- ATTITUDES  AND  PERCEPTIONS  OF AMERICAN  AIRMEN   8 7 called “the most frightening warfare of all” because in the “unnatural habi- tat” of the air, one is “marooned aloft in an aluminum capsule” and cannot run or hide. Enemy fighters closed in to attack at speeds of up to ten miles per minute to deliver cannon fire, rockets, or bomblets. On the most widely used B-17, the G model, almost everyone except the pilots also served as machine gunners. In addition to enemy fighters, antiaircraft fire (flak) was a deadly threat; on deep-penetration missions it could last up to four hours.7 During May and June 1944 almost 8,000 American aircraft were damaged and 300 more destroyed by flak alone. Crewmen who operated in a sitting position usually sat on one protective flak suit and draped another over their lap, “for the ultimate in physical and psychological protection.” Not surprisingly, flak was a greater source of aircrew anxiety than enemy fighters, which could be shot down or outmaneuvered.8 Weather and the elements also had to be endured. At bombing height, temperatures in B-17s and B-24s sometimes reached fifty degrees below zero, and even for airmen wearing heated cloth- ing, severe frostbite claimed many casualties. Oxygen masks could freeze up as well. One bombardier wrote to his parents about his concerns regarding Flak hits could be catastrophic. This unlucky B-17 had its nose shot off just after completing its bomb run on a target near Budap
