prayers con- sisted of a simple, constant repetition of the words, “Please God, I don’t want to die.”10 Because of the high casualty rate, American airmen in the European the- ater were critical of missions they believed were wasteful or that entailed risks beyond the perceived worth of the target. Indiscriminate attacks on cities with no clear objectives also violated the precision-bombing doctrine airmen had been taught. They especially criticized the long and dangerous raids on Berlin. Typical complaints in a June 1944 survey were that the city “is not a military target” and that it was bombed mainly for “headlines,” and “I don’t believe in spite bombing.” Almost three quarters of veteran flyers stated they “occasionally” or “quite often” had gone on missions “not worth the cost.”11 Nor did airmen like humanitarian gestures that raised their risks, such as General Doolittle’s April 1945 warning to workers at the Skoda works in Czechoslovakia of an impending raid in order to reduce civilian casualties. Although depleted defenses offered no resistance to the planes that dropped 500 tons of bombs on the factories, the disgruntled aircrews felt that their leaders had exercised “greater concern for the safety of civilian workers than their own.”12 Combat conditions were not as severe in the Pacific. Only four of the crewmen on B-29s were gunners, and they fired their weapons by remote [128.59.222.107]   Project MUSE (2024-10-07 01:45 GMT)  Columbia University Libraries  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 107 --- ATTITUDES  AND  PERCEPTIONS  OF AMERICAN  AIRMEN   8 9 control. The rest of the eleven-man crew could concentrate on their own par- ticular technical tasks. For the fire raids in 1945 LeMay even stripped out all the weapons and ammunition except that for the tail guns to allow a heavier bomb load. By that time the Japanese air force was no longer a threat, and antiaircraft fire over Japan never reached European intensities. Moreover, most of the long flight f
