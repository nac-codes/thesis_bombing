guns to allow a heavier bomb load. By that time the Japanese air force was no longer a threat, and antiaircraft fire over Japan never reached European intensities. Moreover, most of the long flight from bases in the Marianas to Japan, sometimes as long as eight hours one way, was over undefended waters. The B-29 also had a pressurized and heated interior lacking on other bombers, considerably increasing the crew’s comfort. On the other hand, the plane had been rushed into action before it was fully perfected, resulting in many technical problems, especially engine fires. The accident rate for the very heavy bombers was much higher than the AAF average. One pilot mused, “Sometimes we wondered whether the battle was with the Japanese or the B-29.” As another result of the rush to get the bomb- ers into combat, too few planes were available for training. Crews often did not get enough time flying the aircraft in the United States before deploying overseas and thus had to finish training on combat missions. An additional problem on the long flights to Japan was fatigue. A mission from initial briefing to final debriefing usually lasted twenty-four hours. Despite the lib- eral use of coffee and even amphetamines, some aircraft actually crashed be- cause exhausted crews fell asleep. With fewer distractions from enemies and harsh cold and with much longer missions, airmen in the Pacific could have considered themselves as technicians more than as warriors, focusing on the mechanical problems of flying their aircraft and delivering their bomb load.13 Though they witnessed the nightly conflagrations they caused, they might not have sensed what bombing cities really entailed; unlike airmen in England they could not go on pass and observe the results of the Blitz or of V-weapons firsthand or talk to air-raid victims.14 Unfortunately, few diaries or memoirs to verify these impressions were left behind by the crews who carried out the fire raids. Many reasons are possible for t
