N ATTITUDES  TOWARD BOMBING  CIVILIANS Just as varying factors of combat and technology in each theater could influ- ence airmen’s attitudes toward bombing civilians, so too could their individ- ual training and position. Diaries and memoirs from the European air war support the contention that crew members’ positions in the air were a pri- mary factor in determining individual attitudes toward what happened when bombs hit the ground. The officers on the bombers in particular—pilots, bombardiers, and navigators—underwent considerably different training. For example, when as a captain F. L. Anderson set up the curriculum for his bombardier school, he ensured that students received eleven hours of instruction on military law and the laws of war as well as classes on national policy and current events.17 Technical training focused on targeting and ac- curacy; students practiced bombing day and night in order to achieve the average miss distance of 230 feet necessary for graduation. With this training and their responsibilities in combat, bombardiers seem to have been the crew members most concerned about the effects of indiscriminate bombing. This preoccupation was undoubtedly reinforced by the detailed bombardier briefing form required to be filled out after each mission, which described every aspect of bomb delivery. One man was able to keep his sanity only by following his chaplain’s advice to “keep it impersonal” and not to focus on what happened on the ground. He rationalized that he was doing his best to hit military targets, helping to shorten the war and save lives in the long run. Yet he was still troubled throughout his tour by recurrent thoughts of an incident in which he had almost hit a city amphitheater with an errant  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 109 --- ATTITUDES  AND  PERCEPTIONS  OF AMERICAN  AIRMEN   9 1 bomb. Despite pleas from his nervous pilots, another lead bombardier took his wayward formation over most of Berlin through heavy flak to hit
