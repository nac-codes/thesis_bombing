and on accomplishing their missions, bore an especially heavy burden of responsibility. Researchers were surprised to find that, contrary to the image of unfeeling technicians  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 113 --- ATTITUDES  AND  PERCEPTIONS  OF AMERICAN  AIRMEN   9 5 indiscriminately dropping high explosives, heavy-bomber crews could not “tolerate well the guilt of killing” even though victims were “remote, almost abstract.” Although fighter pilots who strafed ground targets were seldom affected by concerns for the casualties they caused, studies discovered that “many a bombardier tosses in his bunk at night to think what his bombs may have done to the civilians miles below his plane.” The increased stress on bomber crews was alleviated somewhat by the “banding together” of combat crews and their reliance on each other, almost like the closeness of a family. The pilot was seen as a father figure and other crewmen as brothers, a feeling of camaraderie and teamwork that usually took between five and ten mis- sions to develop. This process was especially evident in the Eighth Air Force, where command policies encouraged the consistent use of standard crews, and by the summer of 1944 it had received enough personnel to reach its authorized strength of two crews per aircraft. The Fifteenth Air Force had different practices and often seemed to expect airmen to perform like inter- changeable parts as they were shifted between planes. The rationale for such actions may have been to lessen the effects on morale of death and wounds in close crews, but it was also a result of necessity because the Fifteenth not only had a higher casualty rate at that time but also had only one and a half crews assigned per plane. Thus it could not rotate complete teams and instead had to mix and match. The result was to increase the number of psy- choneurotic casualties from stress. Flyers in the Fifteenth retained the pecu- liar burdens and attitudes of their positions on the crew wit
