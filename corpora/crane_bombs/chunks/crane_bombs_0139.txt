s truly a “deterioration of combat crew morale.” His report in September, based on over a thousand interviews with crew mem- bers, and the findings of a group of carefully selected USSTAF officers sent to Sweden and Switzerland to interview interned airmen, convinced Arnold and Spaatz that morale problems were exaggerated. Wilson concluded, “Not only were the airmen confident of their airplanes, their methods, and them- selves, but they felt sure they were doing more to win the war than either the ground forces or the RAF.” The internment controversy soon ended as the Allied advance in France, and later the Soviet move to the eastern borders of Germany, provided better safe havens for damaged aircraft seeking to land. Losses also declined, and personnel rotation policies relaxed a bit. Perhaps the most important reason for better morale was that all the previous sacri- fice now appeared to be bearing fruit as Allied forces drove deep into Europe and prepared to destroy the Reich.27 Although more study of the attitudes of aircrews is warranted, my re- search indicates that navigators cared most about technique and finishing their mission quota, pilots about bringing their crews home safely, and bom- bardiers about accurate bombing. Like the American public, airmen in Eu- rope probably would have tolerated bombing cities indiscriminately if they had thought it was necessary, but they believed in the precision doctrine that so many had died to prove. Some units even instituted lecture programs to reinforce the commitment to AAF doctrine.28 If the leaders in Europe and in the Pacific had been more alike and if conditions in the two theaters had been similar, there would have been American fire raids on Germany. How- ever, such similarities did not exist, and those intentionally indiscriminate and widespread attacks on enemy civilians did not occur. One difference in attitude between the two theaters, however, disturbed American leaders: the feelings of AAF airmen about
