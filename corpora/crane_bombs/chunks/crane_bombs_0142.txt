With the assistance of Henry Luce, Lovett found some veteran Life editors to run the classified magazine, which was distributed by the assistant chief of Air Staff for intelligence to intelligence officers at AAF units around the world.32 Impact highlighted the effectiveness of precision-bombing doctrine; the text reflected Arnold’s views by emphasizing efficiency and public relations, not ethics. “Expensive planes and highly skilled personnel” had to be used to attack the enemy’s ability to wage war directly instead of being dissipated against area targets such as residential districts, “which are relatively unim- portant from a military standpoint.” An article touting the accuracy of Doo- little’s bombing of Rome displayed the maps designating religious centers to be avoided, boasting, “It was a test of what our bombers could miss as well as what they could hit because of the crocodile tears Axis propagandists would be sure to shed if we had hit any religious edifice.” Another article showed the military targets hit by the Doolittle raid on Tokyo to justify the “universal rage” over the execution of airmen captured on that mission. The avoid- ance of outright ethical statements might have been the result of the AAF’s desire not to appear critical of the RAF.
