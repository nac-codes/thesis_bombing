cs, the RAF night-bombing technique had become so accurate that it “no longer could correctly be called area bombing.”33 From the editorial themes emphasized in Impact , one can deduce which beliefs and practices AAF leaders in Washington had decided needed rein- forcement in the field. Americans have traditionally favored a strategy of an- nihilation and direct assault over indirect or partial approaches, and airmen seemed distrustful of any tactic that detracted from visually observed preci- sion attacks on important military targets. The accuracy of radar-directed attacks through overcast was often touted with magazine captions such as “Radar Performed Miracles.” The use of leaflets instead of bombs was ex- plained at great length in articles supporting “psychological bombing.” One article boasted that 77 percent of German prisoners captured in France “ei- ther carried leaflets in their pockets or had used them to surrender” (some  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 117 --- ATTITUDES  AND  PERCEPTIONS  OF AMERICAN  AIRMEN   9 9 units also used their lecture program to justify such tactics). Raids involving religious shrines were carefully explained as well. Besides the famous bomb- ing of Rome, a raid on Florence was used to illustrate “the effort that is made to avoid hitting structures of historical or cultural interest.” When the Med- iterranean Allied Air Forces “yielded to the military necessity of bombing German troops from the famous Abbey at Monte Cassino,” an article justi- fied the action by explaining in detail that exploding ammunition and flee- ing Germans demonstrated “that this was indeed a military installation.”34 Impact mounted an especially intensive campaign to explain and support the fire raids on Japan. Coverage of the first such attack, on Tokyo the night of 9 March, was preceded by eighteen pages of articles describing Japan’s economy and society, emphasizing that weather limited precision bombing and that concentrated industries and worke
