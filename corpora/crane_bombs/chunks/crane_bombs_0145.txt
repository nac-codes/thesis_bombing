Area bombing that did not concentrate on important targets and methods to bomb through overcast or at night when targets could not be clearly seen were suspect.

The view from Washington was partially correct. Airmen in general did believe in and support precision doctrine, and diversions from that accepted approach were suspect. General Doolittle confirmed that the morale of his personnel was adversely affected “by having to do a lot of things that they feel are not basically sound,” such as using strategic bombers to attack tactical targets or bombing through overcast.36 However, though many airmen had misgivings about bombing civilians and shrines, protecting their crews and winning the war were also important. When Doolittle said he would excuse any of his Catholic airmen from the mission to Rome who could not in good conscience bomb their Holy City, not one accepted his offer. Peer pressure, as well as confidence in the accuracy of precision bombing, was undoubtedly a factor, but the majority of those airmen concerned probably believed that their duty to their crews and the desire to gain the quickest possible victory outweighed any considerations of accidental damage to religious buildings.37 Most Americans were not as callous as the officer who wrote after Cassino, “If the enemy intends to use Italian cities as fortresses, we should feel no qualms in using our Air Force to level them thereby saving countless liv
