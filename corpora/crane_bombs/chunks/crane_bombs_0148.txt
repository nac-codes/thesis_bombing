shot down or his bombsight could malfunction. Other problems resulted from the inherent difficulty of handling large bombing formations, as following groups always bombed with less accuracy than leading groups. Varying ballistics of incendiary and high-explosive bombs also caused errors. But by 1945 diligence, experience, refined tactics, and innovative techniques eventually brought accuracy up to 44 percent of all bombs falling within 1,000 feet of the target and 73 percent within 2,000 feet.4 These results were even better than the goals set early in the war and probably represented as much accuracy as could be expected from well- executed formation-bombing techniques with unguided bombs under combat conditions. Normally the twelve to eighteen planes of a squadron dropped their bombs simultaneously, on the signal of the lead bombardier, a tactic with many advantages. The best bombardiers could aim for everyone; the mass bombing operation would be carried out more rapidly than indi- vidual drops, lessening exposure to flak, and the groups could retain a tight defensive formation. The bomb impacts would be as dispersed as the forma- tion, but commanders believed that a well-disciplined group could produce a tighter bomb pattern to smother any target more efficiently than several aircraft could while bombing on their own. Sometimes to ensure hitting a target, aircrews would use an intervalometer setting of 400 feet for a normal bomb load of twelve 500-pound bombs; thus bombs were released to impact 400 feet apart on the ground, producing a string of explosions 4,400 feet long for each plane. This technique offered more chances for hitting an obscured target or for inflicting greater damage to a large objective such as a marshal-  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 121 --- BOMBING  AIDS   1 0 3 ing yard, but it also could result in widely scattered misses. In truth, such techniques made the difference between so-called area bombing and preci- sion attacks less distin
