-- BOMBING  AIDS   1 0 3 ing yard, but it also could result in widely scattered misses. In truth, such techniques made the difference between so-called area bombing and preci- sion attacks less distinct—even more so when one considers that because of a scarcity of radar sets, especially in the Eighth Air Force, whole bomb groups of three or four squadrons usually dropped their bombs simultaneously with the lead bombardier in nonvisual H2X missions through heavy overcast. The large bombing footprint made by thirty-six to forty aircraft with a maximum intervalometer setting could cover close to a square mile. At the other ex- treme, some groups routinely achieved phenomenal results. Perhaps the best B-24s bombing Frankfurt through ﬂak and clouds in February 1944. The plane in the foreground has dropped its bombs with a moderate intervalometer setting; the tight bomb pattern in the center of the picture shows no spread at all.

Commanders really did not expect such tight bomb patterns, but the significant improvements in bombing accuracy achieved by the AAF in Europe through training and experience between 1943 and 1945 reinforced the faith that airmen had in precision-bombing capabilities.5 Yet General Arnold warned his commanders not to “complacently tell ourselves that our methods and efforts have begun to reach a peak of per- fection beyond which we cannot go.” Jealous of the impressive tonnage dropped on Germany by Bomber Command, he began very early to push his commanders in Europe to find ways to increase their number of missions. Considering the European weather, especially in fall and winter, an increase meant that methods had to be devised to bomb through ov
