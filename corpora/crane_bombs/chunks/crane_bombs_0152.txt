umably a public that seldom questioned such mili- tary pronouncements accepted this position, but the release also seemed to be an accurate representation of Eighth Air Force beliefs. Arnold, however, was not initially convinced of the effectiveness of such techniques. His staff advised him that radar bombing had not been tested thoroughly and that much training and experimentation were still needed. Ever mindful of the AAF image, Arnold particularly feared that the term “blind bombing” then in use would create the wrong impression, and he di- rected the Eighth Air Force to drop that phrase. Press censors in Europe had already begun stopping any news items implying deviations from precision bombing, ostensibly to keep the Germans from finding out that the Allies had new bombing equipment. When Brigadier General Curtis LeMay, who had led the pioneering raids, came to the United States on a public relations tour, he was prohibited from even mentioning overcast bombing.10 Eaker, then commanding the Eighth Air Force, was especially enthusi-  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 124 --- 106  CHAPTER  SIX astic about the nonvisual attacks. Never as committed to the idea of pre- cision-bombing doctrine as Spaatz, he saw great possibilities for H2X and worked hard to persuade Arnold of the rightness of his views. Coast ports were easy to recognize, and destroying them through overcast would lower enemy morale and force the Luftwaffe out to defend them. He broadly justi- fied his assaults on lower-priority targets: “The material destruction by these overcast attacks in workmen’s homes and in harbor facilities and allied war industries is considerable and is certainly alone worth the effort.” At this point in the development of radar bombing tactics and procedures, Eaker was willing to compromise precision targeting in order to keep pressure on the enemy, but through “experiment and test and trial,” he was confident that eventually small point targets would also be attacked suc
