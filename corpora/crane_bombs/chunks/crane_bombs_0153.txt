g to compromise precision targeting in order to keep pressure on the enemy, but through “experiment and test and trial,” he was confident that eventually small point targets would also be attacked successfully using radar techniques. In correspondence to both Arnold and Lovett, Eaker em- phasized the increased number of raids resulting from the ability to bomb nonvisually. This last argument in particular eventually swayed Arnold to wholehearted support of the continued development and use of such meth- ods.11 The first nonvisual missions on recognizable docks and shipyards in coastal cities such as Wilhelmshaven and Kiel encouraged the believers in radar bombing and converted the doubters, but the early successes turned out to be beginner’s luck. They “gave an unfounded hope of potential ac- curacy; and it may therefore have contributed to an unfortunate tendency to treat H2X as a rival of visual bombing rather than a supplement to it.” The successes may also have helped to make the Eighth Air Force compla- cent about the increased rate of operations that the new equipment made possible through the winter. However, by early 1944 it was evident that new training and equipment would be necessary to achieve acceptable accuracy.12 DEVELOPMENTS  CONTINUE In late December 1943 Spaatz returned to Britain from the Mediterranean. A disappointed Eaker, replaced by Doolittle, was reassigned from his be- loved Eighth Air Force to command all air forces in the Mediterranean, including the strategic bombers of the American Fifteenth Air Force. Along with policies concerning the bombing of civilians in occupied countries, Spaatz inherited Eaker’s and Arnold’s commitment and program to pursue nonvisual bombing. Initially Spaatz was enthusiastic about the performance of H2X Pathfinder aircraft in leading bombing missions, calling them “the  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 125 --- BOMBING  AIDS   1 0 7 most critical need of the Strategic Air Forces.” In January he successfully de
