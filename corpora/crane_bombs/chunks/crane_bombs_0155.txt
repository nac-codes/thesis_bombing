the radar pictures needed more detail, Spaatz asked for new radar equipment; Doolittle and Spaatz would continue such pleas until the end of the war. The new Eighth Air Force commander had little faith in radar bombing and waited for good weather instead of using nonvisual methods during his Big Week attacks in February that began the process of breaking the back of the Luftwaffe.14 After six months of nonvisual raids, problems were apparent with both personnel and equipment. Daily USSTAF intelligence summaries reveal that the results of most nonvisual raids remained unobserved; the same poor weather that limited accuracy and visibility also limited damage assessment. When results were readily available, they were sometimes embarrassing. On 1 April 1944 the Second Bombardment Division mistakenly bombed Schaff- hausen, Switzerland, in “particularly unfavorable” weather conditions. An investigation revealed that “the advent of GEE and H2X had caused a let- down in the standard of dead-reckoning navigation because of a miscon- ception that these aids to navigation constituted in themselves a means of navigation.” After completing his training course on these radar aids, nav- igator Earle Cheek wrote, “There is very little error with this equipment and it makes no difference to the navigator whether the ground is visible or not.” The Schaffhausen incident proved that judgment wrong. Classes were instituted throughout the Eighth Air Force to highlight each crew member’s specific tasks with radar and to prevent any more decline in visual bombing skills.15 Meanwhile, coverage of radar bombing in Impact emphasized that the new methods allowed the Eighth Bomber Command to drop a record ton- nage of bombs in November 1943, ordinarily a month of bad weather an d few missions, and showed pictures of damage to Wilhelmshaven. Articles pointed out to airmen that the cloud cover also improved the crew’s safety by providing protection from flak and fighters. The Official Guide to t
