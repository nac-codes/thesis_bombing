showed pictures of damage to Wilhelmshaven. Articles pointed out to airmen that the cloud cover also improved the crew’s safety by providing protection from flak and fighters. The Official Guide to the Army Air Forces , printed for the public in spring 1944, proclaimed, “Accurate high level bombing has been accomplished through more than 25,000 feet of overcast.”16 Apparently Eaker’s early enthusiasm and bomb-tonnage figures had convinced the Air Staff in Washington of the usefulness of bombing through overcast. Although Spaatz and Doolittle did not share this optimism about the strategic effectiveness of nonvisual methods, the coming of OVER- LORD  focused their attention on tactical applications for the new technology. Placed under the direction of General Eisenhower for the Normandy cam- paign, the airmen now had to consider ways to support the ground troops  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 127 --- BOMBING  AIDS   1 0 9 and the land campaign directly with heavy bombers in addition to the usual lighter tactical aircraft. The lessons learned in trying to perfect nonvisual bombing for strate- gic bombers paid dividends in tactical applications and in support of the invasion. Using H2X on D-day, 1,365 Eighth Air Force bombers dropped 2,798 tons of bombs nonvisually behind the beaches thirty minutes before the landing, with more raids during the day. Concerns for safety meant that many bombs fell up to three miles inland, but the air bombardment did help the assault on Utah Beach especially and caused no friendly casualties. Effects on the morale of German troops were significant.17 Ground forces were disappointed with the results of the bombing because a deliberate delay of several seconds in releasing bombs, ordered by Doolittle to prevent dam- age to assault craft, also meant that beach defenses were spared. Only later was it apparent that the heavy bombing had destroyed important minefields and rocket pits and that the damage caused behind the beaches had seve
