also meant that beach defenses were spared. Only later was it apparent that the heavy bombing had destroyed important minefields and rocket pits and that the damage caused behind the beaches had severely restricted the movement of reinforcements.18 With the troops ashore, radar bombing tactics, techniques, and proce- dures initially developed for the strategic air campaign soon became essential to support the ground drive across Europe. The Ninth Air Force, concerned with tactical missions, pioneered numerous advances in the use of radar to guide in air strikes, eventually using microwave early warning stations (MEWS) and SCR-584 control radars at forward director posts to lead planes to their targets. These techniques, combined with GEE and SHORAN, the latter a new directional guidance system from ground stations, enabled light and medium bombers to provide ground support even in winter weather. Be- cause of developments in radar and tactical improvements, Ninth Air Force planes operated in support of the advancing armies for 139 days between 1 October 1944 and 9 May 1945. Accuracy increased, and friendly casual- ties from bombs dropped short of targets were lessened. Tactical instrument bombing, based on many of the lessons of strategic attacks, allowed increased and sustained air support for the successful Allied ground campaign.19 The crews of the heavy bombers, however, did not like hitting tactical targets. The men were not suited to such a role, having had training in or- ganization, tactics, techniques, and procedures that differed from that of the light- or medium-bomber units. The heavy crews did not like bombing through overcast either. General Doolittle claimed that his airmen con- sidered those missions “not basically sound.” They wanted to get back to bombing Germany, visually observing their bombs destroying key military and industrial targets and thus shortening the war.20 By fall 1944 the heavy  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 128 --- 110  CHAPT
