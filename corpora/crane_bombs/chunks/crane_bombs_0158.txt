However, because of typical German fall and winter weather, nonvisual bombing remained an essential part of the USS- TAF air campaign. Spaatz relied heavily on a team of advisers on radar bombing methods sent out by Arnold to prepare for the coming air campaign. He asked for ad- vice on the use of new beacon systems arriving in October 1944 and received details on advances in nonvisual aids used by B-29s. He pushed Doolittle to use “originality and initiative” in order “to take advantage of the fleeting opportunities for bombing during the winter season.” With the German air force broken and Allied armies advancing, Spaatz wrote, “We cannot allow the advantages gained by the very successful operations during the past summer to slip out of our hands during the winter season.”21 Much of the impetus for increased radar bombing at this time came from General George C. Marshall, who visited the European theater in October 1944 to formulate plans to bring about the defeat of Germany by 1 January 1945. The chief of staff was not satisfied that the air effort was exerting full pressure in the right places, and he therefore suggested that USSTAF abandon its long-range ob- jectives in favor of an all-out effort to force an early surrender. As a result of this prodding, Doolittle, who had a strict policy prohibiting secondary or last-resort attacks on German towns or cities without identifiable military objectives, modified his directive to allow secondary overcast-bombing at- tacks on “towns and cities large enough to produce an identifiable return on the H2X scope” because they generally contained appropriate military targets. This move was a departure from USSTAF’s
