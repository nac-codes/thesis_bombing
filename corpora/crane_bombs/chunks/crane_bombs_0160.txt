without good pic- tures, the value of attacks could not be assessed. Major General F. L. Ander- son proposed using smaller formations or single aircraft, but there were too few trained crews and radar sets for that. Moreover, Doolittle complained that the bad-weather operations were producing more accidents and safety hazards. In December 1944 Spaatz again pleaded with Arnold for new and better radars, whatever the cost: “We are . . . willing to pay the high price of introduction of new and complicated apparatus because the return is pro- portionately high.”24 Perhaps the Eighth Air Force’s poor record was to some degree a self- fulfilling prophecy. Strategic Mediterranean Allied Air Forces bombers un- der Eaker, an enthusiastic supporter of nonvisual bombing from the begin- ning, performed more successfully during this same period under similar weather conditions. For the last three months of 1944 the percentages of Eighth Air Force bombs falling within 1,000 feet of the target were 38, 25, and 25; for the same months the Fifteenth Air Force in the Mediterranean achieved percentages of 40, 36, and 36. The latter continued with a better record throughout the war. The Eighth Air Force tried to equip two bomb- ers in every group as H2X Pathfinders to lead blind missions; the Fifteenth assigned four each to half its groups. Not only did this distribution allow more backups in case of mechanical failures, it also allowed Fifteenth groups to split up to bomb in smaller formations with tighter bombing footprints. These specially equipped groups carried out deep attacks on Germany and flew overcast missions, and the remaining groups bombed visually closer to Italian bases—specialization that seemed to pay off in greater accuracy. Eaker also sustained pressure on the enemy with lone-wolf raids by single bombers or small groups (as Anderson had proposed) and was especially successful with attacks on oil refineries. His surprise attacks, often at night and in bad weather, “h
