Probable for SHORAN missions approached a remarkable 600 feet. Bombing accuracy increased significantly from February to May 1945, resulting from “improvement in weather, defeat of the German Air Force, greater exploitation of fighter es- cort, bombing by smaller forces, and further improvement in technique and equipment.” USSTAF training improved so much that Brigadier General Lauris Norstad of the Twentieth Air Force requested that Spaatz send some radar lead crews to the Pacific to train and guide missions there.29 The contention that American nonvisual bombing was the equivalent of area bombing is not supported by the record of European air operations. During the early RAF night attacks on the Ruhr, less than one-tenth of Brit- ish bombs fell within five miles of the aiming point. By the end of the war, the average error for the most accurate RAF raids, using OBOE, was a little over 2,000 feet; Eaker’s airmen actually had a better record using only H2X. However, the key difference between the two air forces lay in their targets. RAF area attacks aimed at the center of residential districts; American H2X attacks, the most inaccurate nonvisual method, usually targeted docks or marshaling yards that operators could detect on radar scopes. There was a large difference between the RAF and the AAF both in intent and effort as to the number of civilians killed. Exceptions occurred, such as LeMay’s attack on Munster and raids on Berlin, which will be discussed later, but generally the Americans consciously avoided indiscriminate nonvisual assaults that airmen considered wasteful.30 Yet it is undeniable that USSTAF’s extensive use of radar bombing was a departure from the spirit of precision bombing and implied the acceptance of greater civilian casualties to achieve strategic objectives. As the war continued, such a trend would become more evident, and the description of actual missions in chapter 3 demonstrates how much USSTAF relied on nonvisual techniques in the firs
