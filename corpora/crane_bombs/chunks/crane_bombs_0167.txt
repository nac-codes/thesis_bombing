force behind the project was General Henry “Hap” Arnold. Along with his interest in new gadgets, he was in- trigued by the idea of pilotless flying bombs like the German V-1s. During World War I, Arnold had been closely involved with the testing of the Ket- tering Liberty Eagle, a rather primitive and flawed pilotless bomber.4 He retained his interest in such weapons, and according to his memoirs by De- cember 1941 an American radio-controlled model had been developed with a range of 200 miles. Attracted by their inexpensive price tags—he claimed that 500 of them could be purchased for the price of one B-17—Arnold believed that their range and accuracy were capable of rapid improvement. Nonethe- less, despite the additional appeal that these “Bugs” might save the lives of many aircrews, he abandoned the project when the war started because with Britain as a base, “we could not get at the real heart of our enemy—interior Germany itself.” His recollections are inaccurate, however. The Bug program actually lasted until 1943 but even then never showed much promise.5 Predictably, Arnold reacted enthusiastically to Spaatz’s request on 20 June 1944 to provide support for a special project to destroy hardened German V-1 launching sites that were “practically invulnerable to normal bombing attacks.” Spaatz mentioned special bombs or radio-controlled aircraft as pos- sibilities and asked that the AAF Proving Ground Command at Eglin Field, Florida, select and test some methods. At the same time, he reported that his units were initiating a program to equip war-weary B-17s with radio-control equipment “for the purpose of carrying a heavy explosive load and diving it into the target.”6 Spaatz was convinced that his heavy bombers were being wasted in attacks on the V-1 sites, code-named Operation CROSSBOW , and was searching for a more effective method to destroy them.7 The difficulties experienced by American airmen hunting missile launchers in Europe in 1944 foreshadowed simila
