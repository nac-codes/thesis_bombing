Response in Washington was swift, and the Navy also immediately offered men and equipment. Soon special units from the US Navy’s assault-drone station at Traverse City, Michigan, and the Army Air Corps Signal Divi- sion’s CASTOR  unit at Wright Field, Ohio, arrived at the secret staging field at Fersfield, England.8 The AAF chief of staff also informed his subordinate field commanders of Spaatz’s plan, which to Arnold suggested “an effective method of disposing of our great and growing numbers of war weary aircraft of all types in all theatres” because they could be expended against targets in  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 136 --- 118  CHAPTER  SEVEN the Far East as well as in Europe.
