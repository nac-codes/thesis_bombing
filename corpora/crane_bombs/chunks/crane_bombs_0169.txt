and one B-17 with ten tons of jellied gasoline. By then the Allies had already lost 2,900 men and 450 aircraft trying to knock out the rocket sites, and pressure for results was intense. As the more technically advanced Navy and CASTOR  units pre- pared their equipment, an Eighth Air Force team under Major Henry James Rand was already prepared to go. They flew the first missions with a rather primitive double-Azon (azimuth only) control system, with an operator on a mother ship flying the pilotless aircraft much like a radio-controlled model airplane. A two-man crew had to get the robots into the air, set their con- trols, and then bail out. The AAF flew six Azon aircraft missions against missile-launching sites in early August but managed only two ineffective at- tacks on targets, the nearest hitting about 500 feet away. One enterprising controller, finding that he could not dive his robot, flew it around an unsus- pecting German flak battery until a direct hit destroyed both the war-weary and the battery. One of the robots went out of control and disappeared but was found circling the English town of Ipswich; a frantic controller barely managed to dump it into the North Sea. The missions were especially hard on bail-out crews; one pilot was killed in a crash, and seven others were hurt in jumping. When Doolittle, who surveyed each mission in his per- sonal fighter, saw the results and the casualties of the double-Azon sorties, he stopped those missions and released Rand’s team.11 The Navy was also involved in APHRODITE , initially with one PB4Y robot (a Navy B-24) and two PV-1 Ventura control aircraft. The Navy assault-drone contingent, now dubbed Special Attack Unit 1, had been working on re- mote-controlled aircraft since 1937. They had a more sophisticated system, involving FM equipment, a block to better handle the robot’s controls, and a TV camera and monitor to enable the operator to aim the B-24 he was con- trolling more accurately. Their first mission, on
