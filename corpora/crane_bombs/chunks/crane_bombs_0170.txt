involving FM equipment, a block to better handle the robot’s controls, and a TV camera and monitor to enable the operator to aim the B-24 he was con- trolling more accurately.

These diagrams illustrate the workings of this rather crude but pioneering guided munition, which foreshadowed a similar mechanism to control modern laser-directed or inertially-guided bombs.

One of the pilots killed was Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy, and fears of his father’s reaction caused much consterna- tion at many military headquarters. The Navy then suspended its project in order to find another drone and perfect its equipment; among other things the faulty electrical detonators were replaced with manual arming. By the time the unit was ready to go again, the Germans had abandoned hardened launch sites in favor of mobile ramps, and the primary targets for the project now became submarine pens at Heligoland. The next mission went well un- til it was close to the objective, but the block operator misidentified his target and then lost his picture because of a flak hit.12 After the initial failures, Spaatz began to lose his enthusiasm for the use of war-weary aircraft, informing Eaker of his belief that RAF 12,000-pound bombs were more promising as a method to eliminate the missile sites. After the Germans switched to mobile launchers, Spaatz stopped the procurement of worn-out aircraft and released the naval unit. Apparently the only reason for keeping the project going was the knowledge that, in the words of one disgruntled officer, “this is the Old Man’s baby,” referring to General Ar- nold’s continuing interest.
