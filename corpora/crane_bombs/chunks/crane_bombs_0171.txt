the only reason for keeping the project going was the knowledge that, in the words of one disgruntled officer, “this is the Old Man’s baby,” referring to General Ar- nold’s continuing interest. General Doolittle of the Eighth Air Force had already collected eleven planes for the missions, and Spaatz directed him to use them up and file a report with any recommendations for their use. The AAF now had the use of its CASTOR  control equipment, similar to the Navy system, and results improved. Seven robots were flown against docks, sub pens, and an oil refinery, with the first two hitting very close to their targets, though bad weather spoiled the other sorties. One lost war-weary exploded in southern Sweden, but Swedish military authorities just sent a polite note with regrets that they could find no trace of any crewmen. Spaatz directed Doolittle to expend the last four aircraft “in attacks on industrial objectives in large German cities as far inland as practicable” to test their effectiveness on deep-penetration missions against softer targets more susceptible to the weapon’s blast effects. These aircraft were used against marshaling yards at Herford and the thermal-power station at Oldenburg in December and Jan- uary, but bad weather again negated their effectiveness. The main result of these deep missions was to cause fears that the program had been compro- mised when carburetor icing forced one robot down intact behind enemy lines. For three weeks fighters and bombers went back to find and destroy the plane, but not until after the war did Allied intelligence learn that a German infantry patrol had destroyed the robot, and themselves, battering in the plane’s door.13  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 139 --- BETTER  BOMBS   1 2 1 The final report on the APHRODITE  project was quite critical; the “Weary Willies” were a failure as a strategic weapon. They were ineffective against heavily defended targets and severely hindered by adverse weather, and the few allot
