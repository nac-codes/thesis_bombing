e was more danger to friendly troops along the worn-out aircraft’s flight path than to any enemy in the target area. In December General Eisenhower told Arnold that he would give WILLIE  ORPHAN  a limited try, but only after more training on safety checks to ensure that no accidents would occur over friendly territory.15 Meanwhile the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS) were developing their own concept of a plan to use the Weary Willies, a move highlighting the lack of communication between Washington and the field. While all this rather dismal testing was going on in Europe, Arnold had already announced to the JCS that the AAF was preparing a plan “for the launching of over 500 loaded war-weary US bombers against large industrial target areas in Ger- many.” This project involved a weapon similar to Arnold’s Bugs, far different from Spaatz’s original concept. The AAF commander did not even mention television or radio control, and when the British chiefs inquired about it, the  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 140 --- 122  CHAPTER  SEVEN Americans replied that any possible improvements in accuracy by using such controls “did not justify the additional time and personnel which would be required in further research or in the movement to the theater of specialized technicians and equipment.” The JCS envisioned the project not as preci- sion bombing but “as a means of requiring continued mobilization of enemy civilian defense services, interrupting industrial production and producing economic-industrial disruption.” Fearing retaliation with similar weapons from the Germans, in January the British announced that they could not agree to such a proposal, and all further testing in Europe was halted.16 There was some justification for British fears; the Germans had already used their own explosives-laden, war-weary Junkers 88 bombers in attacks on shipping. These robot bombs were guided strictly by automatic pilot, but captured Al- lied technology could have been used to improve
