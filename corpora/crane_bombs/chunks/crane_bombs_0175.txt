war-weary aircraft from being launched and that the AAF had to “be reasonably sure of hitting the target” to achieve any significant effect. Arnold’s plan to “turn them loose to land all over Germany” would therefore be impossible to support and a waste of effort.18 It is difficult to know the effect of Spaatz’s letter on Arnold, but after the  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 141 --- BETTER  BOMBS   1 2 3 British rejected the use of Weary Willies, Arnold changed his position some- what. In February Arnold instructed Eglin Field to send a letter to Spaatz explaining all the control techniques that had been developed for the robot aircraft, and at a JCS meeting the AAF tried to reopen the issue with the British.19 Major Generals Laurence Kuter and Frederick Anderson argued that there had been a “misunderstanding on the part of the British as to the employment of the weapon” and that the AAF never intended to launch the robots indiscriminately against Germany. Recent developments in guidance had now proven that “explosive-laden aircraft could be directed against mil- itary targets with considerable accuracy.” Their arguments must have been persuasive because they convinced Admiral William Leahy, a staunch oppo- nent of indiscriminate bombing who had considered the war-wearies “an inhuman and barbarous type of warfare with which the United States should not be associated,” that the missiles “could be usefully employed.”20 Eventually the JCS persuaded President Roosevelt to intervene with Churchill after Leahy wrote Roosevelt a memo describing the improvements and arguing that the “highly concentrated areas of the Japanese homeland” were especially vulnerable to the Weary Willies if enough combat experience could be gained in Europe. The president used the same logic in his letter, but by the time Churchill reluctantly agreed, Roosevelt was dead and the war in Europe was almost over. “Due to the tone of the message [from Churchill] and the circumstances on the Wester
