mes more effective than conventional munitions against such targets. Azon bombs were not widely used in World War II because the technology was limited in availability and reliability and because pilots did not like the requirement to fly straight and level after bomb release so that bombardiers could guide the Azons to the target, a particularly dangerous tactic against heavily defended objectives such as im- portant bridges. Even with limited use, the Azon bombs showed some prom- ise, especially in Burma. Further development was neglected after the war, however, and American airmen would not get effective guided bombs until late in the Vietnam War. These World War II weapons can be seen as the predecessors of the “smart bombs” perfected in Vietnam and that received such glowing publicity during DESERT  STORM .24 Arnold continued to pursue new weapons, and his fascination with the German V-1 culminated in a project to copy it. During a trip to England in June 1944 he calculated that “if the Germans were as efficient as we were” they would be able to launch as many as 1,440 cheap V-1s per hour, to “cause consternation, concern, and finally break the normal routine of life in Brit- ain and dislocate the war effort.”25 He also examined salvaged V-1 parts, and on 12 July 2,500 pounds of them were shipped from Great Britain to Wright Field. Within three weeks the AAF had completed its “Jet Bomb 2,” a “Chi- nese copy” of the V-1. An attempt to develop a purely American-designed flying bomb, the JB-1, was initiated at about the same time, but that project never made much progress.26 During the first few months of the project, Arnold was engaged in a battle with the Ordnance Corps and Army Service Forces over control of research and development of guided missiles. The ground services wanted a weapon  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 144 --- 126  CHAPTER  SEVEN with missile range and artillery accuracy; Arnold did not seek such precision. In January 1945 Arnold won his vi
