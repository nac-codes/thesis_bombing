In January 1945 Arnold won his victory when Marshall gave the AAF sole responsibility for developing the JB-2. That same month, Impact announced the existence of the new weapon.27 Spaatz and Eaker had been told about the weapon in October in a mes- sage admitting that plans for accurate guidance were “proceeding slowly” but asking that the European commanders cable their estimated monthly requirements for the new missile. Twice Spaatz “reiterated his lack of imme- diate interest” before Arnold sent an emissary to change his mind. The Air Staff in Washington thought that the JB-2 could be effective only “against a large urban area” like the Ruhr and only in great quantity, an opinion that assuredly contributed to Spaatz’s lack of enthusiasm. To appease Arnold, in December the USSTAF staff finally sent him an estimated need of 1,000 missiles per month but added that the project should have no special prior- ity. In other words, they really did not want the missiles.28 About the same time, probably at Arnold’s urging, Marshall sent Eisen- hower a cable on the JB-2. The chief of staff admitted that with current inaccuracy it was a “terror weapon when used on a small scale,” and for any decisive strategic effect 500 to 1,000 per day would have to be launched at a major target like the Ruhr. He was concerned that such usage would be prohibitive in cost, might cut into artillery ammunition production, and would tie up too much shipping. Marshall added, however, that possible radar control to improve accuracy would lower the launch rate and make the weapon useful on strategic and tactical targets. He asked Eisenhower for his opinion. In Marshall’s view, the main problems with using the JB-2 were “logistical not tactical”—and seemingly not moral either. Eisenhower proposed a plan to produce 100 JB-2s a day and
