s the JB-2 might be needed, but he did not really believe this would happen. His acquiescence in a later date was also a convenient way to appease Washington at no real cost. Ground commanders Omar Bradley, Courtney Hodges, and George Patton agreed with Spaatz that the weapon had great possibilities for siege warfare, but they were also “affected by an undercurrent of conviction that the war would be over before these weapons could be brought into operation.” Leaders at Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF), remained skeptical about the weapon, believing that it was unsuitable for both strategic precision use and tactical bombardment; however, that position was subject to review as more test data became available.32 As the European field commanders had foreseen, the JB-2 was never needed there. A month after V-E Day in 1945, the Air Staff cut back its order of weapons to 7,000 for development, training, and combat testing The American JB-2 buzz bomb, set for launching from a rail system. It closely resembled the German V-1 that inspired it. Though the JB-2 was built and tested, it was never deployed in the ﬁeld for a number of reasons.

At the same time, Eaker, now Arnold’s dep- uty commander, approached Kenney about putting the JB-2 into operation in the Pacific. If Kenney’s response to Weary Willies was any indicator, he would have been an avid supporter of the new project, but the war ended before the American buzz bomb could be used in combat.33 GAS AND INCENDIARY  BOMBS Giles’s prediction that guided missiles could revolutionize future warfare was correct. Today such weapons are especially deadly because of the nuclear, biological, or chemical warheads they can carry. These extreme methods of warfare were all available in World War II as well, the use of any of them signifying
