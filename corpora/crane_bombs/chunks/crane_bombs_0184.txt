l war in World War II, and its effects would come to fruition in the Pacific: the development and use of incendi- ary bombs for American strategic bombing. Ironically, the impetus for this new bomb can be traced to Colonel Crawford Kellogg, head of the Eighth Air Force chemical section, who was initially responsible for ensuring that his units had sufficient protection against German gas attacks. Once this mission was completed in summer 1942 he turned his attention to expand- ing the role of the Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) in the impending Amer- ican air campaign against the Axis. Considering the US position on the use of gas, he realized that the only hope for any CWS contribution would be through the use of incendiary bombs controlled and developed by the chem- ical branch.38 After ensuring that the CWS supply division at Edgewood Arsenal had enough incendiaries to supply his expected needs, Kellogg enlisted the help of the British to persuade American airmen in England to use these bombs. The British were enthusiastic and provided demonstrations in England and reports for distribution to the War Department in Washington. Initially Arnold and his staff were not convinced of the usefulness of incendiaries,  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 148 --- 130  CHAPTER  SEVEN agreeing with the views of most American airmen that demolition bombs were more effective for precision bombing, especially when resources were limited. Incendiaries worked well for mass-area raids of 1,000 aircraft but not for pinpoint bombardment with smaller numbers of planes.39 By April 1943 Arnold saw three uses for Eighth Air Force incendiary raids: to burn down precise industrial objectives that could not be damaged as effectively with an equivalent tonnage of high-explosive bombs, to start fires to act as night beacons for the RAF, and to burn down cities “when the occasion warrants.” He directed his staff to determine the effectiveness of incendiaries on industrial targets, and they prov
