memoirs, imagining that the winged warriors would have panicked and devastated To- kyo, he conceded that the M-69 incendiary gel bombs he helped develop did the job just as effectively.42 The fire raids on Japan would set the stage for the use of the atomic bomb, the culmination of World War II technological innovation. That weapon also promised to achieve the dream advocated by airmen from Douhet to the writers of AWPD/1: to end the war in one final deathblow from the air, thus realizing the potential of technology by preventing a costly stalemate on the ground.

If the morale of the people is already low because of sustained suffering and deprivation and because the people are losing faith in the ability of the armed forces to win a favorable decision, then heavy and sustained bombing of cities may crush that morale entirely. . . . It is believed that the entire bombing effort might be applied toward this purpose when it becomes apparent that the proper psychological conditions exist. —AWPD/11 The vestige of Douhet’s theory that remained in AWPD/1 lingered in the minds of ground and air commanders in Washington and in the European theater of operations. Army leaders hoped to save the lives of their men by bombing the Germans into capitulation, and the AAF hoped to bolster their postwar position by bringing the war to an end with victory through airpower. Once the Allies were firmly established on the Continent, these desires produced a number of plans for an aerial Todestoss that increased pres- sures to stray from the doctrine of precision attacks against German capacity and established precedents and a state of mind that would influence the air war against Japan. These plans were also fueled by leaders’ perceptions of the results of similar air attacks aimed at breaking morale
