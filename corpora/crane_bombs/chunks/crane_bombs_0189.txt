shed precedents and a state of mind that would influence the air war against Japan. These plans were also fueled by leaders’ perceptions of the results of similar air attacks aimed at breaking morale in the Mediterranean theater, especially against Italy, where Douhet’s theories about the effects of air bom- bardment on morale seemed particularly applicable to his own countrymen. The surrender of the Italian garrisons on the islands of Pantelleria and Lampedusa in June 1943 was due almost completely to intensive bombing of military installations there, and this victory caused some airmen to assert that no place and no force could hold up under a concentrated aerial bom-  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 152 --- 134  CHAPTER  EIGHT bardment. Future operations would show this claim to be false, but ground commanders such as George Patton continued to resort to intensive air at- tacks against stubborn enemy strongholds throughout the war.2 More significant were the effects and perceptions resulting from Doolit- tle’s July 1943 attack by the Northwest African Strategic Air Force on Rome. The marshaling yards there were the key bottleneck for Axis supplies flowing south, but many leaders feared the backlash from Catholics, artists, archi- tects, and other concerned parties that might result from attacking the Holy City. The British had been itching to attack the city since October 1940 but realized that the time for such an operation had to be carefully selected. Roo- sevelt and Stimson wanted Rome declared an open city, not to be bombed, but the Italians procrastinated. Churchill believed that the decision to mount a daylight attack should be left to Eisenhower, and Arnold supported that view, recommending that Ike “should not be influenced by religion or politics” in his decision. Eventually the JCS persuaded the president to allow the mission, and it was scheduled for 19 July 1943.3 Italy seemed particularly vulnerable to being bombed out of the war. The nation had
