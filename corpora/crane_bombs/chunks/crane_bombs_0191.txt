was little opposition. The long-term results of the attack were even more important. Factory workers fled or failed to report for work, producing a noticeable decline in war production and clear evidence that the civil pop- ulace was tired of war. The air strike influenced King Victor Emmanuel to desert Mussolini a week later, and the Fascist Grand Council deposed him. Seven weeks later, in early September, a new Italian government signed a peace treaty.
