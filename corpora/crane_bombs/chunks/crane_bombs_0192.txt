them practically terrified.” He proposed that the capital, Sofia, should be “bombed in its entirety” by day and by night, which would probably cause the collapse of the country. Within five days after successful completion of these attacks, Bucharest, Romania, would receive the same treatment.7 There is no evidence that Dalziel’s plan received any consideration from Spaatz, but similar operations were being developed at higher levels. The Joint Planning Staff of the British War Cabinet had studied the problem of forcing the German Balkan satellites out of the war and had also de- cided that Sofia was the best target. Support of the land campaign in Italy and the Combined Bomber Offensive would retain priority over attacks on Balkan capitals, but the Northwest African Air Forces could mount such raids during bad weather or lulls in other campaigns. Psychological warfare operations would be launched to “unnerve Bulgarian opinion,” along with a propaganda campaign to emphasize the military importance of Sofia because military and communications targets were “so small and so situated within the town that their attack would result in the destruction of the city proper.” Instructions to propose this plan to the CCS were transmitted to the Joint Staff Mission in Washington.8 As a result, the CCS directed Eisenhower to pursue the Balkan attacks when sufficient resources were available. Ronald Schaffer in particular crit- icizes the raids: “American flyers were expected to terrorize Balkan civilians without appearing to use terror tactics,” and he cites the acceptance of these attacks by leaders as an important step in the escalation to total war.9 Yet air- men always expected some psychological impact from any air raid, whether on ground troops or factory workers, and valid military reasons existed for bombing Balkan communication centers, especially as the Russians moved closer. If secondary effects on morale could be obtained from precision at- tacks, as in Rome, and if
