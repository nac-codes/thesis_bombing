litary reasons existed for bombing Balkan communication centers, especially as the Russians moved closer. If secondary effects on morale could be obtained from precision at- tacks, as in Rome, and if bombing Bulgarian marshaling yards could in- fluence that government to leave the war, then so much the better. Still, American airmen in Europe resisted such attacks when they were seemingly targeted primarily at morale and saw the Balkan city missions as a diversion  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 155 --- THE LURE  OF THE DEATHBLOW  IN EUROPE   1 3 7 from more important targets, such as the oil refineries at Ploesti. This AAF position was bound to produce friction with the British, who were deter- mined to exploit the political possibilities of bombing cities such as Sofia and Bucharest. Sir Charles Portal had the authority to set priorities for strategic air forces on behalf of the CCS, and he continued to emphasize the Balkan raids while the Americans tried to establish a stable chain of command for European air operations. In early 1944, the American air command structure in Europe was in some turmoil as Spaatz and Doolittle moved to England and Eaker settled in as commander of Mediterranean Allied Air Forces. In January An- derson told the USSTAF director of intelligence to prepare a policy directive covering the bombing of Balkan cities “similar to that used by forces oper- ating from the United Kingdom . . . applied to cities in the occupied coun- tries.” The next month Budapest, Sofia, Bucharest, and Vienna were listed as a secondary priority for “over-the-cloud” area bombing. However, few such raids were mounted because Spaatz and Anderson resisted the diversion of strategic bombers to “the intangible attempt to break civilian morale.”10 The British, however, continued to press for more Balkan attacks. The Air Ministry provided tempting intelligence reports describing Bulgarian offers of surrender and intimating that one or two more raids might knock them
