The Americans had been reluctant participants in such operations in the Balkans, but they could not resist the temptation to try to end the war against the Nazis. Although Omar Bradley and other ground commanders had hoped that air bombardment might defeat the Germans as early as winter 1943, AAF leaders did not really pursue a system- atic Todestoss until mid-1944, after the Allies were firmly established on the Continent and the enemy appeared close to collapse.16 In August 1941 President Roosevelt had proposed that the British could demoralize the Germans by bombing small towns across the nation. In De- cember his coordinator of information, William J.
