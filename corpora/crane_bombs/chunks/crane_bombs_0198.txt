He also saw the opportunity to overcome external censorship and impress people and officials throughout Germany with “the fact of Allied air mastery and its impact.” He cautioned his commanders, however, that official or civilian morale was “not worthy of being the primary objective” of these operations, which would mainly increase “chances for drawing extra dividends from our regular target systems.” The assignment of USSTAF to SHAEF’s control for the duration of OVERLORD  prevented these “bomber sweeps” from being carried out at that time, but Spaatz continued to refine his concept.20 With the successful invasion and the lodgment at Normandy in June 1944, air commanders in Washington and Europe began seriously to consider ways to achieve victory through airpower over Germany. For many leaders, the time seemed right for an aerial Todestoss. Three weeks after the landings, a captain at USSTAF headquarters, probably inspired by the deputy director of intelligence, Colonel Lowell Weicker, submitted a plan to the USSTAF director of intelligence to bre
