could end the war. He did argue, however, that if his program saved a few Allied lives, any price paid by the enemy should “not be a factor of sober and practical consideration.” When Colonel Charles Taylor, Wil- liamson’s deputy, saw Weicker’s plan and the attached arguments, he agreed with Hughes, adding that it went against his own perceptions of General  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 160 --- 142  CHAPTER  EIGHT Arnold’s desires as well. Williamson agreed, and Taylor penned “Never sent, Thank God!” on the proposal that was to be submitted to Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, SHAEF deputy supreme commander. One week later Taylor killed another psychological warfare plan that proposed to destroy “Nationally Famous Monuments of Industry” to sap morale and to attack the power and transportation infrastructure in 116 cities. His comments, reflecting his growing irritation with such plans, noted that the proposal “leaves the door open for civilian bombing and the needless destruction of industrial monuments.” If the “industrial monument” was “a major factor in keeping Germany in the war,” it would be destroyed anyway as part of the strategic-bombing campaign. He concluded testily that if the target was not that important, “then to hell with it. Let’s get on with the war.”23 Contrary to Taylor’s perceptions of the AAF commander, Arnold was in- deed considering Todestoss at this time. By mid-July he began to believe that a well-timed strike by ground or air units would destroy the “increasingly shaky structure” of German resistance. Although he and Kuter, now the assistant chief of Air Staff for plans, saw some promise of weakening German morale with air attacks concentrated on one or two cities, Spaatz and Anderson, USSTAF deputy commander for operations, envisioned widely dispersed raids similar to Spaatz’s earlier ideas for bomber sweeps.24 Meanwhile, the British Air Ministry circulated a memorandum entitled “Attack on German Civilian Morale” that proposed to
