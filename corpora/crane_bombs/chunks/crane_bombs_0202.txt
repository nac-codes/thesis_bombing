d widely dispersed raids similar to Spaatz’s earlier ideas for bomber sweeps.24 Meanwhile, the British Air Ministry circulated a memorandum entitled “Attack on German Civilian Morale” that proposed to break the morale of the army and the civil population primarily with an intensive bombardment of Berlin, concentrated on the administrative center of the city and con- tinued “without respite so long as operational factors permit.” Clearly they wanted to replicate the urban destruction and civilian dislocation of the July 1943 raids on Hamburg. Approximately 45,000 people had died there, the vast majority from the devastating RAF firestorm of the night of 27 July, the first such conflagration caused by bombing. Most of the dead had heeded the advice of local authorities to stay in basement shelters, where they were asphyxiated by carbon monoxide or crushed by collapsing buildings. How- ever, those who took to the streets sometimes died even more horribly, sucked into fires by high winds or caught in molten asphalt. The Eighth Air Force made two daylight raids on precision targets as part of the series of attacks on the city. They were responsible for less than 1 percent of civilian casualties but achieved poor bombing results because targets were obscured by smoke from fires induced by RAF incendiaries. Because of this experi- ence, the Americans learned that they could not follow Bomber Command  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 161 --- THE LURE  OF THE DEATHBLOW  IN EUROPE   1 4 3 in attacking a target, a lesson seemingly forgotten by the time of the Dresden raid in February 1945.25 The Americans were generally disappointed with their performance against Hamburg; bomber losses were heavy, and bombing accuracy was poor. Eaker was evidently impressed with the destruction of the RAF attacks, however. He rightly believed that the fear of another Hamburg “apparently has the Germans in a great dither,” and he wanted to exploit the situation with a similar attack on Berlin
