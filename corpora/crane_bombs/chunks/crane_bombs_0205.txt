to prepare a plan based on Spaatz’s concepts that would entail an “all-out, widespread attack, of perhaps six or seven days duration.” Arnold did not yet favor obliteration attacks, even on Berlin. No one in the AAF thought the time for Todestoss had arrived, but everyone agreed that contin- gency plans should be prepared.28 The time for executing these plans would soon arrive. As the war in Eu- rope dragged on through 1944 and into 1945, the temptation to end it with the aerial deathblow against morale envisioned in AWPD/1 became almost irresistible. For Arnold, that would demonstrate the decisiveness of airpower and virtually ensure his dream of an independent air force. For members of the JCS and other leaders in Washington becoming increasingly anxious about the will of the American people to sustain the war, a swift Todestoss against Germany was essential to facilitate the timely shifting of emphasis and resources to Japan. For ground commanders facing a seemingly revital- ized German army, any victory through airpower would save many lives, an argument that even the most devoted advocate of precision bombing had to consider. Arguments about the inefficiency of area bombing of cities could be waived for this special case, in which a set of unique circumstances, how- ever vaguely defined, promised decisive results from an attack on civilian morale. Some leaders who retained strong scruples against killing civilians, such as Spaatz, would try to develop and execute a plan capitalizing on the inherent psychological shock effects of air attacks, designed to terrorize with- out killing by collapsing enemy morale through a widespread assault on mili-  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 163 --- THE LURE  OF THE DEATHBLOW  IN EUROPE   1 4 5 tary or economic targets. Other leaders less committed to precision doctrine would go to almost any lengths to end the war and still be comforted by the belief that any expedient against civilians at this critical phase of the confl
