He was willing to partic- ipate in an attack on Berlin but would “select targets for attack of military importance.” Eisenhower’s mixed reply must have alarmed Spaatz: “While I have always insisted that US Strategic Forces be directed against precision targets, I am always prepared to take part in anything that gives real promise to ending the war quickly.” Ike told Spaatz not to change current opera- tional policies yet but to bring the paper to SHAEF for a discussion. When they conferred on 9 September the military situation was at a critical stage. The Germans were broken and fleeing across France, but the Allied pursuit had ground to a halt during the first five days of September. Transporta- tion was not adequate to keep the fast-moving columns supplied, and logis- tical shortages threatened the victory that seemed so close. This dilemma must have influenced Eisenhower to favor operations such as THUNDERCLAP , which promised to exploit the recent successes on the ground by breaking the apparently crumbling German morale from the air. Ike directed that the Eighth Air Force be prepared to bomb Berlin “at a moment’s notice.” Fol- lowing this order, Spaatz told Doolittle “that we would no longer plan to hit definite military objectives but be ready to drop bombs indiscriminately on the town.” USSTAF was now officially committed to THUNDERCLAP .6 The idea of a devastating attack on Berlin to shatter German morale was not new to American leaders.
