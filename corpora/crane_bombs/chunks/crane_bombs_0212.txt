y was fairly high, though aircraft did have to evade murderous flak that downed twenty-one heavy bombers. Nevertheless, the density of that part of the city led to reports of up to 25,000 civilian casualties, and because the raid coincided closely with the attacks on Dresden, it contributed to the ensuing controversy over whether the AAF was adopting terror tactics. In reality, however, the attack by 937 of Doolittle’s bombers killed less than 3,000, more a tribute to his restraint than evidence of indiscriminate slaughter.13  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 168 --- 150  CHAPTER  NINE OPERATION  CLARION Spurred by a sincere desire to end the war and by the realization of the need for an alternative to THUNDERCLAP , USSTAF leaders continued to work their own plan for Todestoss throughout late 1944 and early 1945. On 1 October 1944 Spaatz wrote to Lovett that he had “started the development of a plan for the full-out beating up of Germany with all the Air Forces at our dis- posal.” He believed it represented the only means to end the war that year since the weather would limit operations by November. In a similar message to Arnold, he explained that HURRICANE  would use bombers and fighters to attack “the most critical target system or targets inside Germany within the tactical capabilities of the forces involved” and was designed “to impress the German High Command with the might and destructive power of Allied Air Power.”14 At the same time, Anderson was attending a conference on HURRICANE at the British Air Ministry, along with Hughes and Colonel Alfred Max- well, USSTAF director of operations. The British expected the Americans to present a plan based on SHATTER ; instead they proposed a widespread attack on oil targets. USSTAF conceded that the best objectives for tactical forces would be rail targets but even those attacks would facilitate the oil campaign by forcing more use of motor transport. The British offered to let USSTAF bomb oil targets in the Ruhr a
