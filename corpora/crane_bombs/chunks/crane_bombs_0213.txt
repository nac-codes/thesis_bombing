tactical forces would be rail targets but even those attacks would facilitate the oil campaign by forcing more use of motor transport. The British offered to let USSTAF bomb oil targets in the Ruhr as part of their own operation. The meeting concluded with both parties committed to both concepts, HURRICANE  I, the British plan to obliterate the Ruhr, and HURRICANE  II, the American plan for widespread attacks on oil targets. Meanwhile Arnold had replied to Spaatz’s cable, which had been inspired by Anderson. Though USSTAF still willingly took direction from Eisenhower, it was now technically under the super- vision of Arnold as the agent for the Combined Chiefs of Staff, and his support would help in executing the American plan. Arnold endorsed it wholeheartedly, though he believed that “everything with military impor- tance,” no matter how small, should be attacked, because “all sections of Germany should have opportunity to be impressed by overwhelming superi- ority and destructive power of Allied Air Forces.” He rebuked the British for their plan: “I will not condone attacks on purely civilian objectives.”15 The plans Anderson brought back were circulated among the USSTAF staff. Maxwell criticized the British proposal for ignoring the “dividends of wide-spread fighter strafing” and for selecting targets for US air forces that could be knocked out at any time, not just during a special operation.16 Hughes’s Target Section was even more critical of HURRICANE  II, conclud-  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 169 --- DELIVERING  THE DEATHBLOW  TO GERMANY   1 5 1 ing that only oil objectives offered “ample targets suitably geographically lo- cated” and also “immense, quick, military returns”; rail transportation and morale were not suitable target systems for such an operation. Despite this recommendation, the section was told to prepare a plan to attack German transportation. Using SHATTER  as a guide, they looked at 100 cities with trans- portation targets to destr
