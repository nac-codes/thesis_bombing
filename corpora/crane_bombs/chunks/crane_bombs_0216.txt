He also was concerned with “how the enemy and our own people will react to our attacking these types of targets and the resultant heavy losses to the civilian populace.” Eaker echoed these concerns in a personal letter to Spaatz, adding that the attack would convince the Germans that the AAF  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 171 --- DELIVERING  THE DEATHBLOW  TO GERMANY   1 5 3 were “barbarians” because 95 percent of those people killed would be civil- ians.

He was also concerned that the plan risked heavy losses of low-flying aircraft “to attack objectives with results of such uncertain permanent value.” The Ninth Air Force offered some minor suggestions, though no air force said it could not accomplish the mission if so ordered. The British Air Ministry added to the cacophony of complaints, its greatest concern being that divert- ing resources to CLARION  might affect the fulfillment of the plan to destroy oil supplies!21 Before the execution of CLARION , Spaatz moved to alleviate his subordi- nates’ concerns.
