Poor visibility over the target, in part the result of the many fires started by the RAF, compounded the errors. US bombing was good the first day but very poor later, after targets were obscured by smoke.28 The lessons of Hamburg concerning the problems of hitting preci- sion targets after RAF fire raids seem to have been forgotten. The majority of the 25,000 to 35,000 people killed in Dresden died from inhaling hot gases or carbon monoxide in the tornado of the firestorm caused by RAF incendiaries, though inaccurate USSTAF bombing of marshaling yards in the city probably contributed to the casualties to some degree. British tactics were especially deadly because they mounted a follow-up attack with mostly high-explosive bombs just as the firestorm burned itself out and before citi- zens could flee from their cellars to surrounding suburbs. For years after the raid, German and Russian propaganda estimated deaths as high as 135,000 and contributed to the horror associated with the raid.29 The best studies dealing with the attack lay much of the blame on Chur- chill and the confusion over Russian desires for support. In preparing for the Yalta Conference in late January 1945, the British prime minister prodded his air commanders at Malta to come up with an operation to aid the Soviet ad- vance and impress them with the contributions and might of Anglo-American airpower. Harris and Portal came up with a list of four cities to attack that would cause great chaos in the movement of both military forces and ref- ugees, then persuaded Spaatz to go along. At the Yalta Conference on 4 February, General Antonov and Marshal Stalin asked for Allied air attacks on communications cent
