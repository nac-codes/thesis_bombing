to the same degree in Europe. American leaders feared that the public could not sustain its war fervor for a long conflict and became particularly apprehensive as V-E Day approached. Admiral Ernest King typified the attitude of the JCS when he told reporters privately that he was afraid “the American people will tire of it quickly, and that pressure at home will force a negotiated peace, before the Japs are really licked.”10 This pressure to do anything to end the war was exacerbated by the confused lines of authority in the theater itself. Ronald Spector has argued that the two-pronged advance across the Pacific led by Nimitz and MacArthur was not the “sensible compromise solution” many scholars claim but the result of interservice rivalries that caused much conflict over resources and strategy. The Japanese never did take full advan- tage of the opportunities this divided command offered, but the AAF did.11 When Curtis LeMay took command of the XXI Bomber Command of the Twentieth Air Force he generally did as he pleased. Like Spaatz, he dealt directly with Arnold for strategic priorities; unlike Spaatz, LeMay had no close relationship with any other theater commanders. Although competing British strategies forced the Americans in Europe to unite behind a common course of action, the British played a subordinate role to the United States in the Pacific. Because of the long range of the B-29s, the AAF could focus directly on striking at the fortress of Japan and avoid dealing with the incre- mental island-hopping Nimitz and MacArthur faced. It is interesting to speculate about the course events might have taken if LeMay had been controlled by MacArthur, who adhered to the most restric- tive bombing policy concerning civilians. The prime minister of Australia in- quired in 1943 about MacArthur’s policies covering the bombing of villages in enemy-occupied Australian territory, and the general assured him that  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 182 --- 164  CHAPTER
