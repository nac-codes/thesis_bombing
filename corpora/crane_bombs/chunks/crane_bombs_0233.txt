ld unquestionably hasten the conclusion of the operation.” MacArthur maintained that “the use of air on a part of a city occupied by a friendly and allied population is unthinkable.” He also respected the laws of war in raids on Japanese targets. When authorities on Rabaul complained that an air raid had destroyed a hospital there, MacArthur ordered a full investigation, which revealed that planes were attacking an antiaircraft position right next  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 184 --- 166  CHAPTER  TEN to the hospital. A detailed report with maps was furnished to the Japanese government through the Spanish embassy.13 MacArthur did not deal directly with the issue of bombing Japanese civil- ians during his operations, though a staff study done for him in 1944 con- cluded that they were too adaptable and inured to hardship to be affected by such tactics. In June 1945 one of his key staff aides called the fire raids on Japan “one of the most ruthless and barbaric killings of non-combatants in all history.” This judgment probably represented the ethical views of an old soldier like MacArthur, who, in his speech at the formal surrender, empha- sized the “spiritual recrudescence and improvement in human character” necessitated by the development of the atomic bomb. As will be discussed later, MacArthur’s air commander, George Kenney, who was also enthusias- tic about using war-weary bombers, did conduct three fire raids of his own in August against Kyushu, but it is doubtful his boss, absorbed by planning to invade Japan, was aware of them. Perhaps if Kenney had made a strong ar- gument about the necessity of such attacks to support the invasion, MacAr- thur would have approved them. During the Korean War, he had eventually allowed Far East Air Forces (FEAF) commander George Stratemeyer to fire- bomb North Korean cities in early November 1 950 after the airman asserted that was the only way to deter or limit possible Chinese intervention.14 MacArthur’s naval counter
