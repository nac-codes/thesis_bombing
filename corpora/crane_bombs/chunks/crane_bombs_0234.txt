eorge Stratemeyer to fire- bomb North Korean cities in early November 1 950 after the airman asserted that was the only way to deter or limit possible Chinese intervention.14 MacArthur’s naval counterpart, Admiral Chester Nimitz, commander of the Central Pacific theater, also demonstrated a more restrained view of the role of strategic bombers. He diverted considerable B-29 assets during April and May 1945 to conduct tactical missions against Japanese airfields and kamikazes threatening Okinawa. When naval and surface forces were in position to strike the enemy homeland in force, Nimitz ordered his units to “attack Japanese naval and air forces, shipping, shipyards and coastal ob- jectives,” including shelling iron works at Kamaishi and bombing military targets in Tokyo.15 If LeMay had been under MacArthur’s or Nimitz’s control, the feisty air commander would have been required to work very hard to justify his tactics. However, LeMay was not responsible to anyone except Arnold, and even that long link was tenuous, especially after the AAF chief had his fourth heart attack in January 1945. The XXI Bomber Command was head- quartered on Guam along with the Central Pacific theater staff, but except for squabbling over resources and coordinating support for the invasion of Okinawa, LeMay and Nimitz rarely communicated.16 The Army and the Navy each had a hero, a campaign, and a strategy to pursue the war against Japan; so did the AAF.

His background was considerably different from that of most AAF leaders, with his commission from Ohio State Reserve Officer Training Corps and his lack of any previous war or barnstorming experi- ence. He had little interest in theory or strategy and did not learn much from his c
