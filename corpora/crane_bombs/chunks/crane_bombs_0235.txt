commission from Ohio State Reserve Officer Training Corps and his lack of any previous war or barnstorming experi- ence. He had little interest in theory or strategy and did not learn much from his courses at the Air Corps Tactical School. He was suspicious of geniuses because they were “inclined to forget about the rest of the team” and preferred “a group of average individuals who were highly motivated.” In addition to his flying instruction, LeMay had received special training as a navigator, and he was always looking for a better way to do things. Like Arnold, he was willing to try new ideas. In Europe he had developed staggered formations to increase defensive firepower, designed the non- evasive-action bomb run to improve bombing accuracy, and initiated the training of selected lead crews to specialize on important targets. Known to his men as “Iron Ass,” he was tough but fair and insisted on going on missions to share the risks. He had great respect and admiration for his men and hated to lose them. He was an accomplished navigator and pilot who also knew all about bombardment.

He pioneered in the use of nonvisual bombing techniques and developed a great interest in the utility of incendiary bombs.

His subordinate commanders realized that “the RAF had been doing that sort of thing for a long time,” but his superiors and the press took little notice of the Munster raid because it was overshadowed by the epic and costly attacks on ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt that same week. Whether LeMay was trying to evade effective fighter and antiaircraft defenses that shot down 29 of his 119 bombers or just trying out a new bombing t
