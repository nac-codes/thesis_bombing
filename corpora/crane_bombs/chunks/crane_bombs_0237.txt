rtresses “to set the paper cities of Japan on fire,” though whether this was actually planned or just a remark to deter Japanese aggression is unclear. Articles in the press at that time conjectured about air operations against the home islands from the Philippines, Guam, the Aleutians, and Siberia.20 Once the war began, planners in Washington did not take long to focus on targets for incendiaries in Japan. By February 1942 Arnold’s staff had prepared target folders on Japanese objectives that included areas of Tokyo ranked in order of “vulnerability to incendiary attack.” The AAF chief main- tained on file a copy of a 1942 Harper’s article emphasizing that Japan’s main weakness was its concentration of industry in cities vulnerable to “the easiest and cheapest type of bombing—the broad-casting of many small incendiaries over a comparatively wide area.” The piece pointed out that ramshackle and combustible buildings sheltering small, dispersed industries would create conflagrations beyond the capacities of fire departments to control. It also conceded that the suffering in some areas that would result from incendiary attacks “is terrible to contemplate,” a point that future planners seemed to ignore but that aircrews often could not. With Arnold’s penchant for new ideas, it is not surprising that he continued to pursue this idea of Japan’s vulnerability.21 In early August 1943 Kuter called for the convening of a group made up of Seversky and “other avowed civil air power experts” to develop “a purely air plan or plans to defeat Japan without the limitations of practical realities as seen by conventional planners.”22 The problem was also being examined by the Committee of Operations Analysts, a group of military and civilian experts on industrial intelligence and target selection that produced special  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 187 --- TORCHING  JAPAN   1 6 9 studies for Arnold, and by planners involved in the B-29 Very Heavy Bomber program.
