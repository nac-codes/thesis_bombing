From these efforts, Arnold prepared “An Air Plan for the Defeat of Japan,” which he presented at the Quebec Conference later that month. He claimed in a wordy and convoluted passage purposely avoiding any clear reference to killing civilians that a heavy and sustained bombing of concen- trated urban industrial areas would produce “the absorption of man-hours in repair and relief, the dislocation of labor by casualty, the interruption of public services necessary to production, and above all the destruction of fac- tories engaged in war production.” Arnold’s statement, with its emphasis on destroying industrial capacity and its neglect of any consideration for non- combatants, foreshadowed the pattern that would be used to develop and evaluate the fire raids. In November, the Committee of Operation s Analysts produced its report, which recommended targeting merchant shipping, steel production, urban industrial areas vulnerable to incendiary attacks, aircraft plants, the antifriction bearing industry, and the electronics industry, with no designated priorities.23 During 1944 theory began to be put into practice. Arnold had the AAF board construct some “Little Tokios” at Eglin Field to estimate the effect of incendiaries and fire tactics on Japanese cities. These tests were similar to those carried out by the Chemical Warfare Service at Dugway on simulated German targets, and they demonstrated how potentially destructive fire raids could be. While these tests were being conducted, Arnold sent an outline of his views to the president, which emphasized that “1,700 tons of incendi- aries will cause uncontrollable fires in 20 major cities,” thus destroying nu- merous war industries.24 However, it is significant that he never made these opinions known to his field commanders and that the real
