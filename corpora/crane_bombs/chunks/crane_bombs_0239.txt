In December 1944 another innovative air commander, Major General Claire Chennault, persuaded General Albert Wedemeyer, commanding American forces in the China–Burma–India theater, to order an incendiary attack by B-29s on supplies in Hankow. XX Bomber Command had been operating out of bases in India and China since June 1944 as part of Oper- ation MATTERHORN . Its first leader, Kenneth Wolfe, who had organized and trained the first B-29 units, had been fired by Arnold after only a month of disappointing failures. LeMay, commander there since August, was reluctant to comply with Wedemeyer’s request, believing that it was not his mission to attack such a limited objective. The operation was a resounding success, however, and LeMay would not soon forget the results.25 The Hankow raid was also notable as one of the few successes of early B-29  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 188 --- 170  CHAPTER  TEN operations in the Pacific. Operation MATTERHORN , which had been inspired both by AAF desires to get the new B-29s into the war and a perceived need to shore up the faltering Chinese, had run into much resistance from joint planners, and their concerns proved prescient. The XX Bomber Command’s bases in India were too far from Japan to strike targets there, and its bases in China were vulnerable to ground offensives as well as difficult to supply with fuel, which had to be flown over the hump route across the Himala- yas. During the ten months it operated in the China–Burma–India theater, XX Bomber Command mounted only forty-nine missions. Combined plan- ners had always realized that the Mariana Islands would be a much better platform to launch bombing operations against the home islands as part of a still il
