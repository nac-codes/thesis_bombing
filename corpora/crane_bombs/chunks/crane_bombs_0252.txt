but “Japanese industry as a whole is vulnerable to attacks on the principal urban industrial areas.” LeMay received congrat- ulatory letters from Arnold, Norstad, and Giles. Among leaders there, only Stimson seemed troubled. Typically, he apparently learned the details of the raids later and then from press accounts, probably after LeMay gave a brief- ing on Guam about the fire raids on 30 May that produced stories claiming it was possible that “1,000,000, or maybe even twice that number of the Emperor’s subjects” had perished in the conflagrations. On 1 June Stimson told Arnold that Lovett had promised that only precision bombing would be used against Japan.

In a later meeting with President Truman, the secretary of war repeated Arnold’s arguments. Stimson was anxious because he did not want his country to “get the reputation of outdoing Hitler in atrocities.” Paradoxically, he also was afraid that the AAF would leave Japan “so thor- oughly bombed out” that no suitable target would remain to demonstrate the atomic bomb.41 PLANS  TO END THE WAR Stimson may have had misgivings about the moral implications of the fire raids, but he was even more concerned with the war weariness of the Amer- ican people.

The JCS was alarmed by reports of unrest, irritability, and ignorance about the continuation of the war, fears shared by President Truman. In Europe it had been fairly obvious w
