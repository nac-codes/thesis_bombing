of “LN Agents” to destroy crops. The judge advocate general concluded that the use of such chemicals was legal as long as they were not toxic to humans. He added, “The proposed target of destruction, enemy crop cultivations, is a legitimate one, inasmuch as a bel- ligerent is entitled to deprive the enemy of food and water, and to destroy his sources of supply.” The National Academy of Sciences and the US Biological Warfare Committee urged Stimson to approve the use of LN chemicals,49 and the JCS seriously considered the option. King pushed for a decision by 1 August so that shipping could be arranged in time to ensure the destruction of Japanese crops in June 1946.50 Considering what we now know about the famine conditions in Japan in the winter of 1945, the impact of such an assault on rice would have been truly catastrophic. In May 1945 Arnold received the suggestion for a similar plan to attack Japanese food supplies and to use medium bombers to destroy schools of  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 200 --- 182  CHAPTER  TEN fish. Norstad claimed that the AAF had been working on such a project already, but Eaker asked for further study. By August experiments in Terre Haute, Indiana, had demonstrated that an agent known as VKA was effec- tive in destroying cereal crops such as rice when raw crystals were dropped into paddies from the air.51 Arnold’s staff continued to search for better ways to achieve victory through airpower over Japan. One of the obvious sources for new ideas was the experience of the USSTAF in the European theater, and many officers were transferred to the Pacific. Anderson warned, “These officers should be selected both for their experience and their flexibility of thought, for those tactics which are sound in the European theater may not be the best for the Japanese theater.”52 Nonetheless, AAF headquarters expected to gain valuable lessons from the air campaign against Germany, especially from the work of the US Strategic Bombing Survey (U
