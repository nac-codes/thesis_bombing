best for the Japanese theater.”52 Nonetheless, AAF headquarters expected to gain valuable lessons from the air campaign against Germany, especially from the work of the US Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS). During June and July Norstad chaired meetings in Washington between the Joint Target Group and the USSBS staff, which had studied bombing results in Europe. Roosevelt’s directive, the inspiration for the creation of the survey, recommended that the focus include the “indirect” results of attacks on industries, especially the impact of refugees on transportation, food, medical attention, and morale. Norstad was interested in these aspects in relation to RAF area bombing. He was astonished, however, by reports that workers’ morale was affected very little by the attacks. In fact, impressed workers actually worked harder after air raids, “joined in as a common herd against a common enemy.” Absenteeism was a problem after major raids as people relocated their families, but otherwise the efficiency of German work- ers did not decrease materially. The USSBS gave Norstad a detailed study of Hamburg, tracing its recuperation from the firestorm, and Norstad pre- dicted the information would be helpful in plotting the war against Japan.53 In final reports to the secretary of war, both the USSBS and the Joint Tar- get Group agreed that a large gap existed between the most important target system, Japanese transportation, and any other objective. Second in priority for the USSBS was ammunition reserves, followed by precision industrial targets and chemical attacks on rice production. Attacks on urban industrial targets were last, and they were to be hit only if there was less than a one- third chance of hitting more precise objectives. The Joint Target Group was in general agreement except that they placed no emphasis on most precision targets or on the rice crop and more on incendiary attacks on cities. Both groups briefed Spaatz, the newly designated commander of the recen
