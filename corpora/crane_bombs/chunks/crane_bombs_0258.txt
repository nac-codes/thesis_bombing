Both groups briefed Spaatz, the newly designated commander of the recently cre- ated US Army Strategic Air Forces (USASTAF), which included the Eighth  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 201 --- TORCHING  JAPAN   1 8 3 and Twentieth Air Forces. He was being sent to the Pacific to take over the direction of most strategic air operations there. Eighth Air Force personnel were due to follow, where they would also be equipped with Superfortresses. Typical of the convoluted command structure in the theater, MacArthur and Kenney retained control over their own heavy bombers, mostly B-24s.

Ammunition dumps were stocked with incendiary clusters, and operations and training for the strategic-bomber crews were geared for low-level, night area attacks. Statistics covering the number of bombs dropped and the number of facto- ries destroyed were being used to demonstrate the power of the AAF, and data on civilian bombing casualties were ignored.

The Twen- tieth Air Force was fully committed to the firebombing of Japanese cities. So was General Arnold.
