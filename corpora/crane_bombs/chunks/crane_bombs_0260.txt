rse fate for the Japanese. Directed to continue bombing until arrangements for surrender were completed, Spaatz canceled one raid because of bad weather and tried to limit other attacks to military targets. When the press interpreted Spaatz’s cancellation as a cease-fire, Truman ordered him to halt the bombing to avoid a misperception that its resumption indicated a breakdown in negoti- ations. When the Japanese delayed, Truman ordered more strategic attacks, and Arnold demanded a peak effort to show the importance and power of the AAF. Despite Spaatz’s anxious queries, no cancellation was ordered, and more than 1,000 planes hit Japan on 14 August, some even after Japanese radio announced acceptance of the terms of surrender.56 Although AAF officers quibbled over the number of American lives saved by bombing, they agreed with Prince Konoye’s claim: “Fundamentally, the thing that brought about the determination to make peace was the pro- longed fire bombing by the B-29s.” The AAF was worried, however, that the Japanese “were conducting an intensive propaganda campaign concerning the bombing of their cities with the view to getting sympathy out of Amer- icans.”57 However, little sympathy was available, even though the B-29s had burned out 180 square miles of sixty-seven cities, killed over 300,000 people, and wounded another 400,000. The Twentieth Air Force reported remark- ably light operational losses of only 437 of the very heavy bombers, mostly from technical failures—a tribute to the effectiveness of American tactics as well as to the weakness of Japanese defenses. In contrast, over 3,000 B-17s and 1,000 B-24s had been lost by the Eighth Air Force in European combat.58 Hansell, who remains notably objective in his memoirs, makes a strong case that precision attacks on the Japanese electrical industry, using low- altitude attacks at night with new radars and tactics finally perfected by the 315th Wing, would have destroyed Japan’s ability to make war and brought i
