n the Japanese electrical industry, using low- altitude attacks at night with new radars and tactics finally perfected by the 315th Wing, would have destroyed Japan’s ability to make war and brought it to the peace table “at less cost with fewer undesirable side effects.” This alter- native strategy would have taken fewer sorties and saved many civilian lives, though it would have taken more time (and perhaps cost more American lives) because of the wait for the arrival of new equipment. Another possibil- ity might have been to expand the B-29 aerial-mining program, but that also probably would have required more time to produce decisive results. In four and a half months, LeMay’s 313th Wing sowed over 12,000 mines in ports  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 203 --- TORCHING  JAPAN   1 8 5 and waterways, sinking almost a million tons of Japanese shipping. Along with submarines and tactical air attacks, the strategic-mining campaign had almost completely halted Japanese seaborne traffic of raw materials and foodstuffs by mid-August 1945. One can only wonder what would have hap- pened if another leader, such as Spaatz, had commanded the B-29s, someone more committed to precision doctrine and perhaps more experienced and secure in his position. Would he have been more inclined to take the time and effort to explore alternatives before resorting to the extreme of the fire raids? Such a course would have been difficult, especially after Hansell’s ex- perience. And if Prince Konoye is to be believed, different tactics or a delay in resorting to the incendiary attacks might have had serious consequences in forcing a Japanese capitulation. The massive destruction, social dislocation, and psychological impact of the B-29 campaign against Japanese cities perhaps made it key in the series of shocks that produced a surrender. Each separate blow, including the Soviet entry into the war, affected a different group of decision makers and added to the Emperor’s burden. Remove any
