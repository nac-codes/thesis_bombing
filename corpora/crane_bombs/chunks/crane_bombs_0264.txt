From the perspective of those airmen dropping bombs on the Japanese, the decision to use an atomic weapon was much eas- ier than the choice to resort to the fire raids, but for Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, it was a difficult course of action to adopt. Devoted to morality and to keeping the war “within the bounds of humanity,” he viewed using such a terrible weapon to destroy a city as contrary to everything he stood for. Yet after confronting weary troops headed for the Pacific, and upon con- templating the costs of more war, he approved “the least abhorrent choice”  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 206 --- 188  CHAPTER  ELEVEN for the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to some extent because “it stopped the fire raids.”3 The violent precedent established by LeMay’s incendiary campaign helps explain the civilian authorities’ acceptance of the use of atomic warfare against Japanese cities. Although this new policy troubled Stimson, most of the other leaders in Washington strongly endorsed it, an attitude transmit- ted through Arnold to the rest of the AAF leadership. Even Spaatz made plans to use a third atomic bomb, proposing that it be dropped on Tokyo to exert “psychological effect on the government officials,” using that oblit- eration of capacity as a way to influence leaders’ will.4 Knowing that more nuclear weapons would be used if they were available, and never one to dis- obey direct orders, Spaatz probably hoped that this final raid on the enemy capital would end the war and conclude the deadly air campaign against Japanese cities. Despite the extravagant claims by airmen during the war, the true destruc- tive capacity of airpower was not clear to leaders until they visited conquered enemy cities. When LeMay landed in Yokohama to help arrange the final surrender, he was amazed at the “unpopulated wilderness” his bombers had created. He was proud of his
