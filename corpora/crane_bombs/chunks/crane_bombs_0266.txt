In the postwar period, American military doctrine as a whole began to shift its focus to quantifiable firepower at the expense of more subjective maneuver considerations and to Douhetian formulas on the amount of fire support needed to defeat an enemy. The characteristics of atomic warfare also influenced this trend.8 With the postwar focus on firepower formulas and the use of nuclear weapons, neither historians nor analysts systematically examined the ethical aspects of conventional bombing, or were really willing to examine its effi- ciency or effectiveness objectively. The Air Force concentrated primarily on precise data that could be applied to future target selecti
