primary wartime experiences commanding major units in Europe. A good indication of their attitudes was revealed by the findings of a board Arnold convened in late 1945 to determine the implications of the atomic bomb for the future air  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 209 --- STRATEGIC  AIRPOWER  IN LIMITED  WARS   1 9 1 force. The group, headed by Spaatz and including Vandenberg, concluded that because atomic bombs would be few and expensive, conventional pin- point bombing would still be necessary to strike most strategic targets. Spaatz biographer David Metz adds, “Notwithstanding the fire bombing of Tokyo and other Japanese cities, there was little indication in the report that area bombing had gained favor among its writers.”10 Spaatz maintained his devotion to precision-bombing doctrine and worked for a large air force to carry out both conventional and atomic mis- sions, but a few dissenters led by LeMay were pushing for a “small striking force capable of exploiting the atomic bomb.” As the new deputy chief of staff to the commander of the AAF, LeMay continued to demonstrate his penchant for innovative tactics and his commitment to obliteration bomb- ing; he was joined in his campaign by Eaker. With public acceptance of atomic bombs and the growing realization that an independent air force would be needed to employ nuclear weapons properly, Eaker apparently de- cided that “throwing the strategic bomber at the man in the street” was a good idea.11 Most American air leaders came out of the war believing that their doc- trine had been vindicated. Conventional bombing could be effective in de- feating enemy nations, and adequate accuracy could be achieved. The USSBS also looked to some extent at the psychological effects of aerial bombard- ment on enemy civilians. In Germany, “the power of a police state over its people” kept them working efficiently even when their will to fight declined. The effects of bombing on civilian morale in Japan were more important
