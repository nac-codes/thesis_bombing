. In Germany, “the power of a police state over its people” kept them working efficiently even when their will to fight declined. The effects of bombing on civilian morale in Japan were more important, although “the interrelation of military, economic, and morale factors” that produced the surrender was “complex.” The ethical implications of conven- tional air attack could not be measured and were not systematically studied; nor was there any motivation to do so. The AAF encountered none of the postwar criticism over city bombing that RAF Bomber Command experi- enced.12 The victorious American public and its warriors were just glad to have the war in the Pacific concluded. Their relief was heightened as post- war reports revealed the extent of strong Japanese defenses against invasion that would have caused many casualties.13 American decision makers, who had been deluged with glowing reports and carefully selected photographs of AAF bombing results (similar to the optimistic bomb-damage assessments and impressive bombsight videotapes offered at press briefings during DESERT STORM  and future US Air Force [USAF] aerial campaigns), believed that the AAF could now exert decisive airpower in any conflict, even without atomic weapons, and with pinpoint accuracy.14 A more effective analysis of non-  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 210 --- 192  CHAPTER  ELEVEN quantifiable factors probably would not have changed formal doctrine, but it would have made leaders more aware of the actual effectiveness and the political implications of conventional bombing in urban areas. Such an anal- ysis also might have suggested that different enemy economies and national characters or changing international relations could limit the effectiveness of future strategic air campaigns. DISAPPOINTING  RESULTS  IN KOREA A series of conflicts very different from World War II would soon present severe challenges for a new USAF that still pursued the ideals of a focused strategic bombing campaig
