NTING  RESULTS  IN KOREA A series of conflicts very different from World War II would soon present severe challenges for a new USAF that still pursued the ideals of a focused strategic bombing campaign aimed at eliminating enemy means. The new Strategic Air Command even considered its atomic missions as “precision attacks with an area weapon,” reflecting the same sentiments as Norstad’s message to Spaatz after Hiroshima.15 The dilemma of using strategic air- power in a limited war is that by definition in such confrontations a bel- ligerent is not willing or able to pursue the complete destruction of enemy capacity to resist and therefore must somehow reduce or break will, at least of the decision makers who must be coerced into some sort of agreement to terminate the conflict on terms favorable to those bombing. Civilian mo- rale can be targeted, but as always, affecting that is not enough by itself to create decisive results. In Germany most popular discontent just generated apathy, not Kuter’s “call to action” to truly influence leadership decisions. However, Spaatz might have been onto something with his expectations for the third atomic bomb. Although the USSBS was never going to concede the targeting of morale any significant role in producing surrender, an astute observer might have concluded differently. A basis of the British belief in the efficacy of Bomber Command’s city raids was a sense among policy makers arising from World War I that urban industrial workers were already under great stress in their normal lives and were therefore especially vulnerable to be incited to rebellion by bombing.16 This same mistrust of urban popula- tions had led the French to surrender to the Prussians in 1871 when Paris was subjected to prolonged artillery fire while under siege.17 Richard Frank concludes that a key factor in the Japanese decision to surrender, especially for civilian leaders, was the fear that the hardships inflicted on the popula- tion by the sea blocka
