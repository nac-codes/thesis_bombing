Political constraints restricted the area and nature of opera- tions, and the simple nature of the North Korean economy along with the inviolable sanctuary of Chinese bases made strategic bombing unproductive. American air units entered combat shortly after the June 1950 invasion, and air superiority over the North Koreans was achieved quickly.
