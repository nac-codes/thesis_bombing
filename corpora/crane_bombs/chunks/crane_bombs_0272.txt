This campaign had only a limited impact on a stalemated front and did not influence the ongoing peace talks. By October 1951, FEAF B-29s had been driven out of daytime skies by enemy jet fighters.19 As frustration with stalemate and enemy intransigence mounted, the FEAF mounted a couple campaigns to pressure communist negotiators into an armistice.
