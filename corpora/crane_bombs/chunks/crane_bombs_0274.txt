Operation STRIKE  was intended to exploit the impact of a new “Air Pressure” campaign designed to cause enough destruction to finally force the enemy to concede on key issues deadlocking the peace talks, most notably over POW repatria- tion. First North Korean hydroelectric facilities were attacked, a “dual use” system that had been off-limits before because electricity also went to China and many civilian users. The main impact of those attacks seemed to be in Britain, where there was outcry about escalating the war.
