In fact, there is an installation in Hanoi called “The Museum of Victory over the B-52” that asserts that the December 1972 downing of fifteen B-52s in a “Dienbienphu of the air” led to American withdrawal.30 However, another limited conflict involving an air campaign against a state, this time in Southwest Asia, would produce more USAF arguments for the decisiveness of airpower. SUCCESS  IN SOUTHWEST  ASIA For most of us, the arrival of DESERT  STORM  was heralded by televised Amer- ican air raids on another enemy capital. We remember the vivid images of Tomahawk cruise missiles and Stealth fighters over Baghdad and broken Iraqi troops in Kuwait. The systematic development of war-weary bombers, radar bombing, and Azon bombs had evolved into an impressive array of high-technology weapons, constantly displayed in briefings that emphasized the precision and the destructive might of American airpower. Conventional bombing of pinpoint objectives was the rule, with a repeatedly announced goal of avoiding harm to civilians. Theory, practice, and ethics seemed to merge in a clean and decisive air campaign to eject a tyrant at a minimum cost in friendly casualties. One of the designers of the air campaign was Colonel John Warden, who had further evolved precision doctrine with his conception of the enemy state as a system, with five “strategic rings” of tar- gets—leadership, organic essentials, infrastructure, population, and fielded forces. Even more than the creators of original precision-bombing doctrine, Warden emphasized that bombing did not need to destroy the whole struc- ture, just paralyze it, to eliminate the enemy capacity to resist and influence their leaders to change their policies.31  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 219 --- STRATEGIC  AIRPOWER  IN LIMITED  WARS   201 From the beginning, limited war aims and concerns about maintaining the fragile Allied coalition influenced the execution of the air offensive. This does not mean that extensiv
