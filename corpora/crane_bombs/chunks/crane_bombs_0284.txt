- fects of the air campaign were to break the morale of the second-rate troops in frontline defenses and to seriously damage Iraqi command, control, com- munications, and intelligence systems. The ground war was still necessary but was miraculously easy, helped in part because the land offensive pos- sessed combat power designed to defeat a much larger enemy force, which had been projected by faulty intelligence.34 However, military budget talks were in full swing, and the Air Force was quick to claim sole credit for victory over Iraq. The USAF spokesman, General Merrill McPeak, in words echoing statements made after the surrender of Pantelleria, announced, “My private conviction is that this is the first time in history that a field army has been defeated by air power.” USAF historians quickly began to garner evidence to support McPeak’s assertion. For example, in Storm over Iraq , Richard Hallion provided a detailed analysis of the air campaign that is noteworthy for its discussions of the impact of technology in the Persian Gulf War and how the versatility of modern airpower has blurred the traditional distinction between tactical and strategic roles. Among the lessons that Hallion draws from the conflict is that airpower demonstrated that it can now seize and hold ground without ground forces, and in future wars it will not only be “decisive” but also “the determinant of victory.”35 Such claims hardly vindicate theories of strategic bombing designed to de- feat an enemy nation by destroying its total war-making capacity or by break- ing its national will. Precision doctrine and technology did receive deserved praise for their contribution to DESERT  STORM , though some of McPeak’s dis- closures at the press conference also tarnished the image of the pinpoint ac- curacy of USAF weaponry displayed in so many videotapes at war briefings. Iraq absorbed half again as many so-called smart bombs in forty-three days as Vietnam did in eight years, but precision munitions
