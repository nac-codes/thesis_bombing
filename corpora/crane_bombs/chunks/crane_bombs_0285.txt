acy of USAF weaponry displayed in so many videotapes at war briefings. Iraq absorbed half again as many so-called smart bombs in forty-three days as Vietnam did in eight years, but precision munitions made up only 6,250 of 88,500 tons of bombs dropped on Iraq and occupied Kuwait. And although 90 percent of the smart weapons hit their targets, the accuracy rate for un- guided bombs was only 25 percent. McPeak admitted that over 62,000 tons  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 221 --- STRATEGIC  AIRPOWER  IN LIMITED  WARS   203 of bombs had missed their targets, reflecting a rather disappointing level of precision.36 The Air Force did conduct a thorough evaluation of the air campaign in the Gulf War Air Power Survey, headed by Eliot Cohen. Realizing the shortcomings of the USSBS, the survey team strove for objectivity—so much so that the USAF leadership was greatly disappointed that the findings were not more triumphal and restricted their distribution. The report highlighted limits on strategic bombing “encountered as far back as World War II” and admitted that too little of the air campaign, about 15 percent, was directed at the eight “strategic” target categories to achieve significant effects. Great suc- cess was achieved against electric power, for instance, but very little against the nuclear program. Problems hunting Scud missile launchers resembled those the Eighth Air Force had against Operation CROSSBOW  targets. The re- port did trumpet the operational successes at weakening Iraqi ground forces, but it also cautioned that airpower, like the military instrument itself, could not by itself achieve political “finality” in such a conflict, presciently noting that the defeated side “may regard the military outcome as a transitory evil to be redressed at a later time by political or other means.”37 Such figures and analyses should not detract from the impressive suc- cesses of the air campaign. Careful targeting ensured that few misses caused collateral damage in
