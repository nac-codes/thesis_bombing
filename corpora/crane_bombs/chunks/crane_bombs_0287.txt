rences in DESERT  STORM , rebels often gave up at the mere sound of aircraft approaching. In 1920 Britain needed 135,000 troops to maintain order in Iraq; by 1930 it had only four RAF squadrons and one armored-car company there.39 The British ground operations in Iraq in the 1920s were of course much different from the armored onslaught of Desert Storm, but the results of the associated air campaigns were similar.40 A poorly led third world force in open country was broken by a technologically superior air force. DESERT STORM  gave the USAF a unique opportunity to fight a fast-paced conventional war against a vulnerable enemy on a battlefield with few political restrictions, though it was a limited conflict aimed at dislodging an army rather than at subduing a whole nation. This optimum situation allowed American air- men to demonstrate the full range of their capabilities and the evolution of modern airpower. Traditional strategic bombing of objectives in cities by mass raids of B-52s was not a factor in the coalition victory (though they did pound Iraqi troop concentrations effectively); instead, attacks by individual aircraft using precision tactics and technology were highly effective against key targets in enemy urban areas. Pictures of broken bridges and destroyed factories in Baghdad and a widespread recognition of the sincere and gener- ally successful attempt to avoid civilian casualties in Iraqi cities demonstrated that American airmen had continued their adherence to precision-bombing doctrine and had made significant progress toward achieving the ideal capa- bilities first envisioned at the Air Corps Tactical School almost sixty years earlier. AIRPOWER  IN THE BALKANS , AND BACK  TO IRAQ The apparent rapid and decisive success of Operation DESERT  STORM  in 1991 launched a deluge of claims that warfare had changed. Debates raged about whether the new technologies displayed portended a full-blown revolution in military affairs. Airpower advocates trumpete
