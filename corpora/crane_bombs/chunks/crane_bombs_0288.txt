1991 launched a deluge of claims that warfare had changed. Debates raged about whether the new technologies displayed portended a full-blown revolution in military affairs. Airpower advocates trumpeted the results of the air cam- paign against Iraq and later operations in the Balkans to advocate expanding USAF missions.41 The bombing campaign to get the Serbs out of Kosovo inspired historian John Keegan to declare that conflict the first ever success- fully won by the air arm alone, and that perceived success helped reinforce the concept of “Shock and Awe” that gained many adherents before war was again launched on Iraq in 2003.42  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 223 --- STRATEGIC  AIRPOWER  IN LIMITED  WARS   205 The 1990s saw a number of new attachments to contemporary American airpower theory.

The Shock and Awe concept that appeared in 1996, mostly Warden with a bit of Douhet mixed in, foresaw a swift and powerful air campaign to achieve decisive fi- nality quickly by paralyzing and demoralizing enemies. It advocated a sort of Operation CLARION  on steroids, with carefully chosen target sets that did not target civilians directly but would significantly reduce both their capacity and will to resist.43 Air operations in the disintegrating Yugoslavia seemed to support these new expectations for airpower. Seventeen days of NATO air strikes during Operation DELIBERATE  FORCE  in September 1995 helped persuade the Serbs to accept a cease-fire in Bosnia and eventually to sign the General Frame- work Agreement for Peace in Dayton, Ohio, in November. Though groun d threats from Bosnian Muslims and Croats and a rampaging Croatian army were more significant in achieving that result, airpower advocates were aga
