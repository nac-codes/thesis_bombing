for Peace in Dayton, Ohio, in November. Though groun d threats from Bosnian Muslims and Croats and a rampaging Croatian army were more significant in achieving that result, airpower advocates were again quick to claim decisive independent effects.44 So when another Balkan crisis erupted and diplomacy failed to resolve it, this time over Kosovo in 1999, American and NATO political leaders were prepared to pin their hopes on an air campaign alone to resolve the situation without a ground invasion. When the bombing campaign commenced, Pentagon planners admitted they did not expect it to force President Slobodan Milosevic to sign a peace agreement. Instead, President Bill Clinton announced that military opera- tions had three primary goals: stop the ethnic cleansing as the Serbs expelled Kosovar Albanians, prevent even worse Serb depredations against civilians there, and “seriously damage” Serb military capacity to conduct such atroci- ties. In fact, the ensuing air campaign accomplished none of those objectives and even initially worsened the situation as Serb forces responded to the high-technology aerial assault with a low-technology ravaging of the region. The military forces in Kosovo proved adept at decoys and camouflage as well as hiding in towns and using human shields; postwar surveys revealed that very little damage had been done to them.
