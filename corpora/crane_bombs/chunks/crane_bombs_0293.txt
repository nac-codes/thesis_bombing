January 2000 was so devoid of hard facts that Pentagon officials jokingly labeled it “fiber-free.”49 As the new millennium opened, American airpower advocates were in ascendance. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld intended to create a re- formed Department of Defense relying more on technology than manpower, with a significantly reduced Army. The initial campaign in Afghanistan in  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 226 --- 208  CHAPTER  ELEVEN 2001 seemed to confirm the correctness of his vision, as US Special Forces calling in air strikes were key in enabling the indigenous Northern Alliance to defeat and displace the Taliban.

The initial Shock and Awe plan was modified by desires to limit noncombatant casualties and preserve infrastructure, as well as by General Tommy Franks’s decision to attack early. That meant that the major air offen- sive started twenty-eight hours after ground forces had begun their advance and had overrun many areas. As a result, only 39 percent of leadership or command-and-control targets initially scheduled for attack would be struck during the three-week air campaign. However, airpower had already done much with both kinetic and nonkinetic operations to prepare the battle space. Airmen enforcing prewar no-fly zones had already suppressed Iraqi air defenses and gathered a great deal of valuable intelligence. After the full air campaign began on the night of 21 March, the nonstop precision bombard- ment by ground- and carrier-based aircraft paved the way for allied ground forces so well that their entrance into Baghdad was a virtual fait accompli. Republican Guard units around the city lost over 1,000 of their 2,500 tanks before they were engaged by any ground elements.
