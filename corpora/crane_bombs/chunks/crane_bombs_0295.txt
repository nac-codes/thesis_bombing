the most appropriate one. Mark Clodfelter argues that the ideal vision of American airpower, surgically applied targeting to achieve political goals with a minimum of casualties and collateral damage, does not suit the basic violent nature of war, especially the nature of contemporary “wars amongst the people” involving so many nonstate actors and adaptive adversaries who are willing to use sophisticated information campaigns, “lawfare” with restrictive international norms, and hiding among populations to thwart dominant American air forces. For him, that vision is “an enticing idea waiting to be victimized by conflicting goals, uncooperative enemies, and the imposing momentum that every war generates.”52  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 228 --- 21012. LEGACIES It was an illusion of the historian to assume that the participants would help prepare history current with operations. It is likewise an illusion of warriors to assume they will do it after hostilities. —Bruce Hopper , USSTAF historian1 Strategic bombing in World War II left two conflicting and interacting leg- acies for American airpower. While for some that conflict set the USAF on the path to achieve true precision bombing, others see it as establishing a precedent for mass aerial destruction. Some observers of the First Persian Gulf War against Iraq disagreed with the prevailing view that coalition air forces were consciously and effectively avoiding indiscriminate bombing of civilians. Yasuo Kurata, a political commentator for Tokyo Shimbun , was highly critical of Americans and the USAF after the bombing of the air raid shelter in Amiriya that “slaughtered more than 400 people, including about 100 infants and young children.” Discounting official insistence that the underground bunker was a communications center, Kurata claimed that Americans are insensitive to civilian casualties because they have never been bombed themselves, a charge that brings to mind Vera Brittain’s writings during World War
