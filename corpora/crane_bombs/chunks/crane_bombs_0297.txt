should not completely dis- count Kurata’s perceptions. Fears of massive retaliatory American air raids on Baghdad may have deterred Saddam Hussein from using chemical or bi- ological weapons in the Gulf War. Treatises that argue the American way of war tends toward an overall technological onslaught against an enemy society often use American strategic bombing in World War II as a prime example. Similar criticisms appeared after Operation ALLIED  FORCE , which actually dropped leaflets over Serbia trumpeting how many 500-pound bombs could be delivered by each B-52 as part of the psychological warfare campaign synchronized with the bombing.3 In Yugoslavia it appears that the growing intensity of attacks on dual-use targets in Belgrade and other cities was sig- nificant in achieving NATO’s political goals. Accordingly, there is a good probability that Yugoslav civilian casualties exceeded their military ones. For instance, Michael Dobbs estimates that the Serbs suffered 1,600 civilian ca- sualties and only 1,000 military ones. Human Rights Watch completed a study that lowered estimates of Yugoslav civilian dead to 500 from ninety separate attacks but was still critical of NATO targeting practices. It con- cluded that half the casualties could have been avoided. This is particularly ironic considering the expectations for a bloodless war caricatured so well in Doonesbury  cartoons and reinforced by NATO briefings on targeting accu- racy.4 These high NATO expectations for extremely low casualties on both sides helped convince the more reluctant coalition members to support the air campaign and increased the negative impact on alliance cohesion of each scene of civilian dead and wounded. Yet those same images might have also increased Serb fears and weak- ened their resolve. Ironically, such incidents might have reduced the will to continue on both sides.
