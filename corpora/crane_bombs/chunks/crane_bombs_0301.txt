e is used for military purposes. The emphasis throughout focuses on the military or economic justification for targets and the protection of ci- vilians as much as possible. The issue of workers as belligerents is not directly addressed, however.6 The devotion of men such as Spaatz and Doolittle to the precision doc- trine during World War II established an important precedent for later American air operations. Arnold’s drive to develop new technology also had important implications. American prototypes for cruise missiles, precision munitions, and radar bombing aids that were so impressive for their pin- point accuracy during DESERT  STORM  and after were first tested in combat during World War II. Precision doctrine has influenced the development of technology to the extent that the motivation for recent cuts in American nu- clear weapons has come in part from the realization that conventional smart bombs can remove many targets more effectively, especially at the tactical and operational levels of war. On the other hand, the legacy of the fire raids can be seen in the accep- tance of urban targeting policies involving strategic nuclear weapons.7 Sanc- tions restricting the bombing of civilians eroded as World War II entered its complex final phases, and pressure increased for the Allies to achieve their stated aim of winning the war “as decisively and speedily as possible.”8 Once Hansell had left the Pacific, no real advocate of precision bombing remained there, and LeMay and his superiors saw the area incendiary attacks as the best method for ending the war quickly, saving American lives, demonstrat- ing a true victory through airpower, and securing a strong position to bargain for postwar status as an independent service. The fire raids and the exploita- tion of the accompanying terror marked the culmination of the American escalation to total war.
