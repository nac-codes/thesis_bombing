Once that course of destroying cities was adopted,  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 233 --- LEGACIES   2 1 5 with its complete disregard for any restraint against killing civilians, the use of the atomic bomb was logical. Most Americans and their leaders consid- ered the new weapon simply to be a more powerful version of conventional ordnance; recognized restrictions limiting chemical and biological warfare did not appear to apply to nuclear weapons in 1945. The Chicago Sun echoed popular sentiment: “There is no scale of values which makes a TNT explo- sion right and an uranium explosion wrong.” Once the fire raids became accepted policy, any form of warfare against Japan seemed permissible. If the invasion of Kyushu in November had been a bloodbath, poison gas a nd crop destroyers probably would also have been used to support the invasion of Japan’s main island in March 1946. As Marshall had noted, those weapons were not as terrible as the incendiary bombs being used to incinerate Japa- nese urban areas.9 Yet we should not make hasty moral judgments about the men who fire- bombed Tokyo or dropped the atomic bombs. Michael Howard reminds us that “the overwhelming majority of the people concerned, not simply the de- cision makers but the public that supported them, did not see this as a moral problem at all.” He has also observed that when statesmen and their generals deal with the ethical issues of a war threatening their people and nation, “the options open to them are likely to be far more limited than is generally real- ized.”10 Further, the problems of leaders are much more complex in an era of total war and nuclear weapons. The issues of law, technology, and airpower ethics that every AAF commander faced are part of the problem that Bill Moyers has called “the great unresolved dilemma of our age: Will we go on doing what our weapons make possible?”11 However, that is not th
