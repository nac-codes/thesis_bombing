Those are the factors of reason and humanity which we allow to curb the awful weapon at our disposal. Those are the factors which the brute mind of the beast cannot conceive. With the understanding cooperation of you and thousands of others like you, we will prove to the beast that humanity pays and that Air Power is the most powerful urge for peace. —From “Humanitarian Aspects of Airpower” binder, Papers of Frederick L.
