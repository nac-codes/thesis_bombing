Description for 44th Bomb Group missions comes from the monthly reports in Boxes 14 and 15 of the 44th Bomb Group Collection, USAMHI, US Army Heritage and Education Center, Carlisle, PA. An overall listing of all Eighth and Fifteenth air force missions is available on a CD with Davis, Bombing the European Axis Powers.  The term “10/10ths” means 100 percent cloud cover. 34. Information on the operations of the 455th Bomb Group comes from Asch, Graff, and Ramey, The Story of the Four Hundred and Fifty-fifth Bombardment Group (H) WWII , and Mahoney, Fifteenth Air Force. 35. The remarkable amount of tonnage dropped on targets around Vienna is evident from graphical depictions of the THOR database at the Air Force Research Institute at the Air University, Maxwell AFB, AL. 36.
