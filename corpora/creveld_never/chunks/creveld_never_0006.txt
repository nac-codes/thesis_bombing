The French in particular did possess some modern aircraft, such as the Dewoi- tine D.520 ﬁghter, which were a match for the Messerschmitts.9However, owing to the above-mentioned considerations, few of them were used where and when it mattered.96 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 96 Van, Creveld, Martin.
