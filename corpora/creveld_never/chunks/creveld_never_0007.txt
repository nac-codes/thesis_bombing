However, Dutch ground forces near The Hague prevented the Germans from taking over the airﬁelds; as they did so, their colleagues in Rotterdam successfully fought off the paratroopers.10As Hitler himself recognized in his Directive No. 11 of May 13, Dutch resistance to the Wehrmacht’s ground forces try- ing to breach the Grebbe Line was skillful and determined.11It was only after the Germans bombed Rotterdam, killed 980 people, and destroyed a large part of the city—by accident, they later claimed—that the Dutch gave up.12 Further south, in Belgium and northeastern France, the Luftwaffe also focused on airﬁelds and anti-aircraf t defenses.

Coming like a bolt from the blue, the operation succeeded in opening the road to the ground forces. Subsequent attempts by Allied air- craft, carried out at great cost, to destroy the bridges over the canal failed. Further south stil
