the operation succeeded in opening the road to the ground forces. Subsequent attempts by Allied air- craft, carried out at great cost, to destroy the bridges over the canal failed. Further south still, the Luftwaffe covered the main German Stoss , or thrust, which proceeded by way of the Ardennes forest. The roads in the area were narrow and winding, barely able to carry the huge German forces committed—from the foremost spearheads to the rear echelon, they stretched over 60 miles and more. The outcome was monumental traffic jams, which the Allied air forces, partly because the Luftwaffe operated overhead and partly because they were holding back, failed to exploit. Once the German spearheads reached the River Meuse with its steep banks and strong fortiﬁcations they called on the dive-bombers to help them cross it. Some 300 aircraft participated in the operation, ﬂying in relays; as in Poland, post-action inquiries revealed that the physical destruction the Stukas wrought was not as extensive as thought at ﬁrst. As in Poland, their psychological impact on the French troops on the receiving end, French now, was very great.13 Once they had broken into the open plains of northern France, the tanks, still covered and supported from above, rolled westward very quickly. Twice, on May 19 and 22, did French forces try to mount a counterattack against the long and vulnerable German ﬂanks.14Twice, their efforts were detected and defeated by Luftwaffe aircraft ﬂying in the inter- diction mode and not in close cooperation with the ground forces. There was a lesson here, which the future w as to conﬁrm time and again. Assum- ing reasonable freedom of action in the air, the best way in which an air force can assist in a war against a “trinitarian” army, by which I mean one that is state-owned, bureaucratically organized, uniformed, and clearly sep- arate from both government and population, is almost certainly neither CAS nor strategic bombing, but interdiction.15On the other ha
