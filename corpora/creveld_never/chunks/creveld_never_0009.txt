Much of this is attributable to the fact that the 850 aircraft, mostly ﬁghters, the British had held back from the battle of France were now avail- able to ﬁght the Germans over the English Channel. The RAF itself had changed greatly. We have left the service in 1937–38 when, partly because of Trenchard’s legacy and partly because the governments of the day hoped to deter Germany from going to war, it was still strongly committed to strategic bombing operations directed against enemy urban centers. At that point, a deus ex machina appeared. Having started in 1935, experiments with radar were already well under way. Almost from the beginning they were successful. By permitting incoming bombers to be detected in time for ﬁghters to scramble and meet them, they promised to change the entire nature of war in the air as it had been understood from the time of Douhet on.16 Thereupon the Air Ministry, through its control over the purse strings and the factories, forced the RAF into a near-complete change of direc- tion.17Fighter Command, long the RAF’s neglected stepchild, suddenly re- ceived priority over everything else.
