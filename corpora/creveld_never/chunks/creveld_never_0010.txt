strings and the factories, forced the RAF into a near-complete change of direc- tion.17Fighter Command, long the RAF’s neglected stepchild, suddenly re- ceived priority over everything else. Hurricanes and Spitﬁres, both of them among the most advanced ﬁghters of the age, started rolling off the assem- bly lines in ever growing numbers. Spitﬁres in particular, having a very simple structure, were easy to build. This was one reason why, as early as 1940, the British were able to manufacture more aircraft than Germany, with its considerably larger industrial ba se, did. British production of ﬁght- ers exceeded that of Germany by better than two to one.18Meanwhile, a chain of radar stations was speedily er ected along England’s east and south coasts. A command-and-control system, based on the one used to defend London in 1915–18, linked them to headquarters.

The objective, in Hitler’s own words, was to “overpower the English Air Forc e...  i n  t h e shortest possible time” so as “to create the necessary conditions for the ﬁnal conquest of England. ” As in Poland, Norway, the Low Countries, and France, the ﬁrst objectives were “ﬂying units, their ground installations, and their supply organization. ”19Easier said than done; as is often the case, the defender enjoyed some important advantages. The RAF could keep many of its ﬁghter squadrons in north and west England and Wales, where they were out of range of most of
