T o the “hys- terical applause” of an audience consisting mainly of “raving maidens,” he promised thousandfold retaliation.21 These events may also be interpreted in a different way. By early Sep- tember, Hitler and Goering were confused as to the state of the RAF. On one hand they greatly underestimated its strength and believed it had be- come a spent force. On the other, the British ﬁghters kept coming.22Mean- while autumn and its storms were fast approaching, which meant that a seaborne invasion would soon no longer be practicable. They therefore switched to bombing urban targets, a decision for which Churchill had given them the perfect excuse. The Blitz, as it was called, lasted until May 10, 1941. It killed 43,000 civilians, half of them in London, and destroyed or damaged a million houses in London alone. Yet in truth the Germans, having built up an operational air force consisting mainly of light and medium bombers, did not really have the heavier, four-engine machines they needed for the job. In the end, the impact of the Blitz on Britain’s econ- omy was limited. Only 1.7 percent of the entire stock of machine tools was destroyed. Production of critical items such as electricity, aluminum, iron ore, aircraft, artillery barrels, and bombs was higher in 1940 than in 1939 and was to go higher still in 1941.23 Above all, the will to resist was not broken.
