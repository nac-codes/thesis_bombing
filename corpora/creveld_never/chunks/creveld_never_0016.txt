They used their aircraft as ﬂying artillery, bombing and straﬁng ﬁrst the Metaxas Line and then the Greek- and British-occupied positions that blocked or attempted to block the valleys further south. Distances in this theater of war were rather large—from the Bulgarian-Greek frontier to the southern tip of the Peloponnesus it is over 300 miles. As on previous oc- casions, the Germans’ most impressive quality was their amazing ability to seize enemy airﬁelds and move their logistic organization forward so as to use them almost immediately. For example, when the chief of the Army General Staff, General Franz Halder, ﬂew to Larissa, in Thessaly, on April 22, he found the airﬁeld there in full operation.30 It was precisely this ability that permitted the most spectacular German air campaign of all, the capture of Crete, to begin on May 20, barely three weeks after operations in Greece had ended.31First, several waves of para- chutists were dropped at different spots over the island in order to capture its principal airﬁelds.

In the process many of them were wrecked either by accident or by enemy ﬁre. Once the Germ
