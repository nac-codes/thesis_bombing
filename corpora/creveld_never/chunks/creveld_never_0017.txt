to come down on the beach because the airﬁelds on which they were supposed to land had not yet been secured. In the process many of them were wrecked either by accident or by enemy ﬁre. Once the German troops had reached the ground they fought like devils. Nevertheless, since they had hardly any heavy weapons and no mechanized tran sport except some motorcycles, they found themselves at a grave disadvant age and the number of casualties kept growing. If the undertaking nevertheless ended in victory this was due largely to the fact that the Luftwaffe, in a spectacular display of anti-ship- ping operations on May 22, was able to prevent British reinforcements from reaching the island. This in turn enabled German mountain troops, em- barked on Italian barges, to land on it, and the rest is history. Once the campaign was over, Hitler told the Reichstag that, “to the Ger- man soldier, nothing is impossible. ” Behind the scenes, things were very different. Thirty-two years earlier that extraordinarily prescient writer, H. G. Wells, had correctly pointed out that airpower, while capable of inﬂicting “immens e...  d e s t r u c t ion,” was unable to “occupy or police or guard” assets on land.32Hitler evidently agreed with him; so heavy were casualties among the paratroopers that he told Student that their day was over. From then until the end of the war, they were only used as crack infantry. Still, much of the Mediterranean coast and islands, including Libya, Sicily, the Pelo- ponnesus, and of course Crete itself, was now in Axis hands. This enabled Luftwaffe units stationed in those areas to all but close the sea to British shipping. While the Regia Aeronautica was still present, it hardly counted. Until the Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 ﬁnally turned the tide, Ger- man fortunes in the Mediterranean theater waxed and waned almost ex- actly in proportion to the strength of Luftwaffe units Hitler thought he could spare for that theater of war.
