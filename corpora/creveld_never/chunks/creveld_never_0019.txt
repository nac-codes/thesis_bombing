he Luftwaffe helped. Compared to the momentous events then going on in the Soviet Union, the Mediterranean was a sideshow. The number of divisions Hitler com- mitted in order to defeat Stalin exceeded those under Rommel’s command by about 36 to one. Serious preparations for the campaign, the largest of all time, got under way in December 1940. As so often in the past, the task of the Luftwaffe was to cooperate with the ground forces in the common task of “crushing” the Soviet Union without, however, being subordinated to them. When Operation Barbarossa started on June 22, 1941, Goering had concentrated 2,713 combat (bombers, ﬁghters, close support, and transport), of which 2,080 were operational. These ﬁgures do not include 639 liaison and reconnaissance aircraft (551 operational).35The Luftwaffe’s order of battle as a whole was no larger than it had been in the previous year, nor had its composition changed to any considerable extent.36Given how vast was the country to be overrun, and how gigantic the Red Air Force, this is surprising. The Luftwaffe’s Intelligence Service was inclined to look down on every- thing Soviet. It estimated that the Red Army had about 10,500 machines, of which 7,500, or two-thirds, were stationed in Europe. Supposedly there were 1,360 reconnaissance aircraft and bombers as well as 2,200 ﬁghters.From Triumph to Stalemate 1051586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 105 Van, Creveld, Martin.

They also thought that Soviet an- cillary equipment such as radios and navigation aids was on the primitive side, and in this, too, they tur
