T ake the case of a Kampfgeschwader (bomber group) made up of Ju-88 light bombers and stationed at the central part of the front, where it formed part of II. Fliegerkorps. From June 22 to September 9, it claimed to have destroyed 356 trains and 14 bridges, interrupte d railway traffic 322 times, and ﬂown 200 sorties against troop concentrations, barracks, and supply depots in106 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 106 Van, Creveld, Martin.

This came on top of 148 tanks, 266 guns, and 3,280 vehicles of var- ious kinds.38 There was a price to be paid for this—between August 10 and 21, VIII Fliegerkorps, trying to help the ground forces by cutting the main rail- road from Moscow to Leningrad, lost 10.4 percent of its aircraft. Another 54.5 percent were damaged but could be repaired.39As in World War I, the ﬂat, often featureless terrain made navigation difficult, but it also meant that cover was hard to ﬁnd, thus facilitating reconnaissance.
