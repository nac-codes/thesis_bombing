econnaissance. Yet in some other ways things had changed considerably. Many of the Red Army’s most powerful formations, instead of marching along on their and their horses’ stomachs, were motorized and th us much more dependent on their logistic tails than their predecessors. In the entire European USSR there were only 52,000 miles of rail, many of them single-tracked. Consequently, disrupting the network was easier than in the more developed countries of the west, and the impact on the ground forces was greater. On the other hand, the same ﬂat terrain, plus the fact that few Soviet roads were paved, meant that they were hardly ideal targets for air attack. Whereas in the west one could often hamper ground movement by reducing villages to rubble, in the So- viet Union such methods were of no avail. Yet the most serious problem facing the Germans was the sheer size of the theater of operations. As the Wehrmacht marched east, the length of the front increased, funnel-like, from 1,000 to 1,500 miles. There simply were not enough aircraft, let alone ground troops, to thoroughly reconnoi- ter, conquer, occupy, and master such gigantic tracts of land. Here and there extensive forests covered the terrain, providing cover against air reconnais- sance and enabling entire armies to disappear as if by magic. By this time the Luftwaffe’s operational style of warfare, as the counterpart to the army’s preference for combined arms maneuver warfare, had been fully developed.From Triumph to Stalemate 1071586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 107 Van, Creveld, Martin.
