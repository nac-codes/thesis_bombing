eir ma- chines, such as the I-16, Yak-1, and MiG-3 ﬁghters and the LaG-3 ground support aircraft, were no match for the Messerschmitts. In a wordplay on the manufacturer’s initials, the LaG-3 even acquired the nickname of “var- nished guaranteed coffin. ” Outﬂown, outmaneuvered, and outgunned, the pilots sometimes resorted to desperate  measures, as in trying to ram their enemies. This was done often enough for a technical term, taran , to be in- vented for it. While many died, some survived; a few were recognized as heroes of the Soviet Union.110 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 110 Van, Creveld, Martin.

By the end of the year the German High Com- mand claimed to have destroyed no fewer than 20,392 enemy aircraft. As opposing narratives go, this is remarkably close to the 21,200 mentioned in Soviet sources. The cost to the Luftwaffe was 2,505 aircraft lost. Another 1,895 were damaged, but since the Germans were on the offensive and con- stantly overrunning more and more territory they must have been able to recover and repair more of them than the Soviets did.45Thus the overall balance was almost ﬁve-to-one in favor of the Luftwaffe. Yet it was already beginning to feel the weight of the British air offensive in the west that was eventually to force it almost entirely on the defensive. Much worse for the Germans, in 1941 their output of aircraft was lower than that of the Soviet Union—11,776 versus 15,735—and only slightly higher than it had been in 1940.46It is true that, across the board, Soviet aircraft remained inferior. Many of them suffered fr
