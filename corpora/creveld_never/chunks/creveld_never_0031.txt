as it did. Whereas the French economy assisted the German aviation industry to some extent, Italy and the Regia Aeronautica were a burden on the German one. As in France, production was carried out in rather small factories. Ma- chine tools were scarce, and attempts to increase output by using masses of semiskilled labor did not get far. Production peaked in the second half of 1940 when it reached just over 300 machines per month. Even so, the refusal of the aero-engine manufacturers to allow large constructors of au- tomobile engines to enter the ﬁeld me ant that only barely enough engines114 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 114 Van, Creveld, Martin.

From early 1941 on, the situation was reversed. The production of engines, many of them license-built Mercedes-Benz ones, almost dou- bled from 600 to 1,100 a month. Yet that of airframes started declining, at ﬁrst slowly and then much more rapidly. In 1943 the country became a bat- tleﬁeld. The south was occupied by the Allies, but the north remained in German hands. Thereupon production, and with it the Regia Aeronautica, collapsed.3 During all the six years from 1939 to 1945, Japan only produced 79,123 aircraft.4Output peaked in 1944, when it stood at 28,180. Even at the end of the war, only 15 percent of all Japanese machine tools were of the gen- eral-purpose, as opposed to specialized, type.5This both accounts for, and was a result of, the fact that much of the empire’s industry, the aviation in- dustry speciﬁcally included, was scattered among thousands of small ﬁrms, even family workshops, acting as subcon
