or, and was a result of, the fact that much of the empire’s industry, the aviation in- dustry speciﬁcally included, was scattered among thousands of small ﬁrms, even family workshops, acting as subcontractors to large corporations. Consequently productivity was low—between 1941 and 1945 it went down from 44 percent of the U.S. level to a mere 18 percent. As in other countries, competition by the armed forces drained the labor force and made it hard to use the remaining workers in a rational way. Given that the United States produced almost 100,000 planes in 1944 alone, and that at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor it was not yet at war with Germany, it is a little hard to understand how Japan’s leaders could have hoped to win the unequal struggle. The way the German war economy functioned, whether or not it was deliberately geared to provide what was needed for Blitzkrieg campaigns and no more, and why it produced as much or as little as it did during the years that it was so geared have been the subject of a huge literature. Here all that needs to be said is that, notwithstanding Goering, who once said that Germany “armed until it bristled,”6at ﬁrst there was no attempt to bring about a major expansion of the aircraft industry. Production, which as we saw had stood at 11,776 in 1941, only went up to 15,409 during the next year. This was much less than that of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain, which stood at 64,706.
