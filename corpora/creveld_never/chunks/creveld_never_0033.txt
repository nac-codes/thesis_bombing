Supposedly the Third Reich was governed by the Fuehrerprinzip, the leader principle, according to which decisions at all levels were made by a single man, and Hitler himself, standing at the top of the hierarchy, made the most important ones of all. In practice, owing not least to Hitler’s some- what lackadaisical leadership style, it tended to be surprisingly decentral- ized. Both before and during the war, this left plenty of room for the top ﬁgures to ﬁght ﬁerce turf battles among themselves. In the ﬁeld of aircraft production, Goering, as minister of aviation and commander in chief of the Luftwaffe (among his numerous other titles), fought the air inspector general, Erhard Milch, whom he once described as “a fart in my ass. ” Milch tried to impose some kind of order on leading manufacturers such as Heinkel, Messerschmitt, and Junkers. He was foiled by the fact that, making use of Hitler’s tendency to put his unde rstanding of technology on display,8 the heads of those and other ﬁrms had fairly easy access to him. In theory, they ought to have been coordinated by Udet as chief of the Luftwaffe’s technical office; in practice, as he himself complained not long before his death,9nobody listened to him. The outcome was that, long before 1939, each went his own way, ﬁghting all the rest for resources such as labor, en- ergy, raw materials, and factory space.10 This competition went on throughout the war. It led to an extremely in- efficient use of the chief raw material, aluminum, as well as endless dupli- cation and a very large number of prototypes, the great majority of which never entered production. Another res ult was constant modiﬁcations that disrupted production plans. Perhaps worst of all, after
