ion and a very large number of prototypes, the great majority of which never entered production. Another res ult was constant modiﬁcations that disrupted production plans. Perhaps worst of all, after 1941–42 a great many types were obsolescent. By 1943–45 the British and the Americans had a clear technological lead. Against this background, the feat of doubling of output between 1942 and 1944 was almost a miracle—one that is hardly diminished by the fact that it was done partly by switching from twin-engine to industrially less demanding single-engine machines. The Germans had always known that, quantitatively, they could not cope with their enemies.116 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 116 Van, Creveld, Martin.

The “lightning campaigns” of 1939–41 having failed to bring a decision, the Germans sought to redress the balance by producing an entire genera- tion of revolutionary weapons. The most important one was the Me-262, the world’s ﬁrst operational jet ﬁghter. In the words of one pilot, it gave the term “ﬂying” an entirely new meaning11; had it been available somewhat earlier in sufficient numbers, it might we ll have brought the Allied bombing offensive to a halt. Less successful were the V-1 and the V-2. Developed by the army, the latter was a magniﬁcent technical achievement but owing to its inaccuracy and the relatively small wa rhead it carried, it never justiﬁed the vast resources invested in it.
