Developed by the army, the latter was a magniﬁcent technical achievement but owing to its inaccuracy and the relatively small wa rhead it carried, it never justiﬁed the vast resources invested in it.12Developed by the Luftwaffe speciﬁcally to compete with the army, the former did not do much more for the Endsieg (ﬁnal victory), but at any rate it was much cheaper. This brings us to the real heavyweights, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Throughout the years 1940–43 the British outbuilt the Germans, let alone the Japanese, by a considerable margin. The same hap- pened once again in 1945, when the German and Japanese war economies were approaching collapse. Furthermore, once the Battle of Britain had been won, the British again started producing large numbers of heavy bombers. T o this extent, they replaced quantity by quality. In each of the years 1940, 1941, and 1942 Britain built more aircraft with fewer laborers than Germany did. As early as March 1942 it had a surplus of ﬁghters that could be delivered to its newly found Soviet ally.13Yet nothing could be more mistaken than to think that cooperation was smooth and efficiency maximized. As in Germany, the RAF and the navy were not able to agree who would get how many aircraft ﬁrst, and the establishment in 1938 of an Air Council in which both were represented did little to resolve their differences. Some of the worst errors were committed early on. Grossly overestimating the output of Germany’s aircraft factories, the Air Ministry sought to close the gap as quickly as possible.
