opera- tional purposes, as during the Battle of Kursk in 1943. The Soviets did pro- duce some two-engine machines—the Ilyushin Il-4, the Peltyakov Pe-2, and the Tupolev Tu-2—that could be classiﬁed as either light or medium bombers. However, from the beginning of the war to its end, the emphasis was clearly on single-engine ﬁghters and ground support aircraft; indeed it is said that the number of Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmoviks built exceeded that of any other military aircraft in history.17 From 15,735 in 1941 the number of aircraft built jumped to 25,346 in 1942, 34,900 in 1943, and 40,300 in 1944, only to drop back to 20,900 in 1945. The longer the war, the greater the emphasis on ﬁghters and ground- attack machines as opposed to bombers. In each of these years, the Soviets118 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 118 Van, Creveld, Martin. The Age of Airpower, PublicAffairs, 2011.

Though both countries resembled one another in that they focused on land-based aircraft and produced very few heavy bombers, in other ways they were opposites. The Germans developed a very large number of prototypes of which only a comparatively small number were ever produced; the Soviets went the other way. They discontinued the production of some models so as to free machine tools and factory space, limited the number of different engines, and rationalized production so that building an Il-4 only required 12,500 man-hours in 1943 as against 20,000 two years earlier.18They also skimped on ancillary equipment and on ﬁnish; then as later, compared to their west- ern opposite numbers, Soviet weapons, aircraft included, always had some- thing crude about them.
