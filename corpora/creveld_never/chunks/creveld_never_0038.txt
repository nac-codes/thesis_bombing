er.18They also skimped on ancillary equipment and on ﬁnish; then as later, compared to their west- ern opposite numbers, Soviet weapons, aircraft included, always had some- thing crude about them. This, however, does not mean that they were always ineffective. For example, the Shturmovik, whose armor made it par- ticularly hard to shoot down, was the only World War II plane constructed in such a way that the armor actually contributed to its strength, leading to a weight saving of approximately 15 percent. Even if some Soviet aircraft were relatively ineffective, at any rate they were expendable and, therefore, usable. Standing like a colossus, the most successful World War II producer of aircraft—as of practically everything else—was the United States. In 1940, a total of 12,804 machines left the assembly lines, 26,277 in 1941, 47,836 in 1942, 85,898 in 1943, 96,318 in 1944, and 49,761 in 1945. At peak, there- fore, one aircraft did so every ﬁve minutes, 24 seconds. Furthermore, this output was perhaps more varied than that of any other country: it consisted of small aircraft, large aircraft, single-engine aircraft, multi-engine aircraft, combat aircraft, noncombat aircraft, land-based aircraft, and carrier-based aircraft. Nothing like it had ever been seen before; nothing like it has been seen since, and almost certainly nothing even remotely resembling it will ever be seen in any kind of future. As with every other country, this is not to say that perfect coordination of all production factors was achieved. The mere title of one book, The Mess in Washington , ought to rule out any such belief.19A look at the index shows that the aviation industry suffered from labor shortages, disastrousWar of Factories, War of Wits 1191586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 119 Van, Creveld, Martin.
