It appears that, when President Franklin Roosevelt in May 1940 put forward his “50,000 aircraft” program for 1942 he had taken the ﬁgure out of thin air.20 After Pearl Harbor he raised it to 125,000 aircraft per year, again with no solid basis of facts to back it up. As in other countries, delays in starting the production of some aircraft, notably the B-24 Liberator bomber, meant that, by the time they could ﬁnally be deployed, they were approaching ob- solescence. That was one reason why many of them were used in the anti- submarine role over the Atlantic whereas others were converted into transports. Nevertheless, these probl ems ended up being overshadowed by a number of advantages no other country had. Throughout World War II, the United States was the only major bel- ligerent whose territory was neither invaded nor bombed. Following the Great Depression the country had a huge  unused manufacturing capability and an equally large pool of surplus labor. Thus, from 1940 to 1942 alone, the size of the workforce went up by nine million.21Compared to the pop- ulation, the United States called up fewer men than any other major bel- ligerent did, which translated into a larger workforce. In 1944, the U.S. aircraft industry employed more people than that of any other country. American industrial plants in general, and aircraft-manufacturing factories in particular, were much larger than their British, German, and Japanese opposite numbers, thoug
