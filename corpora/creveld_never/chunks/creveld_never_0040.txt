that of any other country. American industrial plants in general, and aircraft-manufacturing factories in particular, were much larger than their British, German, and Japanese opposite numbers, though in comparison with the Soviet Union the dif- ference was probably not as great. U.S. productivity in the ﬁeld was also much higher than in Germany and Japan.22 There is another way of looking at the ﬁgures. Of the ﬁve main belliger- ents, two entered the war in 1939. One did so in mid-1941, and two at the end of the same year. T aking the period 1940–45 as the best available com- promise, we ﬁnd that, in those six years, the United States produced 309,761 aircraft. Germany built 109,586, the British Empire 143,234, the Soviet Union 147,836, and Japan 74,646. Earlier in this chapter it was es- timated that, if America’s industrial potential in 1939 stood at 3, then the120 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 120 Van, Creveld, Martin.

Combining the two sets we ﬁnd that Ger- many produced somewhat less than its fair share of aircraft. The British Empire produced considerably more, and the USSR many more. Japan, too, produced more than its share. This calculation ignores many factors, in- cluding the extent to which the various countries mobilized their resources and the types of aircraft each produced. Still we conclude that, relative to their overall industrial potential, allthe main belligerents except Germany built more aircraft than the United States did. Surprisingly enough, the country that put the greatest emphasis on the air arm turns out
