industrial potential, allthe main belligerents except Germany built more aircraft than the United States did. Surprisingly enough, the country that put the greatest emphasis on the air arm turns out to have been the Soviet Union. This even held true at the time U.S. production peaked, in 1944. Still following the same calculations, during the same year the Soviet Union should have produced 25,648 air- craft; instead, it came up with no fewer than 40,300. These ﬁgures represent a useful corrective to the oft-heard claim that the Soviet Union was basi- cally a land power that neither put sufficient resources into airpower nor, perhaps, fully grasped its signiﬁcance. The truth seems to be that, relative to the resources at their disposal, the Soviets devoted a greater effort to creating and maintaining its air force than did anyone else. Where they dif- fered was the purpose for which they planned airpower and used it—that is, at the front and comparatively close behind it. Still, given that three out of every four German soldiers killed in World War II met their fate at the hands of the Red Army, perhaps Stalin’s choice was not so bad after all. As much as the war in the air was a battle of factories, it was also a battle of wits. Throughout the years that it lasted, all the belligerents assiduously collected intelligence on the opposing air forces. Doing so, they made use of every possible method, including, to name but a few, perusing the media, agents’ reports, pilots’ reports, and captured enemy pilots’ reports. T o this were added technical intelligence (ﬁnding out whatever they could about the characteristics of enemy machines), photo intelligence, signals intelli- gence (SIGINT , reading enemy radio messages), electronic intelligence (ELINT , learning about the enemy from the frequency of his radio trans- missions, the direction from which they c ome, and so on), and much more.War of Factories, War of Wits 1211586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM
