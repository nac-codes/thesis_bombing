he Germans were building up the Luft- waffe, an error that contributed ﬁrst to appeasement and then to every sort of dire prediction and to accelerated rearmament on their part.23On the German side things worked the other way around. During the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe not only missed the role of radar but underestimated the number of the RAF’s remaining ﬁghters, a truly critical error. Worse, the basic idea, for which there was as yet no evidence whatsoever, that a large and powerful country could be forced to its knees simply by means of terror bombing directed against its civilian population, proved to be false. Born out of arrogance, this tendency toward underestimating the enemy reappeared in 1941, when it was a question of confronting the Soviet Union, and again in 1941–42 in relation to the United States. In both cases the Luftwaffe’s appreciation of its enemies’ weaknesses in regard to doc- trine, training, and technology proved approximately correct—for exam- ple, it never followed the U.S. Army Air Force in its belief that bombers,122 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 122 Van, Creveld, Martin.

What the German Air Staff did not un- derstand, and consequen tly take into account, were the dramatic changes that time and mobilization would bring. Nor did the list of intelligence fail- ures end at this point. Early in 1944, confronted with evidence that Mus- tang ﬁghter-bombers were escorting formations of B-17 bombers deep into German and German-controlled airspace, Goering at ﬁrst thought that his intelligence officers had
