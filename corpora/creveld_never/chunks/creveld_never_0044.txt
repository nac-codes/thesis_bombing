onted with evidence that Mus- tang ﬁghter-bombers were escorting formations of B-17 bombers deep into German and German-controlled airspace, Goering at ﬁrst thought that his intelligence officers had gone stark raving mad and berated them. Some- thing similar happened in the Paciﬁc; thou gh Japanese planners did receive an occasional warning concerning their enemy’s ability to outbuild them in the air, they chose to look the other way. As the war changed course, various kinds of intelligence either gained or lost in importance. For example, Soviet codes were notoriously difficult to crack. Moreover, the Red Army placed a greater reliance on landlines than any other armed force did; thus there were limits to what SIGINT and ELINT could do to gain information about it. Preparing for Operation Bar- barossa, the Luftwaffe placed much reliance on photoreconnaissance. Its chosen instrument in this task was the Ju-86, a magniﬁcent diesel-powered, exhaust-driven, turbocharged, twin-engine machine that was ﬁrst tested in 1939. It had a service ceiling of 42,640 feet; some later models could rise as high as 52,500 feet, but they were only produced in very limited num- bers. By comparison, the famous British de Havilland Mosquito Mark XVI only made it to 39,400 feet. Later, as their own offensives ran out of steam and they were confronted by the Allies’ growing superiority in the air, the Germans found that their ability to conduct this form of reconnaissance declined almost to the van- ishing point. The consequences of this situation can only be called mo- mentous; for example, it enabled the Allies to keep the location of the Normandy landings secret and thus contributed to their success. Allied command of the air also induced Rommel, who had experienced its results in North Africa and was in charge of the German defenses, to try to meet the landings on the beach instead of concentrating his reserves in the rear and counterattacking at a later point.24Both in Europe and the
