sed to serve as early warning against approaching enemy aircraft and to track friendly ones. Somewhat later they also started to be used to direct anti-aircraft artillery ﬁre, a function th at gave rise to the ﬁrst computers. The Allies even mounted a sort of miniature radar set inside anti-aircraft shells, allowing the latter to explode when they passed near the target and not just when they hit it head-on.25At about the same time, smaller radar sets capable of being mounted aboard aircraft made their appearance. In this form, shortwave radar, used by Coastal Command, played a critical role in the defeat of German submarine warfare during the spring of 1943.26 Conversely, an increasingly sophisticated combination of ground radar, anti-aircraft artillery radar, and radar mounted inside twin-engine night ﬁghters allowed the Luftwaffe to wage a years-long ﬁght against the Allied strategic bombing campaign.27Late in the war, radar was also mounted aboard bombers and used to penetrate through cloud cover, but its effec- tiveness in this role remained somewhat dubious. Since water reﬂects radio waves in an entirely different way than  land does, radar was most useful for124 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 124 Van, Creveld, Martin.

However, only in December 1944 did it reach the point where it could reliably identify a large urban target such as Berlin. The real battle of wits consisted not just of introducing new devices but also of inventing others to counter them. Right from the beginning it was clear that radar, while vital to intercept enemy aircraft at night in particular, also gave warning about its own
