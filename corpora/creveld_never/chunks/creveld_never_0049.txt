and technical excellence are one thing, the ability to use them effectively and translate them in to military results, another. Because air warfare, which takes place in a relatively simple environment, is easier to analyze than what takes place at sea or on land, as early as World War I attempts were made to apply mathematics to it. The objective was to sub- stitute scientiﬁc calculation for trial-and-error-based guesswork, to improve performance, and to reduce casualties. A pioneer is this ﬁeld was the British specialist Frederick W. Lanchester. In 1939–45 his scientiﬁc work devel- oped into operations research (OR), and the best-known practitioners of the craft were the American mathematician and game theorist John von Neumann and two Britons, Patrick M. S. Blackett, a physicist who later went on to win the Nobel Prize in his ﬁeld, and Solly Zuckerman, a zoolo- gist specializing in the study of primates. OR could answer, or at least provide better instruments with which to answer, such questions as whether the best way to protect aircraft was by adding extra cannon or armor, how many of the available aircraft to commit and how many to keep in reserve, what formations to adopt under what126 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 126 Van, Creveld, Martin.

OR was equally useful in plannin g and deploying anti-aircraft de- fenses, logistic systems, training sche dules, and, above all, communication systems. The following is a summa
