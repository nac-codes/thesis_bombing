one of his best-known equations Lanchester argues that, in modern war- fare, to offset a numerical handicap of two to one, an armed force needs to be not twice as good as its enemy, as common sense would suggest, but four times. If, as in this case, one side outnumbers the other 4.6 to 1, then a qualitative advantage of no less than 4.6 times 4.6=21.16 is needed. If we assume that this is even approximately correct, the real miracle is not why the Allies eventually won the air war but how the Axis powers were able to hold out for as long as they did.War of Factories, War of Wits 1291586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 129 Van, Creveld, Martin.

Until the spring of 1943, submarine warfare probably represented the one method by which Germany could have beaten Britain and forced it to sur- render. Conversely, ﬁrst Britain’s surv ival and later its ability and that of its larger and more powerful American ally to bring forces to bear against Ger- many (and Italy) depended on their command of the sea-lanes.
