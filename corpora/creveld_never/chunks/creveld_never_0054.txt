e powerful American ally to bring forces to bear against Ger- many (and Italy) depended on their command of the sea-lanes. Though the Mediterranean was never more than a side theater, here, too, ultimately it was command of the sea that decided the issue. The difference between the two world wars was that, from 1918 to 1939, military aviation devel- oped far more rapidly than warships and merchantmen did. By the time World War II broke out, there was still much argument about how much air support navies required, how it should be organized, and what tasks it should carry out, but the principle that they could not operate without such support had been ﬁrmly established. Having already said something about the Mediterranean, and leaving the Paciﬁc until later, here we shall focus on the Atlantic. In 1939–45, as in 1914–18, without the sea-lanes across the Atlantic, Britain could not exist and would have to surrender sooner rather than later.

That struggle was waged mainly by light naval units and the aircraft that worked with them. As in 1914–18, one of the ﬁrst things the British did was to revert to the convoy system and to blockade Germany. The Germans on their part used their submarine ﬂeet to impose a counter-blockade. Seen from the viewpoint of airpower, the struggle was not symmetrical. Wherever they went, the British could and did use aircraft, whether land- launched or carrier-borne, to hunt for German submarines as well as the few other blockade runners, armed a
