e bases in an attempt to learn more about the submarines’ arrivals and departures. Often encountering intense anti-aircraft ﬁre, these aircraft suffered the heaviest losses. While many fac- tors played a role in the submarines’ ultimate defeat, probably the most im- portant one was a shortwave (decimetric) radar set known as SCR-517 introduced in the spring of 1943. Though its range in anti-submarine work was limited to six miles, for the ﬁrst time it enabled the aircraft carrying it to reliably and accurately locate submarines operating on the surface even at night, their favorite time in which to recharge their batteries and stalk their prey. Since a different version of this set, known as the H2S, was car- ried by Bomber Command in its raids over Germany it was feared that the Germans would be able to quickly capture it and counter it. As it turned out, a set was captured almost immediately, but a countermeasure was only built after eight months, because, as Goering himself was forced to admit,5Closing the Ring 1331586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 133 Van, Creveld, Martin.

After June 1943 the submarine menace ceased to play a major role in the war. This enabled the Allies to start closing the ring on Nazi-dominated Europe and begin sending massive troop-carrying convoys across the At- lantic. If no troop-carrying ship ever went to the bottom, then one reason for this was the air escort that the RAF and the USAAF provided for them. Even earlier, in November 1942, the Allies had landed in North Africa. After conquering Algeria and Tunisia, in July 1943 they went on to
