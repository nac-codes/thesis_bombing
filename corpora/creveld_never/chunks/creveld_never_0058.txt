the air escort that the RAF and the USAAF provided for them. Even earlier, in November 1942, the Allies had landed in North Africa. After conquering Algeria and Tunisia, in July 1943 they went on to organize invasions of Sicily and Italy. Each of these undertakings relied on massive air support, and none would have been possible without it. Each time it was aircraft that provided intelligence on the landing sites as well as on the enemy forces defending it; covered the convoys on their way across the sea; provided ﬁrepower during the landings themselves, demolishing coastal fortiﬁcations and interdicting German reinforcements further in- land; and brought in supplies where conditions were suitable and other means unavailable. In Sicily they also dropped parachutists to assist the seaborne troops, with very mixed results. Even as their aircraft helped ﬁght and win the war at sea, the Allies mounted their strategic bombing campaign against Germany. The two were often in conﬂict. Throughout the war, RAF Coastal Command was always calling for more aircraft to support its operations, only to have Bomber Command retort that releasing them meant weakening the strategic bomb- ing campaign as the most effective way to bring Germany to its knees. Arthur Harris, the chief of Bomber Command, also strongly objected— with good reason as it turned out—to using his bombers against submarine pens. During the ﬁrst two years of the war, British attempts to bomb Ger- many had been almost entirely ineffective. Mediocre aircraft such as the Blenheim and the Wellington, highly inaccurate navigation and bombing aids, and unexpectedly strong, increasingly radar-assisted, German de- fenses both in the air and on the ground all contributed to this. Only in the spring of 1942, after new aircraft such as the Avro Lancaster entered ser- vice, did things change.134 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 134 Van, Creveld, Martin.
