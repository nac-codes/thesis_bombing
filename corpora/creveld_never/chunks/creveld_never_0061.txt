their thin “laminar ﬂow” wings, these aircraft had a longer range than any previous ﬁghters. Even then it took some time before the U.S. Eighth Air Force changed its tactics, freed pilots from their close ties to the bombers, and allowed them to engage the German ﬁghters wherever they were found.8 In the summer of 1943, acting on Hitler’s direct instructions, the Luft- waffe shifted the emphasis from interdiction and CAS toward defending the Reich. Eventually 70 percent of all ﬁghter squadrons were so employed. The outcome was to leave much of the Wehrmacht’s ﬁeld formations with- out cover to match the growing airpower that the western Allies, and in their own way the Soviets too, were using against them; the few units that remained often consisted of inferior aircraft. Worse still, many of the anti- aircraft guns, especially the excellent 88-millimeter one, were dual-purpose. Consequently the front was starved of anti-tank weapons as well. As in other countries, the defenses consisted of ﬁghter aircraft, anti-aircraft ar- tillery units, and a civil defense. As in the Soviet Union, but unlike the sit- uation in Britain both during the Battle of Britain and later, the ﬁrst and the second of these were both under Luftwaffe command, facilitating co- ordination. Most of the night ﬁghters were Do-17, Ju-88, and Me-110 air- craft. None of them had been designed for the purpose, and by the end of the war all were obsolete; yet all had the advantage that, being twin en- gined, they were large enough to carr y radar sets. The pilots were directed to their targets by a series of control centers. Approaching, ﬁrst they would spot the enemy on their own radar screens and then, closing to within gun- shot, visually. The control centers in turn relied on data provided by a chain of layered, overlapping, interlocking radar sets ﬁrst established in 1940 and reaching from Denmark to central France. Down almost to the last days of the war, the bombers and their nemesis co ntinued t
