layered, overlapping, interlocking radar sets ﬁrst established in 1940 and reaching from Denmark to central France. Down almost to the last days of the war, the bombers and their nemesis co ntinued to face each other, with each side introducing successive improvements to its methods.9136 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 136 Van, Creveld, Martin.

From this point on they were systematically built up with single-engine ﬁghters such as the Me-109 and the FW-190, and twin-engine Me-410 ﬁghters predom- inating; the last named was heavy enough to carry a 50-millimeter cannon originally developed for use on tanks. As with the night defenses, radar sets detected the bomber swarms when the y were still as much as 60 miles away (the fact that they were coming was noted much earlier, given that the radio traffic they generated was easily interc epted). Once approximate numbers, altitude, course, and the prospective target had been determined, the con- trollers would alert the nearby ﬁghter squadrons and guide the pilots to- ward the approaching enemy. As w ith the night defense s, too, both sides, but the Allies in particular, did what they could to study one another and mislead one another by mounting diversions, changing direction, and broadcasting false messages. On both sides, casualties were extremely high—the British Bomber Command alone lost 55,000 aircrew killed. This ﬁgure represented one- quarter of all military dead and fully 44 percent of the 125,000 aircrew who served under Harris at one time or another. But Allied crews in any case knew that, if they survived their tour, they woul
