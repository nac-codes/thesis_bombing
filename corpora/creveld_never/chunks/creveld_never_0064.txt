In 1941 the RAF dropped 35,509 tons on Europe; in 1942, the RAF and USAAF together dropped 57,550. In 1943, the ﬁgure was 226,513; in 1944, it was 1,188,577; and in 1945, it was 477,051—bringing the total to just under two million.13 The attacks were not always continuous. Now the weather, now German opposition, could cause them to be interrupted for days and even weeks on end. Though the difference might not always be apparent to those on the re- ceiving end, the Americans proceeded in a somewhat more systematic way than the British did. Instead of deliberately setting out to wreck cities and de-house workers, they concentrated on speciﬁc industrial targets. The ones that, in retrospect, proved the most rewarding were Germany’s aircraft factories, its transport system, and its in stallations for producing synthetic oil. The ﬁrst type did not succeed in causing production to break down— in fact, German production of aircraft peaked in 1944—but it did cause untold difficulties and forced the entire industry to disperse with all the in- efficiencies that such a program entails. By the end of the war, the second had produced a situation where such raw materials as could still be ex- tracted and such materiel as could still be produced often could not be as- sembled or put to use. The third hit both the ground forces and the Luftwaffe very hard, forcing the former to place growing reliance on horses and helping create a situation where German ﬂight cadets could not get sufficient training. Sent into the air nevertheless, many were shot down be- fore they could properly learn to handle themselves. In the entire history of World War II, probably no camp
