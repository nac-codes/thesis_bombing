In the entire history of World War II, probably no campaign has given rise to more controversy than this one.

Was strategic bombing the best way to use airpower, or was it merely a diversion from other forms of employing it, such as CAS and interdiction? Were the targets corr ectly selected, or would a different approach have led to better and faster results? What was the effect on the German conduct of the war, and how much did it contribute to victory? Could strategic bombing be morally justiﬁed? Proceeding in reverse order, if the raids on Cologne, Hamburg, Dresden, and so many other cities con- stituted war crimes, then so, without doubt, did the ones on Warsaw, Rot- terdam, London, Coventry, and Birmingham. Given how inaccurate the means of delivery of the time were, it was completely unrealistic to expect that targets hit would be exclusively, and in many cases even mainly, of a military nature. Bombing did not prove decisive in the sense of forcing Hitler and his government to surrender.14What it did do was to kill about 350,000 people and injure 800,000 more, render 10 percent of the popula- tion homeless, and paralyze many industr ies and transportation arteries. T o counter the strategic bombin g campaign, the Germans in 1944 used 55,000 guns and 2,100,000 men (900,000 in the defenses proper, 1.2 mil- lion in damage repair).15These were no mean ﬁgures, but whether they were gre
