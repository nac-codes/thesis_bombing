the preliminary plans, the British general Frederick Morgan, later explained how he went about it.27Dividers in hand, he ruled out any coasts that could not be effectively covered by ﬁghters operating from air bases in the British Isles. Nor was it a question of using ﬁghters and ﬁghter-bombers alone.
