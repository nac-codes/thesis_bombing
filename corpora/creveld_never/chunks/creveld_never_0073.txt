The cam- paigns in North Africa and Italy had taught the Americans and the British how to run their systems of air-to-ground, ground-to-air cooperation. Both had copied the German system whereby forward observers, riding special vehicles and equipped with radio-te lephones, accompanied the forward troops and talked directly to the pilots.

This was all the more so because all parties had some interest in presenting even ts in the most favorable light for them- selves.

Disputes between the bomber pilots and the ﬁghter “jocks” complicated the issue even further to say nothing of the “objective” interventions by military historians. The ﬁrst factor governing the effectiveness of tactical airpower (T
