port could hardly expect to receive it within less than an hour of the request being made. One hour might entail extraordinary efficiency on the part of a host of forward ob- servers, communicators, air traffic directors, and commanders at many lev- els. Yet to men who sought to defend themselves against a counterattack or met unexpected resistance when they themselves took the offensive, it seemed like an eternity; after all, in that period a tank might easily cover 15 miles. T o be sure, much shorter response times might be achieved by diverting ﬁghter-bombers already in the air. However, doing so was not al- ways technically possible and inevitably entailed abandoning other mis- sions. Furthermore, it carried the danger that airpower would be turned into the handmaiden of the ground forces and thus lose its greatest advan- tages, namely, its ﬂexibility and its ability to concentrate. There never was any doubt that, thanks to their agility and their ability to operate at low altitudes, ﬁghter-b ombers could deliver ordnance much more accurately than bombers could. Before the invasion, certain experts— perhaps with an axe to grind since they were employed by RAF Bomber Command to show how wasteful the policy of diverting the heavy planes away from the strategic bombing of Germany was—estimated that it would take 1,200 tons of bombs to kno ck out a single bridge.
