Fighter-bombers had a ﬁeld day destroying stationary and moving targets in the open ﬁeld. Locomotives, which could not engage in evasive maneuvering and which when hit gave off a spectac- ular cloud of steam, were a special favorite. However, they could hardly do the same inside cities with their often tall structures and narrow, sometimes canyon-like, streets. Operating over open country, ﬁghter-bombers were more effective against large, stationary targets, br idges included, than against smaller, moving ones. They were also more effective against infantry in the open, especially if it stood or moved in dense concentrations, than against en- trenched troops; once again, whether the enemy would be caught in the open was very much a question of precise coordination and timing. When ﬁghter-bombers were used in close support the small caliber of their bal- listic weapons, such as machine guns and cannon, and the inaccuracy of the non-ballistic ones, such as rockets, made them much more effective at suppressing enemy ﬁre than at destroying its sources,33and more so against soft vehicles than against armored ones. T o this extent those who favored interdiction over close support were doubtless correct, the more so because second-echelon troops were usually less well provided with anti-aircraft artillery than front-line units. Again, the question is not merely who was right and who was wrong; rather the debate helped shape the post-1945 world. In the end, all that can be said is that the role of Anglo-American T ac/Air in defeating the Wehrmacht was considerable. However, it must also be said that we shall never know just how considerable it was, or whether the industrial and manpower resources it consumed might have been more effectively used if
