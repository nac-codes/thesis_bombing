onsiderable. However, it must also be said that we shall never know just how considerable it was, or whether the industrial and manpower resources it consumed might have been more effectively used if they had been assigned to the ground troops on one hand or to the strategic air forces on the other. In all this it is useful to recall that three-quarters of all Wehrmacht sol- diers who were killed in World War II lost their lives on the Eastern Front. Compared to that, the Western one was almost a picnic.

While the quality of Soviet aircraft was improving, German pilots and organization, including above all the critically important ﬁeld of communications, remained superior. Concentrating its forces, the Luftwaffe was still able to obtain clear air su- periority at the time and at the place it wanted. The problem was that, given the relatively low number of machines a nd the huge spaces to be overrun, there were never enough forces to do a really thorough job. This was re- ﬂected in the tremendous effort of the Luftwaffe transport command; dur- ing this period it ﬂew 21,500 sorties, covered over ten million miles, and delivered 42,000–43,000 tons of supplies.34 Determined to dislodge the last remaining Soviet forces still clingi
