to intervene effectively in the ground battle was at Kursk in July 1943, when it saved the German Ninth Army from encirclement and possibly annihi- lation. From this point on, in the air as on the ground, the boot was clearly on the other foot. Already during 1942 the quality of Soviet airpower had begun to improve; aircraft received wireless—from early 1943 on, every new machine was equipped with a set—and modern navigation aids. Soviet ground radar had now developed to the point where it was able to provide 15 minutes’ advance warning against approaching German aircraft, greatly facilitating interception and enabling commanders to do away with the wasteful practice of mounting air patrols around the clock.

Partly for that reason, partly because of the Luftwaffe’s de- cision to focus on the defense of the Reich, the Red Air Force also enjoyed a very great quantitative advantage. One result was that the number of air- to-air encounters actually declined, as was later to happen in the west too; there simply were no German planes or pilots left to carry on the ﬁght. This in turn meant that the Soviets, assured of air superiority at most times and places, were able to focus on air-to-ground attack. Like their en- emies and their allies, they developed a system of
