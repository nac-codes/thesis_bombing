This in turn meant that the Soviets, assured of air superiority at most times and places, were able to focus on air-to-ground attack. Like their en- emies and their allies, they developed a system of forward air observers. They were fully motorized and used radio telephony to work with ground commanders down to the regimental level. T actics, too, improved. At Sta - lingrad, deﬁcient arrangements for air-to-ground cooperation made Soviet air support almost totally ineffective. Now, with the battle moving to and fro (but mostly to) over the enormous, almost featureless expanses, things became a lot easier. Smaller, more ﬂexible formations numbering three or four aircraft were adopted. Pilots learned to launch their attacks from the west, especially during the late afternoon when the sun would blind the German defenders. While tactical bombers—the only ones the Soviets had—ﬁghter-bombers, and ground atta ck aircraft ﬂew both battleﬁeld sup- port and interdiction sorties, the Soviets continued to differ from the west- ern Allies in that they always preferred the former to any other kind. By one calculation they devoted as many as 40–50 percent of all sorties to that task. This was almost as many as those devoted to air superiority (35–45 percent), interdiction (4–12 percent), and reconnaissance (2–13 percent) combined. The number of Soviet combat aircraft grew from 1,327 at Stalingrad to no fewer than 7,496 during the climactic Battle of Berlin. The daily number of sorties went up from 500 at Stalingrad to 2,600 at Kursk to 4,157 at Berlin.37Whereas at Stalingrad each aircraft ﬂew 0.37 sorties per day on the average, two years later the ﬁgure stood at 0.55.
