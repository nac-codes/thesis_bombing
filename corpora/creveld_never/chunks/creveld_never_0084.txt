opers to be scattered over 50 miles. Out of 134 British gliders, 47 landed in the sea with heavy loss of life. Their activ- ities made little impression either on the Italians, who surrendered with hardly a shot, or on the Germans, who fought with their usual tenacity. On the Eastern Front, too, the largest Soviet airborne operation, mounted at Burkina in the Ukraine in September 1943 and lasting into November, was not a great success either. Perhaps the most successful airborne operation took place in Nor- mandy in June 1944, when British paratroopers and glider-borne troops, sent to capture bridges, road crossings, and key terrain features, achieved all their objectives and held most of them against German counterattacks until help arrived. Their American colleagues were not as fortunate. So scattered and confused did they become that their divisional commanders were only ever able to gather 2,500 men out of 13,000; consequently their operations only amounted to pinpricks. For all sorts of airborne opera- tions, the turning point came at Arnhem three months later. Operation Market Garden, as it was called, involved no fewer than 34,600 U.S., British, Canadian, and Polish troops.40It was much the largest of its kind ever at- tempted. Yet intelligence failures caused it to run into ﬁerce resistance by armored SS troops. It never achieved its objectives of securing the bridges over the Dutch rivers and cost the Allies at least 15,000 casualties. T o make things worse, these were enormously expensive operations. Not only is air transport the most costly form of transport—to say nothing of losses—but organizing it entailed selecting the cream of the available manpower, pro- viding them with special training, and keeping them in reserve—and thus out of combat—for months on end un til a suitable opportunity for their employment arose.Closing the Ring 1511586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 151 Van, Creveld, Martin.
