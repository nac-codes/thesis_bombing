As had also been the case in World War I, the struggle consisted of attrition. There were no clear decisive battles or turning points. Attrition occurred primarily because the number of aircraft involved on both sides was huge, much larger than  in Asia and the Paciﬁc. There the United States deployed only part of its forces, the British and the Soviets deployed a comparatively small number, and Japan as the common enemy produced fewer machines than any other major belligerent except Italy. Yet it was precisely the huge number of aircraft employed in both theaters— even heavy four-engine aircraft carrying ten crew members and more each—that made them expendable. It was precisely because they were ex- pendable that they were able to take a part, however great or small, in the conduct of hostilities. Conversely, we apons and weapon systems regarded as too expensive and too few in number to be lost cannot be used in war either. It was a lesson that, during the decades after 1945, came to be in- creasingly neglected.152 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 152 Van, Creveld, Martin.
