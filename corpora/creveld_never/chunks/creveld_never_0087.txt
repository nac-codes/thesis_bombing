One was to defend against further Japanese advances, including any directed against their own bases, in southeastern China. In this they were largely successful. The sec- ond was to assist in the reconquest of Japanese-occupied Burma so as to open a road from India through the latter country to China. In the end, though the Burma Road was built and was in operation, so difficult was the topography that its performance did not meet expectations. The opposite applied to the airlift over the Himalaya range, the Hump, as it was known, which did much better than expected. During the war it delivered to China no fewer than 650,000 tons of supplies, which made it into one of the great- est triumphs of air transport of all time. Burma also witnessed the ﬁrst large-scale attempt to free a ground force of its dependence on lines of communications by supplying it entirely from the air—a feat pundits and generals had been contemplating ever since the end of World War I. The scheme actually put into operation was the brain- child of an eccentric British officer, Brigadier Orde Wingate. He hoped that, leading a brigade-sized force into the country and conducting a kind of guerrilla warfare behind the lines, he might loosen the Japanese hold on it. In February 1943, some 3,000 men, div ided into seven columns, set out. The operation was not a success; Japanese intelligence had been aware of it from the beginning. Their forces progressively hemmed in the Chindits, as they were called. After more than two months only 2,200 men returned. Of those, 600 were too debilitated by hunger and disease to take a further part in the war—losses largely occasioned by the fact that, despite the air- crews’ best efforts, they often failed to locate the troops on the ground or deliver supplies accurately to them.
