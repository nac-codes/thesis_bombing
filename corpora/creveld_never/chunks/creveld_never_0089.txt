First, observ- ing radio silence, the Imperial Combined Fleet approached Hawaii from the north, avoiding detection and, in effect, escaping the order of battle as traced by U.S. intelligence. Next cruisers, covering the carriers, sent up their reconnaissance aircraft to report on the precise positions at which ships were anchored at Pearl Harbor as well as on any possible U.S. preventive attacks. Putting everything on a single card, the Japanese commander on the spot, Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, left just 48 aircraft in reserve to defend the ﬂeet.

It was claimed that their aircraft were inferior and the people myopic and suffering from heritable “defects of the tubes of the inner ear” that prevented them from ever becoming really good pi- lots.4Now, as two waves, each numbering some 180 machines, roared low over Pearl Harbor they received a rude awakening. The ﬁrst wave con- sisted of torpedo bombers, which the Japanese, having carefully studied the 1940 British attack on the Italian ﬂeet at T aranto, had selected as their main weapon. A special aerial torpedo capable of making its way in the shallow waters of Pearl Harbor was even developed. The principal objec- tive of this wave was to destroy as many capital ships as possible.
