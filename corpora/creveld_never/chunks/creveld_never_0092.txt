out, that ship was undergoing repairs and thus not available for action. Consequently when the two battleships and the four destroyers that escorted them left Singapore to hunt for the Japanese, they did so without air support of any kind. Except for radar, which as it happened did not function very well, they were blind. Unsurprisingly, in- stead of locating the Japanese they themselves were discovered by a Japa- nese submarine. The latter radioed their location, speed, and course to headquarters, and the rest followed. Of the two ships, the Repulse was relatively old, having been launched in the midst of World War I. Since then, however, she had been reﬁtted sev- eral times, speciﬁcally in order to strengthen her defenses against air attack. By contrast, the Prince of Wales was among the most powerful gun-carrying naval platforms anywhere. She incorporated the latest in anti-aircraft and anti-torpedo defenses, including both gu ns and specially designed under- water armor. Yet this did not prevent her from becoming one of the two ﬁrst capital ships ever sunk solely by airpower in the open sea; as a result, in the vast naval battles that followed, battleships, to the extent that they were present at all, were overshadowed by the carriers. On the Japanese side, this even applied to the largest battleships ever built, the Yamato and Musashi, both of which had their short, but exciting, careers terminated by U.S. Navy aircraft. On the American one, it meant that the big gunships’ principal remaining use was not in the ﬂeet actions for which they had been designed but in providing cover to amphibious landings by bombarding coastal defenses.From Carrier War to Grande Finale 1571586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 157 Van, Creveld, Martin.
