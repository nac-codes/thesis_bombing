They illustrate the above developments almost to perfection. The former grew out of a Japanese attempt to seize the British-held island of Tulagi as well as Port Moresby on New Guinea. The ultimate objective was to extend the protective ring around the newly won empire in Southeast Asia, gain a base from which Japanese aircraft could bomb northern Australia, and threaten communications between Australia and the United States.

This was the ﬁrst naval battle in which the naval forces of both sides never even sighted one another. Oper ating over vast distances and maneu- vering at high speed, they searched for one another by means of wireless interception and code breaking, rada r (the Americans), and land- and sea- based air reconnaissance. Once the enemy had been located, and assuming his position was not misreported a nd that he was not lost again or con- cealed by bad weather, they sent out their land- and sea-based aircraft. The trick, an intricate one depending on elaborate calculations of distance, speed, and time, was always to catch the other side’s aircraft while they were being refueled and re-equipped and thus unable to respond; insofar as doing so required high-quality, real-t ime intelligence that might not always be available, a good measure of luck was
