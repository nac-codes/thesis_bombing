they were being refueled and re-equipped and thus unable to respond; insofar as doing so required high-quality, real-t ime intelligence that might not always be available, a good measure of luck was also needed. As it turned out, since Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue’s experienced aircrews sank more American ships than the other way around, he was able to claim a victory. However, losses among those crews were heavy, and unlike their enemies the Japa- nese were unable to replace them; above all, though Tulagi was in fact oc- cupied, Port Moresby, as the operation’s more important objective, remained in British hands. By contrast, the Battle of Midway took place in the Paciﬁc, where it formed part of the second Japanese effort.

Again the two forces, centered on their respective aircraft carriers but also including three Japanese battleships, maneuvered against one an- other over vast stretches of ocean. Once again, they did their best to track each other by means of radio direction ﬁnding, code breaking, radar (in the last two ﬁelds the Americans now had a considerable, and growing, ad- vantage), and sea- and air-reconnaissance. The enemy’s strength, location, course, and speed having been determined, quite often not without any number of errors, again it was a q
