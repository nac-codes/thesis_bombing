Within two weeks from the end of the battle, the House Naval Affairs Committee drew the conclusions from this fact by unanimously scrapping the plans for ﬁve 58,000-ton Montana class battleships with their twelve 16-inch guns each. At the same time it approved the construction of no fewer than 500,000 tons of new carriers. It was clearly the end of an era; from now on, it would be the principal mission of the remaining battleships either to escort the carriers or to bombard coastal targets in preparation for amphibious landings. The carriers themselves gradually grew in size from 20,000 to 30,000 tons at the beginning of the war to as much as 45,000 tons at its end. Doing so, they took on larger and heavier aircraft, which in turn led to larger carriers, and so on in an endless cycle that, involving phe- nomenal cost increases, continues to the present day. They ruled the seas— or, in the view of those who did not have what it took to own them, tyrannized them. Outside the range of land-based aircraft, and leaving aside submarines, which form a separate story, carriers were invulnerable. The only enemies capable of taking them on were others similar to themselves.
