During the four days it lasted American radar detected several key Japanese movements that were made at night.10By this time almost the only remaining qualitative advantage Japanese naval aviation still enjoyed consisted of the longer range of their (land-based) Nakajima C-6 reconnaissance aircraft; yet even this was obviated by the fact that the quality of the pilots was no longer what it had been. War, least of all modern naval war, rarely consists of large battles alone. Going on day in, day out, was submarine warfare. In it, too, naval aviation played a decisive role. As we saw, the German Navy in the Atlantic was badly handicapped by the almost total absence of naval aircraft to work with. By contrast, both sides in the Paciﬁc used aircraft not just in anti-sub- marine warfare but in their efforts to combat the enemy’s merchant ship- ping as well. Again, the U.S. Navy enjoyed the inestimable and growing advantage of radar as well as code breaking. Gradually its commanders learned how to weave surface ships, submarines, and aircraft into a near- seamless web. In that web, as authors of the Strategic Bombing Survey put it, “carrier-borne air attacks, when directed against large concentrations of merchant shipping, were by far the most devastating attacks of all. ” Between them, the aircraft and submarines they often directed to their targets sent 81 percent of Japan’s merchant ﬂeet to the bottom. As imports of raw ma- terials and energy declined, betw een 1941 and 1945
