them, the aircraft and submarines they often directed to their targets sent 81 percent of Japan’s merchant ﬂeet to the bottom. As imports of raw ma- terials and energy declined, betw een 1941 and 1945, Japanese industrial production fell by 80 percent.11 By this time the cream of the Imperial Navy’s aviators had been lost. As the Americans kept introducing more modern aircraft such as the F-  6 Hell- cat and the F-  4 Corsair, the Japanese  also found themselves technologically outclassed. The solution, which had some precedents in Japanese history, was to call for volunteers ready to serve their country by crashing their air- craft into American warships. Most were earnest young men of good fam- ilies. Some of the aircraft they ﬂew were  standard ﬁghters and dive-bombers modiﬁed for the purpose and packed with explosives; others had been spe- cially designed for the purpose, being made of wood and provided with162 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 162 Van, Creveld, Martin.

Training began in August 1944, and the ﬁrst attack clearly identiﬁed as such took place at Leyte Gulf in October of that year. From then on the number of kamikaze missions ﬂown increased, peaking in April–May 1945. At this point it went down—not because of any difficul- ties in recruiting volunteers, of which there were plenty, but because the Japanese General Staff had begun to husband aircraft in anticipation of an American invasion. Having received only rudimentary training, many volunteers made the mistake of going after all kinds of ships rather than focusing on the vital carriers. T o defend against the attack s, the carrier commanders themselves start
