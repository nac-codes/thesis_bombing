During three and a half years of war, their attempts in this direction were limited to launching paper balloons loaded with incendiaries so as to set California’s forests alight—with precious little success, as it turned out.14 Japan was a densely populated, heavi ly urbanized, industrialized country. It contained plenty of targets suitable for strategic bombing of the kind Trenchard, Douhet, and their U.S. successors had advocated. As early as 1943, the Joint T argeting Group ( JTG) in Washington, D.C. (some of whose members would be counted among the most prominent postwar defense officials and intellectuals), referred to these facts and recom- mended the use of incendiaries against Japan’s cities.15This was premature; though the United States had begun to build large numbers of four-engine bombers, such were distances in the Paciﬁc that those bombers were unable to reach the targets in question. True , in April 1942, sixteen B-25 light bombers took off from the carrier Hornet . Since they would not be able to land on it, though, it was planned th at they should ﬂy over Japan, drop their bombs, and proceed to China. The total distance to be covered was 2,400 miles, at the bombers’ extreme range; had it not been for a fortuitous tail- wind, they would not have made it at all. Even so, every single aircraft was lost, some after their crews had abandoned them and parachuted to safety, some after crash-landing
