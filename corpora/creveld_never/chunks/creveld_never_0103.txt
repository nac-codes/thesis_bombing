Even so, every single aircraft was lost, some after their crews had abandoned them and parachuted to safety, some after crash-landing at their destinations, and one after landing on neutral Soviet territory (the Soviet Union was not at war with Japan). Eleven crew members were killed or captured. The Doolittle Raid, as it was called after its commander, Colonel Jimmy Doolittle, created headlines in the United States, and indeed doing so seems to have been the real reason why it was mounted at all. Being unexpected, it lifted American morale— it showed that the United States could actually do something—and tem- porarily rattled that of the Japanese; yet materially its results were close to zero.16 After overcoming many teething problems, the new B-29 bombers reached operational status during the ﬁrst half of 1944.17These aircraft could reach Japan from airﬁelds in east China, and they started being used in that way in June–July of that year.

Even so, there was plenty to be done before the bombers could land and take off again. Runways had to be built—the heavy machines needed no less than one and a
