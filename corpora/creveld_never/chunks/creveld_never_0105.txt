Others, less polite, described him as a “hard-headed bastard. ”19 Having studied the situation, LeMay took the revolutionary step of switching from day to night op erations—thus jettisoning the doctrine preached and practiced by the Army Air Forces from the early 1930s on. Yet there was logic behind the madness. Since Japanese radar was rudimen- tary, night ﬂying meant that its ﬁghter defenses would ﬁnd it very difficult to engage the incoming bombers; so much so, in fact, that LeMay ordered his crews to remove their defensive armament, thus increasing the aircrafts’ range and enabling them to carry a greater weight of ordnance if so desired. The other change—one that also ran straight in the face of every tenet of strategic bombing ever since it had ﬁrst been practiced by the German Zep- pelins in 1915—was the decision to ﬂy low. Instead of trying to cope with what contemporaries called “hellacious” winds howling along at as much as 180 miles an hour, the bombers, roaring in at no more than 5,000–9,000 feet, would move at such high angular speed as to leave gunners on the ground with no time to respond.20 Thus reorganized, 346 heavy bombers took off on March 9 and headed for T okyo, which, at the time,
