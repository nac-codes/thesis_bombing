In the whole of Japan, only 300 were available. On this and subsequent occasions Japanese pilots did what they could but were overwhelmed. Though LeMay may not have been familiar with the conclusions of the JTG in Washington,21he had loaded his aircraft with incendiaries. Almost 2,000 tons were released. So intensive was the resulting heat wave that it buffeted some aircraft—which, empty, turned the scales at 34 tons each—to a height of 1,500 feet above their predetermined course. The city, which until then had only suffered some 1,300 dead, became a blazing inferno in which at least 83,000 people perished. That was about equal to the ﬁgure that re- sulted from the destruction of Hamburg and Dresden combined. By the end of March, Nagoya, Japan’s third largest city, as well as Osaka and Kobe, had shared T okyo’s fate. Detailed calculations determined how many bombs were needed to set what area aﬁre; as one observer wrote, it166 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 166 Van, Creveld, Martin.

In April there was a pause. Partly this was because LeMay had run out of ammunition; partly because, like Harris before him, he was made by his superiors to diver
