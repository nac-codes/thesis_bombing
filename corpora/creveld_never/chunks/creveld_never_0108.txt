The amount of ordnance dropped increased from 13,000 tons in March to 42,000 in July; had hostilities not come to an end, by September it would have risen to 100,000. All this had to be done on or from island bases that could pro- vide practically nothing by way of food, supplies, or even simple accom- modations. Everything had to be transported from the American homeland, which was thousands of miles away. Losses, too, were anything but light, amounting to no fewer th an 309 machines between January and August. It is indicative of how weak Japan’s anti-aircraft defenses had be- come that two-thirds of these resulted from accidents. Yet since each B-29 carried a price tag of $600,000—the 2009 equivalent of $11,000,000—that was scant consolation; indeed developing the aircraft cost as much as build- ing the ﬁrst atom bomb did.
