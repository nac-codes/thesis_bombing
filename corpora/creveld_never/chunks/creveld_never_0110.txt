Though they did not know it, the inhabitants of the two doomed cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were also being prepared for the ordeal. Both cities were of some importance as manufacturing centers, depots, and em- barkation ports. Hitherto they had been spared speciﬁcally so that the ﬁrst atom bombs could be tested on them and the precise results studied in de- tail. On the evening of August 5, the American crews were briefed amid heavy security. Tibbets’s plane, which he had dubbed Enola Gay after his mother, took off at 0245 on August 6. Six hours later, at 0840 in the morn- ing, it was ﬂying at 32,000 feet over Hiroshima. Earlier the city had been reconnoitered by a weather plane, which made sure everything was clear. The unintended result was to convince many people on the ground that the second American aircraft was nothing very dangerous, a fact that may well have prevented them from taking shelter and thus helped increase the number of casualties. Now everythin g worked just as planned; the bomb doors opened and Little Boy dropped out. Fifty-seven seconds later, having reached approximately 2,000 feet, it exploded. By that time Enola Gay was already 11.5 miles away and escaping as fast as it could. Even so, it was badly buffeted by the shock wave and the crew, afraid of being blinded, had to use goggles to observe their handiwork. As the doomed city disappeared under a mushroom cloud that rose to 60,000 feet, 75,000 people lay dead or dying. Later on, another estimated 75,000 died of their injuries or else as a result of the radiation they had re- ceived. Within a radius of one mile from point zero, only a few steel-framed buildings, built to resist earthquakes, remained standing. Yet even that was not the end of the horror. Three days later the second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Though it was considerably more powerful than the ﬁrst, thanks to the hilly topography the number of immediate casualties was considerably smaller. So terrible were the death and
