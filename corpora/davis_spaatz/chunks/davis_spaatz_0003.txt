th the Luftwaffe effectively paralyzed, Spaatz moved against bridges, ports, railyards, and roads and, finally, crushed the Nazi war economy. The Anglo-American partnership, although triumphant in the end, was not easy. Its lines of authority were frequently and hotly debated. Through portraits of major Allied civilian and military personalities, this study describes several contentious interactions around which Spaatz maneuvered adroitly to achieve his broad military objectives. Author Richard Davis contrasts American and British grand strategy, battle tactics, and operations, laying bare the political considerations that necessarily influenced Allied planning. He demonstrates how clashes among only a few individuals can profoundly affect command decisions and the successful pro- secution of coalition warfare. Lessons contained in his study have implications even now in the post-Desert Storm era. That the Air Force today is able to pro- ject global strength is due in large measure to the foresight and tenacity of Carl Spaatz, who freed air power to become the dominant force of modern warfare.
