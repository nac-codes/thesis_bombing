ir Force Historical Foundation   ## p. vii (#9) ##############################################  Introduction This study is an expansion of a doctoral dissertation I began in 1982. Initially I sought to tell the story of the air war in Europe from a new perspec- tive-that of the senior U.S. Army Air Forces (AAF) officer in the theater, General Carl A. Spaatz. Little did I realize the magnitude of the task. I discov- ered a man who had stood close to the central events of the conflict in Europe. Without Spaatz and his insistence on bombing the German oil industry, the war in Europe might have lasted several more months. Spaatz commanded more men than Patton or Rommel ever led. By the end of May 1945 his forces could deliver more destructive power than any force before the advent of nuclear weapons. Thus, an understanding of the part Spaatz played in the victory of the Allied coalition is necessary to any serious study of World War II. In the course of investigating Spaatz's activities during the war, I soon real- ized that many of the conventional interpretations of the role of the U.S. Army Air Forces in Europe sprang from the immediate post-World War II era when the AAF was in the last rounds of its fight to gain independence from the U.S. Army. As a consequence, early U.S. air historians tended to downplay the short- comings of air power and to emphasize the advantages of centralized command of air power by airmen operating autonomously. In this work I have attempted to present a more balanced view of the effectiveness of air power. By its very nature this study of the military life of Carl A. Spaatz is virtually a history of U.S. military aviation from its beginnings to the end of World War II in Europe. To place Spaatz in the context of his times, I found it necessary to examine the development of U.S. military aviation thought and technology.
