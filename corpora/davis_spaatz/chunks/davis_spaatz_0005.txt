y to examine the development of U.S. military aviation thought and technology. From his tour as Commandant of the Issoudun Pursuit Training Center in France in 1917, where he first displayed his skills as an administrator and trainer of men, through his service as special observer during the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940, Spaatz's career reflected the continual changes in air power. Immediately after World War I, Spaatz commanded the sole pursuit group stationed in the continental United States and led the flight of its air elements from Texas to Michigan without the loss of a man or machine (no mean feat in 1922). Once in Michigan, he established his group at Selfridge Field, which had been abandoned two years earlier. Leaving Selfridge in 1924, he attended the Air Corps Tactical School at Langley Field near Norfolk, Virginia. At that time and place the school was far removed from the future period of intellectual and doctrinal ferment in which it produced the American theory of daylight precision bombing. Next, Spaatz served in Washington, D.C., in the Air Service's Training and Operations Section. There he testified as a defense wit- ness in the controversial court-martial of Brig. Gen. William "Billy" Mitchell. vii   ## p. viii (#10) ############################################  INTRODUCTION During the late 1920s and 1930s Spaatz switched from commanding fighters to commanding bombers-a career move that mirrored the Air Corps' change in emphasis from pursuit to bombardment aviation. At the same time, he absorbed the new theories that preached the ability of the heavily armed bomber, flying a tight defensive formation, to penetrate successfully deep into enemy territory to destroy vital economic targets and to return, all the while unescorted by friendly fighter aircraft. Even subsequent firsthand experience of the British and German failure to bomb effectively in daylight failed to persuade him to modify his belief in unescorted bombing. Before U.S. en
