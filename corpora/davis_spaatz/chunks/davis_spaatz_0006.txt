ghter aircraft. Even subsequent firsthand experience of the British and German failure to bomb effectively in daylight failed to persuade him to modify his belief in unescorted bombing. Before U.S. entry into World War II, Spaatz, as Chief of the Air Corps Plans Section and, upon the formation of the AAF in June 1941, as first Chief of the Air Staff, helped to plan and supervise the vast expansion of U.S. military air power. On July 1, 1939, the Air Corps had a force of 1,239 combat aircraft, 570 training planes, 20,191 enlisted men, 633 aviation cadets, and 2,502 officers. Many of the aircraft were obsolescent; there were no advanced training aircraft; and all but 45 of the officers were rated pilots. Thirty-two months later, on March 1, 1942, the AAF had 2,393 combat aircraft (2,182 rated as modern), 10,087 trainers (2,541 advanced), 312,405 enlisted men, 32,896 cadets, and 27,446 officers (13,631 nonpilots).1 These figures represented an increase of more than 1,000 percent in every category except combat aircraft, which increased only 200 percent. With the onset of war, Spaatz took command of the Eighth Air Force and helped prepare a base capable of sustaining the thousands of planes scheduled to operate against Germany from Britain. After Spaatz had launched only a handful of heavy-bomber missions against nearby French targets, however, Lt. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower summoned Spaatz to the North African Theater to advise him and, eventually, to command all Allied air power there. In North Africa the organizational chaos of his geographically scattered command tested his logistical and organizational abilities to the utmost, but by the finish of the Allies' campaign against the Axis forces in Tunisia, Spaatz had produced a well-run, efficient force. Also in North Africa, he played a signifi- cant role in solving the dispute between the Army ground and air elements about the effectiveness of the AAF's handling of close air support. The fall of Tunisia led to the Al
