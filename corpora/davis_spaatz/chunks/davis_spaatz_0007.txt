ca, he played a signifi- cant role in solving the dispute between the Army ground and air elements about the effectiveness of the AAF's handling of close air support. The fall of Tunisia led to the Allied invasion of Sicily and Italy and a period of frustration for Spaatz. After overseeing the reduction of the Island of Pantelleria by air power, Spaatz saw his influence on operations decline as Eisenhower increasingly relied on British Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder. In the summer and autumn of 1943, Spaatz concentrated on perfecting the organi- zation of the AAF in the Mediterranean and on obtaining and establishing a new strategic American air force to operate against Germany from its unprotected southern flank. At the end of 1943, Spaatz left Italy for London where he assumed com- mand of the two American strategic air forces operating against the Germans. viii   ## p. ix (#11) ##############################################  INTRODUCTION As the strategic air commander, he made his two most decisive contributions to Allied victory. With the help of an influx of long-range fighter-escort aircraft, he launched, in the first five months of 1944, an intensive counter-air campaign that emasculated the Luftwaffe fighter force. By the time of the invasion of Normandy, the German air force no longer had the strength to interfere with the invasion or to defend German industry from each large American bomber mis- sion. Shortly before the invasion, Spaatz, after a long policy struggle within the Allied coalition, began a strategic bombing campaign against the German oil industry. This campaign damaged vital cogs of the Nazi war machine by grounding a large portion of the Luftwaffe starving it of aviation fuel, and by impairing the mobility of the Wehrmacht, leaving it almost helpless to counter the maneuvers of its enemies. Under Spaatz's leadership, in the autumn and winter of 1944â€“1945, the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF) helped to bring the German war econ-
