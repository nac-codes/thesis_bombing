at the Center for Air Force History, shared his research on North Africa and helped to refine the treatment of several topics. Patrick E. Murray, Chief Historian, Third Air Force, England, made a special trip to the Imperial War Museum in London to locate photographs. Other colleagues with the Center for Air Force History deserve special credit, having learned more about Spaatz than they probably ever wished to. Jacob Neufeld, Director of the Center for Air Force History, gave me gen- erous amounts of time to work on the manuscript. Dr. Richard I. Wolf proofread large sections of the manuscript and helped me with printers and word processors. Two very hard working and professional editors, Mary Lee Jefferson of the Center for Air Force History and Priscilla Taylor of Editorial Experts, Inc., spent many hours smoothing my prose and forcing me to clarify, in as few words as possible, points and concepts I had glossed over or abbreviated. Ms. Jefferson then patiently shepherded the book through the publishing process, coordinating the efforts of many others. Dr. Alfred M. Beck, Chief, Histories Division, corrected my haphazard German spelling. Editor David R. Chenoweth designed and typeset the statistical appendices. Anne E. Johnson, Chief, Editorial Services, lent moral and technical support in the last phases of publication. Members of the Graphics Office for the Air Force District of Washington made outstanding contributions. Susan Linders, Chief, Conventional Graphics, oversaw production of the book's artwork. Bruce John and Protean Gibril prepared the maps; Tracy Miller prepared the charts. Kathy Jones finalized all illustrations, and Lori Crane, designed the cover. xi   ## p. xii (#14) #############################################  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Professor Charles J.
