In fact, Spaatz maintained a rumpled look throughout his career. Rumor has it that on his graduation day he was still walking punishment tours. He never gained cadet rank, remaining a "cleansleeve" for his four years at the Point. What interested him—bridge, poker, and the guitar-he pursued vig- orously. His classmates especially relished his repertoire of risqué songs. The Howitzer, the West Point yearbook, caricatured him with guitar in hand. The editors commented on his silent demeanor, noted his ability to recite with confi- dence on a subject he had not read, and spoke of his indifference to demerits and “independent attitude generally.”6 By his graduation on June 12, 1914, his inde- pendence, taciturnity, and impatience with stultifying routine had become fixed. He had also acquired a permanent nickname, “Tooey," because of a chance resemblance to upperclassman, Francis J. Toohey. Spaatz left the Academy determined to become a flyer. In his third month at West Point, on May 29, 1910, he had seen Glenn Curtiss fly by on a 150-mile trip from Albany to New York City. (Curtiss stopped only once to refuel, thereby setting a new world record of 87 miles nonstop flight.)7 The sight so impressed Spaatz that he then and there decided to fly.8 In 1914 the U.S. Army's few aircraft belonged to the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps. Before Spaatz could join the Signal Corps he was required to serve one year in a line or combat unit. On joining the 25th Infantry Regiment at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, he served in an all-black infantry company. Thirty years later, he testified to the Gillem Board, which was investigating the place of the black soldier in the post- World War II armed forces, "I must say that I enjoyed that year of service with that outfit as much as any year of service I have ever had-as a white officer in
