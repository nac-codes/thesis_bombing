Barracks and shops were of the crudest construction, and the rainy season had started before roads were in place, making the center a sea of mud. On the flying field, mud churned up by aircraft wheels broke propeller blades as fast as they could be replaced. The cen- ter had no machine shops or material to erect them.14 The morale of all personnel under these conditions plummeted. Primary training cadets, who had joined the Army Air Service for the romance of flying, particularly resented their lot at Issoudun, which had no facilities for primary or introductory flight training. The center had to accept the primary cadets because the French and British initial training schools could not find space for them. When pressed into laboring on the center's essential construction projects, they reacted with little enthusiasm.15 This was the initial situation that confronted Spaatz, who had no training in aviation instruction and had never flown a mod- ern service plane. He spent most of the next nine and one-half months either as commanding officer of the school or as the officer in charge of training. Spaatz did his job well. By the time he left in September 1918, Issoudun had become the largest training field in the world and the Army Air Service's chief facility for training pursuit or fighter pilots. It had 14 airfields, 84 hangars, and numerous ware- houses, shops, and barracks.16 The machine shops could completely overhaul more than 100 engines a week (each requiring at least 100 man-hours) and rebuild from salvaged parts 20 aircraft a week (each plane required 32 man- days). The school averaged 500 to 600 flying hours a day. In all, it graduated 766
