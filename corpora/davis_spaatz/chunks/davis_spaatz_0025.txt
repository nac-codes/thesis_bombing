In all, it graduated 766 pursuit pilots.17 This accomplishment was not without cost; Issoudun suf- fered 56 training fatalities during Spaatz's tenure. In August 1918, for example, 17 students died.18 In all, the Army Air Service suffered 128 combat fatalities and 244 training fatalities in France and 262 training fatalities in the United States. 19 Spaatz also reestablished discipline. One of his trainees recalled fifty years later, "The students all thought he was a stiff necked little German," adding, "but he was fair, and that's all you can expect out of a good officer."20 The assignment gave Spaatz invaluable experience as a trainer and adminis- trator of a fledgling air force. He had successfully accomplished his assign- ment-so successfully, in fact, that Brig. Gen. William "Billy" Mitchell, one of Pershing's chief aviation officers, wanted to return him to the United States to upgrade Air Service training there. Instead, Spaatz, not known for his loqua- ciousness, spoke up. He wangled permission for two weeks at the front with the 1st Pursuit Group, which included the 94th Aero (Hat-in-the-Ring) Squadron, one of whose members was Maj. Edward "Eddie" V. Rickenbacker. Rickenbacker, who ended the war as the highest-ranking American ace, with twenty-six kills, had served at Issoudun under Spaatz for several months. When Spaatz arrived, he found the 1st Pursuit out of the line and not flying 6   ## p. 7 (#31) ###############################################  EARLY CAREER combat missions, so he went on to the 13th Aero Squadron, 2nd Pursuit Group.21 Upon his arrival, Spaatz won over the outfit's pilots, mostly second and first lieutenants who had first entered combat five weeks before his arrival, by removing his major's insignia of rank and becoming one of them.22 When his first two weeks wer
