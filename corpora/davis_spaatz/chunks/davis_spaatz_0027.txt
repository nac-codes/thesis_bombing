By the end of World War I, many air officers, such as Mitchell and Foulois, had become dissatisfied with the place of aviation in the Army. They had encoun- tered too many officers who had gained command of air units without the least knowledge of aviation or who, worse still, had no appreciation of aviation's potential.28 Other officers, such as Arnold, had found little sympathy or support from War Department bureaucrats in Washington.29 Nor did Secretary of War Newton D.

At the time of the postwar congressional hearings on the place of air power within the military establishment, Spaatz said, "My own feel- ing was all in favor of getting it out of the Signal Corps. . . . I wanted air force on the same level as infantry."31 Within a few years, Spaatz and many other Army air officers wanted not just autonomy within the Army but independence from it. In 1919 Spaatz began the typical treadmill existence of an American officer between the world wars-repeated changes of post, lack of public regard, low 7   ## p. 8 (#32) ###############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE pay, and agonizingly slow promotion. Although from 1918 to 1920 he changed posts twenty times,32 he had two advantages over some of his fellow officers- flight pay, a cause of much jealousy among non-flying officers, and seniority as a major. For all but three months of the next seventeen years, when he temporar- ily became a captain, Spaatz remained a major, unlike many of his compatriots who lost their wartime ranks and toiled for years as captains or even lieutenants. The U.S. Army filled its officer ranks by means of an unmodified seniority system. A thorough knowledge of the workings of the Army promotion sys
