and toiled for years as captains or even lieutenants. The U.S. Army filled its officer ranks by means of an unmodified seniority system. A thorough knowledge of the workings of the Army promotion system provides a key to understanding the position of the Air Service and of Spaatz within the Army.* The promotion list, a conservative personnel system long in use throughout the world's civil and military services, worked strictly by senior- ity or time in grade. Unlike many foreign services, which limited the unmodified seniority list to captain and below, the U.S. Army's system extended up through colonel.33 Each commissioned officer entered the U.S. Army officer corps as the most junior 2d lieutenant and, if he lived long enough, advanced to colonel as the men on the list ahead of him left the service. Considerations of merit or abil- ity did not modify one's relative position on the list, and there was no selection scheme to advance deserving and active officers over the heads of the superan- nuated. The system provided for voluntary retirement at thirty years of service and mandatory retirement at age sixty-four. The list did not apply to general officers' promotions, which were by selection. Strict adherence to the promotion list had the advantage of allowing every officer to know his promotion prospects precisely and gave assurance that there could be no favoritism or nepotism. In practice, of course, the choice assign- ments still went to the favorites who had the rank to qualify for them. The disad- vantages of the system included lack of reward for initiative and ability, slow promotion, and bureaucratic routine. Before World War I, each branch within the U.S. Army (such as cavalry, infantry, artillery, and quartermaster) had maintained its own separate promotion list, so some officers were promoted faster than others of equal ability and time of service. To remedy this perceived flaw, Congress, in the National Defense Act of 1920, combined all Regular Army p
