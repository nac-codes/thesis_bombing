list, so some officers were promoted faster than others of equal ability and time of service. To remedy this perceived flaw, Congress, in the National Defense Act of 1920, combined all Regular Army promotion lists into a single list, pro- viding that no officer would hold a relative position on the combined list lower than the one he held on his branch list at the time of the bill's passage. In the same act Congress established the Air Service as a separate branch within the Army; specified that at all times 90 percent of its officers must be rated flyers, balloonists, or observers; and required that all command positions be filled by rated officers. *The air branch of the U.S. Army underwent three name changes from 1919 to 1941: from 1919 through the first half of 1926 it was officially the Army Air Service; from July 1926 through June 1941 it was the Army Air Corps; and from June 1941 to September 1947 it was the Army Air Forces. 8   ## p. 9 (#33) ###############################################  EARLY CAREER These provisions created a closed shop. Officers elsewhere in the Army could not transfer into the Air Service unless they passed flight training. Such a switch proved difficult for field-grade officers (major and above). Their age (mid-thirties, at best) and the extremely high physical standards for pilots almost guaranteed failure to gain a rating. Hence accretions to the Air Service's and Air Corps' Regular Army officer ranks came, for the most part, at the 2d lieutenant grade, from West Point graduates and from Reserve Officers, Flying Cadets, and enlisted pilots earning regular commissions. So stringent were the air branch's physical standards that only the finest specimens entered its training programs. Men who flew in open, unheated cock- pits at altitudes well over 10,000 feet at all times of the year, without oxygen, in aircraft lacking most types of power-assisted controls required extraordinary stamina. The air branch's basic and advanced flight tr
