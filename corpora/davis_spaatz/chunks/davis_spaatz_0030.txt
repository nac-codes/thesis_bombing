well over 10,000 feet at all times of the year, without oxygen, in aircraft lacking most types of power-assisted controls required extraordinary stamina. The air branch's basic and advanced flight training eliminated a large percentage of would-be pilots. On the average, about 40 percent of each entering class completed both stages of training, although in some classes as few as 25 percent graduated. Charles A. Lindbergh, who underwent flight training in 1924, recalled that only 17 of 103 members of his class completed training, and the Air Corps passed only 128 of 592 students in fiscal 1928.34 Moreover, from 1921 to 1938, 95 flying cadets died in air accidents.35 Because the Air Service (and its predecessors) had existed only since 1907, it had had no time to develop its own higher-ranking officers. Even Hap Arnold, Maj. Gen. Mason Patrick, Chief of the Air Service, and Brig. Gen.

In July 1923, Arnold was the fifteenth-ranking major in the Air Service but only 909th of 2,250 majors in the entire Army. At the same time Spaatz was the 88th ranking major (of 89) in the Air Service and stood 2,207 on the majors list. It took Arnold almost nine years to reach lieutenant colonel (February 1932) and Spaatz more than twelve years (September 1935) to advance through the entire major's portion of the list to lieutenant colonel. The Army's air branch had a much lower percentage of field-grade officers than the remainder of the Army. (See Table 1, Distribution of Regular Army Rank in the Air Service and Air Corps Compared with the Army as a Whole 1922-1941.) From 1923 to 1935, the Air Corps had an average of less than 11 percent of its Regular Army officers in field grades. The remainder of the Army avera
