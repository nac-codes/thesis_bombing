ed their commissions only after they had completed flight training. They were thus well behind the men who joined other branches and earned their commissions months earlier. In the interwar period this placed a large percent- age of Air Corps junior-grade officers at the bottom of the promotion list, with little prospect of ever reaching field grade. In 1930, 400 of the 494 Regular Army first lieutenants in the Air Corps had wartime experience.41 The most senior of them would have to advance 3,800 places through the captains' ranks and one-third of the way through the entire list to reach majorâ€”a daunting prospect. The effect on the entering second lieutenants, who could not even make captain until the hump cleared, also must have been dramatic. The limited promotion potential coupled with the lack of personnel turnover contributed to the aging of the small officer corps. (Table 2 for the year 1931, the mid-point between the wars, illustrates the interwar relation between age and rank.) It was no wonder that the bulk of resignations from the whole officer corps, not just the air branch, consisted of junior-grade officers. From 1924 through 1933, 3 colonels, 8 lieutenant colonels, 81 majors, 239 captains, 231 first lieutenants, and 391 second lieutenants resigned from the Regular Army, an average of 95 a year from a force of approximately 12,000.42 As always, those with the least invested in the service and the worst prospects of advancement were most likely to resign. Well over 90 percent of the officer corps chose to stay with the colors. The officer corps as a whole formed a conservative, all-white society removed from the mainstream of American life. Postings to isolated forts and bases, lives spent in the military ghetto of officers' on-base housing, a promotion policy of glacial slowness, and a professional ethos that led to concentration on the techni- cal aspects of their work and to the avoidance of participation in the partisan civilian world accounted for
