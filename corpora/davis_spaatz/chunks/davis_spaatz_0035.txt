icy of glacial slowness, and a professional ethos that led to concentration on the techni- cal aspects of their work and to the avoidance of participation in the partisan civilian world accounted for much of the Regular Army officers' segregation. The officers of the Air Service and Corps formed a small band of brothers set apart even from the officer corps at large.* They numbered no larger than the student body of a medium-size urban high school and they spent much of their careers in small groups of a few dozen or less on primitive airfields. Their agita- * Regular officers left the air branch by three routes: death, resignation, or retirement. Only a sta- tistically insignificant number of them were dismissed or discharged. From 1925 through 1935, 131 regular officers died in air crashes, 35 died of other causes, 126 resigned, and 72 retired. At the same time, the air branch grew from 913 regular officers to 1,303. As one would expect, retirements were concentrated in the years after 1928 (70 of 72), as senior officers who joined the service at the time of the Spanish-American War and later reached retirement age departed. Resignations peaked in 1930, with 27, as the junior officers resigned to join the newly established commercial airlines, and trailed off drastically during the Depression; only 16 regular officers resigned from 1931 to 1935. Figures were compiled from the Annual Reports of the Chief of the Air Corps, 1921-1935. 12   ## p. 13 (#37) ##############################################  Table 2 Age and Rank of the U.S. Army Officer Corps, 1931 Age Maj Gen Brig Gen Col Lt Col Maj Capt 1st Lt 2d Lt Total 64 2 63 2 62 1 61 1 60 1 59 4 58 1 57 5 56 2 55 54 13557647214 8 11 19 24 25 18 36 122 1 1 1 34 4 1 1 32 9 5 60 41 4 5 9 1 70 42 7 13 7 74 60 12 11 16 65 21 10 15 64 23 26 22 43 44 19 20 53 28 57 18 35 52229 116 117 138 132 147 52 1 12 70 15 40 11 149 51 1 50 49 129 6 33 24 53 6 123 75 22 50 7 156 77 54 70 7 209 48 49 50 84 9 192 47 31 77 56 14 178 46 12
