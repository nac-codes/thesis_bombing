Although the leading cause of accidental death* for the entire Army from 1927 to 1936 was automobile acci- dents (660), the second leading cause of death was airplane accidents (459)44___ a category confined to only one branch of the service. (See Table 3, Flight Accident Statistics, 1921-1938.) This danger exclusively to themselves, their low positions on the promotion list, and their mutual participation in an exhila- rating, yet highly technical, occupation bound the air officers together. Understandably the division of the budget and other service resources cre- ated some of the fiercest tension in the Army. From 1920 to 1934, the total cost of Army aviation ranged between 13.1 and 22.7 percent of the Army budget, averaging 18.2 percent a year. This included not only direct appropriations to the air arm but also indirect expenses such as pay, quartermaster and medical ser- vices, ordnance
