Aside from the honor, the rating entitled Spaatz to a flight pay of 75 percent of base pay, an emolument he continued to draw even after the National Defense Act of 1920 limited all flight pay, except for distinguished Military Aviators, to 50 percent.

They per- suaded the chef of a San Francisco hotel to prepare the first egg to be laid and fried in flight. On the day of the great Egg Festival at Petaluma, the chicken cap- ital of California, Tooey and the chef added a prize hen to the crew and headed back for the bay area. They arrived sans poulet-the hen jumped ship at several hundred feet and dived into San Francisco Bay. But the fligh
