al manuals, which were approved by the ground officers who dominated the War Department General Staff, paid little attention to the planning or conduct of strategic bombing. Instead, they concentrated on bombardment's role in ground operations. Attack aviation would conduct low-level attacks with heavy machine guns, cannon, and bombs against battlefield targets. Airmen who believed such low-level attacks would expend both men and machines to little purpose were overruled by ground officers who valued front-line morale-boosting missions against immediate tactical targets. 62 Spaatz took Mitchell's theories to heart. In February 1922, he wrote to the Chief of the Air Service that he conceived of four distinct types of pursuit mis- sions-offensive, defensive, night, and attack-each requiring a plane of differ- ent design.63 As commander of the only pursuit group, he participated in the writing of several pursuit training and tactical manuals, including overall pursuit aviation training regulations, as well as regulations for the pursuit pilot, squadron, group, and wing.64 In only one case did Spaatz envisage the employment of pur- suit in an exclusively defensive role. â€œThe first bomb dropped by an enemy on 17   ## p. 18 (#42) ##############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE  A snow-covered ramp at Selfridge Field filled with Boeing and Curtiss pursuits.

Spaatz noted, however, that defensive pur- suit would be anything but defensive once airborne.65 When asked to com- ment on the attack aviation manuals, Spaatz indicated that "pursuit forces should not accompany the attack forces in the manner of an escort but should be concentrated over the objective of the attack at the time the attack forces arrive to deliver the attack." Spaatz added, "The attack forces must b
