Spaatz added, "The attack forces must be pre- pared to disperse a small force of the enemy pursuit which may molest them on their way to and from the objective."66 It is important not to make too much of the influence of this early thinking on his subsequent actions, but it seems that Spaatz was at least predisposed to accept a doctrine that called for loose escort of bombers by fighters and aggressive employment of fighter air- craft at all times. While serving in Michigan, Spaatz had his first encounter with "drop tanks," jettisonable aviation fuel tanks carried externally by fighter aircraft. He ob- served, "This arrangement, of course, permits pursuit to penetrate to much greater depth without destroying its characteristics."67 Here was part of the solu- tion to the long-range fighter-escort problem that would plague Spaatz and other bomber commanders twenty years later. Spaatz had recognized one piece of the long-range escort puzzle, but, like most other Air Corps officers, he was unable to fit that piece into place, to fully realize that drop tanks would give an aircraft of fighter performance a bomber's range. Spaatz left the 1st Pursuit Group in 1924 to attend his branch of service's 18   ## p. 19 (#43) ##############################################  EARLY CAREER professional school, the Air Service Tactical School at Langley Field, near Norfolk, Virginia, where he had time for reflection-especially when he was hospitalized for a neck abscess that almost led to blood poisoning. While at Langley, he kept a diary, a practice he would not resume until he went to England in May 1940. Spaatz, in an introspective mood, attributed the death of one of his classmates in an air accident in part to reflexes slowed by age. Thirty- three years old at the time, he himself had just had a close call and wondered whe
