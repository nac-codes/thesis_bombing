replied that, where gun- nery was involved, the squadron commanders were at fault. Howze continued, "Is there anybody higher up than the commander of this unit who is responsible for the gunnery work?" Spaatz responded, "Well, in the case of the First Pursuit Group [his old command], the commander of the VI Corps Area has charge of it." Spaatz's pointed rejoinder drew the blood of the VI Corps Area Commander, who happened to be a member of the court. Maj. Gen. William S.

William Mitchell addressing his court-martial, Washington, D.C., October 28, 1925. Siberia, 1918-1919, asked whether his office had ever denied help to the air squadron. Spaatz responded that when the people of Oscoda, Michigan, had offered to rent a gunnery practice field to the Air Service for a dollar a year, he had had trouble persuading the War Department to pay. The crowd laughed, but Graves won the point when Spaatz was unable to recall specifically which office had delayed the matter. Neither Spaatz's nor Arnold's testimony swayed the court, which was even less impressed with Mitchell's decision to conduct an all-out defense designed to take advantage of the circus atmosphere engendered by the trial's heavy press coverage. The court-martial suspended Mitchell from active duty for five years, and he resigned.72 The statements Spaatz made at the court-martial illustrate the intensity of his convictions about preparedness and the status of the Air Service. Despite warn- ings that his appearance might jeopardize his career, Spaatz, who believed in loyalty up and loyalty down, supported Mitchell. He displayed equal amounts of courage and tactlessness in bluntly describing Air Service conditions and in fix- ing responsibility for them. Spaatz later commented, "They can't do anything to you when you're under oath and tell them answers to their questions."73
