ly describing Air Service conditions and in fix- ing responsibility for them. Spaatz later commented, "They can't do anything to you when you're under oath and tell them answers to their questions."73 21   ## p. 22 (#46) ##############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE During his first tour in Washington, D.C., Spaatz demonstrated another unusual facet of his character, his respect for the independence and intelligence of women. Although anything but a ladykiller or a Don Juan, Spaatz liked and appreciated women. As the father of three daughters and no sons he became used to living in a feminine household and he endured much good-natured teas- ing about his "harem." He developed many deep friendships with remarkable women in the course of his career. While in Washington, he encouraged his wife to accept what was then a remarkable opportunity. For three years Ruth Spaatz became the member of a professional standing acting troupe at the National Theater. She eventually played leading roles. Given society's attitudes toward working mothers and actresses, Spaatz's support of his wife seems all the more unusual.74 Later, he would be one of the first and most enthusiastic supporters of the Women's Army Corps (WAC), in World War II. In fact, his executive offi- cer for most of World War II was a WAC, which made him probably the only officer of his rank in the U.S. armed services to have a woman serving in such a role. Spaatz continued on staff duties until the end of 1928, when he received orders to command the 7th Bombardment Group at Rockwell Field in southern California. One of his first actions there involved a publicity stunt conceived by a close friend, Capt. Ira C. Eaker. Eaker proposed to set a new world record in flight endurance. In the moderate, predictable weather of southern California the flight would be safer, less stressful, and free of weather-imposed interference. There was also easy access to the media in nearby Hollywood.
