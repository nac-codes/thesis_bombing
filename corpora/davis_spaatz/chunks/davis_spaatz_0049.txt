Quesada headed for calmer weather over the ocean while the other crew members removed Spaatz's clothes and rubbed him down to prevent 22   ## p. 23 (#47) ##############################################  EARLY CAREER burns. Spaatz told them, "If I'm burned and have to bail out you keep this plane in the air, and that's an order."77 When refueling recommenced, the unharmed major, clad only in a parachu
