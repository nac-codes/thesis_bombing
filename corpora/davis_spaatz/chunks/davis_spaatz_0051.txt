He set up more than adequate refueling and resupply arrangements and showed his intense desire to fulfill his duty—even at risk to himself. The drive to complete a task, in spite of obstacles, was his hallmark. After three years at Rockwell Field, Spaatz assumed command of the 1st Bombardment Wing at March Field in Riverside, California. From California, Spaatz traveled back to the Potomac in 1933 where he served for two years as Chief of the Training and Operations Division in the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps (OCAC).

This attitude earned him an unfa- vorable recommendation for any further training in general staff or high com- mand duty.83 The scho
