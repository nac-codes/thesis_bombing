In March 1939, under the pressure of rearmament and possible war in Europe, both GHQ Air Force and the Office of the Chief of Air Corps became directly responsible to the Chief of the Air Corps. Technology and doctrine both underwent considerable changes in the post- Mitchell Air Corps. Spaatz, who had started the 1920s as one of the Air Service's pursuit (fighter) experts, ended the 1920s and spent most of the 1930s as a bombardment commander, first as Commanding Officer (CO), 7th Bom- bardment Group, from May 1929 to October 1931; then as CO, 1st Bomb Wing, 25   ## p. 26 (#50) ##############################################   The Question Mark Flight, January 1929.

This change in the tech- nical focus of Spaatz's career reflected the changes in aircraft and philosophy that influenced the Air Corps in the 1930s. Between 1930 and 1932, two fast, all-metal, monoplane twin-engine bombers entered the Air Corps inventory, the Boeing B-9 and the Martin B-10.
