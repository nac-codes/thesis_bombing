and 1932, two fast, all-metal, monoplane twin-engine bombers entered the Air Corps inventory, the Boeing B-9 and the Martin B-10. The B-10, with a speed of 207 mph and a ceiling of 21,000 feet, outclassed any other bomber then in use in the world and most of the fighters as well. No sooner had the B-10 entered production than the Air Corps accepted bids on a newer generation of bombers, which resulted in the B-17. The B-17 weighed 35,000 pounds (compared with the B-10's 9,000), and had four engines and a service ceiling of 30,000 feet. At 14,000 feet, at a top speed of 250 mph it could carry 2,500 pounds of bombs 2,260 miles. The prototype model first flew in August 1935, yet the B-17, suitably modified and upgraded, remained a first line bomber in the AAF fleet until the end of World War II.84 As bombardment aviation prospered, pursuit aviation languished. The Air Corps, squeezed with limited funding, concentrated its appropriations on bomber development. The B-10 and the B-17 appeared not to need escort against enemy fighters. Also, the B-17 could attack an enemy before he came within range of sensitive American targets. With the enemy held at arm's length, the value of a large force of defensive fighters depreciated. As a result, the 1931-1935 period was the nadir of U.S. pursuit aviation and pursuit airframe development. The Air Corps' top fighter, the P-26, had an open cockpit, nonretractable landing gear, a range of 360 miles, and a top speed of 235 mph. This lag in development left the United States almost a full generation of fighter aircraft behind the world's other major aviation powers.85 The most outspoken advocate of pursuit aviation in the service, Capt. Claire Chennault, head of pursuit instruction at the Air Corps Tactical School (which had moved in July 1931 from Langley Field to Maxwell Field in Alabama, just outside Montgomery), fought for a more balanced doctrine. He emphasized both the offensive and the defensive nature of fighter aircraft. Con
