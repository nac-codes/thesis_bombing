y 1931 from Langley Field to Maxwell Field in Alabama, just outside Montgomery), fought for a more balanced doctrine. He emphasized both the offensive and the defensive nature of fighter aircraft. Contending that pursuit aircraft could successfully intercept and destroy bombers as well as enemy fight- ers, he enunciated four major principles: force. 1. Attainment of air supremacy depends upon the success of the pursuit 2. The primary function of pursuit is to gain air supremacy. 3. The first objective of pursuit is to destroy enemy pursuit. 4. Success of pursuit depends upon equipment, selection and training of pilots, numbers, tactics, and organization in units large enough to provide effec- tive concentration of force.86 His pleading did not convince the leaders of the Air Corps, who distrusted him. Chennault retired on the grounds of ill health in 1937 and subsequently led a volunteer American pursuit unit, the American Volunteer Group, known as the 28   ## p. 29 (#53) ##############################################  EARLY CAREER Flying Tigers, for the Nationalist Chinese forces fighting the Japanese. There he showed that his concepts were workable even under adverse conditions. Chennault left behind a few converts, such as Capt. Earle Partridge, who, with other officers, slightly revived pursuit aviation in the late 1930s. Through their efforts the Air Corps designed and accepted the P-40 fighter, which out- classed the P-26, although it proved inferior to the first-line fighters of other major aviation powers. The German Messerschmitt (Bf 109), the British Spitfire, and the Japanese Zero-all designed and brought into production at the same time as the P-40-surpassed it. Air Corps doctrine in the post-Mitchell era shifted materially. Fueled by the changes in technology, by Mitchell's new writings (free of the need to conciliate the powers that be), and by the theories of Giulio Douhet (the Italian air power enthusiast and theoretician), most of the Air Corps acce
