rs will begin by air action. Thus we must have an adequate standing air force to ensure our defense and to begin immediate offensive oper- ations. We must place ourselves in a position to begin bombardment of the enemy as soon as possible. 7. The current limited range of our aircraft requires the acquisition of allies to provide forward bases in order to begin action against the enemy. 8. Assuming the existence of allies and forward bases, the air force would 29   ## p. 30 (#54) ##############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE have the power to choose between attacking the armed forces or the national structure of the enemy. The latter should be the primary objective.89 The foregoing doctrine, given the inevitability of the small prewar force, dictated a specific composition for strength available. The force would require a preponderance of long-range bombers to operate offensively. Bombers would maximize their effectiveness by extreme accuracy-10 tons of bombs on target would do as much damage as 100 tons of bombs dropped with 10 percent accu- racy. Precision bombing meant daylight bombing; current and foreseeable tech- nology could not provide for precise night bombing. Daylight bombing deep into enemy territory, given current technology, meant that bombers would oper- ate without fighter escort and would need the ability to outrun or outgun enemy defensive fighters. The B-17, with its highly accurate and super-secret Norden bombsight, fit this specification perfectly, as would its successors. ACTS doctrine contained many assumptions that eventually proved invalid. It underestimated the capacity of a modern industrial nation and its populace to survive repeated and heavy bombing. It overestimated the ability of air technol- ogy to develop bombs big enough to damage heavy equipment or reinforced concrete and the ease with which those new bombs could be manufactured. It discounted the possibility of improvements in air defense and fig
