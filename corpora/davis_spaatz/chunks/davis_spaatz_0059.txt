op bombs big enough to damage heavy equipment or reinforced concrete and the ease with which those new bombs could be manufactured. It discounted the possibility of improvements in air defense and fighter technology that would reverse the advantage held by the bomber. In their most extreme position, heavy-bomber enthusiasts assumed that fighter defenses would be unable to locate bombers until they had dropped their bombs. Because bombers could strike with seeming impunity, the best defense was a good offense. Enemy forces would resort to their own attacks. Then the sky would fill with aerial armadas passing each other virtually undisturbed until the side with the most effective strength subdued the other. In only one other nation did the advocates of strategic bombing gain a deci- sive voice in shaping doctrine and affecting airframe design and acquisitionâ€” Britain. There the followers of Marshal of the Royal Air Force (RAF) Hugh Trenchard, the first Chief of Staff of the RAF, a service independent of the British army and navy, also adopted a bombing philosophy similar to that of Douhet and Mitchell. They, too, committed themselves to daylight bombard- ment, believing, in the words of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, in 1931, that "the bomber will always get through. The only defence is offence, which means you have to kill more women and children more quickly than the enemy if you want to save yourselves."90 In Germany, France, Japan, and Italy, however, the air services, even if nominally independent, found themselves subservient to the- ories or general staffs that bound them to tactical support of their country's land or naval forces. The advent of radar and highly organized ground-spotter organizations, both unforeseen by Air Corps bomber advocates, solved the defensive problem of tracking the bomber force.
