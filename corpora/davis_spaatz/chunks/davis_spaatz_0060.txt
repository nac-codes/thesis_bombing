sive problem of tracking the bomber force. One ACTS instructor, Maj. Haywood S. Hansell, a 30   ## p. 31 (#55) ##############################################  EARLY CAREER leading Air Corps bomber theoretician, who led the 3d Bomb Wing in Europe in 1943 and the XXI Bomber Command in Guam in 1944, later admitted, â€œIf our air theorists had had knowledge of radar in 1935, the American doctrine of strate- gic bombing in deep daylight penetrations would surely not have evolved."91 Similarly, improvements in fighter design led to faster, more heavily armed types that could best the B-17 and could be overcome only if they were pre- vented from reaching the bombers. The Air Corps, however, had rejected the idea that fighters should escort the bombers deep into enemy territory. Current technology seemed incapable of producing an aircraft that could (1) carry the combined weight of fuel necessary for long missions and armament superior to its opponents' and (2) retain the speed and agility to survive a dogfight unbur- dened by the necessary weight penalties of long-range flight. In addition, the Air Corps would never have the funds to build both a prewar bomber fleet and an escort fighter fleet under a particularly parsimonious Congress. The Air Corps maintained its stance against long-range escort through 1940. Only the fortuitous development of the long-range P-51 and drop tanks for the P-47, as well as their deployment in late 1943 and early 1944, saved American air power from a costly mistake. During the 1930s, Spaatz articulated few views on air doctrine. What can be gleaned from his actions and writings as air observer during the Battle of Britain, as Chief of the Air Staff, and as combat commander in World War II suggests a clear affinity with the Air Corps Tactical School branch of air doc- trine. He had a close relationship with Arnold, a leading bomber man; Spaatz had served on the development boards for the B-17, the B-24, and the B-29,92 and he believed in their a
