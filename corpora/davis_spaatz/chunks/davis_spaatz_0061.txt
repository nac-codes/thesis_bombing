He had a close relationship with Arnold, a leading bomber man; Spaatz had served on the development boards for the B-17, the B-24, and the B-29,92 and he believed in their ability to defend themselves. But there were indications that, with regard to the tactical sphere of operations, Spaatz still adhered to Mitchell's early dictum regarding the absolute necessity of establishing air supe- riority before proceeding to other air operations. Spaatz's Association with Arnold and Eaker During the interwar years, Spaatz remained roughly one step behind Henry H. Arnold and one step ahead of Ira C. Eaker, two of his closest friends in the service. In many ways the careers of the triumvirate reflect the experience of the entire Air Corps for the period. Arnold to Spaatz to Eaker was not the double-play combination of a profes- sional baseball team but the eventual chain of command for American heavy- bomber forces in the British Isles. Henry H.

Spaatz and Arnold were the closest of confidants from 1918 until the latter's death in 1950. Eaker was almost as close to both. Yet the three had different backgrounds, personal- ities, and approaches to life. Arnold graduated from West Point in 1907. Like Spaatz, he graduated in the lower half of his class academically and did not achieve cadet rank. Four years (and ten days of flight training) later he became one of the Army's first four lic
