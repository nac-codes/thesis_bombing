Anglo-French total. The President sought an Army Air Corps of 20,000 planes, with an annual produc- tive capacity of 2,000 planes per month. He knew, however, that such a program would not pass Congress. Therefore he asked the War Department to develop a plan for building 10,000 aircraft and for constructing new plant capacity for an additional 10,000 aircraft per year. Although his meeting concentrated on air- planes, it supplied the spark for all subsequent Army and Army Air Corps pre- war matériel and manpower expansion as the War Department sought not only new planes but funds to provide a balanced, combat-ready Army.3 On November 17, Arnold detailed Spaatz along with Col.

This plan served as the blueprint for further expansion of an Air Corps that in the autumn of 1938 had only 1,600 aircraft on hand. Plants working on aircraft contracts for the Air Corps had a productive capacity of only 88.2 planes per month.4 Even six months later (June 1939), the Air Corps still had only thirteen operational B-17s and 22,287 person- nel, only twice the strength of the Cavalry.5 In January 1939, Spaatz became Chief of the Plans Section of the OCAC.
