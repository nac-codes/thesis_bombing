the lessons of the war in Europe into current Air Corps planning and training; the establishment of air- craft production priorities; the coordination of all research and development pro- jects associated with combat aircraft; and, most important, the creation and man- agement of the various air expansion and rearmament programs introduced in the prewar period.6 The first significant problem to face the Plans Section was Roosevelt's rejec- tion of the expansion plan presented to him by the Army and the Air Corps. He had asked for $500 million in Air Corps planes, but the Army and the Air Corps had requested an additional $200 million for Army matériel, $100 million for Navy aircraft, plus unstated amounts for air bases and air training. The President, who was not at all sure Congress would approve the additional $500 million in the first place, redistributed the funds giving $200 million of the $500 million to the Army matériel branches, earmarking $120 million for air bases and other non- plane air items, and leaving $180 million for procurement of 3,000 combat air- craft. He promised to find the Navy's money elsewhere. Congress passed the expansion bill in April 1939, authorizing an Air Corps ceiling of 5,500 aircraft.7 Spaatz spent much of his time dealing with the nuts and bolts of training and procurement. The problem of aircraft for the French and British proved vexing from the beginning. On January 23, 1939, an advanced model U.S. Army dive- bomber crashed during a flight test, killing the American co-pilot and injuring 39   ## p. 40 (#64) ##############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE the French pilot and ten others. This accident gave ammunition to members of Congress and others who wished to build up U.S. forces before aiding Britain and France or who sought to avoid sending aid to any belligerent in the hope of avoiding entanglement in the coming war. Yet the accident also established a precedent permitting a policy of m
