Britain and France or who sought to avoid sending aid to any belligerent in the hope of avoiding entanglement in the coming war. Yet the accident also established a precedent permitting a policy of more lib- eral release of advanced aircraft. Within weeks the British purchased 650 air- craft worth $25 million, while the French added another 615 planes worth $60 million. In the course of the year Canada, Australia, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, and Iraq placed further orders. Although the American aircraft industry accepted the orders, it feared that U.S. neutrality laws might prevent delivery in the event of war and was reluctant to expand production facilities. In the face of this reluc- tance, the French agreed to underwrite the cost of expansion for engines from Pratt and Whitney and airplanes from Wright Aeronautical. By November 1939, the British and French had invested more than $84 million in engine plants alone.8 These large orders ran head-on into the Air Corps' own 5,500-plane pro- gram. In July and August 1939, the Air Corps let contracts of $105 million, more than the entire business of the industry in any peacetime year prior to 1938. Congress spent an additional $57 million to buy new manufacturing equipment for the aircraft industry. By the end of 1939 there was a backlog of orders worth $630 million, with $400 million attributable to foreign purchases.9 The outbreak of war on September 1, 1939, the same day that George C. Marshall officially became Chief of the War Department General Staff, increased the pressure from the Western Allies for aid. On March 25, 1940, the Allies received permission to purchase all but the most advanced models of U.S. combat and trainer types. Aircraft available to the Allies included the B-17, B-24, B-25, B-26, A-20, and P-40, all front-line aircraft in the Air Corps inventory. After the fall of France, the British took over all French contracts and added more of their own. Their orders soon reached 14,000 planes, and after
