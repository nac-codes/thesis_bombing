As Chief of Air Corps Plans, a position he resumed soon after return- ing from Britain, Spaatz had unique knowledge of the status of the Air Corps' capabilities, including its readiness, training, procurement, and war plans. He would find this knowledge invaluable as he assessed the British experience. He could immediately apply whatever he learned from the RAF to the Air Corps' programs. The position Spaatz occupied came about as a dire
