He learned that the British had captured German pilots with less than 100 hours' flying time and that, for the British themselves, a shortage of trained crews, not lack of aircraft, was the biggest bottleneck in fielding a large force. He also learned that the RAF “apparently thinks as we do, but [has] been hindered by higher-ups" with regard to the feasibility and desirability of strategic bombing of the German economy.25 For the next ten days, Spaatz visited the RAF's Training Command, Technical Training Command, and training bases. The initial training system of the British impressed Spaatz, but he considered their bombing accuracy low and doubted the effectiveness of night bombing. Spaatz and the two other American attachés who accompanied him agreed that, in the event of active U.S. participation in the war, the most useful immediate contribution the United States could make would be high-altitude long-distance bombers.26 This con- clusion was probably based more on the predilection of Army Air Corps offi- cers toward the use of large bombers than to any lessons directly related to their visit. In almost every other phase of air activity, their observations must have shown them that the RAF had outpaced 1940 Air Corps practice. Meanwhile, the French, whose army had been shattered by the Wehrmacht, on June 17 asked for an armistice. During this dark period of the war, Spaatz ini- tiated informal staff talks to discuss the details of America's "almost inevitable" entry into the war.27 Spaatz's authority to begin such extraordinary discussions was unclear. No secret instructions or hints of any have surfaced in Roosevelt's, Arnold's, and Spaatz's personal papers. Given Spaatz's presence as an observer in an ongoing program (the Air Corp
