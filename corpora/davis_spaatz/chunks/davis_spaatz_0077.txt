ons was unclear. No secret instructions or hints of any have surfaced in Roosevelt's, Arnold's, and Spaatz's personal papers. Given Spaatz's presence as an observer in an ongoing program (the Air Corps continued to send short-term Military Air Observers to England until the U.S. entry into the war) and his assignment to the post before the outbreak of the German offensive on May 10, 1940, it seems unlikely that any higher authorities would have anticipated the need for immedi- ate emergency aid to England or would have authorized him to initiate such negotiations.* Spaatz probably initiated these discussions on his own. * Absence of proof, however does not mean that such instructions could not have been passed to Spaatz after he went to Britain. Spaatz arrived in London during the repercussions of the Tyler Kent affair. Kent was a code clerk in the American embassy. On May 20, 1940, the British informed the Americans, using incontrovertible evidence, that Kent had totally compro- mised U.S. diplomatic codes. As a result, all communications of the U.S. diplomatic service were blacked out for two to six weeks between Dunkirk and the fall of France, while scores of special couriers delivered new codes to all U.S. embassies. It may well have been that higher-ups in Washington could not have told Spaatz to begin negotiations even if they had wanted to, unless, of course, a courier hand-carried instructions from Washington to him. See David Kahn, The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing (New York: Macmillan, 1967), pp. 494-495, for more on Tyler Kent. On the other hand, instructions could have reached Spaatz through the U.S. naval or military attach√©s' office. Because of known slackness in State Department signal security, important message traffic to and from London, such as that between Roosevelt and Churchill, came via the Navy message center. 44   ## p. 45 (#69) ##############################################  PREWAR PLANNING Such a step was probably less radical
