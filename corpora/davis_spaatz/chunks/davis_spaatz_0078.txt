As Spaatz probably knew from his tour as Air Corps Chief of Plans, the U.S. and British navies had come to a preliminary meeting of minds on war-fighting strategy as early as December 1937.28 In late May 1940, as Spaatz may well have known, the U.S. Naval Attaché in London, Capt. Alan G.

Nor did he commit his country to more than information finding. In any case, this démarche was one of the first efforts in combined U.S.-British operational military planning. On June 13, the day before the fall of Paris, Major McDonald, after dis- cussing the subject of direct U.S. aid to the British with Spaatz, visited the RAF Dire
