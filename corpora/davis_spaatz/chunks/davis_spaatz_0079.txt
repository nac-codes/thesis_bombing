-British operational military planning. On June 13, the day before the fall of Paris, Major McDonald, after dis- cussing the subject of direct U.S. aid to the British with Spaatz, visited the RAF Director of Intelligence. He informed Air Commodore Archibald Boyle that mil- itary officers at the U.S. embassy were considering the possibility that the United States would contribute directly to the war in the air over Europe. Acting on the assumption that entry of the United States into the war was “almost inevitable," McDonald suggested that plans be prepared for the dispatch of fifty B-17s to Britain. If the proposal received a favorable hearing in the United States, then pilots could be trained and special targets studied. Bearing out Spaatz's responsibility in initiating this matter, McDonald indicated that if the RAF "thought there was anything in it, he could arrange for the necessary papers [emphasis in original] to be sent to General Miles [the senior U.S. Military Attaché in London] and General Arnold in the U.S.A. at once."32 The Director of Intelligence passed the McDonald-Spaatz suggestion on to Slessor, who was "all for the plan" in principle. On June 16, Spaatz, McDonald, and Slessor fully discussed the proposal and agreed on the details of a small air expeditionary force.33 After this session Slessor circulated the plan to the appro- priate branches of the Air Ministry so that each could contribute its share to the final plan. The targets suggested by the RAF included oil plants at Vienna, Regensburg, Leuna, Stettin, and Magdeburg; aircraft factories at Munich, Berlin, Magdeburg, Dessau, and Kassel; and targets in northern Italy.
