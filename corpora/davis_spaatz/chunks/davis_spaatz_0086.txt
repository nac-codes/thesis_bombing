He noted favorably the efficiency of female RAF personnel, which may have encouraged his own subsequent wartime support of U.S. Army female personnel.

Spaatz criticized what he termed “too much rigidity of control by the higher command, which as stated above, extends even to the point of Group control of individual sections of a squadron."53 In mid-August, Spaatz spent three days at Dover, where he witnessed German air attacks and watched British heavy antiaircraft artillery fire inaccurately on friend and foe alike. During his stay at Dover, Spaatz, dressed in his rumpled civilian tweeds, wandered away from his escort and was promptly detained by a British naval commander as a spy when he blundered into a restricted area. It took some hours to establish his identity. Spaatz took the incident with his usual good humor and a few days later signed himself in at an RAF field as "Col. Carl A. Spaatz, German spy." "54 At the British Technical Establishment, he examined downed German aircraft. Detailed reports on each plane soon found their way to Arnold. As for the performance of the Luftwaffe, Spaatz noted that its bombing had been "particularly lousy," and he suspected that it had been "too hastily con- structed" to stand up for long to the apparently better trained RAF Fighter Command.55 In the last week of August, Spaatz maintained his close contacts with the RAF.
