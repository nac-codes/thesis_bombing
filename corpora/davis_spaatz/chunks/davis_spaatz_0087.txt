They agreed that a modern, well-dispersed air force could not be destroyed on the ground.57 They further noted the unsuitability of dive-bombers against well-defended targets and the relative effectiveness of rapid-firing, light antiaircraft weapons. In discussing the jealousy between the British army and the RAF, which Spaatz had previously noted,58 they stated, “It takes close coordination with the Army to obtain maximum misuse of air power."59 In other words, the more an air force conformed to the wishes of its army, the less effective it would be.
