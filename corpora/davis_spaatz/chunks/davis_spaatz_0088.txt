The Krauts must be losing more than we know."62 Spaatz recommended that B-17s be shipped at once to the British to add strength to the long-range British striking force. After leaving England, Spaatz spent ten days in Lisbon. There he saw first- hand the pitiful state of refugees fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe, which further hardened his attitude toward the Germans. At lunch at the U.S. legation he told those present, including the ex-governor of New Hampshire, John G. Winant, who was on his way to London to replace Joseph P.
