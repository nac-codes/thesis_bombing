rry enough fuel internally, would have to be larger, and therefore would be less maneuverable and combat capa- ble, than lighter, shorter-range defending fighter aircraft. The performance of the German heavy twin-engine fighter, the Bf 110, against the nimble, shorter-range, lighter British single-engine Hurricanes and Spitfires, confirmed this conviction. Spaatz also observed from German operations that close fighter escort, in any case, did "not insure immunity from attack by hostile fighters on the bombers. A comparatively fewer number of hostile fighters can, by determined effort, break up the large [bomber] formation."64 After talking to RAF bomber pilots Spaatz also reaffirmed his belief in the necessity of daylight precision bombing for accurate results and in the defensive strength of large, heavy-bomber formations. Explaining away the apparent con- tradiction between the assumption that determined fighter attack would break up bomber formations and the assumption that a well-flown bomber formation could defend itself, he observed that so far the Germans had not demonstrated the ability to mount a determined attack on British bombers. Spaatz apparently had not fully realized that the British had switched to night operations because of excessive casualties suffered in daylight operations. These beliefs, typical of those of many Air Corps leaders, would be modified only by costly direct actions with "determined" German fighter planes in 1943. But, as already noted, Spaatz had seen the ineffectiveness of the close escort tactics the Germans employed to protect their bombers. In close escort German fighters stayed with the bombers until British fighters attacked, at which time the escorts tried to break up the intercepting fighters' assault. This tactic had proved ineffective. It robbed the German fighters of their aggressiveness by forcing them to react to British attacks instead of launching their own. In con- trast, distant escort freed the fighters to leave
