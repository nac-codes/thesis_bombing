neffective. It robbed the German fighters of their aggressiveness by forcing them to react to British attacks instead of launching their own. In con- trast, distant escort freed the fighters to leave the slow-moving bomber forma- tions and to attack enemy fighters when they made their appearance. This obser- vation may have helped Spaatz reach his brilliant wartime decision, in January 1944, to free the Eighth Air Force's fighters from the bombers by authorizing them to search out and destroy enemy fighters. At the same time, Spaatz dis- carded one of the tenets of prewar air thinkingâ€”that air bombardment could shatter a civilian population's willingness to resist. Spaatz left Britain convinced that the morale of the British and probably that of the German civil populations would not collapse in the face of bombardment. Spaatz's stay in Britain also exposed him to technical innovations, such as 53   ## p. 54 (#78) ##############################################   KA KAR KA M KAK The Battle of Britain. Contending aircraft reflected the advanced aviation technology of the era. Clockwise from above: The twin-engine Vickers-Armstrong Wellington was one of RAF Bomber Command's principal models. With a 4,500-pound bomb load and a max- imum speed of 235 mph, it was among the best of its type. Hawker Hurricanes (opposite, above) were the most numerous British fighters in the battle and bore the brunt of early engagements with the Luftwaffe. Each was armed with eight Browning .303 caliber machine guns and attained a speed of 350 mph. Marks 1 and 1A Supermarine Spitfires (opposite, middle) confronted the Luftwaffe in the later days of the battle. As heavily armed as Hurricanes but faster, the Spitfires outfought and outlasted most German adversaries. The Bf 109E fighter (opposite, below) was the Luftwaffe's mainstay in Germany's five- month effort to dominate British skies. It was a formidable opponent at 350 mph and com- bined machine gun and cannon armament. Its fuel-injecte
