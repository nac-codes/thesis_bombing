below) was the Luftwaffe's mainstay in Germany's five- month effort to dominate British skies. It was a formidable opponent at 350 mph and com- bined machine gun and cannon armament. Its fuel-injected engine enabled pushovers into sudden dives, giving its pilot the advantage in initiating and breaking off combat, but a short range limited its ability to protect German bombers over Britain or to engage the RAF at will.

Unfortunately, Spaatz appears not to have recorded any opinions he may have formed during this trip of RAF leaders. He had only a brief meeting with Portal, Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Bomber Command. A colonel, even one from a favorably disposed neutral country, simply did not hobnob with officers at the highest lev- els of command, especially when they were in the midst of their nation's single most important battle since Trafalgar or, perhaps, Hastings. Among the more junior RAF officers, however, Spaatz made several friends, including Slessor, who became Chief of the Air Staff after World War II. In his memoirs Slessor recorded a lively pictur
