hip. Spaatz's failure to draw correct conclusions from the German and British experiences about the survivability of daylight bomber aircraft also had impor- tant consequences. He did not realize that procurement of an effective daylight long-range fighter escort aircraft was a top priority or that Air Corps bomber formations were no more likely to survive in daylight than RAF or Luftwaffe bomber formations. If he had decided that the Air Corps, too, could survive only at night, or that it needed to begin development of appropriate escort fighters immediately, then the American strategic bombing effort in World War II, which he was eventually to direct, might have taken an entirely different path, with incalculable results. 56   ## p. 57 (#81) ##############################################  PREWAR PLANNING Spaatz and Prewar Strategic Planning On May 16, 1940, two days before Spaatz left for England, the Air Corps, at the President's behest, increased its expansion plans. Spaatz's plan of December 1938 had called for an increase in annual military pilot training from 300 to 4,500 pilots. In the spring of 1939 the Air Corps had adopted a planning goal of 24 combat-ready groupsâ€”that is, fully equipped, completely trained, and capa- ble of fulfilling their assigned missions by June 30, 1941. But the May 16 expansion raised these goals to 7,000 pilots per year and 41 groups. Barely 2 months later, on August 8, newer plans called for 12,000 pilots and 54 combat- ready groups. The August 8 plans also called for 21,470 planes and a total of 119,000 personnel, almost 6 times the personnel envisaged in the summer of 1939. These were the changes Spaatz found when he resumed his post as Chief of the Plans Division (upgraded from a section in May 1940), Headquarters, Air Corps, in November 1940. In another month, on December 17, 1940, a new pro- gram called for 30,000 pilots a year. 66 Between his return from England in September and his resumption of duty in the Plans Division,
