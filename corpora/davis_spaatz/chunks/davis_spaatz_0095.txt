he Air Corps and the three Assistant Chiefs of the Air Corps endowed their occupants with the ranks of major general and brigadier general respectively. The rank stayed with the job; former occupants reverted to their Regular Army ranks, usually colonel or lieutenant colonel. 57   ## p. 58 (#82) ##############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE  Robert A. Lovett, Assistant Secretary of War for Air, 1941-1945. its supply and training function, could not long survive. By the end of March 1941, Marshall initiated new studies that resulted in the final prewar air organi- zation.68 On June 20, 1941, the War Department issued a revised edition of Army Regulation 95-5, which governed the status, function, and organization of the air arm. It created the Army Air Forces (AAF) headed by a chief, who also became the Deputy Chief of Staff for Air and had the authority to supervise and coordi- nate the work of the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps, the GHQ Air Force (redesignated Air Force Combat Command), and all other air elements. The reg- ulation further created an Air Staff to assist the new deputy chief, which freed the air arm from much of the dominance formerly exercised over it by the ground officers who controlled the War Department General Staff. At Arnold's behest, Spaatz became the first Chief of the Air Staff at the end of June 1941. This organization sufficed until March 9, 1942, when a final rearrangement of positions gave the Army Air Forces equality with the Army Ground Forces and greatly reduced the power of the General Staff.69 In another War Department organizational move, in December 1940, Robert A. Lovett became Special Assistant to the Secretary of War on all air matters. The following spring Lovett advanced to the post of Assistant Secretary of War for Air, a position left vacant by the Roosevelt administration since 1933. Lovett would prove a powerful, friendly, and effective civilian advocate for the AAF. Negotiations
