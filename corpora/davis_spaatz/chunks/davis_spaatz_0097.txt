A British Military Mission, with joint army-navy-air representatives, came to Washington, and two separate "Special Observer Groups," one U.S. Army and one U.S. Navy, crossed the Atlantic to London. Because the largest initial combat force contemplated for deployment to Britain was drawn from the Air Corps, an air officer, Maj. Gen. James E.

This plan accepted most of the strategic assumptions of ABC-1 and gained the approval of the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy in May 1941. RAINBOW No. 5 provided detailed breakdowns and deployment schedules for Army (including air) and Navy units allocated to areas of anticipated conflict.
