Spaatz apparently failed to realize that available technology in the form of expendable, externally carried fuel tanks, called drop tanks, could satisfactorily solve the problem of range extension. One scholar has stated, Literally hundreds of crewmen lost their lives because escort fighters of suit- able range were not ready when needed. The lack of escort fighters je
