ested that only essential changes be approved.84 Spaatz's Plans Division, faced with desperate aircraft shortages throughout its training and readiness programs, concentrated on pushing aircraft through the production system. As a consequence, Vandenberg argued that “a determined effort should be made to keep the pursuit airplane as simple as pos- sible."85 As a technical detail it should be noted that the P-39D aircraft's design limited it to operations under 12,000 feet, and at no time did the Air Corps seri- ously consider using the plane as an escort for heavy bombers. Production, not doctrinal considerations, motivated Spaatz's action. Although the Air Corps began a limited-range extension program in 1940 and expanded it in 1942,86 Spaatz's and Vandenberg's attitudes toward long- range fighter escort typified prevailing prewar Air Corps views. The authors of AWPD/1, in August 1941, showed equal shortsightedness. "It has not yet been demonstrated," the plan stated, "that the technical improvements to the bom- bardment airplane are or can be sufficient to overcome the pursuit airplane.” 61   ## p. 62 (#86) ##############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Consequently, the plan observed, "It is unwise to neglect development of escort fighters designed to enable bombardment formations to fight through to the objective." The aircraft envisioned by the plan was not an aircraft of pursuit per- formance with extended range, such as the P-51, but, instead, was a convoy defender like the YB-40 (a B-17 modified by the addition of extensive armor plate and several additional .50 caliber machine guns). AWPD/1 called for the funding of an experimental squadron of thirteen such planes.87 In combat with the American Eighth Air Force over Germany, in 1943, the YB-40 proved a costly failure. Similar opinions appeared in the AAF's last prewar review of its pursuit aircraft requirements. In October 1941, Spaatz, as Chief of the Air Staff, and at Arn
