1943, the YB-40 proved a costly failure. Similar opinions appeared in the AAF's last prewar review of its pursuit aircraft requirements. In October 1941, Spaatz, as Chief of the Air Staff, and at Arnold's behest,88 appointed a board of pursuit and air mat√©riel officers to recommend "the future development of pursuit aircraft." The opinions of the board's members, which included Col. Ira C. Eaker and Col. Frank O'D. Hunter, illustrated the thinking of the AAF on the eve of the war. Eaker, in particular, would have played a key role in this board's decisions. He had just returned from England, where he had served as Special Air Observer until October 1, 1941. His primary mission had been to determine the feasibility of integrating the radio systems of American ground echelons, pursuit forma- tions, and aircraft into British operations.89 However, Arnold had also instructed Eaker to conduct "a broad study of all phases of fighter operations." This included obtaining "the best thought now prevalent on the subject of escort fighter protection."90 Eaker did a thorough job. He not only talked to many senior RAF officers, he came back with dozens of copies of British reports con- cerning British and German fighter tactics and performance. He undoubtedly shared the information he collected with the pursuit panel. The views of the RAF on bomber escort aircraft, as Eaker accurately reported, paralleled those of the AAF. Eaker's visit to England came just at the conclusion of a limited upsurge in RAF daylight bombing missions. The RAF directed those missions, nicknamed "circus" raids, at targets on the French coast within range of British fighter planes. The purpose of these raids was to produce attritional combat between escorting RAF fighters and attacking German fight- ers. They failed because the Germans soon adopted a policy of engaging only when they held the advantage. The Germans could adopt such a policy because the limited range of the RAF escorts did not allow bombi
