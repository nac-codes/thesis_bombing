y failed because the Germans soon adopted a policy of engaging only when they held the advantage. The Germans could adopt such a policy because the limited range of the RAF escorts did not allow bombing of targets vital to the German war effort.91 Circus operations reinforced the prevailing RAF opin- ion that short-range fighter aircraft could not provide strategic escort. In May 1941, shortly before launching the operation, the Chief of the Air Staff and a former head of Bomber Command, Air Chief Marshal Portal, had replied to a query from Churchill on fighter escorts by noting, "Increased range can only be provided at the expense of performance and maneuverability." He added, “The long-range fighter, whether built specifically as such, or whether given increased range by fitting extra tanks, will be at a disadvantage compared with the short-range high-performance fighter."92 On September 28, Portal 62   ## p. 63 (#87) ##############################################  PREWAR PLANNING expressed similar views to Eaker, drawing the logical conclusion "that the proper escort fighter will be a ship exactly like the bomber it is going to escort." This heavily armored and armed aircraft would take station at weak points in the bomber formation and by "expel[ling] heavy caliber fire in all directions,” make it "very difficult for the light single seater fighters."93 The commander of the RAF Test, Research, and Experimental Unit spoke to Eaker of the impossibility of the large fighter getting through a screen of small fighters, saying, “They will sting it to death."94 The organization and design of the RAF contributed to its inability to con- ceive of aircraft combining bomber range and fighter performance. The raison d'etre of Fighter Command was the air defense of Britain. Its planes, especially the superb Spitfire series, had been designed and built for that purpose alone. Therefore, they emphasized performance over endurance, which was not needed for defense of English ai
