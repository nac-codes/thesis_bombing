planes, especially the superb Spitfire series, had been designed and built for that purpose alone. Therefore, they emphasized performance over endurance, which was not needed for defense of English air space. Fighter Command had little operational need to develop long-range fighters. Likewise, Bomber Command had committed itself, despite limited circus operations, to the strategic bombing of Germany at night. Night operations depended on avoiding and deceiving the enemy's defenses, not fighting through them, which would have required escort aircraft. Bomber Command, too, had little operational need for escort aircraft. Given the per- ceived lack of need and the limited resources available, the RAF's refusal to invest in escort aircraft and its failure to pursue technical solutions to fighter range extension were understandable. In fact, the RAF never developed or employed substantial numbers of long-range fighter escort aircraft during the war. These strongly held opinions of a future major ally, with over two years of hard-won direct combat experience, which had been confirmed by AAF observers, undoubtedly influenced the AAF pursuit board. Eaker, himself, con- tinued to advocate the development of a convoy defender until its experimental employment, under his own command, demonstrated the fallacy of the idea in actual operations. In any case, the board's officers had probably held views sim- ilar to those of the RAF even before their exposure to Eaker's reports and docu- ments. The AAF pursuit board, like the RAF, could not overcome the seeming tau- tological improbability of the successful long-range fighter escort and made no recommendation whatever for one. Instead, the board suggested consideration of a "convoy defender." "Only with the assistance of such an airplane," warned the board, â€œmay bombardment aviation hope to successfully deliver daylight attacks deep inside enemy territory and beyond range of interceptor support." Yet the board feared that the size
