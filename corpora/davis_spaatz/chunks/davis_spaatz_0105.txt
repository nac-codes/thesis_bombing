ne," warned the board, â€œmay bombardment aviation hope to successfully deliver daylight attacks deep inside enemy territory and beyond range of interceptor support." Yet the board feared that the size and expense of such a convoy defender would interfere with other production and development projects. It thus gave low priority to development of a convoy defender prototype, concluding: The Board is unable to say whether or not the project is worthwhile, and can only point out the need for furnishing day bombardment with the very maxi- 63   ## p. 64 (#88) ##############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE mum attainable defensive firepower if that form of attack is to be chosen to gain a decision in war against any other modern power.9 The board also considered a long-range pursuit aircraft with a range of 2,000 miles and an operating altitude above 25,000 feet, which would have sacrificed climb and maneuverability for range and endurance. But the board did not rec- ommend the development of a prototype, nor did it envisage the use of drop tanks by this plane.96 Operational employment and accessory equipment also received attention by the board, which recommended the high-priority development of nineteen items of new equipment, including new gunsights, pressurized cockpits, new means of aircraft propulsion, and "expendable external auxiliary-fuel tanks." The board defined pursuit's mission in these words: "The general mission of our pursuit aviation is to seek out and destroy, by air combat, hostile aircraft which attack or threaten to attack our vital installations on the ground or our friendly aviation in the air. The principal target is the hostile bomber" [emphasis added].97 Here the board enunciated a principle embraced by none other than Hermann Goering, the Luftwaffe's commanding officer. Interestingly enough, almost all students of great strategic bombing campaigns of World War II cite Goering's directives to attack Allied bombers
