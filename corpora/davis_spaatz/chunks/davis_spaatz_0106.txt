Hermann Goering, the Luftwaffe's commanding officer. Interestingly enough, almost all students of great strategic bombing campaigns of World War II cite Goering's directives to attack Allied bombers in preference to Allied fighters as a key tactical error. The board saw a need for adding drop tanks and for increasing the safety of bombers on deep penetration raids. Yet it never connected the single-engine pur- suit aircraft and drop tanks with the bomber protection problem. Neither did the rest of the AAF until almost too late. Ironically, a future commander of the Eighth Air Force did have the solution to the fighter escort problem in his reach, but failed to grasp it. However, that failure, if failure it be, applies more to Eaker, who sat on the development board, than to Spaatz. The refusal by Spaatz, Eaker, and the board to place a high priority on fighter escort stemmed more from technical considerations than from a denial of the necessity for it. The recent observations of both men in Britain had shown the disadvantages of the Bf 110 against the Spitfire and Hurricane. RAF techni- cal personnel were convinced that a plane capable of both long-range combat and successful dogfighting could not be built-a view shared by Spaatz and Eaker and reflected in the board's findings. Eight years earlier Spaatz had writ- ten Arnold concerning a long-range fighter prototype: "If this plane used as a single seater operates to its full range of 1,000 miles, it would undoubtedly be used for the purpose of accompanying bombardment." In that case, Spaatz thought that the fighter "would be forced to meet interceptor pursuit of the enemy which, with a much lower cruise range, will have greatly superior performance."98 Spaatz and Eaker, of course, had seen the British and the Germans both resort to night bombing because their bombardment aircraft could not survive in hostile daylight skies. They discounted that experience by calculating that the B-17 flew higher, was more rugged,
