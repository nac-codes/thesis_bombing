both resort to night bombing because their bombardment aircraft could not survive in hostile daylight skies. They discounted that experience by calculating that the B-17 flew higher, was more rugged, and carried more and heavier guns than any European bomber. They also assumed that the Americans would maintain 64   ## p. 65 (#89) ##############################################  PREWAR PLANNING tighter defensive formation than the British or Germans. Events proved the Americans and British correct in their assumption that no heavy fighter could successfully perform long-range escort in Europe. The P-38, an American twin-engine fighter, had its greatest impact in the Pacific against a very different foe. The P-38, because of its higher operating altitude and faster diving speed, a factor of its greater weight, was not helpless against German air- craft; it just operated at a disadvantage in a melee because of its relative lack of maneuverability, especially when opposing pilots were of equal ability. The P-38 performed better than the Bf 110 in the strategic escort role, but as soon as suffi- cient numbers of long-range single-engine fighters became available, the AAF hastened to replace it. Ironically, the aircraft that proved the ultimate solution to the long-range escort problem, the P-51 (Mustang), had its maiden flight in October 1940, a year before the pursuit board met. The Mustang was the direct result of a con- tract between the British government and the North American Aviation Corporation. The contract, signed in January 1940, specified completion within 120 days of a prototype single-engine fighter aircraft. Within 117 days, North American rolled out the plane, complete except for its engine. The design incorporated lessons learned from the early days of the war and included simple lines, for ease of pro- duction; an in-line water-cooled engine, frowned upon by the AAF because of its vulnerability to damage compared with a radial air-cooled engine; and an a
