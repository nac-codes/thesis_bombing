r and included simple lines, for ease of pro- duction; an in-line water-cooled engine, frowned upon by the AAF because of its vulnerability to damage compared with a radial air-cooled engine; and an advanced laminar-flow wing section design for improved performance. As rec- ompense for giving permission to the British to produce the aircraft in the United States, the AAF took delivery of two of the initial ten aircraft for testing. The original U.S.-produced and -designed Allison engine of the P-51, the same used in the P-40, did not provide enough power and limited the P-51's best performance to altitudes below 15,000 feet, an operational ceiling unsuitable for escort of heavy bombers. The British, who appreciated the possibilities of the Mustang's sleek airframe, replaced the original engine with their own powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. The mating of one of the outstanding piston-driven aircraft engines ever made and a superb airframe resulted in a hybrid of distin- guished performance, perhaps the best propeller-driven fighter of World War II. The Americans, too, made a key contribution to the Mustang's development. In their search for a suitable long-range escort they added increased internal tank- age, which extended the P-51's escort range to 475 miles (the maximum range of a P-47 with drop tanks) and 108-gallon drop tanks, which extended its escort range to more than 650 miles (to Berlin and beyond). These improvements made the P-51 the preferred escort for the American heavy bombers and the dominant fighter over Europe for the last year of the war. Unfortunately, it did not come into mass production in the United States until 1942 and did not reach American fighter groups in England until December 1943. It reached the Eighth Air Force just in time to help turn the tide of the air war, in conjunction with the yeoman- like service of P-47s equipped with new longer-range drop tanks, and to prevent 65   ## p. 66 (#90) #######################################
