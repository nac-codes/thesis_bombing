Perhaps the P-51 was a technological freak aided by wartime combat experience and superior British engine technology, or perhaps the Air Corps aircraft development program had limited itself to overly conservative engineering. 101 As 1941 drew to a close, the most important and dramatic portion of Spaatz's career lay before him. In the three years prior to U.S. entry into World War II, Spaatz had worked at the center of U.S. air expansion. Few officers could equal his many years of command experience or his breadth of knowledge of the current state of AAF readiness and plans for future production. He under- stood his force's lack of training and the long delays to be expected in securing replacement aircraft, and this knowledge may account for much of his subse- quent reluctance to commit his command in Britain to combat until it was fully ready. Finally, his trip to Britain, which gave him knowledge of modern combat and acquainted him with senior RAF officers, made him an obvious choice for leadership when the United States entered the war in Europe. His seniority enti- tled him to a large role, but he could keep such a role only by successful perfor- mance. 66   ## p. 67 (#91) ##############################################  Ch
