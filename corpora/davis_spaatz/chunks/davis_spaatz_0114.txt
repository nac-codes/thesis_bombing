which gave every indication that it would support the Germans as long as they continued to win. On March 3, 1942, the Combined British and American Chiefs of Staff (CCS) dropped SUPER-GYMNAST as an operational possibility.8 The Americans advanced a new alternative. One American in particular, the new head of the War Plans Division, Brig. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, had already sent two important memoranda to General Marshall proposing that the Allies launch an early invasion of Europe. Eisenhower had good reasons for the suggestion. It placed a minimum strain on shipping. It did not disperse the escorts vital to the North Atlantic line of communications to Britain. A buildup in England would force the Germans to put a larger garrison in western Europe, leaving fewer troops to fight the Soviets. Once ashore in France, the invaders would find better land communications than anywhere else in Europe. Numerous airfields already existing in England allowed for the establishment of the large air force necessary to gain air superiority over the beachhead. An invasion of western Europe would allow the British to employ offensively a maximum portion of their combat power because they would not have to leave behind a large force to defend the 69   ## p. 70 (#94) ##############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE home islands. And the attack would cause the Germans to fight on yet another front. One can find no better statement of the U.S. Army's rationale for an invasion of northwestern Europe. Eisenhower made passing reference to a U.S.- British air attack designed to clear the way for the landing but no mention of a strategic bombing campaign against the Reich. By the end of March 1942, the Operations Division (OPD), the successor to the War Plans Division under the Army reorganization of March 9, delivered yet another plan to Marshall emphasizing the need for a massive assault from England to France. Marshall, of course, needed no convincing. He
