The Americans promised to have 1 million men, 30 divisions, and 2,550 combat air- craft ready by April 1, 1943, but only 3Â½ divisions and 700 combat aircraft by September 15, 1942.11 For the next six days the British and American planners and the British Chiefs of Staff discussed the "Marshall Memorandum," as the British dubbed the plan. On April 14, the British accepted the plan with one proviso that all necessary mea- sures be taken to prevent a joining of Japanese and German forces. 12 The Americans had no objections.13 The Marshall Memorandum, especially the BOLERO phase, was the strategic foundation for Spaatz's own plans for the buildup of the U.S. Eighth Air Force in England.

The diversion of ship- ping to the Pacific overturned deployment predictions, and the preparation for a land invasion meant less time for the strategic bomber offensive and an in- creased emphasis on the creation of tactical air power to support the invasion.
