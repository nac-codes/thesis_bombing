for the arrival of the AAF in Britain: July 1942-3 heavy-bomber groups (105 planes), 1 medium-bomber group (57 planes), 3 light-bomber groups (171 planes), and 5 fighter groups (400 planes); October 1942-11 heavy-bomber groups (385 planes), 3 medium-bomber groups (171 planes), 5 light-bomber groups (285 planes), and 7 fighter groups (560 planes); January 1943-15 heavy-bomber groups (525 planes), 7 medium-bomber groups (399 planes), 7 light-bomber groups (399 planes), and 13 fighter groups (1,040 planes).

For the next three months, Spaatz applied his organizational skills to preparing the AAF for overseas movement. He suggested on March 31 that the Eighth Air Force be made the intermediate command head- quarters between the U.S. Army European Theater of Operations and its subordi- nate AAF commands. Thus, the Commanding General of the Eighth Air Force would be not only the chief of all AAF units in the theater but also the airman responsible for overseeing both a large strategic and a large tactical air force. Official orders established the Eighth as such exactly one week later, on April 7. When Spaatz assumed command of the Eighth Air Force on May 10, the ini- tial movement of personnel and mat√©riel had already begun. Some potential organizational and command problems had also been solved. ABC-1 established the principle that the theater air forces of each nation would be treated as sepa- rate entities under the strateg
