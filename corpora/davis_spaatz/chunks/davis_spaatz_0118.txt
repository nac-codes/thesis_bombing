potential organizational and command problems had also been solved. ABC-1 established the principle that the theater air forces of each nation would be treated as sepa- rate entities under the strategic direction and command of one of the Allies. Moreover, Arnold gained Marshall's agreement that the U.S. Army in Britain would be organized along functional lines. Instead of dividing Britain into geo- 71   ## p. 72 (#96) ##############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE graphically denominated corps or army areas, each composed of a force of all arms, the senior officers of the Army Ground Forces, the Army Air Forces, and the Army Services of Supply in the theater would command only their own branch and be directly subordinate to the theater commander.

Air components would not be split up and parceled out to army ground gen- erals in charge of subregions. This arrangement relieved the theater commander of the administrative and tactical details of operating an air force and provided flexibil- ity enough to accommodate the vast air armada then contemplated for deployment to Britain. The Headquarters of the Eighth Air Force, as the highest level AAF head- quarters in England, was therefore responsible for the theater's air power. The Eighth consisted of an air force headquarters and four subordinate com- mands, each carrying the number of the overall headquarters: VIII Bomber Command, VIII Fighter Command, VIII Air Support Command, and VIII Service Command. The composition of these commands corresponded to expected func- tions. The VIII Bomber Command, consisting of heavy-bombardment groups, each containing 32 aircraft, would carry out the operational aspects of the strategic bomber offensive. Later in the war, the Eighth's heavy-bo
