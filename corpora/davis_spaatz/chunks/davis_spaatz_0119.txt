Bomber Command, consisting of heavy-bombardment groups, each containing 32 aircraft, would carry out the operational aspects of the strategic bomber offensive. Later in the war, the Eighth's heavy-bombardment groups gained authorization for a front-line strength of 48 planes. The VIII Air Support Command, made up of the medium-bombardment groups, the light-bomber groups, and the dive-bomber groups (all of 52 planes each), would provide tactical support and interdiction for the ground troops invading France from England. The VIII Fighter Command, made up of the fighter groups (75-80 planes each), would escort, according to the situation and its range capabilities, the planes of either the Bomber Command or the Air Support Command. If required, Fighter Command could also join the Air Support Command in direct assistance to the ground troops. The functions of VIII Service Command included supply and maintenance of all items peculiar to the Air Force. As the size of the Air Force increased, additional echelons appeared between the commands and the groups. First came wings, formed of several groups. Next, for the heavy bombers only, came bombardment divisions containing three to five wings. Combat aircraft equipping the three fighting commands varied in quality from poor to excellent. The B-17E, although somewhat undergunned by later standards, outclassed any other daylight heavy bomber in the world. In addition to speed and high-altitude capability, the B-17E had a rugged construction that allowed it to absorb unbelievable amounts of battle damage and still return to base. Variants of the B-17 served as the backbone of the Eighth's bombers throughout the war. The B-17E had a combat radius of approximately 750 miles.* * The combat radius is the straight distance a plane can fly from its base and return. It takes into account taxiing, taking off, forming up, and landing, and is calculated at 3/8 to 2/5 of the aircraft's rated range. 72   ## p. 73 (#97) ##################
