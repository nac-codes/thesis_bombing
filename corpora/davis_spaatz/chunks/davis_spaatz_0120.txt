It takes into account taxiing, taking off, forming up, and landing, and is calculated at 3/8 to 2/5 of the aircraft's rated range. 72   ## p. 73 (#97) ##############################################   Brig.

It was usually operated at altitudes below 20,000 feet and thus was unable to attack targets defended by heavy antiaircraft guns, which usually guarded strategic targets. It was sturdy and fairly heavily armed. American fighters did not measure up to world standards. The P-39 (Aircobra), although fast, lacked the maneuverability and altitude to contend with German fighters. It had a combat radius, allowing 10 minutes of combat, of 150 miles. The P-40 (Warhawk) had a similar combat radius. But given proper tactics and disciplined pilots, it could hold its own against the German fighters at lower altitudes. By 1942, the AAF official history acknowledged its obsoles- cence.15 The twin-engine P-38 (Lightning) was a good high-altitude heavy fighter with a combat radius more than double that of other American fighters. It could hold its own at high altitudes against German aircraft but its engines reacted badly to the unique combination of high humidity and extreme cold found over northwestern Europe during winter; it operated more satisfactorily in the warmer Mediterranean and the Pacific. Upon taking over command, Spaatz immediately began the final prepara- tions for sending the Eighth to England. Contrary to what one might suspect, the headquarters personnel of the Eighth Air Force did not consist of a group of elite officers hand-picked by Spaatz and Arnold for their dedica
