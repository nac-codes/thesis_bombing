Contrary to what one might suspect, the headquarters personnel of the Eighth Air Force did not consist of a group of elite officers hand-picked by Spaatz and Arnold for their dedication to the ideals of daylight strategic bombardment. In fact, Spaatz had inherited the Eighth Air Force Headquarters because its previous assignment, preparing for a possible invasion of French North Africa, had lapsed, leaving it available for reassign- ment. The Eighth's former Commander, Col. Asa N. Duncan, became Spaatz's Chief of Staff, and Duncan's staff continued its work for Spaatz.

A few days later General Marshall ordered the Eighth Air Force to prepare and to present to him in ten days a complete opera- tional plan.
