Hughes noted, "they had none of them ever made an operational war plan before in their lives, none of them had had the opportunity to study the problems 74   ## p. 75 (#99) ##############################################  THE EIGHTH AIR FORCE involved, and a more scared and nervous bunch of officers I have seldom seen." Hughes agreed to help and within five days he prepared a slick and plausible plan. Shortly thereafter he found himself transferred permanently to Spaatz's headquarters.16 On May 10, Spaatz and Arnold met at Bolling Field to discuss the move- ment of the Eighth to Britain and Hughes's plan. Spaatz "expressed the hope that the force would not be stampeded into premature action by political pres- sures and other influences.‚Äù17 He warned against exaggerating AAF strength and cautioned that he intended to operate on the basis of 100 percent reserves at all times, until the pipeline of replacement combat crews and machines had been put in place and filled. Spaatz wanted it understood that he would not begin combat operations until his force was ready. 18 Four days later Spaatz and Marshall met, and Spaatz again presented his (and Hughes's) basic concept of operations. The Americans meant to draw the Luftwaffe into combat and destroy it in a battle of attrition. A great air force, as Spaatz had observed in England, could not be destroyed in one or two battles. He had seen how constant action had broken the German air offensive while bringing the British themselves to the brink of defeat. It would take months of constant bleeding of experienced pilots and loss of first-line machines to draw the sting of the Luftwaffe and make a cross-channel invasion possible. 19 To force the Luftwaffe to come up and fight, the Americans intended to bomb targets of such economic or military importance that the Germans would have to defend them or lose the war. General Spaatz contended that "the full or partial destruction of Ploesti would force the enemy to defend many of tho
