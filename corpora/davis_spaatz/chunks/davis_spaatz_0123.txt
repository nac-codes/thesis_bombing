or military importance that the Germans would have to defend them or lose the war. General Spaatz contended that "the full or partial destruction of Ploesti would force the enemy to defend many of those tar- gets now considered unimportant." Once Hitler's chief source of natural petroleum in Ploesti, Romania, dried up, the synthetic oil plants of the Reich would have to be defended or Germany would be helpless to fight a modern war.20 Given the Marshall Memorandum, tactical air plans for the European inva- sion ranked high on the agenda at this meeting. Marshall discussed the strength of Nazi defenses and the necessity of reducing them. He next turned to the need for air superiority over Allied preinvasion troop concentration points and asked what the AAF could do to counter night movement of enemy armored forma- tions. Marshall also expressed concern about the AAF's capability to protect the invasion areas. Spaatz, in turn, suggested that timely reconnaissance and prop- erly stationed planes would solve those problems. He defined for Marshall the difference between air superiority and air supremacy. Air superiority meant that the stronger force could operate with freedom but could not guarantee that the opposing air force would be unable to execute damaging air raids. Air supremacy meant that the opposing air force would be completely unable to operate effec- tively. Spaatz emphasized that the cross-channel invasion required air supremacy before October, when bad weather would tie up the air arm and the plan. Marshall accepted a weather deadline of "early October" and asked Spaatz to brief Secretary Stimson.21 75   ## p. 76 (#100) #############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE  Henry L.

Spaatz replied that the original conceptions of AWPD/
