ichardson pointed out the importance of submarine production as a key target. Both generals discussed the effect of combined Anglo-American command on target selection and agreed that the Americans should retain the right to select their own targets. During the targeting discussions, Spaatz included German aircraft production, noting that the necessary rate of destruction would be twenty planes a day. With regard to fighter escorts for the bombers, Spaatz expressed the then standard AAF opinion on the defensive prowess of the B-17 as a gun platform.23 Finally, discussion turned to methods of sending the Eighth to England. Spaatz presented a plan to fly the Eighth's aircraft over a Maine-Labrador- Iceland-England ferry route. Richardson was impressed, and as he departed, indicated that Marshall, too, had expressed great optimism about the plan's suc- cess. The key element of the plan was its provision of aircraft and crews in England as early as possible. Aircraft that arrived crated and disassembled via sea transport would need to be assembled and checked out. Their entry into combat would be thus delayed. Each B-17 heavy bomber would lead four P-38 fighters. The flying of hundreds of planes across the relatively undeveloped North Atlantic route required detailed and accurate scheduling to assure the presence of vital supplies and navigation aids along the way. The plan also sacri- ficed future combat strength for immediate effect, because the inexperienced 77   ## p. 78 (#102) #############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE crews ferrying the planes would suffer attrition at a fairly high rate, while all seaborne airplanes and crews would arrive intact, provided German submarines did not sink them. Once the route had been established, as it was later in the war, regular ferry crews, rather than combat crews, delivered the planes.24 In these conferences Spaatz left no doubt in the minds of his superiors, mili- tary and civilian, about
