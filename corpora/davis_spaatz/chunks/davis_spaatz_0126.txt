it was later in the war, regular ferry crews, rather than combat crews, delivered the planes.24 In these conferences Spaatz left no doubt in the minds of his superiors, mili- tary and civilian, about what he intended to do and how he meant to do it. The Eighth Air Force, when fully prepared and only then, would be hurled en masse against vital German targets that absolutely had to be defended by the Luftwaffe. The Luftwaffe would destroy itself on the guns of the Eighth's bombers and, if possible, those of its short-range fighters. And as the battle of attrition continued in the air, the Eighth would also throttle the Luftwaffe on the ground by destroy- ing the aircraft production industry. This action would ensure air supremacy for the invasion of Europe and severely damage Germany's capacity to wage war. Spaatz's knowledge of the Luftwaffe's size, strength, and deployment came almost entirely from British intelligence. The AAF official history admitted, "When the war began, the AAF probably was more deficient in its provisions for intelligence than in any other phase of its activities." The same source also stated that the AAF remained dependent on British intelligence for the combat status of the Luftwaffe and for target information for the balance of the war.25 The British possessed reasonably accurate reports on those matters in part because of their European intelligence network26 and in part because of their breaking of top-secret German codes (known as the ULTRA secret), especially those of the Luftwaffe. The breaking of the codes enabled the British to obtain accurate readiness, location, and order of battle information on Luftwaffe com- bat formations.* This information gave Spaatz confidence in his assumptions that the Germans would continue to deploy the bulk of their air power on the Eastern Front or Mediterranean. Furthermore, code breaking could give him quick warning of any change in enemy air plans. Spaatz's strategy, given the disposition of the L
