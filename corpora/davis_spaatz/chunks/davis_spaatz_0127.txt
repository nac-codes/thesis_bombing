lk of their air power on the Eastern Front or Mediterranean. Furthermore, code breaking could give him quick warning of any change in enemy air plans. Spaatz's strategy, given the disposition of the Luftwaffe and the on-time delivery of the aircraft promised him, did not seem unreasonable. The Luftwaffe had between 4,000 and 4,400 front-line combat aircraft for most of 1942, 60 percent of them deployed against Russia, a little less than 10 percent assigned to the night fighter defenses of Germany,27 and a large contingent in the Mediterranean. Spaatz may have faced no more than 400 to 500 machines of all types, which gave a large statistical edge to his own initial strength of 512 heavy bombers and 225 fighters, plus the several thousand British bombers and fight- ers stationed in Britain. Any major German redeployment or upset of Spaatz's timetable would invalidate his calculations.28 Postwar examination of captured Luftwaffe records revealed that Spaatz faced a larger force than he had antici- * It is doubtful that in May 1942 the British were directly sharing the ULTRA secret with the AAF. However, information derived from ULTRA, but not attributed to it and suitably disguised, would have figured in the British appreciation of German air strength made available to Spaatz. 78   ## p. 79 (#103) #############################################  THE EIGHTH AIR FORCE pated. German day fighters on the Western Front began the year numbering 292 aircraft and ended the year numbering 453. In September, German day fighter strength reached a high of 574 and then dropped to 500 for the following two months.29 The most salient point of Spaatz's plans was the emphasis on destroying the Luftwaffe rather than on conducting a strategic bombing campaign against the German war economy. Spaatz would strike at important economic targets pri- marily to force the Luftwaffe to defend them and only secondarily to damage German production. He apparently muted his own beliefs in the effective
