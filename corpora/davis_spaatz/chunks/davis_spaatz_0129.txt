interest of safety, Spaatz said he could not allow the B-17s to shepherd more than four fighters each across the Atlantic. Arnold regretted the diversion of the B-17s but insisted that "certain pressure" (King) made it necessary.31 Later that morning Spaatz met with Arnold and Maj. Gen. Millard F. Harmon, Spaatz's successor as Chief of the Air Staff. The three analyzed a letter Spaatz had just received from Eaker expressing "the opinion that the R.A.F. would attempt the dispersal of our units and absorb them within the British Command."32 Because both parties accepted the assumption that the U.S. bomb- ing force would operate semiautonomously, this dispute centered on the control and basing of U.S. fighters. During the ABC talks in January and February 1941 and in a final report of March 27, 1941, the Americans had agreed to undertake the air defense of the bases of U.S. naval units in British waters and of certain other areas as well.33 In the summer of 1941, the Air Ministry and the U.S. 79   ## p. 80 (#104) #############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Observer Group made concrete plans to station U.S. pursuit groups in Northern Ireland, with the clear intention of having the Americans assume full responsi- bility for the air defense of that sector. The Observer Group further agreed to allow individual pursuit squadrons to gain operational experience by working with British units in different sectors of the British air defense network.34 The rapid buildup of tactical air forces required by the Marshall Memoran- dum and the AAF's intention of building up a large strategic bombing force led the Americans to change their opinion on the proper basing for the pursuits. Arnold expounded the new strategy to Portal in mid-April 1942. In order to gain air supremacy over Europe and to divert the Luftwaffe from the Russian front, Arnold said, the United States and Britain would have to concentrate the greatest mass of aircraft as soon as po
