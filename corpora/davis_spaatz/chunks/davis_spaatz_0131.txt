In a reply that the Air Ministry found most unsatisfactory, the RAF Dele- gation said, "You are up against a very strong determination on the part of Arnold, Spaatz, and others to concentrate the training and employment of their forces in the U.K. entirely upon proving the daylight bombing offensive can be made a success." Attempts to explain the technical difficulties to Spaatz in par- ticular had failed, but the RAF Delegation thought that he might come to accept universal fighter control once he reached Britain and experienced those difficul- ties. The delegation warned that the Americans would not easily be turned from their determination to use their pursuits primarily as escorts.37 On May 12, Chaney delivered a new proposal asking to put two fighter groups 80   ## p. 81 (#105) #############################################  THE EIGHTH AIR FORCE on fields near U.S. bombers (in the Huntingdon area) and to delay the arrival of an additional five groups.

The plan to occupy Northern Ireland had already gained the approval of the Combined Chiefs of Staff; moreover, the RAF had no objection to the proposal that the primary task of the U.S. fighters be offensive and had already offered cooperation in the early stages of the bomber offensive.

While in Britain, Arnold apparently agreed to station the first two and the last U.S. fighter groups in the Huntin
