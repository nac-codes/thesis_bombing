at Bolling Field in Washington, D.C.,52 which was soon transferred to Ireland. Spaatz knew full well that Arnold would send him crews as soon as they could make the tripâ€” well before they had finished their training. Two factors prevented this training command from completing its mission: (1) the scarcity of active U.S. combat formations (new groups were sent into combat very soon after arrival, before their training could be enhanced) and, by midsum- mer 1943, (2) the higher training level of arriving groups. In fact, because of diver- sions to North Africa and elsewhere, combat crews did not arrive in Northern Ireland for training until September 1943. The few replacements reaching the Eighth were easily handled at one of the two AAF training fields in England.53 The Eighth disbanded the training command by the end of 1943. The aircraft needed for operations arrived after a painfully slow journey over the ferry route. The first two, a B-17 bomber and a C-47 transport, arrived on July 2. Six days later a grand total of eight B-17s, seven P-38s, and five C-47s had arrived. Spaatz's reception plans for his forces were not helped by constant changes in the number of aircraft scheduled for the theater. By June 19, Arnold's original promise of February had grown by one heavy-bomber group (32 bombers), nine fighter groups (675 fighters), six medium- and six light- bomber groups (624 planes), eight transport groups (480 transports), and four observation groups (144 planes). Many of these additional 2,000 aircraft were intended to provide support for the cross-channel invasion.54 Subsequent strate- gic decisions sending groups to the Pacific or to North Africa caused numerous delays in the planned shipments for England. Not until July 27, 1943, did the Eighth report a strength of sixteen heavy bomber groups-the original figure promised by Arnold in February 1942.55 Establishing the Autonomy of the Eighth Air Force Aside from the primary task of readying his force and depl
