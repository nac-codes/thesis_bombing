The RAF, at this stage in the war, was far larger than the AAF in Britain and incomparably more experienced. The RAF had committed itself to night bombing because its own operations had shown that daylight bombing raids against Luftwaffe-defended targets produced unacceptable losses of men and machines. Therefore, the RAF wanted the Americans to abandon their attempt to bomb in daylight and to join with them in night raids. Initially, at least, the British also wanted to employ U.S. fighters to augment their own air defenses. On June 22, Spaatz paid an informal call on Rear Adm. St. G. Lyster, British Chief of the Naval Air Staff. Lyster suggested U.S. fighter protection for British shipping, a suggestion that Spaatz resisted. His fighters' primary function was U.S. bomber protection, and the instructions given to him from Arnold through Eisenhower were clear: U.S. fighters would not "be integrated with British fighter units employed in the defense of the United Kingdom, or into the British Fighter Command.‚Äù56 The following day Spaatz and Eaker drove to RAF Fighter Command to confer with Air Chief Marshal Sholto Douglas.57 Spaatz again emphasized that the primary function of U.S. fighters was to support U.S. bombers. He did con- cede, however, that his fighters would be trained in air defense procedures to assist the RAF in the unlikely event that it could not cope with a renewed German air offensive against Britain.
