d con- cede, however, that his fighters would be trained in air defense procedures to assist the RAF in the unlikely event that it could not cope with a renewed German air offensive against Britain. Douglas suggested that the most expedi- tious way to acquaint American pilots with operations was to blend U.S. squadrons with British wings until they learned procedures. Spaatz agreed to consider this suggestion. Next, Douglas “expressed the hope that eventually the U.S. Air Forces would take over an entire sector."58 Spaatz pointed out that the Americans would then have to assume responsibility for the air defense of that sector. Douglas admitted "that if U.S. forces did take over a sector, U.S. Air Forces might be called upon to furnish Fleet Arm protection."59 Spaatz deferred his decision. He continued his delaying tactics on other occasions during the summer when the RAF again made tentative attempts to gain closer operational control of the AAF in Britain. On July 7, Douglas repeated his attempt to pin down Spaatz on sector air defense. Finally, on July 15, Eisenhower and Spaatz met with Douglas and Slessor and obtained British agreement to the principle “that the integrity of the 8th Air Force must be maintained in any organizational set- up-but there was no objection to all Air Powers being under one Command."60 If not in this meeting, then at some time during the summer, Spaatz made sub- stantial concessions to the British. He allowed the attachment of his fighter squadrons to British groups for final training and acclimatization and agreed to the eventual assumption of control of British sector and group areas.61 Spaatz might well have taken the calculated risk that the integration of his fighters both 86   ## p. 87 (#111) #############################################  THE EIGHTH AIR FORCE  Air Chief Marshal Sholto Douglas, Air Officer Commanding, Fighter Command, RAF, 1942.
