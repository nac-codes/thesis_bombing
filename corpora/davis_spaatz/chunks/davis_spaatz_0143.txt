erican operations. The same day, in light of the commencement of active U.S. operations on August 17, the Eighth Air Force and the Air Ministry together held the first of a series of weekly meetings to discuss operational ques- tions. At the first two meetings, both attended by Spaatz and chaired by Slessor, the chief order of business was consideration of a joint U.S.-British directive on daylight bomber operations involving fighters.67 Modifications to suit both staffs and the approval of Eisenhower and the British resulted in the promulga- tion, on September 8, of the "Joint American/British Directif [sic] on Day Bomber Operations Involving Fighter Co-operation." The joint directive divided the development of the day bomber offensive into three successive phases and provided command procedures for implement- ing each. In phase 1, U.S. bombers would fly with combined U.S.-British fighter cover. In phase 2, U.S. fighters would escort the bombers while the British sup- plied diversions and withdrawal cover. In phase 3, the AAF would operate inde- pendently in cooperation with the RAF, a phrase ambiguous enough to allow the AAF complete control over its own operations.

The joint directive effectively laid to rest the question of inte- gration of U.S. forces into the RAF.68 Spaatz had convinced the RAF that the AAF should retain its operational integrity. Although Spaatz had fended off too close an embrace from the RAF, the "Joint Directif," at least in the minds of the RAF's top leaders, merely allowed the AAF to continue its experiment in daylight bombing.69 The British, as the New York Times had implied, did not believe it would succeed.
