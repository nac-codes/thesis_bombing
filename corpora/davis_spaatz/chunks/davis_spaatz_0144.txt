he British, as the New York Times had implied, did not believe it would succeed. Portal flatly pre- dicted failure. On September 26, 1942, he stated to Archibald Sinclair, the Secretary of State for Air, with remarkable accuracy the conditions the U.S. strategic bombers would face in October 1943: The Americans will eventually be able to get as far as the Ruhr, suffering very much heavier casualties than we now suffer by night, and going much more rarely. They will in effect do area bombing with the advantage of the absence of decoys. If it can be kept up in face of the losses (and I don't think it will be), this will of course be a valuable contribution to the war, but it will certainly not result in the elimination of the enemy fighter force and so open the way to the free bombing of the rest of Germany. I do not think that they will ever be able to regularly penetrate further than the Ruhr or perhaps Hamburg without abso- lutely prohibitive losses resulting from being run out of ammunition or from gunners being killed or wounded.70 Called Peter by his close associates, Portal was the youngest of the Combined British and American Chiefs of Staff. He had begun his military career in 1914 as a motorcycle dispatch rider. A year later he joined the Royal Flying Corps, earning a Distinguished Flying Cross and shooting down several German aircraft before the end of the war. Between the wars he served as Commander, British Forces, Aden; as instructor at the Imperial Defense College; and as Director of Organization on the Air Staff. Personally somewhat remote and cool, he nonethe- less established excellent working relationships with Spaatz, Eaker, Arnold, and Eisenhower. The British Chiefs of Staff and Churchill respected him for his strate- gic ability and brilliant intellect. Because he was virtually unflappable, he could weather the storms of Churchill's fanciful military ideas, often hurled with insult- ing vehemence by the Prime Minister at the Chiefs of Staff, and
