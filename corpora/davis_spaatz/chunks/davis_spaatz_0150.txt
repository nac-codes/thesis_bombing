that the war could not end until the Allies gained a foothold on some point now occupied by Germany, and operated from that territory against the enemy.‚Äù Harris insisted that "a prolonged bombing of the enemy's vital industry alone could finish the job." Placing troops on occu- pied soil meant supporting them, thereby jeopardizing other operations. Harris also raised the possibility of another Dunkirk disaster. Spaatz replied that "no such effort should be attempted until the Allies were certain of the results and that the propitious moment was only when and if the Allies gain complete SUPREMACY [sic] in the air."76 This discussion neatly summarized the differences between these two great practitioners of strategic bombing: Spaatz, the flexible, pragmatic disciple of Billy Mitchell, who, despite his belief that strategic bombing alone could defeat Germany, also anticipated and accepted having a large percentage of his force assigned to tactical air missions supporting an invasion of France; and Harris, the inflexible student of the great British air power advocate, Trenchard, who insisted in the face of all opposition that his bombers could win if he was given a chance to prove it. Almost two years later, when the two men actually had 5,000 bombers between them, they would find themselves unable to end the war within their self-imposed deadline, perhaps because diversions prevented them from applying the full effort of their bombers. In June 1942, Spaatz and Harris had much in common. Both had received their commands in February, and neither led a large force. Spaatz hoped to have at least 500 modern heavy bombers by January 1, 1943. Harris, despite taking great risks to get 1,000 bombers in the air for a raid over Cologne, hoped to have a similar number. Harris had mounted this large raid only by including 370 93   ## p. 94 (#118) #############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE aircraft and their half-trained crews from his operatio
