This directive continued a policy first enunciated in a directive of July 9, 1941, which called for attacks against civilian morale and the inland transportation system in Germany. The Air Ministry issued the February directive to take advantage of a newly devel- oped radio navigational aid, Gee, which promised greater accuracy in night bombing of targets within its range, 350 miles from Mildenhall. The accuracy of the system varied from 0.5 mile to 5 miles.79 Targets within range included Germany's chief industrial area (the Ruhr) and the coastal ports of Bremen, Wilhelmshaven, and Emden.80 The bombing of Germany to reduce the morale of its civilian population, especially the work force, which emphasized the targeting of city centers rather than precision targets and the use of large numbers of incendiary bombs, became an id√©e fixe with Harris. He had observed how the RAF had scattered its effort in vain attempts to bomb the Germans' transportation system, synthetic oil indus- try, and capital ships at Brest. From these failures he drew firm conclusions that Bomber Command lacked the accuracy to destroy precision targets and that any attempt to divert his force
