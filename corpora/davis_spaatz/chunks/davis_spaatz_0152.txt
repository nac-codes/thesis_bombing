From these failures he drew firm conclusions that Bomber Command lacked the accuracy to destroy precision targets and that any attempt to divert his forces to such targets should be resisted at all costs. He dubbed plans that promised to end the war by knocking out a single system of key targets "panaceas" and those who advocated them "panacea mongers." A study issued on August 18, 1941, six months before Harris's assumption of command, had already drawn attention to Bomber Command's inaccurate night bombing. The Butt Report, named for its author, D. M. Butt, a member of the War Cabinet Secretariat, had concluded, after examination of 633 photos taken by attacking aircraft, that only one aircraft in five dropped its bombs within five miles of its target. Only 7 percent of the British bombers attempting to demolish the Ruhr dropped their bombs within five miles (or within seventy- five square miles) of the target.81 The Butt Report, with its damning indictment of RAF night navigation, spurred the development of electronic navigation aids, such as Gee. The report may also have tipped the scales toward adoption of the area-bombing policy embraced by the February 14 directive by eliminating any option featuring precision night bombing. The Butt Report could only have strengthened Harris's mistrust of precision targeting. Like the majority of high-ranking British and American airmen, Harris had spent his adult life in the service. In 1914, he had joined the Rhodesia Regiment and had fought as a mounted infantryman during the conquest of German South- 94   ## p. 95 (#119) #############################################  THE EIGHTH AIR FORCE  Air Chief Marshal Arthur T.
