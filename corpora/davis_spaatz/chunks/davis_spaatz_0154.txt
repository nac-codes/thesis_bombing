litated frequent and frank exchanges of views between the two men. This easy availability for face-to-face discussions often gained Harris the advan- tage of Churchill's support and a strengthened position with the Air Ministry. Spaatz, whose position in dealing with the AAF staff was also strong, although it rested on his relationship with Arnold rather than with the head of government, nonetheless came under increasing pressure to commit his forces to combat.

When Spaatz and Eisenhower inspected a bomber group in late July, they flew a gun- nery training mission with a crew that had never fired on the range before, had just arrived from the United States, and had not even initiated crew training.
