The day after Masefield's article appeared, Spaatz held a joint AAF-RAF press conference to emphasize cooperation between the two forces and to finally launch mission no. 1. Spaatz had intended to lead the mission himself.91 Eisenhower approved these arrangements,92 with the proviso that both Eaker and Spaatz not fly on the * The decision to invade North Africa is discussed later in this chapter. 97   ## p. 98 (#122) #############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE same mission, but apparently, the British objected. What would happen, they asked, if a ranking officer were downed over occupied France and ended up in the hands of German military intelligence? Spaatz and Eaker reluctantly accepted the British view but decided that the psychological value of a general flying was worth the risk. Spaatz, however, had already learned one of the most important secrets of the war; the British had already fully briefed him on the ability of the British Government Code and Cypher School (GC and CS) at Bletchley Park to decrypt the messages of the German top-secret Enigma enciphering machine (used by all the German armed services and many civil and police organizations as well).* Spaatz obviously knew too much. Therefore, Eaker, Spaatz's deputy and Commander of VIII Bomber Command, who did not yet know the ULTRA secret,93 led Eighth Air Force heavy-bomber mission no.1, directed at the Rouen-Sotteville railroad marshaling yards.94 The targeting officer of the Eighth Air Force, Col.
