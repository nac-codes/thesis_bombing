at the French coast after being six- teen minutes late for its escort. Attacking German fighters damaged one of its planes, but the bombers seemed to have defended themselves well. Spaatz sent reports of these pinpricks to an impatient Arnold. In a hurried letter, hand-car- ried to Arnold, Spaatz wrote that the latest operations indicated "we can bomb accurately from high altitude." Spaatz further commented favorably on his bombers' ability to maintain formation, fly formation through flak, and defend themselves against the Germans' best fighter, the Focke-Wulf 190 (FW 190).99 99   ## p. 100 (#124) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE  The King and Queen of England inspecting an Eighth Air Force field with Maj. Gen. Carl A. Spaatz, summer 1942. Earlier the same day Spaatz, who said he had delayed judgment until operational experience allowed him to gauge with accuracy the value of U.S. training and equipment, had justified his actions to Arnold. "First let me say that I can imag- ine what a strain this inaction has been on you and what a lot of gripes you have had to put up with and answer. But I really believed we were justified in with- holding action with our B-17s until we could get off to a good start and am fol- lowing a similar policy with the P-38s." Then Spaatz told Arnold that critics had begun to recant: In spite of the London Times, Seversky or anyone else the B-17s are far supe- rior to anything in this theater and are fully adequate for their job. The British themselves admit this and say that with similar equipment and training they too would day-bomb. They are unanimous in their praise of our Bombing accuracy about which they had their fingers crossed until now.100 Arnold, recognized that Eisenhower because he had Marshall's complete confidence and would soon be a power in his own right, should have the best air advice available, especially if he were in charge of American air power's most important theater.
