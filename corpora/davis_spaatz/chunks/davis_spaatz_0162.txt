aatz some con- cern. On August 14, he told Arnold, "I am certain that it would be a mistake for two large Air Staffs to be built up here."103 Spaatz suggested a solution to Arnold and Eisenhower, and so, on August 21, Arnold, at Ike's request, gave Spaatz additional duties as Air Officer for ETO and appointed him head of the Air Section of the ETO staff, thus assuring the Eighth of active participation in theater planning. Earlier, on July 7, Arnold had given Spaatz a second hat by appointing him Commanding General, AAF, ETO, which did not add a plane or private to Spaatz's command, but did elevate him a step on the ETO organization charts. Before that, as Eighth Air Force Commander, Spaatz was a tactical commander and therefore was organizationally outranked by the Commanding Generals of the Service of Supply, ETO, John C. H. Lee, and Army Ground Forces, ETO, Mark Clark, who had theaterwide administrative training and doctrinal responsi- bilities. Spaatz now wore three hats (CG, Eighth Air Force; CG AAF, ETO; Chief, Air Section, ETO Staff) with one goal-keeping air power and its advocates at the forefront of the theater scheduled to receive the preponderance of U.S. wartime air strength. When Eisenhower was officially transferred to the Mediterranean in January 1943, an airman succeeded him. General Marshall's selection of Lt. Gen. Frank M. Andrews as CG, ETO placed the theater in the hands of a man committed to daylight strategic bombing. In September 1942, Arnold, eager for more materials with which to wage his air power publicity campaign on the home front, applauded Spaatz for suggest- ing photographs of bombing results. "People believe more readily what they see than what they hear," he noted, "Every daily paper in the United States will fea- ture the pictures if you can get them to us.‚Äù104 Arnold extolled the value of posi- 101   ## p. 102 (#126) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE  Maj.
