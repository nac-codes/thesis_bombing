He held press conferences in July and August. On August 23, Spaatz even allowed Arthur Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times, to accompany him on a flight to High Wycombe where Eaker would be decorated with the Silver Star. The flight almost ended in tragedy when the pilot of their plane ground-looped on landing, wiping out the props and landing gear.
