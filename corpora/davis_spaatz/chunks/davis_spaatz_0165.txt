s. Two more groups (the 93d and 306th) entered combat, while the Eighth Air Force lost its first B-24 in combat. Yet for every few steps forward there would be one backward. On October 21, the 97th Bomb Group, the Eighth's most experienced heavy-bomber formation, transferred to the Twelfth Air Force, which the Americans had formed to support the Allied invasion of French North Africa, scheduled for early November 1942. Its second most experienced group, the 301st Bomb Group, went to the Twelfth Air Force on November 8. In November, the Eighth finally matched the number of mis- sions flown in August-eight. It put 91 bombers in the air for the month's largest mission and had three additional groups enter combat (the 44th, the 303d, and the 305th.)108 These first short steps failed to please Arnold. His records showed 178 heavy bombers in England by September 30,109 but as yet no single mission had come close to matching that figure. He sent Spaatz the first of a series of mes- sages that would continue for the next sixteen months and were directed at the U.S. bomber commanders in England. Arnold sarcastically noted, "It is believed that some powerful reason must obtain which limits your heavy-bomber opera- tions to an apparent average of less than one per week. Weather conditions alone are not believed the cause, nor the preparation of some of the two hundred heavy bombers under your control in England for use in other theaters. Request full information on the subject."110 103   ## p. 104 (#128) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Arnold, who had never led a unit in combat, never seemed to appreciate fully the difficulties involved. Spaatz, Andrews, and Eaker repeatedly had to defend their seemingly dismal operational readiness rates which, in the autumn of 1942, could be attributed in large part to bad weather and training requirements. Before Spaatz could field all the bombers on hand, he had to finish training their crews,
