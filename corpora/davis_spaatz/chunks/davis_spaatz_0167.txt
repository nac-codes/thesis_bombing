In reply to Arnold's criticism, Eaker wrote, "Three hundred heavy bombers could attack any target in Germany with less than four percent losses." A smaller number of bombers, which would lack the self-defensive strength of the larger force, would suffer greater losses. "The daylight bombing of Germany with planes of the B-17 and B-24 types is feasible, practicable and eco- nomical."114 In the next year, the Luftwaffe day-fighter force would amply demonstrate the inaccuracy of Eaker's and Spaatz's initial assessments.
