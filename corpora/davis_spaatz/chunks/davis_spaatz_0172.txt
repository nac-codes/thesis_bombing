d of the American forces in Britain by his mentor, Marshall, supported it, as did Spaatz. During the weekend Spaatz contended that a cross-channel invasion in 1942 had a better chance than one in 1943. He based his reasoning on the condition and disposition of the Luftwaffe. In July 1942, the German summer offensive had taken Sevastapol and broken through Soviet defenses toward Stalingrad. This offensive had absorbed the bulk of the Luftwaffe's resources and would obviously do so for several more months. During the winter months the Luftwaffe could rehabilitate itself and would therefore be a much more formidable oppo- nent in 1943 than in 1942.126 Spaatz repeated this position,127 but he and the rest of the Americans failed to move the British in ensuing meetings. On the day Marshall arrived in England, Churchill and the British Chiefs of Staff met and unanimously decided that the proposed autumn 1942 cross-channel invasion "was not a feasible or sensible operation."128 Because the British would be supplying most of the resources required in any action, their refusal to go along ended all prospects of an early invasion. When the U.S. delegation reported this impasse to the Presi- 107   ## p. 108 (#132) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE dent, he replied with a list of alternative U.S. actions against Germany, but indi- cated a preference for U.S. actions against French North Africa. Marshall bowed to the inevitable and agreed to a U.S.-British invasion of French North Africa code-named TORCH. By July 30, Roosevelt and Churchill made their tentative agreement on a North African campaign. The Allies' decision to invade French North Africa by November 1942 had important long-term and short-term effects. It undermined large-scale U.S. heavy-bombardment operations launched from the British Isles and postponed the cross-channel invasion until 1944. More immediately, TORCH or its ramifica- tions required that Spaatz substantiall
