U.S. heavy-bombardment operations launched from the British Isles and postponed the cross-channel invasion until 1944. More immediately, TORCH or its ramifica- tions required that Spaatz substantially modify his plans and expectations from midsummer to the end of 1942 and beyond. On August 6, he received a letter from Arnold detailing, with what turned out to be undue optimism, the final results of the Marshall-King-Hopkins mission to London: 1. The cross-channel invasion would be abandoned for the year. 2. The air buildup in Britain would continue. 3. TORCH would be executed. 4. More aircraft might be diverted to the Pacific. 5. A TORCH planning unit would be created in London. The letter contained a postscript: "I have just agreed with General Marshall that Doolittle will go to England at once as Commander of Air Forces for TORCH."129 By selecting Brig. Gen. James H. Doolittle, America's reigning air hero, Arnold at least assured the AAF that it would receive extensive press coverage of its role in TORCH, whatever that role might be. Subject to Spaatz's and Eisenhower's approval of Doolittle, the Eighth had made its first contribution to the North African venture-its air commander. Doolittle had been slated to command the 4th Bombardment Wing (Medium) for the VIII ASC. He checked into WIDEWINGS the same day, August 6. TORCH not only delayed the cross-channel invasion, it slowed the buildup of the Eighth. In mounting the North African invasion, the Allies had accepted the necessity of assuming a defensive posture in operations against the Germans from Britain. As a consequence, Britain for the time being no longer required a rapid buildup in air power to support a ground offensive. The North African invasion would consume resources and shipping originally destined for Britain. All this meant that the U.S. bomber offensive mounted from England would start considerably later and with far less force than that envisaged prior to July 1942. The shift to TORCH disconcer
