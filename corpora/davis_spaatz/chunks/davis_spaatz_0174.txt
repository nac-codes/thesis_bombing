The shift to TORCH disconcerted Spaatz. He believed that the Eighth was making great progress. He had even somewhat optimistically convinced himself that "the presence here now of 200 B-17's would be a major factor in crippling German air power and insuring air supremacy next spring."130 In a letter to Arnold, he wrote that he was "much concerned about possible diversion of units 108   ## p. 109 (#133) ############################################  THE EIGHTH AIR FORCE from the Eighth Air Force. . . .
