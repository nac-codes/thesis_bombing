On September 23, Doolittle assumed command, with Vandenberg as his chief of staff.133 By October 24, the day Headquarters Twelfth Air Force embarked for North Africa, the Eighth had supplied 3,198 officers, 24,124 enlisted men,134 and 1,244 planes for JUNIOR. Until well into January 1943, 50 percent of the Eighth's on-hand supplies and much of its main- tenance work were devoted to the Twelfth. Well might Spaatz ask, "What is left of the Eighth Air Force after the impact of TORCH? We find we haven't much left."135 The creation of the Twelfth Air Force prompted a disagreement between Spaatz and Eisenhower. On September 8, the two discussed the problems caused to the AAF, ETO, by having to raise the Twelfth while the Eighth simultane- ously flew operational missions. Eisenhower solved the problem very simply. He ordered Spaatz to cease all combat air operations by the Eighth at once.136 The next day Eisenhower cabled Marshall his proposals on how to conceal the halt. 137 From Spaatz's point of view, Eisenhower's decision was the worst possible. It delayed the entire AAF bomber offensive for an indeterminate period. If it provided an opportunity to justify the diversion of yet more AAF strength to subsidiary theaters, it might prove fatal to AAF hopes and deleterious to the morale of the Eighth's service and combat personnel. Spaatz apparently wasted no time in appealing to Arnold. On September 10, Arnold cabled Eisenhower, "You and Spaatz are urged to continue intensive air operations until the last pos- sible moment as the Eighth Air Force is now accomplishing the mission for which it was intended: (a) draw the GAF [German Air Force] from other fronts, (b) attract the attention of German fighters, (c) reduce German war effort by bombing important targets."138 On the same day, Spaatz gave Eisenhower a draft cable he wished to send to 109   ## p. 110 (#134) ############################################  SPA
