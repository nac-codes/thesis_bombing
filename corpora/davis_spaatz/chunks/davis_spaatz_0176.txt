German war effort by bombing important targets."138 On the same day, Spaatz gave Eisenhower a draft cable he wished to send to 109   ## p. 110 (#134) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Arnold in which he forcefully expressed his disagreement with Eisenhower's order to halt operations. Spaatz was certain that missions from North Africa would not be as effective against the Luftwaffe and German war strength as those from Britain. He argued that "new operations jeopardize acquisition of air supremacy over Germany and may have serious effect on successful outcome of war"139 and warned that air operations would be delayed for at least two months. Eisenhower persuaded Spaatz not to send the cable. Instead, he modified his position, cabling Marshall: "Ground elements of U.S. Air Squadrons in U.K. that are set up for service in the expeditionary force are compelled to begin packing of equipment immediately. Nevertheless, provision is being made to carry on at least two bombing missions a week."140 Apparently, Spaatz was able to convince Eisenhower that the Eighth could devote maximum attention to organizing the Twelfth while continuing to bomb Europe. As long as Spaatz realized that TORCH had overriding priority, Eisenhower was willing to allow him to salvage the bomber offensive. In the end, harsh northern European weather limited the Eighth's bombers to four raids in September, three in October, and eight in November. Although the rate of operations was only half of that authorized by Eisenhower and far less than that hoped for by Spaatz and Arnold, it at least gave the crews and commanders experience and probably kept some German attention focused on northwestern Europe. While the Eighth continued to aid JUNIOR, Spaatz pursued two courses of action with equal vigor. He provided unstinting cooperation in all phases of the Twelfth's growth while doing everything possible to maintain the Eighth as a viable fighting force capable
