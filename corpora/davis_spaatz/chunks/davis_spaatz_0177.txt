He provided unstinting cooperation in all phases of the Twelfth's growth while doing everything possible to maintain the Eighth as a viable fighting force capable of sustaining a strategic offensive against Germany. He failed in the latter but not through lack of effort. In a series of letters to Arnold, whose views were identical to his own, Spaatz attempted to further his fight for the AAF bomber offensive. Noting unanimous British praise of the Eighth's bombing accuracy, he began, "I am more confident than ever before that the war can be won in this theater if we are permitted to carry out the poli- cies which were built up under your command."

Because TORCH was turning the ETO into “a 100% 110   ## p. 111 (#135) ############################################  THE EIGHTH AIR FORCE air theater of operation" until the mounting of a cross-channel invasion, Spaatz wrote that, in conjunction with the RAF, he needed only 20 heavy-bomber groups (960 planes), 10 medium-bomber groups (570 planes), 10 fighter groups (800 planes), 10 photo reconnaissance/weather squadrons, and 2 transport groups (supply carriers) to attain "complete aerial supremacy" over Germany w
