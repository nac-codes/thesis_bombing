Spaatz at midnight, August 26, to inform him of the message's contents, and Spaatz and his staff worked until six in the morning to gather background material.145 Spaatz and Eaker enthusiastically supported Arnold's attempt to refocus U.S. strategic thinking. Spaatz, deciding to send Eaker along with Hansell because he recognized the "vital importance of the forthcoming decision," wrote to Arnold: Hansell is thoroughly familiar with my ideas, and Eaker's ideas as of opera- tions, etc., exactly parallel mine.
