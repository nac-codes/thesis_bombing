Roosevelt, in typical fashion, gave each side half a loaf; the Navy got the groups for the Solomons campaign, but AWPD/42's basic assumptions and all but 8,000 of its production requirement of 139,000 planes in 1943 were approved. By the end of the year, production realities reduced the aircraft goal in 1943 to 107,000.151 In conjunction with AWPD/42, Arnold asked Spaatz to enlist the aid of key commanders in the ETO for the AAF position 152 Spaatz complied, producing messages from Patton, Clark, and Eisenhower. Eisenhower's message to 112   ## p. 113 (#137) ############################################  THE EIGHTH AIR FORCE Marshall on September 5 shows Spaatz's handiwork: "We are becoming con- vinced that high altitude daylight precision bombing is not only feasible but highly successful and that by increasing the scale of attack, effective results can be obtained."153 Eisenhower's request for the 20 heavy-bombers, 10 medium- bombers, and ten fighter groups that Spaatz had already determined would be needed so pleased Arnold that he told Marshall, â€œI believe that this cable is of such great and immediate importance as to warrant the presentation of its con- tents to the President and to the Joint Chiefs of Staff." Arnold asked Marshall to make the presentations to enhance its effect.154 Apparently he did. TORCH siphoned off the Eighth's operational groups and changed its bomb- ing priorities. Transatlantic shipping, which formed the centerpiece for the oper- ation's logistical planning, had become the objective of both the German and Allied navies in the Battle of the Atlantic, the outcome of which was still in doubt between September and November 1942 as German submarines continued to sink Allied shipping as fast as it could be produced. Thus, the Eighth embarked on a campaign against German submarin
