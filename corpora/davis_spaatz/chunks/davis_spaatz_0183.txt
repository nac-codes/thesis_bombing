well into 1943. As with so much else, TORCH was its inspiration. "Please understand," he wrote, "that the decision for undertaking the special operation is now completely out of my hands and it is upon that basis that I have insisted that it and the United Kingdom operations are complementary.‚Äù Because TORCH could not be averted, perhaps it could be deflected or at least be made to serve other AAF goals. TORCH should go forward with all possible support; 113   ## p. 114 (#138) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE therefore any units that helped to ensure its success, such as the Eighth, should be as strong as possible, too. 157 Arnold soon concluded that coordinating the efforts of the Eighth and Twelfth would best be accomplished by a single USAAF commander super- vising operations in both Britain and Africa. That officer would be directly subordinate to the overall U.S. commander, Eisenhower. Arnold also con- cluded, pari passu, that only one man had the proper qualifications for the post-Spaatz. As Maj. Gen. George E. Stratemeyer, Chief of the AAF Staff, noted, Arnold had expressed a desire for Spaatz to remain at Eisenhower's side and provide him with AAF advice. Stratemeyer told Spaatz, "You really should be designated as the Commanding General, American Air Forces in Europe," not just of the ETO. Such "a request to place you in that position should come from Eisenhower, and I am sure that it would be approved here."158 Spaatz discussed the suggestion with Eisenhower, but then rejected it on the ground that the already thin ranks of experienced staff officers would be diluted if yet another headquarters were created. 159 This was not an idle objection; throughout the war, the Achilles heel of the AAF was its shortage of adequately trained staff officers. 160 Although Eisenhower had initially agreed with Spaatz that an overall USAAF commander was not needed, he gradually came to side with Arnold, but for his own reasons.
