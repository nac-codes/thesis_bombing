quately trained staff officers. 160 Although Eisenhower had initially agreed with Spaatz that an overall USAAF commander was not needed, he gradually came to side with Arnold, but for his own reasons. He accepted the AAF's contention that a bombing offensive should be waged from Britain but thought it should come after the conclusion of TORCH. He wanted to strengthen the Eighth immediately to use it as a reinforce- ment pool for North Africa,161 believing that once bases were set up along the African Mediterranean littoral, Africa and Britain would form a "single air the- ater" in which air power could be' concentrated at any point to take advantage of weather conditions or strategic opportunity.162 On October 29, Eisenhower requested Spaatz's support for his own plan of a unified AAF command "from Iceland to Iraq." He had apparently obtained clari- fication on the War Department's view of a unified command. A single theater would help keep resources from the Pacific, an appeal that two separate the- aters-Europe (Britain) and North Africa-competing against each other would lack. If TORCH succeeded so that a unified command was possible, Eisenhower intended to place Spaatz in the position of "Supreme Commander of all U.S. Army Air Forces which came under his command, and to advocate the inclusion of U.S. Army Air Forces in the Middle East also in that same command."163 He instructed Spaatz to prepare a plan for implementation of his proposal within thirty days. 164 By the eve of the invasion, which started on November 8, 1942, Spaatz seems to have resigned himself to being Eisenhower's chief air officer in North Africa, although he would far rather have stayed in Britain to direct the Eighth Air Force. In a series of mid-November letters, Arnold and Stratemeyer urged Spaatz's appointment. On November 13, Stratemeyer wrote Spaatz, â€œYou 114   ## p. 115 (#139) ############################################  THE EIGHTH AIR FORCE should get yourself appointed as overall co
