They also give not only an in-depth analysis of the tactical air power experience of another major air service, the Royal Air Force (RAF), but trace the influence of thought within the RAF on the emergence of AAF doc- trine. During the campaign in North Africa (see Map 3, Operation TORCH Area), the U.S. Army Air Forces in Europe and their commanding general, Carl A. Spaatz, met and overcame fundamental problems in the employment of air power. At the campaign's opening, Spaatz left his task-that of introducing the strategic U.S. Eighth Air Force to limited combat operations from a secure and logistically sophisticated base area in Britain—to assume entirely different duties in North Africa. There he directed combined Anglo-American strategic, tactical, and coastal air forces in the midst of sustained combat at the end of an attenuated supply line. As the leader of tactical forces, Spaat
