Chief U.S. Army and Navy planners had limited the role of AAF personnel to provid- ing air details concerning tactical support to the invasion task forces rather than to employing air power in the Mediterranean at large. Ten days before the opera- tion started, Spaatz confessed to Doolittle that he had never understood the “what, when, and where" of the Twelfth Air Force's assigned mission and func- tion.2 AAF planners did, however, convince Eisenhower on one point—that the British and American air forces should be commanded directly by Eisenhower rather than by a subordinate air commander in chief.3 The original invasion plan had called for an overall air commander, but Eisenhower said, "I accepted representations made to me, principally by American airmen in whom I had the greatest confidence, that the projected use of the American and British air forces involved such a wide geographical dispersion that unified command would be impracticable."4 This advice, consistent with his thinking, probably came directly from Spaatz.
