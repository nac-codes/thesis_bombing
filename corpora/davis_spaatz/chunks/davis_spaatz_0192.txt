aatz prepared and presented to the Combined American and British Chiefs of Staff (CCS) during the King-Marshall-Hopkins mission of July 1942 provided for an organization exactly like the one Eisen- hower adopted for TORCH. The July plan explicitly admonished that "there must be no subordination of U.S. Air Units, and no attachment to R.A.F. units." Instead, the plan specified, "there will be unity of command through the Task Force Commander. He will use his two air forces, British and American, as a Corps Commander would use two division commanders, without subordinating one to the other."5 Even when the two air forces operated in the same area, let alone widely separated ones, the AAF would not subordinate itself to the RAF. This failure to set up a combined air command before the invasion hamstrung the efficient application of Allied air power during the first crucial month of the campaign. Spaatz erred in his resistance to possible RAF domination. Although under- standable, his loyalty to the AAF weakened his military judgment. Of course, the example of General John J. Pershing, Commander of the American Expedi- tionary Forces to Europe for World War I, influenced the U.S. Army leaders of World War II who had served their apprenticeships in the ranks of his forces. (Except for a few cases of extreme emergency, Pershing had adamantly refused to place his forces under the command of his French or British allies.) In other preinvasion planning for TORCH, only the U.S. Navy consented to a combined command with its British counterpart. The U.S. Army and the AAF, for what- ever reasons, did not.6 For the landing phase of the invasion, the inexperienced Twelfth Air Force, designated the Western Air Command, assumed responsibility for supporting the Casablanca and Oran task forces, both composed entirely of U.S. forces.
