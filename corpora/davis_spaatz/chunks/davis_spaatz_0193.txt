The combat-experienced RAF supplied the Eastern Air Command (EAC) to assist the chiefly British Algiers task force. The EAC had a planned force only one-third the size of the Twelfth's-454 planes of all types, many of them short-ranged Hurricane and Spitfire fighters. The EAC also had responsi- bility for air operations to the east of Oran, including Tunisia. Once French North Africa capitulated and Fascist Spain appeared quiescent-a situation that released the Allied forces assigned to watch those areas the Twelfth had no strategic role other than to support the drive on Bizerte.7 Inexperience hampered the AAF's effectiveness.

For one, I had to learn my job, and I worked hard at learning it."8 Doolittle, the short, stocky, forty-five-year-old son of a carpenter, had a devil-may-care image that masked a man of surprising substance. In the 1920s and 1930s, he won several international airplane speed races, including the Schneider Trophy for seaplanes in 1925 and the first Bendix Trophy for transcon- tinental speed in 1931; in taking the Thompson Trophy in 1932, he also set a new speed record. As one of the most famous pilots of his day, he had the same aura of mystery and death-defying courage that clings to modern-day astronauts. Doolittle had, on occasion, shown bad judgment. On a trip through South America in 1926, when he was under the influence of alcohol during a stopover in Santiago, Chile, he fell from a second-story window ledge and broke both ankles. Yet he finish
