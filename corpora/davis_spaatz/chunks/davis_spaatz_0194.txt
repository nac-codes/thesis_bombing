On a trip through South America in 1926, when he was under the influence of alcohol during a stopover in Santiago, Chile, he fell from a second-story window ledge and broke both ankles. Yet he finished the journey, including air shows and stunts, by flying in leg casts. On other occasions Doolittle engaged in wingwalking or sat on a biplane's wheel spreader or axle while it landed. Unlike many AAF leaders, Doolittle was not a career officer or a West Pointer. He had joined the Army in April 1917, transferred to the Aviation Section, and served there for thirteen years, until early 1930, before resigning to join Shell Oil. While in the Air Corps he earned a doctorate in aeronautical engi- neering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At Shell, Doolittle worked to develop 100-octane aviation fuel, a prerequisite for the advanced and more powerful piston-driven engines that would equip U.S. aircraft in World War II. Recalled to duty as a major on July 1, 1940, he acted as a troubleshooter at various aircraft plants. In late January 1942, Arnold assigned Doolittle, by then a lieutenant colonel, to command Special Project No. 1, a combined Army- Navy effort to strike Tokyo with Army bombers flying from a Navy aircraft carrier. "Doolittle's Tokyo Raid," sixteen B-25s launched from the USS Hornet on April 18, 1943, once more catapulted Doolittle into national prominence.
