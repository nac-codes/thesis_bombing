The AAF and the nation, saddened by the surrender of U.S. and Filipino forces in Bataan in early April, rejoiced over a genuine hero.

Arnold assigned him the command of the Eighth Air Force's 4th Bombardment Wing, a medium-bomber wing being formed.

He suggested Doolittle for the XII Bomber Command or command of the air supporting the
