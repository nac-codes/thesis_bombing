hs of hard work to change Eisenhower's opinion. The Twelfth's top remaining leaders had little or no more combat and administrative experience than their commander. North Africa, in the winter of 1942–1943, proved an unforgiving locale for the conduct of air operations. The division of the Twelfth into two parts, each directly subordinated to its invasion task force commander (Maj. Gen. George S. Patton in Casablanca and Maj. Gen. Lloyd R. Fredendall in Oran), put the two sections of the air force 365 miles apart by air. The route trav- eled by the ground echelons from Casablanca and Oran to the front would, naturally, be more arduous and less direct. Furthermore, the task force com- manders' reluctance to give up command of their air assets prevented the Twelfth from gathering its full force. Part of the Twelfth remained tied to the U.S. Fifth Army in Morocco to watch the Spanish. Although portions of the AAF would eventually travel the entire 1,065 miles from Casablanca to Tunis, the Luftwaffe and the Reggia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) were more favored by geography. They had major depots in Sicily, which was 160 miles from Tunis, and Naples, 375 miles from Tunis. The Axis powers also seized the only four all-weather, hard-surface airfields in the 127   ## p. 128 (#152) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Tunisian plain,* which gave them a considerable advantage over the Allies, who operated from unimproved dirt fields in the eastern Algerian highlands. When the rainy season began in December 1942, these fields immediately turned into mud puddles. The Allies had only one hard-surface field east of Algiers, at Bône, 115 miles from the front. (See Map 4, Allied and Axis Airfields on the Northern Tunisian Front.) To add to the confusion in the initial phases of the campaign, RAF and AAF units operated from the same airfields. All supplies for the forward units of the Twelfth would have to move along the feeble colo
