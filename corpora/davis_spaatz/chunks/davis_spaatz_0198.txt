d to the confusion in the initial phases of the campaign, RAF and AAF units operated from the same airfields. All supplies for the forward units of the Twelfth would have to move along the feeble colonial road network and one overworked, single-track rail line from Algiers. In addition, the Twelfth lacked mobility. Aircraft might travel far and swiftly, but they remained tethered to their ground echelons. The ground eche- lons required considerable motor or rail transport to keep pace with the rapidly changing front lines characteristic of modern warfare. Already hampered by frangible French railways, the AAF in North Africa had to prevail over a chronic shortage of motor transport. The Twelfth started the Tunisian campaign under- strength in trucks because invasion planners, facing the usual premium on ship- ping space confronting any large-scale amphibious invasion and envisaging a static role for the AAF, had pared the Twelfth's motorized components to a min- imum. The Oran task force carried no two-and-one-half ton trucks, and only 50 percent of all types of organizational vehicles. The Casablanca task force sailed with 100 percent of its men but only 50 percent of its mat√©riel.16 U.S. ground units moving to support the advance of Lt. Gen. Kenneth A. N. Anderson's 1st British Army into Tunisia aggravated the transportation shortage by stripping away much of the Twelfth's shrunken allocation of motor transport. The Eastern Air Command suffered the same hardships. It had requested shipping for enough motor transport to make its ground echelons 100 percent mobile, but was allocated only half of its request.17 Many vehicles immediately fell into different hands. One air observer reported that new units' "Senior Officers and others were in the habit of commandeering vehicles as soon as they were unloaded in ALGIERS, without regard to whether they were consigned to their unit or not. When no longer needed, these vehicles were abandoned by the wayside."18 The original
