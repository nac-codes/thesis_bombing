or the United States, or on convoys in the middle of the Atlantic. Communications and intelligence problems also plagued the Twelfth at the start of the campaign. The French telephone system, at best primitive and ineffi- cient, soon failed under the demands placed on it. Atmospheric conditions unique to North Africa hindered radio transmission, as did lack of modern equipment and half-trained signals personnel.19 In many instances motorcycle couriers had to carry the load.20 Moreover, the Twelfth had no military intelli- gence. All its operational information came from the British; there were thus delays in planning and consequent delays in missions. U.S. Air Support Doctrine Before Operation TORCH U.S. ground and air forces started the North African campaign with an untested air support doctrine. Because of the AAF's position as a combat arm subordinate to the Army rather than as a service independent from the Army like the RAF, the ground forces, rather than air, had the decisive voice in determin- ing official doctrine.

TR 440-15 also stated that the "Air Service is an essential arm in all major operations. The organization and training of all air units is based on the fundamental doctrine that their mission is to aid the ground forces to gain decisive success."21 TR 440-15 authorized strategic bombardment operations under favorable conditions and after the defeat or neutralization of a hostile air force if it was "based on the broad plan of operations of the military forces."22 The advent of General Headquarters Air Force (
