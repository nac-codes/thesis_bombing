This revision placed GHQ AF under the commander in chief in the field in wartime, and under the Chief of Staff of the Army in peace- time. The revision gave the GHQ AF three functions: 1. Operations beyond the sphere of influence of the ground forces; 2. Operations in support of the ground forces; and 3. Coastal frontier defense.

In addition, the GHQ Air Force Commander could be directed by the commander-in-chief in the field to "support designated operations of an army with all or with a specified part of GHQ Air Force in accordance with the instructions of such army comman- ders."23 Yet the 1935 version of TR 440-15 represented a significant step for- ward in the eyes of air officers, in that it recognized a role for strategic bombard- ment equal to that of ground support. It is important to remember that strategic bombing offered the airmen an institutional advantage not offered by tactical operations. Strategic operations were independent of the Army and could be used to justify an independent air arm. Tactical operations, in contrast, would always be in cooperation with ground forces and difficult to separate from them-hence the airmen's constant attempts to advance strategic air and their lack of interest in tactical air. Adolf Hitler's aggressive, revanchist foreign policy of 1936-1939 and the outbreak of war in Europe led to the reexamination of U.S. Army air doctrine.
