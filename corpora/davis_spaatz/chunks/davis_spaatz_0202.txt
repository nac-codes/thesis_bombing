tler's aggressive, revanchist foreign policy of 1936-1939 and the outbreak of war in Europe led to the reexamination of U.S. Army air doctrine. On April 15, 1940, War Department Field Manual 1-5 (FM 1-5) superseded TR 440-15 of October 15, 1935. The authors of FM 1-5 intended it to be the com- prehensive rubric for the employment of all types of U.S. military aviation.

With only minor changes these findings became FM 1-5.24 Although the manual emphasized the role of air power in the defense of the United States and its possessions, it provided for a strategic air offensive to "decisively defeat important elements of the enemy armed forces" or to "deprive the enemy of essential war material.‚Äù25 In its discussion of air operations in sup- port of ground forces it laid down the following instructions: The hostile rear area is the normal zone of action of support aviation, since operations in this area permit the full utilization of striking power against con- centrated targets with the minimum of losses and the maximum of results. Support aviation is not employed against objectives which can be effectively engaged by available ground weapons within the time required. FM 1-5 also observed that "aviation is poorly suited for di
