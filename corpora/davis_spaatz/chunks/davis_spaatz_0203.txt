. Support aviation is not employed against objectives which can be effectively engaged by available ground weapons within the time required. FM 1-5 also observed that "aviation is poorly suited for direct attacks against small detachments or troops which are well entrenched or disposed." 131   ## p. 132 (#156) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE The manual addressed the control of tactical air as well, stating that, in gen- eral, centralized control at the theater level maximized effectiveness, but noted: When decentralization becomes necessary in situations requiring immediate tactical support of specified units, the superior commander may attach to or place in support of specified large units a part or all of his support aviation. Support aviation may thus act with greater promptness and better understanding in meeting the requirements of the supported unit. When combat aviation is employed for immediate tactical support of surface forces, the requirements of the supported force will be of paramount importance in the selection of objec- tives for air operations.26 In theory, the manual should have supplied a reasonable compromise solu- tion to the ground forces' desire for control of support aviation in a battle situa- tion and the desire of elements of the Air Corps to centralize the control of all tactical air under an airman. In practice, all would depend on the attitude of the theater commander, who would almost certainly be a ground officer. In that case, Air Corps officers feared that he would routinely attach air support units directly to his field armies or corps and ignore the strictures on centralization of air command. Army and corps commanders, whose attention would be focused solely on the attainment of their own immediate objectives, would be slow to release the attached air units and would invariably be unable to cooperate effec- tively with each other in a timely enough manner to take advantage of air's ab
