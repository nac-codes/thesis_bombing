FM 1-5, however, reflected the increased influence of the Army Air Corps within the structure of the Army and the development of an aircraft capable of strategic bombardment, the B-17. No longer, as in 1926, could the ground forces impose doctrine by fiat. A series of important prewar Army maneuvers in Louisiana and North Carolina in 1941 showed the extent of the rift between the ground forces and the air forces. As the Army ground forces sought to adapt to the German method of blitzkrieg warfare, they clashed with the Army Air Forces, which had a different set of priorities. The ground forces, looking at the war in Europe and seeing the successes of the German army acting in close concert with the Luftwaffe, a force designed for ground support, formed armored divisions and an armored corps to fight the new war. To work effectively, these new corps required large-scale close air support to form a combined-arms team capable of fighting the Germans on equal terms. Thus they needed modern planes for training and an air support communications network and support team to function at full capacity. The AAF had difficulty supplying those items. The AAF, studying the war in Europe, realized it would need an air defense network and a strategic bombing campaign to weaken the Germans before attempting an invasion of the Continent, if that proved necessary. The needs of the ground forces took lower priority. The Western Allies were buying hundreds of modern warplanes and the AAF's own training programs were consuming 132   ## p. 133 (#157) ############################################  THE RACE FOR TUNISIA most remaining aircraft production, leaving few aircraft for air support training.
