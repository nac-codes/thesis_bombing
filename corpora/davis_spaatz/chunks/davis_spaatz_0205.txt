Given these conflicts, prewar maneuvers had proved unsatisfactory. Ten days before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Arnold noted the poor coordina- tion between ground and air during the North Carolina and Louisiana maneuvers that he and Marshall blamed on the "lack of knowledge of fundamentals on the part of both the Air and Ground elements."27 Air and ground officers did not know air communications techniques and procedures, proper employment of their own forces for air operations, and the characteristics and limitations of air itself. Arnold informed Spaatz that Marshall wished to hold a series of command post exercises at Fort Benning in Georgia for all major combat commanders of the Army. "The first one should be started off," recommended Arnold, â€œwith a general discussion by all present as to exactly what Air Support means and how it is to be carried out, so that the fundamentals may be discussed frankly and all present get some ideas of what can and should be expected."28 U.S. entry into the war increased the intensity of the dispute between air and ground. The Army reorganization of March 9, 1942, institutionalized the dispute by giving air and ground the same degree of power and prestige. In that reorga- nization the AAF and the Army Ground Forces (AGF) became separate and equal organizations under the Army General Staff and the War Department. If, as in 1926, one arm or the other could have imposed its will, at least one of them would have been content. Or if a virtually unlimited number of planes had been available, both sides could have had adequate air resources for strategic bomb- ing and ground support, as was the case in 1944-1945. On April 9, 1942, the War Department promulgated a manual on air support based on the lessons of the prewar exercises, War Department Field Manual 31- 35 (FM 3
