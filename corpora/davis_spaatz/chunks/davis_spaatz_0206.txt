d support, as was the case in 1944-1945. On April 9, 1942, the War Department promulgated a manual on air support based on the lessons of the prewar exercises, War Department Field Manual 31- 35 (FM 31-35), "Aviation in Support of Ground Forces." Air historians have charged that it created many of the AAF's ground support woes early in the war. The AAF official history said of FM 31-35, "The outstanding characteristic of the manual lay in its subordination of the air force to ground force needs and to the purely local situation."29 Yet the AAF itself had issued the manual. The Army Air Support Staff Section had drafted the manual. Its successor in the March 1942 reorganization, the Directorate of Ground Support, had produced the finished copy. In fact, the manual attempted to reconcile irreconcilable air and ground posi- tions. It was not intended to speak to any aspect of air power other than air sup- port. The manual devoted more than half of its text to a detailed exposition of the air-ground communications network rather than to doctrines of employment. It placed an air support command-along with fighter, bomber, and base com- mandsâ€”within a theater air force, all under the control of an airman. The manual offset this arrangement by noting that the air support command would be habitu- ally attached to or designated to support a particular field army. Within the air support command, all control was centralized in the hands of its commander, an airman, who would assign missions as the needs of the ground units developed. 133   ## p. 134 (#158) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE If required, however, an aviation unit could be "specifically allocated" to the support of subordinate ground units.30 In such a case, the aviation unit would receive its orders from an air support control unit commanded by an airman and co-located at the command post of the supported unit. The overall air support commander retained the right to a
