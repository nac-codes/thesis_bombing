right time rather than using a few aircraft to hit widely scattered targets. Other factors included attention to time and space factors (distance from air bases, speed of communications, readiness status of aircraft, etc.), the inherent flexibil- ity of air power to concentrate on short notice, and the necessity of the air sup- port command to cooperate with other air elements in the same area. The manual's procedures for selecting targets raised the ire of pro air power critics, who focused on one paragraph: "The most important target at a particular time will usually be that target which constitutes the most serious threat to the operations of the supported ground force. The final decision as to priority of tar- gets rests with the commander of the supported unit."33 This lifting of one para- graph from its context distorted the balanced intent of the entire manual, which was not an encomium for the doctrinal positions held by the ground forces. Ground force officers objected to the centralized control of air support aviation inherent in the air support command; they favored the direct attachment of air units to the units they supported.34 FM 31-35 satisfied neither the ground forces nor the air forces, which was perhaps the true measure of its attempt at objectiv- 134   ## p. 135 (#159) ############################################  THE RACE FOR TUNISIA ity. If it proved wanting on the battlefield, it was because most of the American air and ground commanders in North Africa were inexperienced in combat and half-trained in the air support procedures laid down by FM 31-35 or ignorant of its provisions. The issuance of FM 31-35 did little to solve the U.S. Army's and AAF's ground support training deficiencies. In front of War Department, Navy, and British army observers the AAF botched its share of a corps-level demonstration at Fort Benning on June 13, 1942.35 This demonstration, conducted under the command of Maj. Gen. Lloyd R. Fredendall, included units of the 1s
