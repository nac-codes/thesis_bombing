the AAF botched its share of a corps-level demonstration at Fort Benning on June 13, 1942.35 This demonstration, conducted under the command of Maj. Gen. Lloyd R. Fredendall, included units of the 1st Infantry Division. Both the division and Fredendall would play large roles in North Africa. In July 1942, Maj. Gen. Jacob L.

When informed of the complaint, Arnold tartly replied that the armored forces had the best the AAF could supply and that he hoped to have sufficient quantities of light bombers and observation planes to meet ground force requests in full by the end of the year.36 In September Devers complained directly to Arnold of "lots of talk but no real action because there is a great shortage of equipment.‚Äù He pointed out spe- cific shortcomings in bombardment, observation, and communications units attached for training. "I stick to my opinion," said Devers bluntly, "that there is no air-ground support training. We are simply puttering. Cannot something be done about it?" Arnold replied that he had no modern heavy-bombardment, medium-bombardment, or fighter units available because all such units and their replacements were committed to active battle fronts.
