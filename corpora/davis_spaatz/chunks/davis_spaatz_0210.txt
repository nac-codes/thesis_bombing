oncluded by saying that he would continue to push for modern aircraft for training as soon as they became available.37 If the state of air-ground training of the armored forces, which had the highest priority, needed bolstering as late as September 1942, one can only imagine the status of the Army's remaining divisions and of the forces assigned to the North African invasion. Lt. Gen. Leslie J. McNair, Commander of the Army Ground Forces, admitted on December 30, 1942, "So far as I know, there is no U.S. ground unit overseas which had air-ground training before leaving the U.S., other than the superficial occasions incident to large maneuvers."38 Clearly *Arnold's mention of North Africa referred to Egypt where the British Western Desert Air Force (assisted by a handful of AAF units) was supporting Lt.

The British air planners for the invasion, perhaps constrained by security considerations, which prevented direct contact, took no notice of the combat proven air support advances made by their own forces in the Middle East.39 The British 8th Army and the Western Desert Air Force (WDAF), thanks to the hard lessons learned at the hands of the German Afrika Korps, had developed both an effective air support team and a modified air support doctrine based on close air- ground planning and communications. The British North African contingent for TORCH ignored that example and instead produced a plan similar to that of the advanced a
