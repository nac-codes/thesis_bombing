The next day the heaviest air attacks to date hit exposed Allied tanks and infantry, while the Germans organized their defense. By November 27, the 1st Army had one squadron of Twelfth Air Force P-38s (25 planes) at Youks-les-Bains, two squadrons of RAF Spitfires (36 planes) at Souk el Arba, and two squadrons of RAF Spitfires and one of Hurricane fighter- bombers (54 planes) at Bône available for both air superiority and close air sup- port operations. These planes had a serviceability rate of only 50 percent and Spitfires had no bombing capability. The aircraft at Bône provided air defense for the port and arriving convoys and were not always available. In fact the 139   ## p. 140 (#164) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE British did not use fighter bombing to support their front-line troops in the cam- paign until December 15.47 The Luftwaffe countered those planes with a force of approximately 81 fighters and 28 dive-bombers based in Tunisia. In the entire Mediterranean the Germans possessed 1,220 aircraft, of which more than 512 were operating against TORCH by November 12 and some 850 by December 12. At the same time they raised the number of their transport aircraft from 205 to 673.48 Anderson naturally found the air situation unsatisfactory. He called off his attack on November 29 partly because "the strain of persistent dive-bombing was beginning to tell." He complained further that air attacks on Bône had seri- ously disrupted his supply lines and said, "This week was notable for the heavy scale of enemy air attack, particularly by dive-bombers, to which the leading troops were subjected, and which our own air forces were at this stage unable to prevent."49 Here, the inexperience of Anderson's troops, their light scale of anti- aircraft armament, and their lack of ammunition pr
