his com- manding officer "decided to postpone the discussion of the organization of the Air Force until I [Spaatz] could complete a brief visit to the principal establish- ments in the North African Theater."55 As Spaatz emerged from the Gibraltar meeting, he learned that his chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Asa N. Duncan, had ditched his B-17 into the Atlantic. Subse- quent air search unearthed no trace of his plane, its crew, or passengers. The AAF had lost a valuable, experienced officer, and Spaatz had lost a friend. The tour itself was hardly a case of veni, vidi, vici for Spaatz.

He and Doolittle left Gibraltar for Africa on the morning of November 18. At Oran, Spaatz noted its excellent repair facilities and "great numbers of [AAF] men who knew what they were doing and who were going about it in a fast and orderly fashion.” He gathered a somewhat different impression at Algiers, par- ticularly of its major air facility, Maison Blanche, which he found overcrowded as well as unsuitable for deployment of B-17s. Its location put the heavy- bombers too close to the front, leaving them too exposed to enemy counter- strikes. Typically, Spaatz observed that "the place lacked organization.” After a quick stop at Gibraltar to inform his superior of his findings, he flew to Casablanca on November 20. There he conferred with Brig. Gen. John K. Cannon, Commander of the Twelfth Air Support Command (XII ASC). "Uncle Joe" Cannon, although not one of the top AAF decision makers, was only a step below the Arnold, Spaatz, Eaker, and Andrews echelon. Cannon had taken flight training in 1921, had gradu- ated from the Air Corps Tactical School and the Command and General Staff School in the 1930s, and had led the First Air Force's Interceptor Command in 1941.
