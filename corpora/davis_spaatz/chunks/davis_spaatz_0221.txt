ssary road and rail transport for their forward fields. Eisenhower's directive chafed the U.S. airmen because its restrictions placed them under the command of a ground force general whose ideas of air power seemed, at best, hazy. Spaatz agreed to broach these problems to Eisenhower as soon as possible.63 On December 3, Spaatz established his headquarters. Craig had responsibil- ity for liaison between the Twelfth and Eisenhower's headquarters, AFHQ, while Air Vice-Marshal James M. Robb would handle liaison duties between the EAC and AFHQ. Spaatz also decided to assign deep bombing missions (in cur- rent USAF terminology, "deep interdiction" missions) against enemy supply lines to the Twelfth and support of ground operations to the EAC. The light- and medium-bomber units of the Twelfth would be attached to the EAC when the congested supply situation in the forward fields eased.64 Spaatz's decision to divide his forces, with one force devoted exclusively to bombing missions behind the enemy's lines and the other devoted solely to the support of ground operations, departed from the then current AAF doctrine of a composite air force, a self-sustaining unit capable of all types of combat and support missions. Of course, the composition of the forces at hand made his decision almost mandatory. The EAC was equipped largely with fighter and other light aircraft, whereas the Twelfth had the only heavy bombers dedicated entirely to the theater. This functional division of December 1942 cleared the way for the AAF to concentrate on daylight precision bombing while giving to the RAF the responsibility of ground support for the 1st Army. It also helped to relieve the increasing congestion of aircraft in the forward airfields.
