airfields, Tafaraoui, located a short distance from Oran, had a hard-surface runway but no hard-surface dispersal areas. It reported 285 planes mired in the mud,70 giving rise to a ditty about "Tafaraoui where the mud is deep and gooey." In the three weeks from the December 3 meeting to Christmas Eve, Spaatz drove himself and his staff to prepare for a renewal of the Allied offensive. He called the theater's four aviation engineer battalions from Oran and set them to work east of Algiers. Despite the loss of two battalions' worth of equipment in ships that did not reach North Africa and despite confused unloading at the over- crowded North African ports, the engineers performed well. By December 12, the 809th Aviation Engineer Battalion had finished a single well-drained airstrip at Telergma, the start of a medium-bomber airfield complex. Spaatz sent the heavy bombers to Biskra at the end of a spur of the French rail system, on the fringes of the Sahara desert. There an engineer company completed a field in four days.71 Spaatz ordered every available air transport to ferry bombs, ammu- nition, fuel, and supplies of all sorts to the front in order to keep his forward fields supplied. As usual, he traveled, visiting Maison Blanche on December 15 (where he noted little improvement since his November 18 inspection), to Anderson's headquarters on December 20 (where Anderson expressed concern that Welsh would not properly support Lawson), and to Biskra on December 21 to check bomb supplies. To increase the effectiveness of planning he prodded his chief of intelligence to get photo reconnaissance in order, especially in front of the 1st Army, so that both the army and air forces could determine bombing targets. Next, he ordered daily early-morning flights over the front line to give air planners some idea of the weather. He did his best not only to improve com- munications between his headquarters and forward airfields but also to establish links that would enable a unifi
