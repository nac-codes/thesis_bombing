to give air planners some idea of the weather. He did his best not only to improve com- munications between his headquarters and forward airfields but also to establish links that would enable a unified air command for the theater. All this attention to detail had little immediate effect. Spaatz did not command "general weather."72 On December 24, after three days of rain had rendered all forward airfields unser- viceable,73 Eisenhower postponed any major offensive for six weeks. By the end of December, Allied air had not gained air superiority or estab- lished effective air support arrangements. Air attempts to cut down the flow of supplies across the Mediterranean to the Axis bridgehead also had encountered difficulties. From November to December, Axis seaborne supply tonnage received in Tunisia increased by 60 percent from 12,627 tons to 21,437; airborne supply tonnage grew sixfold, from 581 tons to 3,503. But because a portion of this increase represented a partial diversion of shipping from Libyan ports over- run by the British, whose supply tonnage dropped by 19,000 tons in December, the total amount of supplies received by the Axis forces in Africa actually decreased by 8,000 tons or almost 25 percent.74 145   ## p. 146 (#170) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Despite the increase in Axis tonnage to Tunisia, Allied interdiction of Axis shipping to Tunisia improved, too-from no Axis supplies shipped to Tunisia lost in November to 23 percent lost in December.75 Throughout the Mediterranean the Allies sank 17 ships of over 500 tons deadweight in November (12 by air) and increased that total to 32 (14 by air) in December.76 Apparently most of the shipping losses to air occurred on runs to the Libyan ports. American heavy and medium bombers concentrated their attacks on Tunisian ports, causing disrup- tion, delays, and some damage. Because Tunisian dock workers refused to unload under the constant bombing,77 debarking t
