When engine trouble delayed Craig's return flight, Tedder urged him to visit Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Coningham, Air Officer Commanding, Western Desert Air Force (WDAF), at Marble Arch, Tripolitania.

As two modern British military historians have pointed out, the growth of cooperation necessary to form and successfully operate a combined-arms team of any sort-be it artillery-infantry, tanks-infantry, or air forces-army- was slow and del
