s have pointed out, the growth of cooperation necessary to form and successfully operate a combined-arms team of any sort-be it artillery-infantry, tanks-infantry, or air forces-army- was slow and delicate, requiring time, copious amounts of goodwill, constant human contact, and careful training. Combined-arms cooperation did not become fully functional instantly or merely by decree.86 In their excellent history of British military theory, Shelford Bidwell and Dominick Graham present a thorough history of the development of British air support. They begin by noting that the RAF had begun the war with the inten- 148   ## p. 149 (#173) ############################################  THE RACE FOR TUNISIA tion of intervening on the battlefield only in ground emergency. The dividing line between ground and air operations would be the range limit of army artillery.87 When this plan proved unworkable during the campaign in France, it was discarded in favor of closer air force-army cooperation, which the RAF fostered by forming the Army Co-operation Command. Its commander, Air Marshal Arthur Barrett, and his two chief subordinates, Army Lt. Col. J. Woodall and Group Captain A. Wann, produced an outstanding solution to the problem based on an army-air control system created entirely by Woodall as a result of logical analysis.88 Woodall's system had four chief components: 1. The requirement for a properly equipped air formation reserved for the direct support of the field army but under RAF control. This formation would have two tasks: to shield the army from air attack by offensive action against enemy air and to apply airborne firepower on the battlefield itself, coordinating closely with ground operations. 2. A specially trained army staff (Air Liaison Officers-ALOS) able to explain air methods and limitations to soldiers and army methods of operation, planning and situation to pilots assigned to the missions. 3. A joint command post or control center, the Army Air Control C
