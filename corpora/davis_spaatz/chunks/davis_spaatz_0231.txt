This linking of ground units to the air formations supporting them through only one intervening element greatly speeded up the delivery of air support to the forces needing it. In addition, each headquarters in an army had a signals section, called a "tentacle" (because of its appearance on an organization chart of the communications net- work), with a signals officer and a staff officer trained in air support.89 When Coningham arrived in the desert, he found the WDAF and the British 8th Army smarting from the rough handling they had received in a costly, failed attempt to relieve the Axis siege of Tobruk (Operation BATTLEAXE). Both ser- vices saw the need to integrate their efforts. Into the breach stepped "Mary," who added the newly created air-ground method to ongoing joint exercises. In September the British army and the RAF published "Middle East Training Pamphlet No. 3: Direct Air Support." The communications network envisaged by this pamphlet mirrored the network proposed by Woodall and even called the jointly staffed Air Support Control Headquarters (ASCs) established at each corps and armored division headquarters "tentacles." Coningham had apparently gone Woodall one better by prov
