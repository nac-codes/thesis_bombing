adjacent 8th Army/Western Desert Air Force Headquarters. The fighter group relieved Coningham's headquarters of the burden of detailed operational control, leaving WDAF Headquarters free to concentrate on planning and overall direc- tion of operations. 150   ## p. 151 (#175) ############################################  THE RACE FOR TUNISIA The fighter group control center contained an army gun operations room,* an air controller, a duty signals intelligence officer ("Y"), an operations officer, and two forward bomber control officers. They plotted aircraft tracks on their operations table and had the radio equipment for controlling aircraft. All bomber, fighter-bomber, and tactical reconnaissance missions were coordinated through the control center. The fighter group headquarters and control center were located as close as possible to the majority of the airfields, which enabled rapid communications by secure ground lines.93 This modification. curtailed the role of the AACC and the tentacles, reducing them to the status of a specialized com- munications network divorced from command. Coningham's cardinal principle was that the enemy air force had to be driven from the sky before any other air operations could succeed; hence maximum force must be focused on an initial counterair campaign. He deplored the em- ployment of air assets in scattered groups and small numbers, called "penny packets," tied closely to ground troops and conducting purely defensive func- tions. Penny packets prevented the concentration of force necessary to win the crucial counterair battle. The achievement of air superiority by aggressive offen- sive action against enemy aircraft and airfields freed friendly air forces to exer- cise their flexibility and capacity for rapid concentration at the decisive point. When conditions did not require concentration, an air force which possessed air superiority could roam over and behind the battlefield at leisure, harassing or destroying enemy ground fo
