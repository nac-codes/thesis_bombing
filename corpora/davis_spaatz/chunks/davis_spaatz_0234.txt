cisive point. When conditions did not require concentration, an air force which possessed air superiority could roam over and behind the battlefield at leisure, harassing or destroying enemy ground formations and supply lines. As a corollary, Coningham believed in the centralized control of air operations by an airman working closely with, but not directly under supervision of, the ground commander. Although Coningham put his air headquarters in a tent adjacent to Mont- gomery's own, he maintained that air officers had trained for their task and ought to be allowed to do it without kibitzing from soldiers with little idea of, or sympa- thy with, air problems. The RAF's independence from the army greatly assisted Coningham in the realization of his ideas.94 Coningham lost no time inculcating his strictures to Craig, who proved a willing convert. Criag's initial report gave Spaatz, and through him the AAF hierarchy, additional insight into British methods. Unfortunately, Coningham's and Montgomery's newfound skills made little difference in the early stages of the North African campaign. The Americans had yet to put their doctrine into practice, and the British had not yet fully assimi- lated the lessons of the Western Desert. Not until February 1943, did the hard- learned experience of the Western Desert Air Force begin to influence all the Allied forces in Africa. *The army gun operations room coordinated RAF activities with army artillery to prevent guns and aircraft from interfering with each other's missions and from attempting fire missions better suited to either air or ground capabilities. For instance, aircraft could not safely fly into an area already under artillery fire, but could fly sorties beyond artillery range. There was no need to send aircraft to attack a target undergoing the more accurate fire of artillery. 151   ## p. 152 (#176) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Within a few days after Christmas 1942,
