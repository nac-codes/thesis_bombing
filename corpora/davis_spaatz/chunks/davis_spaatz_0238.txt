gn was a logistical nightmare. By the end of November, the forward airfields were so overloaded that Eisenhower's Assistant Chief of Staff for Air, Air Vice-Marshal A.P.M. Sanders, reported that it was "imperative that no more U.S. air squadrons should be brought to the East from the Oran and Casablanca areas until the situation regarding airfields and supplies to them can be improved." Sanders added sternly, "It is useless to send operational air units to them [forward airfields] until transportation and communications to keep them effectively supplied and controlled can be established" [emphasis in original].103 In December 1942, Spaatz made solid, if unspectacular, progress toward solving logistical problems, but because of those problems he made less head- way in the gaining of air superiority, the provision of close air support, and the interdiction of enemy supply. Successful tactical air operations required superi- ority in aircraft at the front-and superiority could be achieved only by having an overwhelming number of aircraft at all points or by concentrating the planes available at key points. Both necessitated better logistics. More planes needed more fields and supplies. Concentration at key points needed better command and control of available aircraft. The Allied Air Force was created to clarify lines of command and thereby 153   ## p. 154 (#178) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE ease the ability to concentrate both air forces on one objective. Control of air- craft in the air, which would greatly increase the offensive and defensive power of Allied fighters, awaited the delivery and installation of adequate radio and radar equipment, another function of the logistics system. In the next phase of the campaign Spaatz directly addressed the problem of tactical air. 154   ## p. 155 (#179) ############################################  Chapter 5 Failure and Reorganization (January-March 1943) I have mentioned the
