ns. While admitting that Spaatz and his other American friends were "a bit unwarrantably cockahoop" over the success of their early raids, Slessor spoke of their professionalism and resolve to suc- ceed, concluding, "I have a feeling they will do it."9 On October 16, Churchill sent a message to Harry Hopkins that the achieve- ment to date by the B-17s' shallow penetrations, under mainly RAF escort, "does not give our experts the same confidence as yours in the power of the day bomber to operate far into Germany." Churchill asked Hopkins to look into the matter "while time remains and before large mass production is finally fixed."10 The Prime Minister expressed himself more bluntly within his own government. In a note on air policy he predicted a disaster for the Americans as soon as they ventured out from under British escort. Churchill suggested diverting the Ameri- cans to antisubmarine patrols and night bombing. As for U.S. aircraft produc- tion, Churchill urged that the Americans take up night-bomber production on a large scale.11 Sinclair immediately took up the challenge. The Americans had come to a critical point in their allocation of air priorities, he said, and if the Prime Mini- ster pressed for conversion to night bombing, setting himself "against their cher- ished policy of daylight penetration," he would confound the very groups in the U.S. military that wished to build up big bomber forces in England during 1943 and 1944: It would be a tragedy if we were to frustrate them on the eve of this great experiment. To ally ourselves with the American Navy against General Spaatz and General Eaker and the United States Air Force in this country, and to force them into diverting their highly trained crews to scaring U-Boats instead of bombing Germany would be disastrous. It would weaken and alienate the very forces in the United States on which we depend for support in a European as opposed to a Pacific strategy and for the production of heavy bombers as dis-
