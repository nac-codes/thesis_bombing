He, too, repeated the fear that premature opposition to daylight bombing would lead to the commitment of U.S. resources to other theaters. 15 On November 21, Portal took the additional step of asking the RAF Delegation in Washington to press Arnold for an attack on Germany "at the earliest possible moment without waiting for the build-up of a very large force." The inability of the AAF to bomb the Reich weakened Portal's defense of not only the shipping priorities for the aviation fuel, personnel, and supply requirements of the Eighth Air Force but U.S. bombing policy as well.16 Churchill remained unconvinced.

During the previous two months he had "become increasingly doubtful of the daylight bombing of Germany by the American method." If his ally's plan failed, "the consequences will be grievous." The collapse of daylight bombing would stun U.S. public opinion, disrupt an industrial effort increasingly committed to production of bombers unsuitable for night work, and render useless the tens of thousands of American air personnel and their airfields in Britain.17 Perhaps for domestic political reasons (a certain percentage of the British population objected to the ubiquitous presence of their Allies*), the large, seemingly useless mass of AAF personnel in Britain (which would eventually be dwarfed by the million Americans in Britain before the Normandy invasion) particularly raised the Prime Minister's ire. He returned to it time and again in the course of the debate. No
