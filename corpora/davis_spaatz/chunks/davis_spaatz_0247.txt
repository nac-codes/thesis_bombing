By the end of November 1942, transfers to the Twelfth Air Force left only 23,000 AAF personnel in England. The January 1943 rolls carried 36,000 personnel.

He admit- ted that the RAF might be wrong in its perception that the Americans would pick up their toys and go to the Pacific if threatened, but his officers were con- vinced that "any attempt to divert the American Air Forces from the function for which they have been trained to a subsidiary role over the sea or in secondary theaters would be fiercely resented and vigorously resisted." If daylight bomb- ing proved unsuccessful, the Americans themselves would abandon it and turn to night action. "They will not turn aside from day bombing," estimated Sinclair, "till they are convinced it has failed; they will not be convinced except by their own experience."20 Writing just a few days before the Casablanca Conference, Sinclair counseled patience, advising that at the present stage it would be wrong to discourage the Americans from what might still be a successful experiment.21 All this drew an exasperated retort from Churchill. The Americans had not even begun their experiment and when they did, it could take four or five months to convince them one way or the other: Meanwhile I have never suggested that they should be "discouraged" by us, that is to say we should argue against their policy, but only that they should not be encouraged to pe
