While every effort should continue to be made to achieve success by day, it is important to arrange that, if the daylight bombing of Germany proves impracticable, it will be possible to convert the United States Bomber Command from a primarily day to a primar- ily night force with the least possible delay and loss of efficiency.25 If he had not earlier received warnings from friends on the RAF staff, Arnold must have quickly learned from them after receiving the memo that it reflected the Prime Minister's opinions.
