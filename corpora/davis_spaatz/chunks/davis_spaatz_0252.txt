at Casablanca, Spaatz talked to both heads of government. He apparently left his meeting with Churchill and went directly to Roosevelt, with whom he met from 10:00 A.M. to 11:30 A.M. No official record of the meeting exists, and Spaatz did not refer to it in his records. Only Elliott Roosevelt, one of the President's sons, left an account. According to the younger Roosevelt, Spaatz explained the operational difficulties encountered in Tunisia, such as the lack of replacement planes and hard-surface runways, and spoke of the problems of combined command and the difficulty of serving under Tedder.31 The reference to Tedder does not ring true.

It seems likely that Spaatz also spoke of daylight bombing, given (1) the British threat to it, (2) his familiarity with the AAF's troubled efforts in Europe, and (3) Roosevelt's, Churchill's, and Portal's questioning of Arnold during the confer- ence on the Eighth Air Force's failure to bomb Germany.32 If Churchill contin- ued to press for conversion to night bombing, Roosevelt would have to be per- suaded to resist. Churchill's reversal, however, eliminated the need for special and immediate support from the President. 163   ## p. 164 (#188) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE While at Casablanca, Spaatz also discussed operations and organization with Marshall, Portal, and Arnold.33 Arnold, no less frustrated than Churchill over the Eighth Air Force's inability to bomb Germany, had hard questions. Spaatz did his best to lance his chief's frustration before it came to a head. Years later Spaatz recalled, "I remember having a heart to heart talk with Hap, walking along the beach. We talked very, very frankly about da
