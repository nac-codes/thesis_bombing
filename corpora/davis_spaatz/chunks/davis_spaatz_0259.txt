Because he did not move his headquarters, the commanders of the XII ASC, who had co-located their head- quarters with Fredendall's, had no problem maintaining contact with him or set- ting up semipermanent communications facilities with their subordinate air units. And despite his refusal to help the French, Fredendall did not interfere unduly with the operations of the XII ASC. Col. Paul L. Williams, who led the XII ASC from late January to the end of the campaign, noted in an official report, "General FREDENDALL and General PATTON both stated in sub- stance, 'Don't wait for us to order air missions, you know what the situation is, just keep pounding them.‚Äù46 The lack of air-ground teamwork between II Corps and XII ASC was more the fault of XII ASC than of II Corps. Frequent changes of command, assign- ments, and stations robbed the XII ASC of the continuity of training and cooper- ation with familiar ground units necessary for ground support work.

In the midst of the German counterattack of January 18-25 (described later), Doolittle wrote to Spaatz that although Craig was a brilliant staff officer and one of the AAF's exceptional plann
