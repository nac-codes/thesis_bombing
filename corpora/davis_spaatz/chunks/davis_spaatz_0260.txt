fidence. In the midst of the German counterattack of January 18-25 (described later), Doolittle wrote to Spaatz that although Craig was a brilliant staff officer and one of the AAF's exceptional planners and organizers, his current job did not suit his capabilities. Doolittle suggested that Craig move to the XII ASC Detachment with Clark and that Col. Paul L. Williams replace him. Of Williams, Doolittle said, "Williams is better suited as a result of experience and temperament to command and lead combat units in support of ground troops in an extremely active forward area."47 The next day, January 21, Spaatz sent Williams to the XII ASC, noting that Craig would become Tedder's chief of staff in the coming Casablanca-dictated air reorganization.48 The XII ASC now had its third commander in three weeks, two of whom had had no chance to become acquainted with its personnel, its condition, and the troops and ground commander it supported. This switch occurred precisely when a German counterattack against the French XIX Corps contributed to the Allies' disjointed air response. Beyond its unfamiliar leaders the XII ASC suffered under many operational handicaps. The rainy season limited operations and turned the airfields to mud. The airfields themselves were too distant from the front lines and meagerly 170   ## p. 171 (#195) ############################################  FAILURE AND REORGANIZATION equipped. Insufficient logistics and lack of experience, already cited, contributed to a very low operational ready rate, subtracting even more planes from the com- mand's order of battle. The XII ASC had two further problems. (1) It lacked radar coverage of its front. This cut down its warning and reaction times to German air operations and forced it to rely on chance sweeps to catch German aircraft aloft or on their fields. The Germans, who had complete radar coverage, avoided these sweeps. Their dive-bombers would merely land for five minutes or so until the Allied aircraft p
