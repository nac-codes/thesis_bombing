ces shifted to the south. Once again, the Axis gained key passes from the French, especially the Faid Pass, which could serve as a jumping-off point for attacks on II Corps' main supply depot at Tebessa and the airfields at Thelepte. Sandy soil conditions, which promoted excellent drainage, allowed Thelepte to operate in any weather, a crucial factor in Tunisian air operations. Axis dive-bombing attacks harassed the Americans, particularly during an unsuccessful U.S. attack on the village of Maknassey. One German air attack on January 31, 1943, struck a U.S. infantry battalion aboard a truck convoy in daylight, causing substantial casualties.57 The Allies remained on the defensive at the beginning of February as Rommel's forces joined their comrades in Tunisia and prepared to take the 172   ## p. 173 (#197) ############################################  FAILURE AND REORGANIZATION offensive before Montgomery's British 8th Army could come to the assistance of Eisenhower's forces. The Germans began the so-called "Battle of the Kasserine Pass" by breaking out of the Faid Pass and seizing the important crossroad at Sidi Bou Zid. They continued forward, capturing several positions, including Thelepte, by February 17. On February 20, under the eyes of Rommel himself, Axis forces stormed the Kasserine Pass, badly damaging several units of the U.S. 1st Armored Division. At that point Allied defenses stiffened. The Axis, concerned about the approach of Montgomery and their own lack of sup- plies, began to withdraw from the Kasserine Pass on February 22. They were pursued only hesitantly by Allied ground forces, who reoccupied the entire pass by February 24. This withdrawal ended the largest Axis attack of the campaign and gave them a tactical victory but produced no strategic effect. The Allies soon replaced their heavy losses in men and mat√©riel. This summary of ground operations outlines the campaign's events in the winter of 1942-1943. The activities of Spaatz and of Allied
