d No. 242 Group made up the bulk of Kuter's new command.63 In Algiers, Spaatz began a round of meetings that would take him to Cairo and back. On January 24, he met Arnold, who had come directly from Casablanca. They decided to equip all AAF fighter units in Britain only with P-47s—a deci- sion that would free all P-38s then based in Britain for deployment to Africa. This key decision, based in part on operational necessity and in part on logistical consid- erations, deprived the Eighth Air Force of the long-range escort fighters it would need to protect its deep-penetration operations over Germany. It demonstrated the AAF's refusal to accept the need for long-range escort for strategic bombers as the highest priority. Late on January 26, Spaatz left Algiers for Cairo and, upon arriv- ing the next morning, joined in three days of discussions with Tedder, Arnold, Andrews, and Maj. Gen. Louis H. Brereton, the Commanding General of the Ninth Air Force, to settle the details of the new Allied organization in the Medi- terranean.64 He returned to Algiers on January 31. On February 4, in the wake of another Axis thrust, Spaatz flew to Constantine. That evening he and Brig. Gen. John K. Cannon called on Maj. Gen. Lucian K. Truscott, Eisenhower's representative at the front, to inform him of their inten- tion to visit Fredendall's II Corps Headquarters the next day. During their visit, Spaatz elaborated on his own views toward the use of aviation in conjunction with ground operations: "It was a mistake to use up all of one's force in an inde- cisive operation; the air force should be used to hit the soft parts of the enemy and in return to protect the soft parts of one's own force; and only in the event of an all-out decisive engagement was the loss of a whole force to be risked.”65 The next day, Spaatz and his party traveled to Tebessa to meet Anderson, who had apparently come south to discuss future operations with Fredendall.66 Once again, the conversation turned to air
