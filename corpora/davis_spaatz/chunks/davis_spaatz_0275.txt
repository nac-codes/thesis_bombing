Allied staff to the lowest feasible level served as a template for the organization of the Allied Expeditionary Force, which later conducted the cross-channel invasion into France. This close associ- ation with the RAF had an important side benefit for the AAF, which managed to cloak itself in the RAF's independent status and thus free itself from some of the more irksome restrictions inherent in its role as a subordinate part of the U.S. Army. Spaatz, for example, participated in Allied command conferences as an equal to his ground and naval opposite numbers rather than as an air adviser to the American ground force commander. The reorganization also embraced the logistical support of Allied air power in North Africa. Brig. Gen. John Cannon became the head of the Northwest African Training Command, and Brig. Gen. Delmar Dunton formed the Northwest African Air Service Command from the XII Air Service Command and the main- tenance organization of the Eastern Air Command.76 In one of their first actions after establishing the NAAF, Spaatz and Tedder met Eisenhower on February 17 and gained his agreement that air support should function very much along the principles previously in operation with 8th Army and Alexander. It was understood that this means in general that the decision and needs of the ground army are of paramount impor- tance, and that the element of decision as to type of operation must rest with the Army commander. Eisenhower, however, allowed the air commander to determine all matters of technique and forces employed.77 This concession by Eisenhower gave XII ASC more operational flexibility. Coningham's arrival at 18 Army Group Headquarters on the same day, February 17, allowed Allied air power to widen this initial and significant con- cession by Eisenhower. Upon assuming command on February 23, the New Zealander promptly put the Northwest African Tactical Air Force into operation according to his own principles. The flying of defensive umbrellas over
