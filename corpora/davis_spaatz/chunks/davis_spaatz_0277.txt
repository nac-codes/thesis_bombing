entralization of control of tactical air under him, and his location with Alexander solved the personality problems of the old EAC. Anderson, with his defensive attitude, was removed from his position in charge of allocation of tactical air. Welsh and Lawson were replaced and sent elsewhere. Welsh spent the rest of the war exiled to the United States as head of the RAF Delegation. When Spaatz took over the Allied Air Force in the beginning of January he had recognized the pair's inability to cope with Anderson. Because Spaatz controlled them and not Anderson, he had rec- ommended their replacement then and there. Portal, who apparently assumed that Spaatz wished to dispose of Welsh because Welsh outranked him, objected to U.S. interference in internal RAF matters,81 reprieving Welsh and Lawson for six weeks. By that time Tedder presumably had informed Portal about the true state of affairs. 182   ## p. 183 (#207) ############################################  FAILURE AND REORGANIZATION No matter how effective the experienced Alexander-Coningham air-ground team would prove in the long run, it could not change the situation in a day.

On the first day of the offensive, February 14, the XII ASC mounted 391 sorties as opposed to 360 to 375 German sorties.82 The Germans were more effective, but the large number of U.S. sorties gave a hint that the balance might soon tip in the Allies' favor. By February 16, the XII ASC reported a total operational strength of sev- enty-six Spitfires, twenty-seven P-39s, and twenty-four A-20s. The 33d Fighter Group and its P-40s had withdrawn to refit on February 9. The Spitfires of the 31st Fighter Group and two-thirds of the 52d Fighter Group replaced it.83 Both air forces maintained their effort through February 16, but bad weather for the next five days hampered Allied air operations.
