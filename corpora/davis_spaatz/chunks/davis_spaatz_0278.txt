Group and two-thirds of the 52d Fighter Group replaced it.83 Both air forces maintained their effort through February 16, but bad weather for the next five days hampered Allied air operations. On February 18, the enemy advance forced the XII ASC to evacuate its forward fields at Thelepte, requiring it to destroy thirty-four unserviceable planes and 50,000 gallons of aviation fuel. In two days the Americans had lost forty-two planes. The clouds and rain finally cleared on February 22, when the XII ASC, disorganized by its retreat from Thelepte and operating from one overcrowded field (Youks-les-Bains) with only a single steel-plank runway, flew 304 sorties and lost only eleven planes. On the evening of February 22 the Germans began their retreat, and for the next few days British and U.S. aircraft punished their retiring columns with increasing effect. Rommel later recorded, â€œThe bad weather now ended and from midday [February 23] onward we were subjected to hammer-blow air attacks by the U.S. air force in the Feriana-Kasserine area, of weight and con- centration hardly surpassed by those we had suffered at Alamein."84 During the critical period of February 20 to 24, Coningham had also had the strategic bombers placed at his disposal. Instead of complaining about delays imposed by enemy air, ground leaders began to note improvement. On February 25, Eisenhower observed, "The Air Force is now better organized, is well sorted out and operating efficiently."85 In January and February 1943, Allied ground and air leaders sought to answer the question of who should have ultimate control of the theater's limited air assets. Later in the war such a question would not have arisen because the overwhelming number of aircraft then available to the Allies made it possible to supply simultaneously the need of the ground commanders for battle-line sup- port and the need of the air commanders for counterair and supply-line strikes. The Casablanca Conference imposed an air command st
