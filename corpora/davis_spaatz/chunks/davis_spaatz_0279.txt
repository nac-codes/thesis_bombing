The Casablanca Conference imposed an air command structure on the theater that supplied an air chain of command separate from the ground forces. This for- mal structure, however, would have meant little if Eisenhower had continued to allow his ground commanders to set air priorities. He who sets priorities controls the allocation of resources.
