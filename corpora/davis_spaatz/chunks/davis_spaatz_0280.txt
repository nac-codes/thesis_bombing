und Forces or our Air Forces.¹ -Eisenhower to Arnold, May 2, 1943 The reorganization that produced the Northwest African Air Force (NAAF) and introduced the air support team and new procedures enhanced the efficiency of Allied air power. It was the catalyst that enabled the disparate air elements present in North Africa to redirect their efforts to the task at hand-defeating the enemy. The improved logistical situation, which occurred at approximately the same time as the reorganization, proved an equal factor in advancing Allied air fortunes. The end of the rainy season in mid-April allowed the Allies to greatly accelerate operations from their forward fields.
