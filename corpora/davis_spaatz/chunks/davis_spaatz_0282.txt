to form a quick and accurate picture of the position of his own and of the enemy's frontal aviation. Complete coverage enabled the air commander to divert or abort tactical bomber and reconnaissance flights from enemy fighters and, at the same time, made it possible for him to use friendly fighters either defensively to break up incoming enemy air attacks or offensively to strike enemy aircraft on or over their air- fields. This made the centralization of control of air-support forces not only nec- essary but easier and more effective. During the initial rush from Algiers to Tunisia, the Allies sent forward as many aircraft as they could. They neglected, however, to send forward their ground-based early warning radar. Spaatz, who had seen its effectiveness in the Battle of Britain, moved at once to get ground control intercept (GCI) and early warning radar sets deployed as rapidly and as far forward as possible. In his diary he emphasized the importance and urgency of radar coverage at the front in obtaining effective use of fighters on both the defensive and the offensive: The nearer the RDF [radio direction finding or radar] coverage can read the enemy airdrome areas and check them up on take off, the more effective our operations will be. This makes the location of sites for RDF stations of almost 186   ## p. 187 (#211) ############################################  COLLAPSE OF THE AXIS BRIDGEHEAD as great importance as the terrain for airdromes as an objective for the ground forces. This necessity has been lost on our buildup of units, and must be emphasized in order that our Air Forces can be properly balanced.4 Spaatz reiterated the point in a letter to Arnold, dated March 7: The ability of the enemy to attack our troops with dive bombers indicates that the enemy has control of the air or our forces are improperly controlled or that essential equipment is lacking. The solution lies in an acceptance of the princi- ple that the first prerequisite to the support o
