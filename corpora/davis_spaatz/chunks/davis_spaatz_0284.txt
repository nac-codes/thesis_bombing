the higher commanders some of the quickest and most accurate infor- mation on combat situations. AAF formations had made it a habit to pass within range (fifteen miles) of the air support parties in order to get exact information on conditions in the target areas. At least once, an air support party (ASP) called down a strike on enemy forces in close contact with its own forces.9 Spaatz's front-line inspections revealed a morale problem in NASAF as compared to NATAF. Acute shortages of replacement planes and crews accounted for much of the problem in NASAF's medium-bomber and fighter groups. 10 This issue had become particularly severe in February, but thanks to increased ferrying of new aircraft from the United States and the unsnarling of the replacement pipeline through France's African possessions, the AAF cor- rected half of the problem by the end of March, when Spaatz could report to 187   ## p. 188 (#212) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE  Maj.

Vandenberg is seated directly behind Spaatz. Stratemeyer, "Tell the Boss that there is a very, very noticeable improvement in the airplane situation."11 The lack of replacement crews, unlike the airplane shortage, did not lend itself quite so readily to a production-line solution. In fact, the problems of war-weariness and the rotation of experienced crews continued to haunt Spaatz and the AAF's other numbered air force commanders until the war's end. Initial rotation policies seemed to imply that crews could go home after fulfilling a minimum of 30 combat missions or 200 hours of combat flying. Many crews who felt they had fulfilled their duty were dismayed when circum- stances required additional missions. Their morale plummeted.12 Spaatz did what he could to improve their spirits. On seve
