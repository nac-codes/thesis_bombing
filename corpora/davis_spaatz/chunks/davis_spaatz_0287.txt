Force met to analyze the effectiveness of the antishipping campaign. From ULTRA sources they knew the daily unloading returns from Tunis and Bizerte.22 These confirmed that "the shipping strikes have not been sufficient to bring down the amount of supplies into Tunisia below the danger point to the Germans."23 Spaatz recommended singling out tanker shipping and concentrating all forces on it. Photo reconnaissance and "other intelligence" would show the tankers' locations. 189   ## p. 190 (#214) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE By January, ULTRA could already determine the full details of 60 percent of all cargoes.24 Of course, it could not supply the Allies every detail necessary to their- plans of attack. The conference hammered out responsibilities for photo reconnais- sance (NACAF), minimum forces exclusively devoted to antishipping (two squadrons of the NASAF), and chain of command (the NACAF would notify NASAF Headquarters of targets and the NASAF would decide composition of the force). The conferees also agreed to strengthen communication links between the two air forces. The settling of jurisdictions, better flying weather in March and April, and the end of the crisis on the ground which had diverted the NASAF's strength to ground-support strikes, combined to greatly increase the ship-killing opportuni- ties for Doolittle's command. Adding to the strength and effectiveness of Doolittle's antishipping blows were improvement in aircraft replacement rates; reinforcement by one medium-bomber group and two heavy-bomber groups; and the transfer, in March, from Cairo to Algiers, of an intelligence group that specialized in the study of the enemy supply situation and the selection of ship- ping targets.2 25 British aircraft flying out of Malta and night patrols by Royal Navy ships and submarines put further pressure on the Axis which, in March, unloaded 43,125 tons of supplies, as compared with 49,600 tons in February.
