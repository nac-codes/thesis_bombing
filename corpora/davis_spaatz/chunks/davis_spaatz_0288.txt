flying out of Malta and night patrols by Royal Navy ships and submarines put further pressure on the Axis which, in March, unloaded 43,125 tons of supplies, as compared with 49,600 tons in February. In the fol- lowing month unloadings plunged to 29,233 tons.26 Postwar figures show that in March and April, 41.5 percent of seaborne cargoes dispatched to Tunisia failed to reach North Africa; loss of Axis shipping in March, not made good in April, accounted for that month's lower tonnage. Only four ships exceeding 3,000-tons dead weight reached Africa in April. Furthermore, daily unloadings steadily declined throughout the period from 1,300 to 700 tons.27 By the end of April, the Allied tactical air forces had joined the fray and they, too, began to fly antishipping strikes. Naturally, the Axis increased their resupply effort in the face of the Allies' onslaught. They diverted as much high-priority seaborne supply as possible to small ferries, landing craft, and naval vessels. The Axis also turned to air trans- port. As a British official history states, "Enigma [ULTRA] made it plain that his higher rate of fuel consumption [the principal air transport cargo] and the increasing destruction of his shipping had made the enemy critically dependent on air supply."28 Throughout the Tunisian campaign, German air transport ferried large numbers of personnel and amounts of supply to the Axis bridgehead in North Africa. This transport proved an invaluable aid in November and December 1942, when the surprise Allied landings called for a rapid response. In those two months the Luftwaffe brought in 37,000 men and 9,000 tons of mat√©riel. After the initial surge, traffic declined to between 50 and 20 landings a day at the end of the year. German transport landings then began to climb until they reached 150 a day by late March 1943. In February 1943, air transport brought in 11,000 190   ## p. 191 (#215) ############################################  COLLAPSE OF THE AXIS BRIDGEHEAD per
