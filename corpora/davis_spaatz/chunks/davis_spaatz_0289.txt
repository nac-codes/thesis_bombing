il they reached 150 a day by late March 1943. In February 1943, air transport brought in 11,000 190   ## p. 191 (#215) ############################################  COLLAPSE OF THE AXIS BRIDGEHEAD personnel and 4,000 tons of supplies. In all, excluding March, this airlift con- veyed 71,000 troops and 23,000 tons of supplies to North Africa. 29 No one appreciated this herculean effort of the Luftwaffe more than Spaatz. On January 16, he instructed his staff to draw up plans "to get after" the daily parade of Junkers Model 52 (Ju 52) traffic across the straits.* Two days later, January 18, he "told Cannon to send out a strong fighter force occasionally to swat the Ju 52 daily procession coming across the Straits."30 The British, too, developed plans to disrupt Axis air transport. Eastern Air Command drew up plans for such an operation on February 5 and expanded the plans to include the XII Bomber Command. This operation, code-named FLAX, ran afoul of the exigencies of the Kasserine crisis, which siphoned off all avail- able air, causing the cancellation of the strike.31 In March, Spaatz returned to the scent. At an NAAF staff meeting on March 4, he directed the NASAF to include in its priorities attacks against Axis air transportation.32 When the NAAF drafted a plan to ruin any attempted Axis evacuation from Tunisia, the destruction of German air transport received first priority.33 At the beginning of April, Tedder, Spaatz, Doolittle, and Coningham met for a “Dunkirk" conference to complete plans for action against the expected attempt by the Axis to withdraw completely from Tunisia. Spaatz, supported by Coningham, disagreed with Tedder about whether the chief target priority should be air or sea transport. Spaatz said, “At the present time we are in doubt as to whether we are justified in getting away from sea transport and hitting air transport; but on the evacuation, unless we can believe air is the most important, we will be continuously in doubt as to what to do
