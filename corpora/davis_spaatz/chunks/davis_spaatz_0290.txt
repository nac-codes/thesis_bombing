we are justified in getting away from sea transport and hitting air transport; but on the evacuation, unless we can believe air is the most important, we will be continuously in doubt as to what to do."34 As the discussion contin- ued, it turned to implementing FLAX. Tedder agreed "emphatically" with FLAX as a separate operation, but not as a general or continuing plan. He remarked that Eisenhower would probably agree to FLAX as a specific operation to take prior- ity over everything. Tedder objected to waging an air campaign exclusively against air transport and rejected Spaatz's suggestion that air transport be assigned first priority; instead, Tedder "insisted" that shipping remain the prime target. ULTRA intercepts tended to confirm Tedder's judgment. They showed that shipping carried eight to ten times more tonnage than aircraft to the bridgehead in February and March.35 Once Tedder had driven that point home, he gave his subordinate authority to attack "air transport when specific targets arise." That satisfied Spaatz, who observed that in any case of sea versus air transport, the value of the individual target would always determine its selection.36 Eisenhower apparently accepted the plan. On April 5, the NASAF conducted the first FLAX strike. A morning fighter sweep splashed eleven Ju 52s and five escorts into the sea. Next, B-17s struck Tunisian landing fields, where the trans- port shuttle terminated, with fragmentation bombs. Around noon more B-17s and *The Germans used the trimotor Ju 52 as their chief transport aircraft. 191   ## p. 192 (#216) ############################################      ## p. 193 (#217) ############################################   The end of two Axis supply ships off Bizerte, Tunisia, March 1943.    ## p. 194 (#218) ############################################   A six-engine Messerschmitt Me 323 Gigant transport (above) and low-flying Junkers (Ju 52) tri-motor transport (below).
