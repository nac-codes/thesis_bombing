The ubiquitous "Tante Ju" was the workhorse of Luftwaffe airlift.    ## p. 195 (#219) ############################################  COLLAPSE OF THE AXIS BRIDGEHEAD B-25s finished off the affair by dropping fragmentation bombs on the Sicilian airfields at Boccadifalco, Trapani, and Borizzo, where the second daily flight for Tunisia usually formed up. These actions totally disrupted service, because an afternoon P-38 sweep found the straits empty. The bomber raids caught Axis aircraft bunched together on their fields and inflicted heavy damage. The Luftwaffe acknowledged losses of 14 Ju 52s shot down, 11 transports destroyed on the ground, and 67 transports damaged. The AAF claimed 201 enemy aircraft destroyed, and admitted its loss of 3 aircraft with 6 unaccounted for.

Before executing FLAX, the Allies had observed enemy air transport activity via photo reconnaissance and radar coverage, but had not interfered with daily flights. As a result, the methodical Germans were lulled into establishing a regular schedule and became more vulnerable to the initial Allied attacks.38 Because of extremely sensitive ULTRA information, Spaatz avoided mentioning its contribution to the success of the operation. The breaking of the code used by the Luftwaffe's Enigma cipher machine gave details of cargoes, variation of convoy routes, flight cancellations, and German defensive measures. RAF "Y," the RAF's tacti- cal intercept service added more information with its readings of local Luftwaffe and Italian Air Force (IAF) air transport radio traffic. "From the study of this traffic the intelligence staffs derived their familiarity with points of arrival and departure, the
