of local Luftwaffe and Italian Air Force (IAF) air transport radio traffic. "From the study of this traffic the intelligence staffs derived their familiarity with points of arrival and departure, the time taken to unload and turn around, the normal routes, and the strength of the escorts."39 The signal security of the German air force was noto- riously poor. After April 17, the Western Desert Air Force (WDAF) took over the execu- tion of FLAX from the NASAF. The following day, the WDAF, operating from newly captured airfields around Sousse, a coastal city on the Gulf of Hammamet only 90 miles from Cape Bon (one-third of the distance from NASAF fields), staged the "Palm Sunday Massacre." WDAF P-40s and Spitfires attacked a homeward-bound air convoy and sent between 50 and 70 of the 100 transports and 16 escorts spinning into the Mediterranean. The next day they added 12 out of 20. The Axis, in desperate condition on land and sea, persevered in the face of this pounding. They brought in air transport reinforcements and kept flying. Even instructor crews participated in the one-sided fight.40 On April 22, the Germans lost an entire flight of 21 Messerschmitt Model 323s (Me 323s). These six-engine converted gliders had four times the cargo capacity of Ju 52s but little maneuverability; they generated barely enough speed to keep themselves air- borne, lacked armor and self-sealing gas tanks, and had no chance against the Allied fighters which pounced on them. Three days later, ULTRA revealed the order of the Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe, Reich Marshal Hermann Goering, to switch all transport flights to night. This step greatly reduced air resupply into Tunisia and ended FLAX.41 195   ## p. 196 (#220) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Throughout the FLAX operation the NASAF had continued its raids on Axis staging airfields.
