IN EUROPE Throughout the FLAX operation the NASAF had continued its raids on Axis staging airfields. These raids completed the destruction of the German air trans- port fleet and resulted in the loss of numerous Axis escort and antishipping air- craft as well. Of the 263 German transports available at the beginning of April, the Luftwaffe had lost 157 by April 27,42 not including Italian transports and Axis bomber aircraft pressed into transport service. One estimate placed total losses at 432 aircraft. These losses, combined with casualties suffered by the German Air Transport Service in its attempts to supply the German Sixth Army in the Stalingrad pocket of southern Russia, crippled German air transport for the remainder of the war.43 Operation FLAX and the equally successful strangulation of seaborne traffic doomed the Axis land forces in Africa. Only forty tons of diesel and motor fuel remained in the bridgehead at the time of their surrender.44 Allied intelligence had selected its shipping targets so carefully that the only surplus remaining was food, which the Allies had purposely not sunk in anticipation of feeding Axis prisoners of war.45 The interdiction campaign, like the adoption of British air-support tech- niques, provided an example of the victory of wartime improvisation over pre- war doctrine. Neither subject had captured the imagination of the interwar Army Air Corps theorists, yet both these aspects of the Tunisian campaign have served as models for future AAF and USAF doctrine. Never again has U.S. air power participated in such an effective supply interdiction effort or had so many advan- tages over the enemy. The Allies broke almost every major cipher used by the enemy; they had overwhelming air and naval superiority, which they could freely apply to the restricted area of the Cape Bon-Sicily narrows; and they fought an overextended and, to some extent, disheartened enemy. Spaatz contributed to the success of the operation in two ways. He insi
