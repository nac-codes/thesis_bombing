He insisted that airborne as well as water transport be interdicted, thereby closing a vital supply line that specialized in the delivery of petroleum productsâ€”a necessity for the Axis forces in the bridgehead. Second, like other senior air officers, he seized the opportunity to demonstrate air power's effectiveness against the Axis forces' vulnerability to an aggressive air interdiction campaign. Heavy-Bombardment Aviation in Tunisia The pride of the AAF, heavy-bombardment aviation, performed well and sometimes spectacularly well during the Tunisian campaign. From November 1942 through May 1943, the B-24s of the Ninth Air Force and the B-17s of the Twelfth Air Force flew 7,041 combat sorties, only 900 fewer than the medium and light bombers of the two air forces,46 and lost only 81 aircraft (1.1 percent) to combat or accident.47 The B-17s suffered only 24 combat casualties; enemy fighters accounted for 8 of them, flak and other causes taking the other 16.48 In a letter summarizing the campaign, Spaatz wrote to Arnold, "The impact of the 196   ## p. 197 (#221) ############################################   After an air raid on Castelvetrona, Sicily, April 1943.
