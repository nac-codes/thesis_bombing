ated bravery, but did they demonstrate another quality essential to command-wisdom? If the casualty figures can be accepted, he personally witnessed one-sixth of all B-17 combat losses for the campaign. He did not choose milk runs. In fact, he appears to have exposed himself to great danger and to have run real risks. If his plane had gone down and he had been captured, the enemy might have forced the ULTRA secret from him, to the signif- icant detriment of the Allied effort. His loss in battle might also have damaged AAF prestige and shaken faith in the possibility of daylight bombing. But Spaatz's flights do demonstrate a cardinal principle of good command- leadership. He had a morale problem in the NASAF. What better way to help ease it than to let his men know "the old man" shared their risks?

He apparently par- ticipated as an observer only and did not interrupt normal crew procedure or put himself in the cockpit. By confining himself to raids on coastal targets he less- ened the danger of capture should he and his crew be forced to abandon their plane. They could parachute from it or ease it into the water with the hope of encountering Allied rescue parties. Moreover, recent evidence shows that the ULTRA Secret had become known at levels far lower than his. Because he was usually not the only on
