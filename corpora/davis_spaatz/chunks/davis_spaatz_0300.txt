Coningham's appointment to head the NATAF improved the performance of the tactical forces but did not provide a universal nostrum to the ills of air- ground cooperation in North Africa. Not all ground or air commanders suc- cumbed to the New Zealander's messianic expressions of the new support arrangements. Nor did "Mary's" combative temperament ease his path.

The Americans disagreed with his orders of Mar
