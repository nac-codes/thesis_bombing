appointment to head the NATAF improved the per- formance of the tactical forces, neither Spaatz nor the AAF in North Africa accepted his system in toto. The Americans disagreed with his orders of March 17, which forbade NATAF planes from communicating with air-support parties (as mentioned, AAF-manned liaison teams equipped with a VHF radio on a 1Â½- ton truck that traveled with the forward ground elements and provided immedi- ate contact with planes overhead). To Coningham, the practice by which U.S. aircraft checked in with the air-support parties smacked of excessive control of air by the ground commander and thus violated the principle of unity of air com- mand. It also threatened to short-circuit the whole British system by providing a direct link between pilots and individual ground units. Such a link abbreviated the functions of the Fighter Wing Control Room, reducing control by the overall air commander.67 Colonel Williams, the commanding officer of the XII ASC, after discussion with his group leaders and pilots, advised his superior that the air-support parties did not command or control his planes, but merely provided a quick and valu- able communications link with the ground forces at the point of combat.68 Spaatz intervened in support of Williams's position, and the air-support parties continued to provide their useful services.69 American use of air-support parties illustrated certain differences in Allied air coordination practices. Although the Americans absorbed many lessons from the British, the two organizations did not form mirror images. The Americans regarded the air-support parties as the equivalent of British "tentacles," but they did not follow the example of assigning an air liaison officer at each forward air- field. Instead, the ground unit receiving support sent one of its own officers to the airfield to brief the air commander.
