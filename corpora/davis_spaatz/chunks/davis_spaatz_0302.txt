In the WDAF/8th Army scheme, the 8th *See discussion of the RAF's and Coningham's air support doctrine in Chapter 4. 201   ## p. 202 (#226) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Army processed air requests from subordinate units, decided on priorities, and at that point presented requirements to the WDAF, which had control over all operational aspects of the mission. The Americans also used different communication channels. Instead of II Corps Headquarters developing air requests from its subordinate units, XII ASC Headquarters developed requests received directly from the air-support parties. The air-support party's commander not only served as air-ground liaison but doubled as a member of the ground unit's staff. After allocating its aircraft to specific strikes, XII ASC then confirmed its decisions with II Corps G-3 (Operations). If G-3 approved, XII ASC carried out the missions according to its own plans and force available. The Americans believed in the superiority of their procedure since it introduced qualified air opinion at the beginning of a request process, thereby preventing air commitment to unsuitable or impossible tasks. Coningham had learned from the Americans through Williams that air- craft command and control was technically reserved to XII ASC Headquarters and not to the air-support parties, but he was, apparently, either uninformed or uncomprehending of the essential role played by those parties in the American scheme of ground support.70 Coningham's original order, had it remained in effect, would have totally disrupted American air-ground cooperation. The Americans resisted this attempt to impose British methods from the top. In practice, however, both the British and the American schemes worked equally well. In 1944 Spaatz took the American procedures with him to Britain where they were applied by the U.S. Ninth Ai
