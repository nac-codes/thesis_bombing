e top. In practice, however, both the British and the American schemes worked equally well. In 1944 Spaatz took the American procedures with him to Britain where they were applied by the U.S. Ninth Air Force. With Spaatz's departure in 1944, the Mediterranean Theater adopted British procedures. Even before Coningham's arrival to command the NATAF, Spaatz had observed to Stratemeyer that with Coningham "at the head of our Air Support Command, it can readily be seen that something is bound to break out in a very short time."71 Air-ground relations remained tranquil until April 1. After the Kasserine crisis, Allied ground and air units prepared to renew attacks on the Axis. The logistical situation improved dramatically after early December and January. Spaatz could report that the forward fields had sufficient bombs and gasoline for operations.72 The NAAF needed only one item to remove the prin- cipal bottleneck remaining in its logistics-motor transport. On March 30, Spaatz complained that II Corps still had 450 AAF trucks. Seven days later, he asked Eisenhower for more transport to move the air force forward, even if it had to come from II Corps.73 After a pause to reorganize following the defeats of mid-February, II Corps resumed the offensive. Although Coningham now held operational control of XII ASC, he followed the earlier and logical practice of ordering each of his air contingents to support its own land forces. In keeping with his ideas, however, XII ASC gave first priority to counterair operations rather than to ground sup- port for II Corps. 202   ## p. 203 (#227) ############################################  COLLAPSE OF THE AXIS BRIDGEHEAD On March 17, following intensive artillery and air preparation, Patton's II Corps took Gafsa and began to attack toward the sea coast, seventy-five miles away. By then, XII ASC's operational strength had risen to 116 Spitfires, 49 P- 39s, and 4 photographic reconnaissance planes.74 The Support Command's medium bombers h
