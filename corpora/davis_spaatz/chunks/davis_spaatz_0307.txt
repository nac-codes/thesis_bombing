They flew to Thelepte, met Kuter and Williams, and investigated the lack of air support reported by Patton. The WDAF, they found, had scheduled 160 fighter sorties for April 1, but weather had interfered.

Patton replied, "If I could find those sonsabitches who flew those planes I'd mail them each a medal."88 In a far less celebrated incident, the airmen had a measure of revenge on the Luftwaffe the same day, when XII ASC fighters intercepted a Stuka (dive-bomber) formation and shot down thirteen of sixteen planes.89 That afternoon Tedder and Spaatz flew on to
