I think we will now get better air support than ever before." As Patton well knew, the squeaky wheel gets the grease.92 In a contrite letter to Tedder's deputy, Air Vice-Marshal H.E.P. Wiggles- worth, Coningham said of Patton, "I like him very much, he is a gentleman and a gallant warrior. But on the slightest provocation he breathes fire and battle, and as I also like fighting I could not resist the challenge when he turned the bar- rage on to me."93 Coningham sent out a new message, in which he expressed regret that his original signal might have been interpreted as a slight to U.S. forces and laid the cause to an egregious error in transmission: "Two Corps" had been wrongly substituted for "Few corps."
