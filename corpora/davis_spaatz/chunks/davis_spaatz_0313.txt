personnel move did not halt the flow of complaints from General Bradley, who had replaced Patton as the Commander of II Corps, or from Anderson. The 1st Army initiated its new offensive on April 22, the same day the Luftwaffe began a general withdrawal from its African bases.

Provided the Army limited its requests to one or two attacks a day, No. 242 Group would att
