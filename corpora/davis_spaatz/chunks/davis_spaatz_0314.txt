Provided the Army limited its requests to one or two attacks a day, No. 242 Group would attack any target, regardless of suitability. The group also placed at 1st Army's disposal a considerable force for its use as artillery, with little result; No. 242 Group claimed that 1st Army dissipated the force made available in seventy dif- ferent attacks against forty-four separate targets. 108 On April 29, Eisenhower visited Spaatz at his villa in Constantine to discuss Bradley's and Anderson's dissatisfaction with their air support.
