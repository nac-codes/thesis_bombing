Bradley's command did not get all the air missions it requested because 1st Army, which set air priorities for all the forces it con- trolled, did not approve all of II Corps requests. Spaatz had no authority to change that arrangement, although he did attach XII ASC's tactical reconnais- sance squadron directly to II Corps and tied II Corps G-2 (Intelligence Staff) into reconnaissance pilot briefings.111 In attaching one of his air units directly to the ground unit it supported, Spaatz, of course, violated the doctrine of concen- tration of air assets.

Bradley's corps would have to continue under the current structure. Spaatz also informed Eisenhower
