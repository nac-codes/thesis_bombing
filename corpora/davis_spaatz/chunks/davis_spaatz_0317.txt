Because air formations could move freely in flight, ignoring terrain, the control of air should be centralized and not divided into small packets among armies or corps. Spaatz listed five requirements for support of the ground army: 1. The establishment of a fighter offense and defense, including a complete radar network: 2. The use of the fighter force to protect the army and to gain air superiority; 3. The creation of a tactical reconnaissa
