ishment of a fighter offense and defense, including a complete radar network: 2. The use of the fighter force to protect the army and to gain air superiority; 3. The creation of a tactical reconnaissance force to meet the needs of the army; 4. The creation of a fighter-bomber force to attack targets in the battle area; and 5. The employment of a bomber aircraft capable of operation at altitudes up to 10,000 feet. Once those five elements were achieved, they could be combined to form a tactical air force. In fact, Spaatz suggested eliminating the term air support com- mand altogether. In a postscript, Spaatz also mentioned the invaluable role played by the air support parties and commented on the importance of personali- ties in the coordination of air and ground efforts: â€œIt must be based on the princi- ple that the airman knows his job and the ground man knows his job, with a mutual respect for each others' capabilities and limitations. . . . The ground or the air commander should be eliminated who cannot get along with his opposite number."117 Arnold gave wide circulation to this and other letters from Spaatz describing operations and lessons learned.118 Some of the new air doctrine even reached the American public when Time magazine in its March 22, 1943, issue quoted Tedder: [sic] Air war is a separate war, though linked to those on land & sea. Command of the air determines what happens on land & sea. . . . [sic] The essential lesson learned in the Middle East is that an air force is a separate offensive entity, striking at the enemy in cooperation with the army.119 Spaatz's March 7 letter to Arnold echoed many of the principles found in War Department Field Manual (FM) 100-20, Field Service Regulations, "Com- mand and Employment of Air Power," issued July 21, 1943. FM 100-20 institu- tionalized many of the lessons of the North African campaign drawn by Spaatz 211   ## p. 212 (#236) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE a
