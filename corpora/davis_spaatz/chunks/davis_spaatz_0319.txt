FM 100-20 institu- tionalized many of the lessons of the North African campaign drawn by Spaatz 211   ## p. 212 (#236) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE and disseminated by him to the War Department. The proximate cause of FM 100-20, however, was a note from Assistant Secretary of War for Air Robert A. Lovett to Marshall. Lovett sent Marshall a copy of a pamphlet published by General Montgomery. Montgomery, because of his ballyhooed victories over Rommel in the desert, had a prestige that no other Allied ground commander could match at this stage in the war, thus his statements on the art of command took on a particularly authoritative air. On February 16, 1943, he and Coningham addressed an assemblage of Allied admirals and generals in Tripoli. Montgomery distributed a pamphlet entitled "Some Notes on High Command in War," in which he spelled out sev- eral tenets concerning the use of air power. Air power's greatest asset was flexi- bility, which enabled it to be concentrated for use as a striking force of prime importance. To gain concentration, air control must be centralized, and com- mand should flow through air force officers. Montgomery specifically forbade the dissipation of air resources into "small packets." He suggested that each army commander have an air headquarters with him to command all aircraft allotted to army support. These air forces would not, however, be under the "direct command" of the army commander. 120 Coningham added some RAF clarification to Montgomery's remarks.
