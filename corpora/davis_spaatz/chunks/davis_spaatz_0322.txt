tacle system. The AGF, reading between the revision's lines, raised the following objections: 1. Ground and air forces would be more widely separated. 2. There would be little or no air support without air superiority. 3. Air support, when available, would be furnished on a basis dictated by the air commander. 4. Air units would not be attached to ground units, and 5. Air support would not be decentralized. The AGF rejected the placement of air superiority at the highest priority, calling the deferment of air support until its attainment an unsound practice which "would impose a serious and at times insurmountable handicap on the ground force commander concerned."127 The AGF's protest had no effect on the General Staff. On May 31, a career air officer, Lt. Gen. Joseph T.

McNarney specified that the U.S. Army's new doctrine con- cerning command and employment of air power would include the following four points: 1. Land and air forces were co-equal and independent, 2. Gaining of air superiority was the first requirement for the success of any major land operation, therefore air would concentrate against the enemy's air forces until the obtainment of air superiority, 3. Flexibility was air's greatest asset allowing concentration of the whole weight of air power on a specific target, and 4. Control of air power must be centralized and exercised through air channels of command; the theater commander would exercise command of the air force through the air force commander; and the theater commander would not attach AAF units to the ground forces unless the ground forces were operat- ing independently or were isolated.128 The first section of FM 100-20, when published, consisted entirely of these four points and repeated almos
