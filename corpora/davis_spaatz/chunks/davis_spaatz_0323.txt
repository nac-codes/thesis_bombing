he ground forces unless the ground forces were operat- ing independently or were isolated.128 The first section of FM 100-20, when published, consisted entirely of these four points and repeated almost exactly the wording in McNarney's instructions to the Training Division. 129 By the end of June, McNarney and Arnold had per- sonally approved a draft of the new manual.130 Eight officers (including five generals) representing the infantry (2), the field artillery (1), the coast and anti- aircraft artillery (1), and air (4) had also carefully reviewed and approved the draft. 131 Three of those general officers (Stratemeyer, Kuter, and Porter) either had acquired combat experience in North Africa or had recently visited the the- ater. All three had had extensive discussions with Spaatz on the changes needed in air doctrine. 132 FM 100-20 reflected several of the thoughts Spaatz had expressed in his March 7, 1943, letter to Arnold: "In order for the Army to advance, the air battle must be won." FM 100-20 stated, "The gaining of air superiority is the first requirement for the success of any major land operation."133 Spaatz had observed, "The control of the air units must be centralized and command must be exercised through the Air Force commander. . . ." FM 100-20 specified, "CONTROL OF AVAILABLE AIR POWER MUST BE EXERCISED THROUGH THE AIR FORCE COMMANDER."134 Spaatz had suggested a tactical air force composed of fighters, fighter-bombers, medium bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, and radar warning and control equipment; so did FM 100-20.135 FM 100-20 also accepted almost word for word Spaatz's admonition concerning the necessity of establishing a fighter-radar network: "The first pre- requisite for the attainment of air supremacy is the establishment of a fighter defense and offense, including RDF [radio direction finder], GCI [ground con- trol interception], and other types of radar equipment essential for the detection of enemy aircraft and control of our own."136 FM
