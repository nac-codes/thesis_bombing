After the war Kuter, for instance, admitted that "my own writing during the period was slanted toward the formation of a separate air force."142 He added that because his primary focus was on independence, he had slighted the tactical air power position.

Its entire first sec- tion, cast completely in capital letters, was a unilateral declaration of indepen- dence. It began by stating, “LAND POWER AND AIR POWER ARE CO-EQUAL AND INTERDEPENDENT FORCES; NEITHER IS AN AUXIL- IARY OF THE OTHER."143 The manual's assignment of missions to the Tactical Air Force named close air support as the third and last priority after attainment of air superiority and the prevention of the movement of troops and supplies into or within the theater of operations. In its discussion of this third priority the manual noted, “In the zone of contact [between the opposing land forces], missions against hostile units are most difficult to control, are most expensive, and are, in general, least effective," and "only at critical times are contact zone missions profitable."
