mmunication system did not lend itself to speedy response to immediate ground requests for air support. Throughout the campaign, ground combat officers complained of the lack of on-call, or immediate-response, air strikes. Brig. Gen. Paul M. Robinett, Commander of the 1st Armored Division's Combat Command B, which suffered heavy casualties under British command, wrote to Marshall: "The coordination of tank attacks with infantry and air attacks has been perfect on the German side. On our own side it has yet to be achieved." Robinett strongly implied that placing all air and ground forces attacking an objective under the ground commander could solve the problem. 154 At the campaign's end, Col. William B.

The present system of going back through so many channels is wrong. We haven't time for it." Maj. Gen. Charles W. Ryder, Commander of the 34th Infantry Division, added, "The system of calling through two or three different headquarters for air support simply will not give the support desired at the time desired. Adequate air support can only be obtained by direct call from the division to the air. Any other system," observed the general, â€œis too slow and will result in loss of opportunities."155 217   ## p. 218 (#242) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Given good two-way radio communication between pilots in the air and ground observers (a practice that Coningham forbade and that technology, at that point, could not then guarantee) and a great many airplanes available for ground support missions (not available until later in the war), the close air sup- port problem could be overcome in wartime. During the campaign in northwest- ern Europe, for instance, overwhelming numbers of fighter-bombers and innovations such as two-way radios installed in the leading tank elements of
