he minor day-to-day problems, not the strategic or tactical application of forces, proved the stumbling block of interservice rela- tions. "I will emphasize," he told Arnold, "that air operating under the command control of a ground officer will most probably be improperly used.”157 In an interview in 1965, Spaatz restated this point in answer to a question about the major lessons of World War II: "I think the first lesson was the one about air being indivisible and in order to develop effectively, it must be controlled by air people that developed it, and not under the Army or any other form of organiza- tion other than the Air Force."158 At the beginning of the campaign in North Africa in November 1942, the AAF and its commander encountered three problems that hampered their efforts * In addition to its employment difficulties, air reconnaissance presented a “political" problem to the AAF in North Africa because the commander of the chief photo reconnaissance unit was one of President Roosevelt's sons, Elliott Roosevelt. 218   ## p. 219 (#243) ############################################  COLLAPSE OF THE AXIS BRIDGEHEAD to defeat the Axis: faulty organization, poor logistics, and the lack of an effec- tive air-ground team. By the time of the fall of Tunis and Bizerte in May 1943 the Allies had built an organization, the NAAF, capable of employing air power in a flexible and coherent manner against the enemy. The functional separation of the Northwest African Air Force into a ground support force and a long-range bomber force necessitated by British experience in air-ground cooperation on the one hand, and the AAF's virtual theaterwide monopoly on long-range bombers on the other hand, proved so sensible that the practice continues in the USAF to this day. The relatively smooth functioning of its combined staff served as a model for later Allied organizations. Spaatz played no small role in the success of the NAAF. Perhaps his supreme ability as a commander was his
