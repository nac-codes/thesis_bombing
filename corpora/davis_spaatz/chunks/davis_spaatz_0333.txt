utely essential."159 Not surprisingly at the end of the campaign Williams found himself trans- ferred from the XII ASC to a troop carrier wing where he could cooperate to his heart's content with Army airborne troops while not being allowed to overiden- tify with close air support. After the war an Air Staff officer who had reviewed FM 100-20 before publication and had gained experience in North Africa described the publication of Williams's report as "premature" and ascribed it to a misguided chauvinistic adherence to American concepts. The officer noted that Spaatz neither supported nor endorsed the report.160 But in fact, Spaatz sug- gested to Arnold that the report be "given the highest consideration‚Äù161 and demonstrated that, as a combat officer, he did not take so hard a line on air- ground doctrine as the AAF staff in Washington. 219   ## p. 220 (#244) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Perhaps the most telling statistic on the AAF's attitude toward close air sup- port concerned the training status of the U.S. Army's ground divisions in the United States on January 1, 1944, six months before the invasion of France. Thirty-three still needed aviation for joint training and initial air-ground tests, twenty-one had not witnessed a recognition demonstration of the various types of aircraft, and forty-eight had had no opportunity to participate in the compara- tive air-ground firepower demonstrations required by regulations. 162 Although close air support still did not quite meet the mark, it had improved from the beginning of the campaign. The interdiction and counterair phases of tactical air power proved spectacularly successful once the command and con- trol arrangements of air improved enough to allow flexibility. This flexibility allowed (1) the concentration of all forces at the crucial time and place, as with FLAX or the close air support effort for Anderson's April offensive; (2) the encouragement of specialized
