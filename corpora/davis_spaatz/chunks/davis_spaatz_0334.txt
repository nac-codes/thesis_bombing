flexibility allowed (1) the concentration of all forces at the crucial time and place, as with FLAX or the close air support effort for Anderson's April offensive; (2) the encouragement of specialized functions, such as daily antishipping strikes by the Strategic Air Force; and (3) the day-to-day supply of close air support by the Tactical Air Force. For the relatively modest butcher's bill of 1,433 casualties (277 killed in action, 406 wounded, and 750 missing, interned, or captured),163 and 666 air- craft of all types lost on combat missions,164 the AAF acquired a revision of air- ground support doctrine and gained recognition of the principle of equality between air and ground on the battlefield. More important, the AAF had gained valuable combat experience and demonstrated its ability both to overwhelm the Luftwaffe and to interfere with the operations of German ground forces. Carl Spaatz was instrumental in that watershed development of U.S. air power. 220   ## p. 221 (#245) ############################################  Part Three Mediterranean Interlude From Pantelleria to London May-December 1943   ## p. 222 (#246) ############################################    ## p. 223 (#247) ############################################  Part Three Mediterranean Interlude During the second half of 1943, Spaatz and his command fought to maintain a significant role in determining air strategy in the Mediterranean, to assert AAF independence from the U.S. Army and RAF, and to participate in the Combined Bomber Offensive aimed at the German heartland. During late May and early June, the NAAF conducted operations against Pantelleria, a small Italian-occu- pied island in the straits between Tunisia and Sicily. The surrender of this island on June 11, 1943, demonstrated that, in certain instances, air power alone could force the surrender of a fortified position. Pantelleria also provided a case study in combined operations, air-ground cooperation, and AAF-RAF relations. The AAF
