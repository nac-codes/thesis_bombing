ain instances, air power alone could force the surrender of a fortified position. Pantelleria also provided a case study in combined operations, air-ground cooperation, and AAF-RAF relations. The AAF and Spaatz contributed to the success of the Anglo-American invasion of Sicily on July 10, 1943, and of Italy at Salerno on September 9, 1943, by providing air-ground support and air cover for the invasion fleets. During the Allied drive up the Italian peninsula to the Cassino Line, American air power in the Mediterranean continued to provide air-ground support and began to prepare to participate in the Combined Bomber Offensive against Germany by forming a new U.S. air force with a strategic bombardment mis- sion-the Fifteenth. In early December 1943, Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt met in Tehran, Iran, where they agreed on future strategy for the conduct of the war against the Nazis. The planned cross-channel invasion of France was scheduled for spring 1944, and Eisenhower received the top command of the invasion, code-named Operation OVERLORD. Tedder became Eisenhower's deputy. The British and American Chiefs of Staff also approved both the appoint- ment of an American strategic bomber commander to command and coordinate the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces and the transfer of Spaatz to fill the post. The move coincided with Arnold's replacement of Eaker with Doolittle as Eighth Air Force Commander. Arnold had become increasingly disenchanted with the Eighth's combat performance and had assigned Eaker to replace Tedder in the Mediterranean. By January 1, 1944, Spaatz had arrived in London to assume his new command. From there he would direct U.S. participation in the Combined Bomber Offensive and assume de facto direction of U.S. air-ground support of OVERLORD and the subsequent campaigns through to the final defeat of Germany. 223   ## p. 224 (#248) ############################################    ## p. 225 (#249) ############################################  Chapter
