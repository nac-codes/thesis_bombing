The neutralization of the island became even more important when the final plans for the Sicilian invasion required an assault on the southern beaches near Licata and Gela. The U.S. invasion forces headed for those beaches would have to sail within easy range of Pantelleria.3 Pantelleria, a military zone forbidden to unauthorized persons by the Italian government since 1926, presented a potentially tough nut. Its one small beach suitable for amphibious assault had tricky offshore currents and high surf. The island's surface of volcanic lava and ash could not support vehicular traffic and was cut by numerous ravines. The Italians had reinforced these natural defenses with more than a hundred concrete gun emplacements supplemented by fortified positions and pillboxes imbedded in the cliffs. Sturdy peasant farmhouses and hundreds of high, thick stone walls, which delineated each farmer's fields, pre- sented further military difficulties. But Pantelleria had a weak spot-its defend- ing garrison.
