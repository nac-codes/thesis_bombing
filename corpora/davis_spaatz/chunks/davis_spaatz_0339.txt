In contrast, the island lay well within striking distance of Northwest African Strategic Air Force (NASAF) fields in Cape Bon. On May 13, Eisenhower told Marshall, I want to make the capture of Pantelleria a sort of laboratory to determine the effect of concentrated heavy bombing on a defended coastline. When the time comes we are going to concentrate everything we have to see whether damage to material, personnel and morale cannot be made so serious as to make a land- ing a rather simple affair.10 Spaatz meant to pass his superior's test of air power.
