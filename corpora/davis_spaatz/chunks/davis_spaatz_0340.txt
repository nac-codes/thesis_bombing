the island, most of them committed to tasks other than defending Pantelleria. 12 Spaatz met with his British Navy and Army colleagues on May 16 and pre- sented the air plan of operations. It called for three days and nights of increas- ingly violent attacks, at the end of which the Navy would approach the island to test the remaining strength of enemy defenses. On the fourth day, the Allies would summon the garrison to surrender. Refusal by the garrison would be fol- lowed by a "high order" of air attack on the afternoon and night of the fourth day and the landing of troops on the morning of the fifth day. Apparently the Army and Navy accepted the plan, although General Clutterbuck expressed great concern about the amount of residual resistance his troops might have to overcome.13 Spaatz discounted Clutterbuck's complaints and, in the privacy of his personal headquarters mess, began to refer facetiously to Clutterbuck as "Clusterbottom."14 The next day, May 17, Spaatz expressed to Eisenhower his belief that the air component ought to control the operation, while the Army and Navy should conform to the air commander's decisions. He also emphasized that the current bombing of Pantelleria constituted only part of a larger Allied air effort to sup- press the German and Italian air forces in anticipation of the battle for Sicily.15 The preparatory bombing of Pantelleria began on May 19. Fifty medium- bomber and fifty fighter-bomber sorties a day struck Pantelleria's airfield and port in an effort to prevent any resupply of the island. These attacks, supple- mented by a naval blockade, increased in tempo on May 23 and by the end of the month had almost completely cut the island's supply lines. Additional raids against Axis airfields in Sicily, Sardinia, and the toe of Italy helped to prevent 229   ## p. 230 (#254) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Axis air interference with the Pantelleria operation and the all-important inva-
