He flew from Eisenhower's head- quarters in Algeria to Casablanca on the evening of May 17. There he met Brig. Gens. John K. Cannon and Delmar Dunton, who commanded the Northwest African Training Command (NATC) and the Northwest African Service Command (NASC) respectively. The next day, Spaatz inspected the air depot at Casablanca and found it well stocked and efficient, a far cry from its state during his initial inspection in November 1942. Later that day, the three generals flew to Marrakech where they decided to release the facilities there from the purview of the NAAF and place them under the Air Transport Command. On the follow- ing day, the party flew from Marrakech east to Oujda, where they inspected the 99th Fighter Squadron (Separate).17 The 99th was the first all-black AAF combat unit to reach an overseas com- bat theater. Its thirty-year-old commanding officer, Lt. Col. Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., a West Point graduate and son of Brig. Gen. Benjamin Davis, the first black general in U.S. history, caught Spaatz's eye. Spaatz's diary recorded that "Lieutenant Colonel Davis impressed me most favorably, both in appearance and intelligence." Spaatz also noted that the squadron would be attached to the 33d Fighter Group for use in ground support and would receive the same treat- ment as any similar white squadron. 18 On May 20, Spaatz returned to Oujda and reviewed troops of the 82d (Airborne) Division. He hosted a lunch followed by a meeting with Lt. Gen. Mark W. Clark, Commander of the U.S. Fifth Army, Clark's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Alfred M. Gruenther, and Maj. Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway, Commander of the 82d Division. They
