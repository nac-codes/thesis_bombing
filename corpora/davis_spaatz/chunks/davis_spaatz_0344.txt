Upon his arrival on May 22, Zuckerman met Tedder, another old friend, who sent him to Spaatz's headquarters with instructions to comment on the feasibility of the forthcoming Pantelleria opera- tion. After a two-day study in which he applied the statistical and quantitative methods he had employed in his scientific and anatomical studies, Zuc
