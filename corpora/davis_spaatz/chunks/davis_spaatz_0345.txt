feasibility of the forthcoming Pantelleria opera- tion. After a two-day study in which he applied the statistical and quantitative methods he had employed in his scientific and anatomical studies, Zuckerman replied that the forces available could silence Pantelleria's shore defenses.28 From then until he issued his final report on the island's damage in July 1943, Zuckerman became a part of Spaatz's staff. He roomed with Brig. Gen. Lauris Norstad,29 Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations, NAAF, and attended all plan- ning sessions.30 Zuckerman's first task after demonstrating the feasibility of the operation was to help prepare a detailed bombing plan. He had constant exchanges with Spaatz, Robb, Norstad, and McDonald, who, according to Zuckerman, made it plain that they had every confidence in his ability to produce an effective and precise bombing plan of a kind that had not been designed before.31 The profes- sor repaid the airmen's confidence by producing one that (1) provided precise aiming points; (2) called for detailed reports and analysis of each sortie; (3) required extensive photo reconnaissance; and (4) demanded the plotting of every bomb burst on a grid, with attention paid to the relationship of bombs identified to total dropped, the position of burst in relation to gun positions, and any dam- age caused. As a last proposal, Zuckerman called for an extensive ground survey of the island after it was captured.32 Even before the professor presented his plan's final draft, Spaatz's forces began to execute it. Photos and reports poured into the schoolroom where Zuckerman, with a small staff and photo interpretation experts, assessed damage and assigned new targets. The plan called for enough bombs to be dropped on each battery to destroy only one-third to one-half of its guns; peripheral bomb damage would inactivate the rest of the battery by damaging gun sights and communications and storage facilities and would bury everything in rubble.
