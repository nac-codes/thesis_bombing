On each of the twelve days prior to the inva- sion, Zuckerman submitted a report to Norstad, who forwarded it, with appropri- ate changes of orders, to each command.33 While the professor orchestrated the bombing, Spaatz coordinated other aspects of the invasion within the NAAF and with the Allied ground and naval forces.

Spaatz ordered the air inspector to investigate. The XII ASC, at Spaatz's orders, would begin flyi
