n links between the ship and the Tactical Air Force and the XII Air Support Command (XII ASC) failed. Spaatz ordered the air inspector to investigate. The XII ASC, at Spaatz's orders, would begin flying a daily mission against Pantelleria under the sole direction of the naval command ship and was to maintain constant com- munication with it at all times. In addition, Coastal and Tactical Air Forces would henceforth maintain full-time liaison officers at task force headquarters. Spaatz returned to Constantine convinced that much of the doubt in the minds of the British Army and Navy commanders stemmed from their own interservice rivalry with the RAF.35 Upon returning to his headquarters Spaatz instructed Robb to "inform Coningham that my impression was that he was a trifle too indifferent in his arrangements for CORKSCREW, particularly in connection with exercises."36 Meanwhile, the bombardment of Pantelleria steadily increased in fury. On June 1, the first B-17s attacked the island. Together with P-40 fighter bombers they dropped 141 tons of high explosives; on June 4, heavy, medium, and fighter bombers unloaded an additional 200 tons of bombs. Between May 18, when the bombing began, and June 4, the NAAF flew 1,700 sorties flinging 900 tons of ordnance, many of them 250- or 500-pound high-explosive bombs, on the har- bor and airfield and 400 tons on Pantelleria's gun positions.37 Starting with June 7, D-day minus four (D-4), the level of attack increased daily, especially when General Doolittle, Commander of the Strategic Air Force, lowered the bombing altitude after disappointing results.38 On June 7, Spaatz flew back to Sousse. At 5:30 the next morning, (D-3), he boarded Admiral McGrigor's flagship, a small Hunt Class destroyer-escort, HMS Whaddon, for a personal look at the effects of bombing and naval gunfire on Pantelleria. Clutterbuck and Zuckerman were also on board. In addition to the eight destroyers of McGrigor's task force, five cruisers from the British
