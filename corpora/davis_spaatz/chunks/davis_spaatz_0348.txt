In addition to the eight destroyers of McGrigor's task force, five cruisers from the British Mediter- ranean Fleet joined in the shelling. One of them, HMS Aurora, had Eisenhower and Admiral Andrew Cunningham on board. They, too, wished to view the pro- ceedings.39 As the Whaddon approached the island around 10:00 A.M., Clutterbuck 233   ## p. 234 (#258) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE became visibly upset, complaining about the spasmodic nature of naval fire and what he considered excessive intervals between air strikes.40 When the Whaddon joined in the bombardment, firing 36-pound shells from its twin 4-inch guns, Spaatz muttered to Zuckerman, "What the hell kind of damage do they think these small shells will do?"41 This sentiment was echoed by the professor, who noted in his memoirs that photo interpretation throughout the campaign never revealed any significant damage by naval fire.42 A little before 11:00 A.M. the medium bombers attacked two gun batteries. Then came the pièce de résistance. Doolittle's B-17s rumbled over Pantelleria at 12,000 feet; their bomb salvos, aimed at two of the island's batteries, completely obscured the coastline with smoke and dust. This sight even encouraged Clutterbuck.43 Throughout the bombardment of June 8, only three Italian batteries at- tempted to engage the ships offshore, and the garrison did not put up a heavy barrage against the attacking aircraft.

These overtures elicited no response from the Italians, and so the attack resumed in the afternoon. The ships returned to harbor. Eisenhower, who had spent the day on a 6,000-ton cruiser, reported to Marshall that he and Cunningham "were highly pleased both with the obvious efficiency of
