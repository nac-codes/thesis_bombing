ing on D-day, June 11, the Largs had sighted Pantelleria and within an hour had sailed to within ten miles of it. By 10:30 A.M. the assault boats had formed up and awaited only the signal to start their final run to the beach, timed to coincide with the end of the naval bombard- ment and a last B-17 strike. The Tactical Air Force completed its bombing by 10:00 A.M., and the Strategic Air Force's heavy bombers pounded the island one last time at 11:30 A.M., an instant before the first troops hit the beaches. On board the Largs, Clutterbuck continued to exhibit unease, even though the ship's display boards showed that all bombing had followed schedule and that 300 additional sorties had punished the island since 10:00 A.M.

Before he sighted the invasion fleet, Pavesi had already made the decision to surrender by 11:00 A.M. on June 11. 235   ## p. 236 (#260) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE The already low morale of the defenders had crumbled under incessant bom- bardment and the shortages of basic supplies. Many of the local militia, who manned the antiaircraft batteries, had deserted in order to assist their families.54 From May 8 to June 11, the NAAF had dropped 6,200 tons of bombs and had flown 5,285 sorties, with the loss of fourteen a
