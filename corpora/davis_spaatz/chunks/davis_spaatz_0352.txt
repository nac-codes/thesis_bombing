d the antiaircraft batteries, had deserted in order to assist their families.54 From May 8 to June 11, the NAAF had dropped 6,200 tons of bombs and had flown 5,285 sorties, with the loss of fourteen aircraft destroyed or missing. AAF planes accounted for 5,000 tons of bombs and 4,387 sorties.55 Naturally, Spaatz was pleased, as was Robert A. Lovett, Assistant Secretary of War for Air, who had come to North Africa in late May and had stayed to witness the conclusion of the operation. The two sent a telegram to Arnold briefly describing the battle and concluded by saying, "The boys have really done a grand job."56 The Allies transferred their attention and air strikes to the Pelagies (a group of three small islands: Lampedusa, Linosa, and Lampione also located between Africa and Sicily), which surrendered the next day. A day after the surrenders, Spaatz sent Zuckerman to Pantelleria to prepare a thorough report on the exact nature and effectiveness of the bombing. This prompt action reflected Spaatz's concern that studies by the ground forces or navy hostile to air might downgrade the effectiveness of the air effort.57 While waiting for the professor's final report, which he did not receive until July 20, Spaatz drew some immediate conclusions from the experience which led him to recommend three improvements: (1) longer-range radar for command ships; (2) manning of opposite ends of communications links by members of the same ser- vice and country; and (3) coordination of all bombing, whether tactical or strate- gic, with and through the control ship.58 In Spaatz's mind, at least, Pantelleria had confirmed the most extreme theo- ries of air power enthusiasts: air power alone could defeat a major power. While still in the afterglow of the Pantelleria success, Spaatz wrote to a friend: The application of air power available to us can reduce to the point of surrender any first class nation now in existence within six months from the time that pressure is applied.
