In applying the pressure, any or all of the air must be directed against anything which can prevent or interrupt our air effort. Any conception of modern Warfare which does not fully recognize the foregoing is marking time in place.59 Two days later, Spaatz forwarded to Tedder the preliminary analysis of damage by Zuckerman and in his cover letter expressed his conclusions a little less boldly: "Precision bombing deserves a precise plan, and air forces properly employed can destroy or reduce the operational effectiveness of defenses to a point where the will to fight ceases to exist.” In a bow to Zuckerman, Spaatz acknowledged, “Air force operations must be planned to employ scientifically forces adequate to secure the degree of material destruction necessary to reduce the objective. A by-product of such operations will almost certainly be complete demoralization." Again referring to Zuckerman's application of the scientific method, Spaatz wrote, "The force necessary to destroy communications and to isolate a given area is a matter of mathematical calculation. In this instance, the 236   ## p. 237 (#261) ############################################   Pantelleria, June 1943.
