easonable factor of safety." Spaatz had two more points: (1) an ascending and continuous scale of bom- bardment coupled with deliberate and successive elimination of strong points will markedly affect the defenders' morale and paralyze their repair facilities and services; and (2) "unless topographical features exist, which allow the pre- cise definition of targets and bombing lines, the air cannot be expected to pro- vide a precise barrage immediately in front of ground or naval forces."60 These were the views of an air power zealot. Fortunately for himself and the AAF, Spaatz reserved most of them for his Command Diary. The Pantelleria operation merely confirmed his long-held opinion that air, in order to exert its dominant role in warfare, required equality with the army and the navy and that equality could come only with independence for the air forces. As Spaatz explained to Zuckerman, "There was one 'A' too many in the designation U.S.A.A.F.”—the 'A' that stood for Army-and Pantelleria would help get rid of it.61 The operation also provided an opportunity for one of the pioneering efforts in the application of scientific analysis and quantification to combat, particularly in operations research for the AAF and the closely related field of operations analysis. Zuckerman's methods and results predisposed airmen, such as Spaatz, to seek more opportunities to apply them. Zuckerman's work received mention in Eisenhower's dispatch on the fall of Pantelleria: A less intense bombardment might, in the light of later knowledge, have subju- gated the island, but there would have been lacking essential data for the study of the tactical possibilities of scientifically directed air bombardment of strong- point[s], and the most economical disposal of available air strength. Professor Zuckerman's exhaustive report on the subject may prove of as much value in the fight against the Axis as the capture of the island.62 Zuckerman's final report showed that although the batteries
