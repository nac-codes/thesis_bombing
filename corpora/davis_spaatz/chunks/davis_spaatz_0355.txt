fessor Zuckerman's exhaustive report on the subject may prove of as much value in the fight against the Axis as the capture of the island.62 Zuckerman's final report showed that although the batteries received bomb- ing on a scale of 1,000 tons of bombs per square mile, the amount of firepower lost to each battery ranged from 10 percent to 75 percent, with an average of more than 40 percent lost for all batteries.63 Only two batteries received direct hits and the attacks neutralized forty-three of the eighty guns, ten of them per- manently.64 Not all analysts of Operation CORKSCREW have agreed with Spaatz's most extreme conclusions. Clutterbuck pointed out the failure of the XII ASC and the Largs command ship to establish satisfactory communications links during prac- tices. He argued that communications between the two would have failed disas- trously had they been needed.65 Montgomery's recent biographer, Nigel Hamilton, condemned the effort expended in the conquest of Pantelleria as an "unfortunate distraction" and bemoaned the casualties "sacrificed to this airman's fantasy of how the Axis 238   ## p. 239 (#263) ############################################  PANTELLERIA AND SICILY enemy could be defeated by air power alone.”66 Hamilton implied that the effort could have been better spent by softening up Sicily, as if the initial German counterattack on the Sicilian beachheads could have been totally prevented by air power. To blame many of Montgomery's problems in Sicily on inadequate preinvasion air bombardment does air power and Montgomery no service. Without the presence of the 33d Group's P-40s and Spitfires flying from Pan- telleria's field, Montgomery would have had even less support. As the AAF official history admitted, “In the final analysis the morale of the defenders was the determining factor in the failure of Pantelleria to put up a strong and prolonged resistance. The air assault not only hurt the enemy's ability to resist; it broke his will."67 The
