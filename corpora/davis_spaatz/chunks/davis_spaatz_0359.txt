These attacks, which started with strikes assisting the NAAF's April 1943 assault on German air 240   ## p. 241 (#265) ############################################  PANTELLERIA AND SICILY transport into the Tunisian bridgehead and continued through and after the anti- air strikes supporting the Pantelleria operation, rose to a crescendo in the week preceding July 10 (D-day). Spaatz firmly believed in the necessity of conducting a vigorous counterair offensive before other land, sea, or air operations began. On June 24 he observed to Arnold, "The German Air Force becomes very cocky when it has a few successes. It then becomes necessary to give them a thorough beating on their airdromes as well as in the air."76 By the beginning of June, the Luftwaffe had started to transfer bombers from Sicily and southern Italy to southern France and northern Italy. This move dimin- ished its ability to attack the ports where the Allied invasion forces assembled. ULTRA, however, revealed an increase in Luftwaffe fighter and fighter-bomber activity on Sicily, which continued until July 3. At that point the NAAF began a final week of intensive bombardment, which reduced the number of fighters by one-third and caused the fighter-bombers to withdraw. Diversionary and coun- terair raids on Sardinia in the week before the invasion reduced the 130 Luftwaffe fighter-bombers there to 35 percent serviceability and denied them the aviation fuel necessary for sustained operations. Added to the invaluable infor- mation gained from signal intelligence was detailed aerial photographic recon- naissance. NAAF aircraft took special photos of industrial areas and communica- tion lines and daily pictures of the Corsican, Sardinian, Sicilian, and Italian air- fields and the ports berthing the major surface combat units of the It
