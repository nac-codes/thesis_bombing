The fighter units of XII ASC would join the Third Air Defense Wing directly under Coningham's command, while Brig. Gen. John K. Cannon replaced Kuter as Coningham's second in command and principal American deputy. Finally, Tedder was to meet with all army commanders and senior air officers before the invasion in order to completely clarify arrangements. The con- ferees also agreed that when U.S. forces had firmly established themselves on Sicily, the XII ASC would reconstitute itself as a major combat unit.80 According to Spaatz, these moves resulted from his feeling that the Tactical Air Force had not given the U.S. II Corps enough help in the just-completed campaign.81 The new arrangements left Patton unsatisfied. He noted in his diary on May 22, "Tedder controls the air with Spaatz, a straw man, under him. . . . Conyngham [sic] commands the tactical air force and the close support air force by another British Vice Air Marshall [sic]. Our close support force is com- manded by a Colonel. . . .
