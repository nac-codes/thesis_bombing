It communicated with the Army Air Support Control, the joint Army-RAF communications group at the WDAF/8th Army Headquarters; with the Air Liaison Officer at the wing or group airfield; and, by means of a VHF radio, directly with aircraft over the target area.

The U.S. Seventh Army and XII ASC used a similar system based on the jeep.88 The partial failure of airborne operations as well as the failure to prevent the Axis evacuation of Sicily by completely interdicting the Straits of Messina marred the air effort.
