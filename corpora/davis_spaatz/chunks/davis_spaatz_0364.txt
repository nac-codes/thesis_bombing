They also received assurances from the Navy that guaranteed antiaircraft-free passage over ships offshore. Unfortunately, the mission arrived on the heels of the last Axis air attack of several that had hit the area during the day. An earlier attack had blown an ammunition ship sky-high. A gunner in the fleet, confused and nervous from a day of Axis bombing and perhaps uninformed of the drop, opened fire on the slow, low-flying, troop-carrying aircraft.
