(1) airborne operations can avoid excessive casualties only by achieving surprise; (2) excessive losses will occur if troops are dropped on organized battle positions; (3) ground and naval units need extensive training to prevent them from firing on friendly aircraft; and (4) surface forces should get ample warning before an airborne overflight of their positions and should be forbidden to fire on any planes during the designated time of the overflight.92 Tedder endorsed the report, adding, "A.A. firing at night is infectious and control almost impossible."93 The lessons Spaatz, Eisenhower, and the advocates of airborne operations gleaned from the Sicilian operation paid dividends in the planning for the airborne phase of the cross- channel invasion. In addition to the supervision of combat operations, which, of course, required much of Spaatz's time and effort, two other related matters received 244   ## p. 245 (#269) ############################################  PANTELLERIA AND SICILY significant attention: the question of a separate postwar U.S. Air Force and the establishment of an all-American, all-AAF, Mediterranean-wide command. In summing up the Tunisian campaign, Spaatz had written to Arnold, "If it were not for the disturbance which would ensue, I would probably announce the urgent necessity of a separate Air Force."94 This comment reflected not only his opinion of the just-completed campaign but also the experiences and conclusions over his entire career. In 1925, at Brig. Gen. William "Billy" Mitchell's court-martial, Spaatz had stated that the air arm could not function properly under the aegis of the War Department, and the eighteen years after the trial had only served to rein- force that opinion. On June 1, Spaatz, in a conference with Doolittle and Maj. Gen. Follett Bradley, who commanded one of the U.S. continental air forces charged with training and had just arrived from Eaker's Eighth Air Forces Headquarters in Britain on a trip at Arnold's behe
