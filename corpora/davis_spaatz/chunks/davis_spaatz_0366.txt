Gen. Follett Bradley, who commanded one of the U.S. continental air forces charged with training and had just arrived from Eaker's Eighth Air Forces Headquarters in Britain on a trip at Arnold's behest, agreed that, although the cur- rent air organization was adequate for the defeat of Germany, the final campaign against Japan would require the separation of the U.S. Army Air Forces from the U.S. Army. Spaatz added that the AAF ought to disentangle itself from the British Army and the RAF as well. This action would enable the AAF to set up all-U.S. strategic and tactical air forces whose commanders would have equal rank with the Army Ground Forces commander. The overall air commander would outrank the ground force commander.95 These musings did not leave AAF circles. Spaatz also believed that air power should have a preeminent place not only in the Sicilian invasion but in any amphibious operation. Before the Sicilian landings he observed, "The next operation will be successful, but the same mis- take is being made which was made in the Pantelleria assault-that of placing air as a secondary power to the ground forces and not giving them the top command when air success is first in importance in making the operation a suc- cess."96 A few days later, on July 5, he codified his ideas on the proper role of air power in future operations as follows: (1) air power isolates the area where the ground forces will attack; (2) air power will attain air supremacy over that area; (3) enemy forces and fortifications will be reduced by a rising scale of attack Ã  la Pantelleria; and (4) only after the completion of the foregoing actions will ground forces, fully supported by tactical and strategic air, begin their assault. Spaatz added that, in operations having a further lead time for planning than HUSKY/Sicily, the air commander should have the supreme command and army and navy forces should start their combat operation only after the air com- mander had given the go-ahead.97 It
