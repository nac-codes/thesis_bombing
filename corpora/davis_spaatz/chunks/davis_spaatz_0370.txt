old Doolittle that he preferred to have all American Tactical and Strategic Air Force units under a U.S. commander and that he thought it best to "extricate" the AAF from the RAF. Three days later Spaatz noted in his diary a disagreement between himself and Coningham about which particular American officer should command the XII ASC, an all-U.S. unit. On June 6, Spaatz became extremely irked when Coningham treated the Pantelleria operation in a particularly offhand manner. Later, through his deputy, Air Vice Marshal Robb, he advised Coningham that a change of attitude would be desir- able. On June 12, at the conclusion of the Pantelleria operation, Cannon and Spaatz met again at Sousse. Cannon reported that MAC had sent a signal mov- ing the U.S. 33d Fighter Group from the Tactical to the Coastal Air Force three days prior to the final assault. This action had clearly intruded into Spaatz's realm of authority as Commanding General, Twelfth Air Force, and Command- ing General, NAAF. Spaatz instructed Cannon to tell Coningham that “if he car- ried out any future orders received direct from MAC he would be relieved of his command—that all orders should come direct from NAAF." Spaatz further spelled out his view in person to Tedder on June 21: "MAC does not have the right to exercise control over units under the command of NAAF," Spaatz claimed, "unless [that] order is coordinated through HQ, NAAF.”106 The establishment in mid-June of a joint MAC-NAAF advanced command post at La Marsa blurred further the lines of authority. This command post, which served as the control center for the Sicily operation for both Tedder and Spaatz, had direct radio links to all of the NAAF's and MAC's subordinate com- mands. It also served as a collection and analysis point for photographic and electronic intelligence.
