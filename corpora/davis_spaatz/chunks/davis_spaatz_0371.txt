By June 27, Spaatz's American chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Edward P. Curtis, had begun to suggest that the joint command post wasted too much staff. Spaatz replied that he expected an early break, with NAAF Headquarters moving for- ward while MAC stayed behind. 107 By July 12, Spaatz apparently had decided to ensure his control of U.S. air units even if it meant completely bypassing the British. On that date he ordered the creation of a new communications network manned entirely by Americans. The system, which would operate only between senior U.S. officers, would have no central filing system; copies of messages would be kept only by sender and recipient. Spaatz wanted the system, which soon became known as REDLINE, in effect by August 1. The first link was to be established between Cannon and XII ASC, presumably to give XII ASC a way to circumvent Coningham. Spaatz also wanted the network so flexible that even missions already airborne could still be recalled. When established, the system would give Spaatz complete control, without British interference, over all AAF units and personnel in the Mediter- ranean. Spaatz planned to go even further in separating his forces from the RAF.

Spaatz also wanted American officers in each function of the Tactical and Coastal Air Forces who could take over at a moment's notice. 108 The next day Spaatz told Doolittle that future plans for the NAAF were unstable. 109 Eventually, REDLINE grew into a swift and effective all
