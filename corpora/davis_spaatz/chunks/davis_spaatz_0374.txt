This post would give Spaatz "a position of great strength, prestige, and influence,‚Äù while allowing the British to maintain the overall strategic responsibility for the theater allotted to them by the directives of the Combined Chiefs of Staff. The scheme would also "provide absolute continuity of American command of all American units from top to bottom."113 In his reply to Eisenhower's message, Marshall accepted the outline of the plan.
