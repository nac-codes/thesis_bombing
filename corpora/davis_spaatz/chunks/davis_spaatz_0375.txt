eturn Tedder's headquarters from La Marsa to Algiers, to separate Tedder from day-to-day operations while keeping him where he could supply advice on air matters close at hand. Back at his headquarters, Spaatz told his staff that the NAAF had just reverted to its status prior to the establishment of the NAAF-MAC Combined Command Post-in other words, the NAAF had direct control of operations. He added that Tedder would accept this arrange- ment before they returned to Algiers.115 This state of affairs lasted five days and then Eisenhower reversed himself. In Tunis, on August 9, in a meeting with Eisenhower, Tedder, Coningham, and Alexander on planning for the invasion of Italy, Spaatz had an opportunity to present organizational problems. He noted that the current situation left Coningham in doubt as to the chain of command. The situation could be cor- rected if orders to Coningham and Doolittle came from the NAAF, not from a combined NAAF-MAC headquarters or from MAC alone. In addition, MAC Advance Headquarters should be disbanded, and morning meetings between MAC and NAAF no longer held. After the meeting, Eisenhower told Spaatz that he had changed his mind, perhaps succumbing to urgings from Tedder. As a result, Spaatz and Eisenhower were back to the position they had taken in their July 18 message to Marshall. Eisenhower "stated that he did not want anything to develop which would indi- cate that the RAF and the USAAF could not operate together." He wanted MAC as the "top over-all" headquarters, with the Twelfth Air Force as an administra- tive head for all U.S. units. Spaatz complied and directed his staff to send to MAC all nonadministrative functions of the NAAF. Spaatz noted in his diary, "This is a compromise organization and will be successful only if senior staff officers are very careful to consider the proper prerogative of staff officers of other headquarters.‚Äù116 * Headquarters, Ninth Air Force, was transferred to England to lead the U.S. tactical air
