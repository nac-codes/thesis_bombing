The Ninth Air Force had been part of the Northwest African Air Forces. 250   ## p. 251 (#275) ############################################  PANTELLERIA AND SICILY In fact although not in name, Spaatz became Tedder's deputy. He main- tained a voice in overall strategic direction and zealously championed the administrative separation of the British and U.S. air forces in all but the top command levels. Yet despite his stand, day-to-day operational control of Allied air power in the Mediterranean increasingly tended to become Tedder's pre- serve. Spaatz would have found much to agree with in the postwar statement of his successor as deputy, John Slessor: The position of deputy commander is not an easy one: he is rather liable to be neither fish, flesh, fowl nor good red herring and his responsibility is not easy to define. As in all these things, it depends largely on personalities, and on friendly arrangements between the commander and his deputy about who does what—an arrangement easier to agree upon than to make known to all subordi- nate commanders.117 Spaatz had succeeded in gathering the disparate AAF elements in the theater under a single U.S. commander, and he remained Eisenhower's principal American air adviser.
