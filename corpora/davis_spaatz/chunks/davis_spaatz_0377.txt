es. Spaatz could not and Tedder did not control him. Several errors in judgment by Coningham, which went uncorrected by higher air authority, may have contributed to the unsuccessful air interdiction of the Axis evacuation from Sicily across the Straits of Messina to Italy. From August 11 to 17, the Germans and Italians, working independently, evacuated more than 100,000 men, 9,800 vehicles, 47 tanks, 150 guns, and 17,000 tons of munitions and stores. 118 Three German divisions escaped to fight again. The Allies had made no plans as they had in the Tunisian campaign to halt this retrograde movement, which earned the Allied command structure and each of the three services equal shares of the reproaches from postwar analysts. Land forces, particularly the British, did not press the Axis forcefully enough to prevent them from disengaging the vast majority of their troops. The naval forces would not risk the loss or damage of their heavy units by bringing them into the confined waters of the straits in order to sink the evacuation ships. The Allied high command structure, influenced perhaps by Hitler's previous refusal to evacuate Tunisia, not only did not anticipate the evacuation but failed to realize it had begun until very late in its progress. Neither Eisenhower nor his three chief subordinates, Alexander, Cunningham, and Tedder, pushed hard enough or coordinated readily enough with their colleagues to mount the com- bined ground, naval, and air effort necessary to close the Straits of Messina.119 Finally, the air forces, under Coningham, made several mistakes. Coningham assumed that the evacuation would take place largely at night, and he anticipated heavy air opposition over the straits. Both these reasonable assumptions proved 251   ## p. 252 (#276) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE wrong, but he did not abandon them.
