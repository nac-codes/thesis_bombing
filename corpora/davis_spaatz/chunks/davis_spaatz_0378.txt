############################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE wrong, but he did not abandon them. Although he had the authority to request the assistance of Strategic Air Force's heavy bombers, medium bombers, and fighters, with twelve hours' advance notice, subject to Doolittle's approval, Coningham apparently never requested the American daylight bombers after August 9. From July 29 to August 17, NAAF heavy bombers flew only 142 sor- ties over Sicily. 120 Most of the NASAF therefore devoted itself to attacks on the Italian mainland distant from the straits, in preparation for the upcoming inva- sion of Italy. On the day the main German withdrawal began, Coningham noti- fied Tedder that, should a big withdrawal develop, "we can handle it with our own resources and naval assistance."121 In fact, Coningham overestimated the ability of the NATAF to halt the evacuation. The Axis powers had brought up numerous heavy and light antiaircraft guns to defend the crossing. These put up such intense fire that NATAF's light bombers and fighter-bombers could not operate effectively against Axis shipping, which also carried heavy antiaircraft armament.122 Nor did Coningham press home his attacks, perhaps because he and his superiors sensed no emergency. On August 16, the last full day of the evacuation, with an available force of 970 aircraft, he sent only 317 sorties against the straits. 123 After the war, Coningham himself concluded, â€œThe escape of a large number of the enemy at Messina proved that a density of flak can be provided so lethal that air attack can be held off sufficiently to maintain commu- nications."124 Coningham apparently believed that his orders should come from Tedder rather than Spaatz. This was the view that Spaatz, who at the time of the evacua- tion had lost much of whatever control he ever had over Coningham, expressed to Eisenhowever on August 9.125 Tedder had taken over strategic direction and allocation for theater air power, thereby forcing Spaatz
