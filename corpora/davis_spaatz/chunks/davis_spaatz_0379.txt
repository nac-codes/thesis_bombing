t much of whatever control he ever had over Coningham, expressed to Eisenhowever on August 9.125 Tedder had taken over strategic direction and allocation for theater air power, thereby forcing Spaatz to concentrate primarily on purely American administrative matters. Spaatz's papers contain no references at all to the Axis evacuation. Given his intense interest in the details of the operation against supply lines in Tunisia and in the bombing of Pantelleria, it seems reasonable to conclude that he had become detached from day-to-day operations, especially the tactical sphere of responsibility. Instead, during the time period of the evacuation he found time to campaign for air force independence with visiting senators and to inspect bomb groups in North Africa. In addition, he oversaw the AAF in the Mediterranean's first Combined Bomber Offensive mission-against fighter assembly plants in Wiener-Neustadt, Austria, on August 13â€”and discussed plans for AAF reorga- nization and the coming invasion of Italy with Eisenhower and Tedder. 126 In short, Spaatz had no hand in stopping the evacuation. There were indica- tions that if he had he would have, at the very least, used the U.S. heavy bombers more frequently on evacuation targets. On August 4, shortly before the evacua- tion, he said, in Eisenhower's presence, at a general officers' meeting, "It is my belief that it [air] should have been used exclusively in Sicily to expedite the battle there." In his diary Spaatz added, "Too much insistence exists in the mind 252   ## p. 253 (#277) ############################################  PANTELLERIA AND SICILY of Tedder that there be a differentiation between Tactical and Strategic Air Forces. Under certain battle conditions they should be considered as one Air Force and should be applied [together] as was done in the case of Pantelleria."127 Spaatz's remark on Tedder's mindset found an echo in the criticism of the air effort in official Royal Navy and U.S. Army histories. 128
