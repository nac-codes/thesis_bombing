ase the way for the invading forces. Allied air power also sought to smooth the path. The Strategic Air Force, in particular, spent much of the five weeks prior to the invasion in counterair and supply and in the communications line interdiction strikes that had become standard. By the time of the invasion on September 9, the Luftwaffe and the Italian rail network had suffered severely. Once again the Northwest African Air Forces (NAAF) protected the inva- sion fleet effectively, despite a temporary resurgence of Luftwaffe activity.

Because all of the NAAF's striking forces were directly supporting the beach- head, Eisenhower requested the CCS to transfer three heavy-bomber groups from the Eighth Air Force to the NAAF. In addition, he asked the CCS to order the Eighth to bomb Northern Italian communications from England. The CCS promptly complied.3 In all, from September 12 to 15, the NAAF dropped 3,500 tons of bombs and flew 6,000 sorties over the Italian battlefront.4 Allied naval support forces also played an important part in repelling the counterattack. During the entire Salerno operation they pumped 11,000 tons of shells, the equivalent of 72,000 field artillery shells (105mm), into German posi- tions.5 Given the advantage in accuracy of naval gunfire over bombing, Allied navies contributed somewhat more than Allied air in breaking up the German assault. Nonetheless, Eisenhower, Alexander, and Clark, Commander of the U.S. Fifth Army, which had operational control of the invas
