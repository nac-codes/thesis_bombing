combat. In the summer of 1943, heavy-bomber crews in the Mediterranean, where enemy opposition was light, had to fly fifty missions before returning home. At the same time, heavy-bomber crews in Britain, who faced much heavier opposition (and hence had a shorter life expectancy), had a combat tour of twenty-five missions. 256   ## p. 257 (#281) ############################################  SALERNO AND LONDON led to increased fatigue among air and ground crews, causing more depletion of the human resources needed to conduct the air battle.8 The replacement situation had become severe even before the invasion of Italy. Spaatz reported to Arnold: As the extent to which air has assisted the ground action becomes more widely known increasing demands are made for its employment. We are faced with a rather difficult problem in this respect in that weather almost never interrupts flying and between 70% and 80% of our airplanes are kept in commission. Combat crew fatigue has become the main problem.9 The following day Eisenhower sent, at Spaatz's behest, an "Eyes Only" cable to Marshall in which he pleaded for an immediate increase of the replace- ment rate from 15 percent per month to 25 percent per month. Eisenhower noted, "It now appears that we must either fail to meet demands or gradually reduce our groups' effectiveness as a result of attrition." Alluding to the surrender negotiations with Italy and the worsening Axis position on Sicily, Eisenhower added, â€œWe have reached a critical position in this area which requires that any favorable development, military or political, be fully and immediately exploited. Air forces, of course, provide our most effective means of rapidly applying pres- sure where necessary."10 The Salerno operation only exacerbated the shortfall. At the height of the German counterattack, Spaatz wrote to Arnold: In addition to communications, the biggest worry at present is the old one of replacement crews. Our frequency of operation in spite of all
