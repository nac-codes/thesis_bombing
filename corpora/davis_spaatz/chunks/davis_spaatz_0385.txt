height of the German counterattack, Spaatz wrote to Arnold: In addition to communications, the biggest worry at present is the old one of replacement crews. Our frequency of operation in spite of all efforts to hold it down to a minimum, is continuously greater than the replacement rate warrants, and crews are becoming war weary faster than replacements will arrive to relieve them."1 Eisenhower, too, pleaded with Marshall for more men: "Our actual use of air has greatly exceeded that which was planned. I consider that reducing the scale of our present air effort might prove disastrous." Eisenhower urged Marshall to take remedial action at once; otherwise "our strength will drop below that essen- tial for conduct of operations."12 Arnold and Marshall, however, could do little to meet these appeals. They temporarily sent down eighty B-24s (two groups) from the Eighth, but the vagaries of U.S. military manpower recruitment and procurement, especially in the AAF, had produced a manpower crisis that particularly affected air crews. The low point in the supply of trained manpower for the AAF occurred in the summer of 1943, leaving Arnold and the AAF unable to meet more than the minimal planned replacement flows.13 During this replacement crisis Spaatz confronted another delicate personnel problem-evaluating the performance of the pilots of the 99th Fighter Squadron, the only black AAF unit then in combat. In an "Eyes Only" cable on August 17, Spaatz alerted Arnold to a possible problem. General Cannon, Deputy Com- 257   ## p. 258 (#282) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE mander of the NATAF, reported that the 99th was "beginning to show evidence of tiring." Cannon compared the unit's performance unfavorably to that of the 33d Fighter Group, which was operating from the same airfield under the com- mand of Col. William W. Momyer, and noted, "It is indicated that the colored pilot cannot stand up under [the] same pressure as [the
