s not yet arrived when the white and colored soldiers will mess at the same table and sleep in the same barracks. Finally, House suggested, "If and when a colored group is formed in the United States, it be retained for either the eastern or western defense zone and a white fighter group be released for overseas movement.”19 In his endorsement of the report to Spaatz, Cannon wrote, "The pilots of the 99th Fighter Squadron fall well below the standard of pilots of other fighter squadrons of this Command," in categories such as eagerness for combat, aggressiveness, will to win or reach the objective, stamina, and ability to fight as a team. Black pilots had "no outstanding characteristics in which they excel in war over the pilots of other squadrons of this Command."20 The report contradicted what Spaatz had recorded in early June 1943, that Colonel Davis had told him the "men have lost a little of the eagerness they had before any combat missions, but are proving themselves."21 In any case, Spaatz forwarded the report to Arnold, expressing his "full confidence in the fairness of the analysis" made by Cannon and House, observing: "I feel that no squadron has been introduced into this theater with a better background of training than had by the 99th Fighter Squadron.”22 The report came to the attention of the McCloy Committee, a special com- mittee established by the War Department to oversee black troop policies. On October 16, Colonel Davis testified before the committee and effectively refuted House's and Momyer's criticisms.23 The 99th remained in combat in Italy and was eventually joined by the all-black 332d Fighter Group. At the very least, the foregoing report demonstrated the inability of the Army hierarchy to conduct an objective evaluation of black soldiers in the U.S. Army of World War II. The incident may have affected Spaatz's evaluation of them. After the war he told the Gillem Board, which was investigating the possi- ble future roles of black soldiers
