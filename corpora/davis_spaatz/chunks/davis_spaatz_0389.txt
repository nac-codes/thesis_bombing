On the same day, the British 8th Army, advancing from the toe of Italy, occupied the great airfield complex of Foggia, eighty miles to the northeast of Naples. The capture of Foggia gave the AAF the capability to open up a second front in the Combined Bomber Offensive against Germany by putting it well within range of Austrian and south German industrial targets.

AWPD/1 had provided for a bomber force of very long-range B-29s (still on the drawing boards in 1941) operating against Germany from bases in the Sue
