launched the first Mediterranean raid to partic- ipate in the Combined Bomber Offensive by attacking the Ploesti oil targets on August 1. They lost 54 aircraft and 532 crewmen and inflicted heavy, but not decisive, damage to their targets.29 260   ## p. 261 (#285) ############################################  SALERNO AND LONDON Before flying the Ploesti raid, these groups joined the NAAF and flew sev- eral hundred sorties in the Sicilian campaign. They also participated in two other strategic missions before leaving the theater, one before and one after the Ploesti raid. On July 19, with the medium bombers and B-17s of the Twelfth Air Force (more than 500 planes in all), they also bombed airfields near and two railroad marshaling yards in Rome.
