Rome with Churchill, Marshall, and Alan Brooke, British Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who had come to the Mediterranean to obtain Eisenhower's views on post- Sicilian operations. In his description of the Prime Minister's visit, Eisenhower related that "long discussions were carried on regarding the desirability of bombing the marshalling yards near Rome." The CCS authorized the raid on June 15.33 In addition, Spaatz emphasized the necessity of capturing northern Italy for use in air operations against Germany.34 Two weeks later Spaatz and Tedder, while planning support operations for the upcoming Sicilian assault, decided to interdict rail yards in both Naples and Rome as part of the overall campaign to disrupt supply and communications in Italy. Spaatz suggested that Naples should receive not only bombs but surrender leaflets as well.35 He did not make clear whether he thought the latter might ren- der the port susceptible to a coup de main or prove effective as a psychological ploy in the war against Italian morale. Spaatz may have felt that a hard double blow at those two key cities might undermine Italian morale and weaken opposi- tion to the invasion. He noted that if air power could not be concentrated against those two targets, the entire effort should fall on Sicily itself. In private, Spaatz had earlier expressed great faith in the psychological impact of bombing. On May 8, he wrote to a friend in Washington, D.C., that, in the B-17, the United States had discovered the principal weapon for concluding the war successfully. "We have ample evidence," remarked Spaatz, "to clearly indicate they can blast their way through any defenses and destroy the will to fight in any nation which may oppose us."36 261   ## p. 262 (#286) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Nine days after the Sicilian landings the AAF struck Rome in a raid that showed precision bombing at its best and helped to topple Mussolini's regime six
