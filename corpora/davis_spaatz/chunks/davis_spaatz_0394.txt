On June 24, he had written to Arnold that the fate of the air forces after the next two operations (Sicily and Salerno) concerned him greatly. He also believed that the heavy-bomber effort against Germany ought to come from more than just one base area: "If we can establish ourselves in Italy, much of Germany can be reached from there with better weather conditions at our airdromes than prevail normally in England. This would immediately, when applied, force a dispersion of the German fighter and anti-aircraft defenses."41 Spaatz suggested that the necessary heavy-bomber force could be obtained by converting his existing B-25 and B-26 groups to B-17 groups. The excess medium bombers could then go to the French. After talks with Doolittle, Spaatz reiterated most of his foregoing sugges- tions in a July 14 letter to Arnold. Spaatz did modify the proposal slightly by observing that not all of his medium-bomber groups could convert because ground support missions required aircraft with the medium bombers' operating characteristics. Again he pointed out the advantages of strategic bombing from Italy: I am confident we will progress up the Italian Peninsula, and before too many weeks have passed, will be in a position to bomb the fighter production plants 262   ## p. 263 (#287) ############################################  SALERNO AND LONDON in the vicinity of Vienna and other places now beyond the effort out of U.K. I believe points we can reach amount to 97% of their production.42 Arnold held different views. In late July, he told a member of the RAF Delegation in Washington that the fall of Sicily and potential fall of Italy did lit- tle for the Allies against Germany. Because the bombing offensive against Germany must come from Britain, the three B-24 groups on loan to Spaatz should be returned immediately. The best way to finish the war was to attack by the shortest wa
