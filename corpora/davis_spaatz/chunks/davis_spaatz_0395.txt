se the bombing offensive against Germany must come from Britain, the three B-24 groups on loan to Spaatz should be returned immediately. The best way to finish the war was to attack by the shortest way-across the channel. Arnold regarded Eisenhower's call for reinforcements in the Mediterranean as an extravagance that could compromise the cross-channel invasion.43 When the RAF Delegation reported these opinions to Portal, he instructed his mission in Washington to present the RAF's case for strategic bombing from Italy, especially from the central (Rome) and north (Po Valley) Italian areas. Portal, like Spaatz, pointed to the advantages of spreading German fighter defenses and placing more vital targets within easy range. He believed that without question the Allies should create in Italy the largest bomber force that a logistical base could support. He accepted the fact that the limiting element of logistics would mean a smaller total force in Italy than the one stationed in Britain.44 Air Marshal William Welsh, the head of the RAF Delegation, discussed Portal's ideas with Arnold on August 1 and reported considerable modification of Arnold's views. Arnold agreed completely on the need for a bomber force flying from northern Italy. A decisive factor in changing Arnold's mind may have been British intelligence indicating significant dispersal of German fighter assembly and manufacturing capacity to Austria and other southern European targets beyond the range of the Eighth Air Force's heavy bombers.45 But Arnold added a new wrinkle. He suggested that the Allied bomber offensive required a single overall commander to coordinate the strategic bombing forces in both Italy and Britain in order to avoid competition, overlarge liaison staffs, and con- stant appeals to the Combined Chiefs of Staff for decisions. Welsh warned Portal that Arnold would bring up the matter of command when they next met.46 In the meantime, AAF Headquarters rejected Spaatz's proposals to reequip h
