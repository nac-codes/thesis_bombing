Both forces would operate under the theater commander, but the Fifteenth would occasionally receive directives from the CCS for employment in the Combined Bomber Offensive. The Fifteenth would receive the Twelfth's six heavy groups and fifteen more from the continental United States. * POINTBLANK's first objective was to destroy the German daylight fighter forces, after which it would attack the German aircraft industry, the ball-bearing industry, and other high-value economic targets. 264   ## p. 265 (#289) ############################################  SALERNO AND LONDON Eaker and Devers objected vigorously, arguing that the plan diverted forces from Britain and sacrificed the principle of concentration of force, thereby jeop- ardizing POINTBLANK and OVERLORD. The JCS, after discussions with Bedell Smith and Spaatz, approved Arnold's plan. The JCS then submitted the matter to the Combined Chiefs of Staff, who had overall control of the Combined Bomber Offensive. The CCS agreed with a proviso inserted by the British that if logisti- cal problems prevented the stationing of heavy-bomber groups in the Mediter- ranean, then the excess bombers would go to Britain.58 The CCS directed Eisenhower to employ the Fifteenth Air Force against strategic targets.

Spaatz immediately obtained an authoritativ
