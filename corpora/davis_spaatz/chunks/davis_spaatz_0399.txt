Marsa on October 22, the same day the CCS approved the formation of the Fifteenth, quickly assured Arnold on the logistical capabilities of southern Italy. Spaatz immediately obtained an authoritative state- ment on logistics from a West Point classmate, Lt. Gen. Brehon B. Somervell, the crusty Commanding General, Army Services of Supply. Somervell, the Army's chief logistics and supply officer with a status virtually equal to Arnold's, had visited the Italian theater and Spaatz at the end of October. Armed with Somer- vell's estimate and the results of a recent inspection of Foggia and its supply line back to Taranto, Spaatz sent out a telegram, over Eisenhower's signature, mini- mizing supply difficulties. Eisenhower appended a staff report from Bedell Smith which indicated somewhat more soberly that Italy could support the planned influx of bombers and escorts. Smith's report gave Arnold the ammuni- tion he needed to refuse to discuss the issue when the British again questioned the capability of Italy to support additional strategic groups.60 For their part the British had come to question not the eventual need for the Fifteenth, whose existence they had already approved, but the timing of its increase. Portal had always favored strategic attacks from Italy because he assumed that the central and northern portions of the peninsula would be avail- able for bases. Hitler's decision to defend Italy south of Rome and Field Marshal Kesselring's successful execution of that policy upset his calculations, however, and he began to question the effectiveness of basing bombers at the Foggia fields in the south.61 In London, Eaker took issue with the rate of the Fifteenth's bomber and fighter group buildup specified in Eisenhower's instructions. He privately protested to the British that the nine heavy-bomber groups scheduled to go to Italy in November, December, and January should come to Britain, even if Italy could support them logistically.62 On October 26, the British
