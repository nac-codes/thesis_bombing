ritish that the nine heavy-bomber groups scheduled to go to Italy in November, December, and January should come to Britain, even if Italy could support them logistically.62 On October 26, the British Chiefs of Staff, reflecting Portal's and Eaker's positions, suggested to the CCS in Washington that the fifteen heavy-bombard- ment groups scheduled for Italy be redirected to their original destinationâ€” 265   ## p. 266 (#290) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Britain.

Churchill emphasized that the goal from the British must be "saturation" or overwhelming strength for the American day- light attacks.64 When the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington presented that position to the CCS, the Americans brushed it aside. At the October 29 meeting, Arnold, referring repeatedly to assurances given him by Spaatz, said that the buildup of the Fifteenth did not interfere with the strengthening of Eisenhower's tactical air or ground forces. Arnold maintained that bombers in Italy would be more effec- tive than those in Britain and renewed his promise to send to Britain all the groups that the Fifteenth could not supply or operate effectively. Marshall reminded the British that Eisenhower himself had called for a strategic air force in Italy, in part to have those forces at his disposal in case of a ground emer- gency, during which he could decide relative priorities.
