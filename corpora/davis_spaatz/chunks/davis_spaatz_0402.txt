The AAF and the RAF had separate agendas on the issue of command and control. Arnold and the AAF wanted a single Allied Strategic Air Force Commander in charge of the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces and Bomber Command, with headquarters in London and a status equal-presumably with four-star rank—to that of the European and Mediterranean theater commanders. This idea, if approved, would in a stroke make the AAF's and the RAF's strate- gic air forces independent of the ground forces' leaders and allow untrammeled pursuit of the strategic bomber campaign against Germany-the raison d'être of both air forces. In addition, the airman who held the post would emerge with a prestige that at least matched that of the war's other theater commanders, such as Generals Eisenhower and MacArthur and Admiral Chester Nimitz. Arnold probably assumed that the commander would be a member of the AAF, princi- pal supplier of aircraft. Even if an RAF officer got the job, Arnold would still have taken a large step toward eventual postwar autonomy for the AAF. Next, Arnold wanted a U.S. Strategic Air Force Commander in Europe (also based in London) who would take operational control of both U.S. strategic air forces (the Eighth and Fifteenth) and administrative control of the U.S. air forces in Britain (the Eighth and Ninth). The AAF would thus acquire control over all of its heavy bombers directed toward Germany. Without such a headquarters, the two strategic air forces, each under a separate theater commander, might well fail to coordinate their efforts adequately. Such a command would also be at least equal to Bomber Command in prestige and stature and would certainly
