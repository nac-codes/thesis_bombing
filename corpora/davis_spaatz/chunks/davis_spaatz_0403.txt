h under a separate theater commander, might well fail to coordinate their efforts adequately. Such a command would also be at least equal to Bomber Command in prestige and stature and would certainly exceed it in numbers of heavy bombers. Because this headquarters would be in London, it could still take advantage of British intelligence and cooperate with Bomber Commandâ€”a unit already headed by an officer with the equivalent of four-star rank. His U.S. opposite number would probably have the same rank, which would reflect well on the AAF. By giving the U.S. Strategic Commander administrative control of the Ninth (Tactical) Air Force, which was slated to provide tactical air support for the cross-channel invasion, Arnold may have hoped to influence what promised to be the major U.S. land campaign of the war and to augment the power and prestige of the head of the U.S. Strategic Bomber Command.66 Although Arnold's plan stemmed from both his proposal for a combined bomber command in the summer of 1942 and his and Spaatz's advocacy of a single theater air force in the fall of 1942, his campaign for the acceptance of a new strategic command began no later than August 1, 1943, when he informed the head of the RAF Delegation in Washington, Air Marshal Welsh, of his idea for an overall commander.67 Arnold continued to explore the idea during a trip to visit Britain and Eaker in September 1943. After spending three days inspect- ing the Eighth, Arnold visited Air Chief Marshal Harris at Bomber Command on September 5. That evening he and Harris discussed the subject of a combined 267   ## p. 268 (#292) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE command "in generalities." Arnold favored the plan because it allowed more efficient use of aircraft. Harris objected chiefly, as Arnold noted in his trip jour- nal, because the British would then lose control of the bomber offensive. Harris, who operated with virtual autonomy from the RAF staff, cou
