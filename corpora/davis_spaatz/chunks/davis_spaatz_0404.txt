Harris objected chiefly, as Arnold noted in his trip jour- nal, because the British would then lose control of the bomber offensive. Harris, who operated with virtual autonomy from the RAF staff, could hardly be expected to accept an American superior when he had already freed himself from a British one.68 Arnold also discussed his plan with Portal,69 who probably indicated that he found it impractical. By early October, Arnold had carried his ideas to Harry Hopkins, Franklin Roosevelt's alter ego, who endorsed them and presented them to the President.70 A month later, Marshall, who by and large supported Arnold's position, advised him not to press the question until after the settlement of the more important questions of a unified Mediterranean command proposed by the British and the appointment of a single supreme commander for all U.S.-British forces fighting against the Germans.71 Nevertheless, Arnold persevered in his advocacy of new command arrange- ments. When the President made the first leg of his trip to the initial Big Three meeting with Churchill and Stalin at Tehran, Iran, in November 1943, he sailed on the brand-new U.S. battleship Iowa. The U.S. Chiefs traveled with him and added the finishing touches to their presentations and plans for the Cairo Conference with Churchill and Chinese leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, November 22-26, and the Tehran Conference, November 28 to December 1. During the voyage Arnold succeeded in gaining the backing of his fellow chiefs and the President for his command scheme. In a JCS memo for the President dated November 17, 1943, the JCS stated that from the military point of view the operation of the British and American strategic bombers required unity of command. The memo, which offered different proposals depending on how the British reacted to the American push for a supreme Allied commander in Europe, specified a single bomber command whether the British agreed to an overall supreme commander or not.72 The ne
