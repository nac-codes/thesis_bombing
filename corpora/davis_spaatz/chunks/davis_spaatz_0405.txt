on how the British reacted to the American push for a supreme Allied commander in Europe, specified a single bomber command whether the British agreed to an overall supreme commander or not.72 The next day Arnold obtained the American Chiefs' agreement for the for- mation of a new U.S. headquarters to command and control all U.S. strategic bomber forces in Europe. The U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF) would command both the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces from London, where it could coordinate action with British Bomber Command. The theater comman- ders retained the right, upon notification of the Commanding General, USSTAF, to deploy bombers in the event of a tactical or strategic emergency.

His name went forward to the President with the rest of the package.73 Arnold chose Spaatz to head USSTAF for both professional and personal reasons.

On paper and subject to concurrence by the AAF, therefore, the British were in charge of the Combined Bomber Offensive, and Bomber Command remained an independent part of the offensive.
