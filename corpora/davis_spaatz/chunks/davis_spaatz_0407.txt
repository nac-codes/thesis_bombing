ets of a "psychological" nature, such as rail centers and depots, but noted that con- tinued destruction of fighter and munitions factories in Germany would advance the Soviet cause as much as any other targets.75 Next, Hopkins asked Spaatz for his views on the Combined Bomber Offensive and its relationship to the cross-channel invasion and to operations in the Mediterranean. Spaatz replied boldly that once the weather cleared over Germany in April and May, thus allowing continuous operations from Britain and Italy, Germany would give up in three months. OVERLORD, Spaatz thought, was neither necessary nor desirable. From the point of view of air power, further gains in Italy would bring the bombers closer to Germany and represented a bet- ter investment in men and mat√©riel than the cross-channel invasion. Hopkins was impressed but unconvinced.76 He belonged to the Marshall/War Department Operations Planning Division school of strategy, which upheld the primacy of the OVERLORD cross-channel invasion over all other operations.

Once the chiefs of state and their military leaders assembled in Cairo on November 23, Arnold's proposals encountered stiff opposition from the British. Although Marshall and Roosevelt, on separate occasions, brought up the issue of an overall Allied strategic air force with Churchill, they could not overcome British resistance. To Roosevelt's observation that "our strategic air forces from London to Ankara should be under one command," Churchill replied that a deci- sion on the matter could be deferred until after OVERLORD and that the current system worked well enough.77 The dispute was not resolved
