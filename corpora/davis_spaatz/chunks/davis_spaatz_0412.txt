As Arnold and Spaatz had confirmed that day, Tedder would soon vacate his post as Air Officer Commanding, Mediterranean Allied Air Forces (MAAF) to go to England as Eisenhower's deputy commander (not as deputy for air). Eaker's transfer south would allow the AAF to fill the chief air command in the Mediterranean-a position promised to the Americans during the general reorganization of the commands in the theater-with a widely expe- rienced combat officer. After their meeting Arnold and Spaatz talked briefly with Eisenhower; they recommended Eaker's transfer and Eisenhower agreed.93 In addition, Spaatz reiterated to Eisenhower what he had told Bedell Smith-when the cross-chan- nel battle began, Spaatz should serve directly under Eisenhower so that all of the power of the strategic air forces could assist the invasion.94 The three generals left the conference unsure about exactly what form the subordination of USSTAF to the Supreme Allied Commander would take and when it would occur.95 Two and one-half weeks later, on Christmas Day, Eisenhower con- fessed to Marshall, "To be perfectly frank, this assignment for Spaatz leaves me somewhat puzzled as to purpose and . . . position of such a command in an American organization, since we always, in each Theater, insist upon a single commander."96 After these brief meetings, all of which took place in little more than an 272   ## p. 273 (#297) ############################################  SALERNO AND LONDON hour, Spaatz returned to Foggia and his palatial headquarters with Arnold, where they spent the night.
