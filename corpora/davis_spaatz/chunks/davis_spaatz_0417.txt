e Brereton's place I can assure him a warm welcome and a receptive ear for his Pacific experience."109 All this was to no avail. Arnold's replies to Portal and Devers (written by Kuter) emphasized the need for a man of Eaker's qualities in the Mediterranean (to fill the vacuum left by Spaatz). To Devers, Arnold added, "This move is necessary from the view- point of world wide air operations."110 To Portal, Arnold replied that General Wilson would find Eaker topnotch in the Mediterranean and "the Spaatz- Doolittle-Anderson team a vigorous and effective one in the U.K.”111 Arnold did his best to quash any hope Eaker retained of staying with the Eighth: “I extend to you my heartfelt thanks for the splendid cooperation and loyalty that you have given me thus far and for the wonderful success of your organization, but I cannot, repeat, not see my way clear to make any change in the decisions already reached."112 Spaatz, after receiving Arnold's approval, replied in a vari- ation on the same theme: "Command of an Air Force in either place is relatively of less importance as compared to overall requirements, particularly since Eighth Air Force under new setup will function as an operating headquarters more nearly approximating Eighth bomber command."113 Eaker's appeals did not go completely unheeded. On December 23, Bedell Smith informed Spaatz, that "strong objections are being raised to the transfer of Eaker from the U.K." Spaatz, who replied that he would not go to England unless Ira Eaker came to the Mediterranean, 114 still believed that the AAF in the Mediterranean required Eaker's leadership to replace his own.115 In a post- war interview he said: I know this-that I would have been satisfied to have stayed down in the Mediterranean and command the Mediterranean Air Force, if I hadn't had to go up on that cross-channel operation. . . . I didn't look forward at all to England at that time. I felt my job down in the Mediterranean was just the job I wanted to have.116 F
