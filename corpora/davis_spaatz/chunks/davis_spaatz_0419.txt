- ated the impression that not he, but Spaatz and Tedder, wanted Eaker ousted. On Christmas day in Tunis Eisenhower told Spaatz that he would send a message to Marshall in which he would give Spaatz's views as his own. Spaatz again remarked in his diary, "General Eisenhower has [been] and is firm in [his] decisions and I consider him one of the finest men I know."121 In his â€œEyes Only" cable to Marshall, Eisenhower gave assurances that he had studied the proposed personnel changes for some time and had a "completely objective" attitude in recommending them.

He then added his own opinion that if Spaatz left for Britain, Eaker must
