would not go to Britain unless Eaker was transferred, Eisenhower per- suaded Marshall to bow to the new arrangements. Spaatz, too, had taken a straightforward position during the Eaker transfer. At no point in his wartime papers or postwar interviews did he criticize Eaker's performance in command of the Eighth. Unlike Arnold, Spaatz had extensive personal experience with difficulties involved in the mounting of large-scale heavy-bomber missions and with the frustrating and peculiar weather conditions in England and Western Europe. Spaatz believed in Ira Eaker's great ability, especially as a military diplomat, and wanted him in the Mediterranean to advance the war effort and the AAF's cause as the new Commander of the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces. Knowing that Eisenhower wanted him in London, Spaatz told Arnold: "If I go to England, then Ira must have command of the air forces in the Mediterranean."126 He did not consider Eaker's move a demotion;127 in fact, Spaatz later credited himself with the original recommen- dation that Eaker move. 128 He wanted Eaker in the Mediterranean because he knew that, given the complex and intermingled operational and administrative controls over the American air forces in Europe in which he and Eaker would operate, he needed a man he knew and trusted. 129 There was no hint that Spaatz advocated Eaker's transfer in order to remove a rival or a possible center of opposition from England. Unlike Eisenhower and Spaatz, Arnold had mixed motives in removing Eaker. AAF official historians said in 1949, "If Arnold's dissatisfaction over the rate of Eighth Air Force operations entered into the decision, the record appar- ently has left no evidence of it."130 The diplomatic record of the Cairo Confer- ence, published in 1961, and Arnold's own memoirs, published in 1949, contra- dicted them. Arnold probably did feel that Eaker's talents could be more effec- tively applied in the Mediterranean, but he did not lose sight of his main goal- r
