well-organized, and well-supplied American air forces. Of course, a year's worth of combat experience and the fruits of America's vast industrial effort did much to improve their status. Spaatz also deserves credit as a military administrator. The responsi- bility for military administration rested in his headquarters, not in Tedder's Mediterranean Air Command or the Strategic, Tactical, and Coastal Air Forces. They dealt only with operations. 133 Without Spaatz's efforts there might have been not only one air force, but one air force dominated by the RAF and devoted to the close support of the army. Spaatz's establishment of a strategic air force, over the objections of those favoring a stronger heavy-bomber buildup in England, would also prove important in the long run. Bombers based in Britain did not have the range to hit the vital Axis oil targets of southeastern Europe. Without the Fifteenth Air Force, the Allied bombing campaign would have achieved substantially fewer results. Arnold might well have refused to consider splitting his forces in the face of the enemy and handing part of them over to an officer he did not know as well or trust as completely as Spaatz. 280   ## p. 281 (#305) ############################################  Part Four The Point of the Blade Strategic Bombing and the Cross-Channel Invasion January-June 1944   ## p. 282 (#306) ############################################    ## p. 283 (#307) ############################################  Part Four The Point of the Blade Strategic Bombing bears the same relationship to tactical bombing as does the cow to a pail of milk. To deny imme- diate aid and comfort to the enemy, tactical considerations dictate upsetting the bucket. To insure eventual starvation, the strategic move is to kill the cow.ยน -U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, November 1945 On January 1, 1944, Lt. Gen. Carl A. Spaatz officially assumed command of the United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF). This new headquar- ter
