Spaatz was compelled to substitute sheer tonnage for precision when his bombers failed to destroy their targets-this practice required bombing in less-than-perfect weather conditions and using radar for navigation and sighting. 283   ## p. 284 (#308) ############################################  By January 1944, the Americans' operational plan for their part of the Combined Bomber Offensive, known as POINTBLANK, had three high-priority targets: (1) single-engine fighter plane production, (2) twin-engine fighter plane production, and (3) German antifriction bearing manufacturing.3 As a single overriding prerequisite to the neutralization of these targets, POINTBLANK called for the destruction of the Luftwaffe's fighter forces in being-the chief obstacle to the success of the Combined Bomber Offensive. POINTBLANK had its origins at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, where Roosevelt, Churchill, and their military staffs had agreed to a bomber offensive against Germany. In May 1943, at the Washington Conference, the Combined Chiefs of Staff approved a plan for the Combined Bomber Offensive drawn up by Eaker and the Eighth Air Force. This plan was based on priorities originated by an AAF-supported study group (the Committee of Operations Analysts) and agreed on, with some modifi- cations, by experts of the British Ministry of Economic Warfare and the RAF Air Staff.4 The plan gave the highest priority to German fighter plane production. Early elimination of fighter manufacture was essential to the accomplishment of the rest of the Combined Bomber Offensive and would heighten the chances of suc- cess for the cross-channel invasion by reducing expected air opposition. Allied planners had identified antifriction, or ball, bearings as crucial in the production of German war mat√©riel. The effects of their unavailability, althoug
