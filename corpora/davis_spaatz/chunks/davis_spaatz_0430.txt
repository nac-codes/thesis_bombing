cember 4, 1943, that "the program was, in fact, some three months behind [schedule]."7 As of early January 1944, Eighth Air Force statistics, only slightly skewed by the disastrous Schweinfurt mission, 287   ## p. 288 (#312) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE showed that only 26 percent of those crews beginning operational tours in the theater could expect to complete twenty-five missions (the minimum needed to return to the States); 57 percent would be dead or missing; and the remaining 17 percent would fail to complete their tours because of combat fatigue, accidental death, transfer, or administrative reasons.8 Arnold reported only slightly less dis- couraging statistics to Marshall, noting that the Eighth's 3.8 percent loss rate per mission from July through November translated into a loss of 64 crew members* out of every 100.9 Spaatz, however, would soon take advantage of opportunities and resources unavailable to his unlucky predecessor, Ira Eaker. In a campaign that bore some resemblance to that of Ulysses S. Grant versus Robert E. Lee in the spring of 1864, Spaatz would use every opportunity to close with the Luftwaffe and force it to bleed and die. Similarly, just as the relative contributions of Grant and George G. Meade, the actual commander of the Union Army of the Potomac, blurred and merged, so, too, did those of Spaatz and his chief subordinate Maj. Gen. James H. Doolittle. Grant's drive from Fredericksburg to Petersburg destroyed the offensive potential of Lee's army and tied it to a trench system that it could not successfully defend. Spaatz, in the upcoming campaign, would pull the Luftwaffe's teeth, forcing it to defend only the most preeminently important target systems, such as oil, while allowing the AAF daylight air supremacy over Germany. Also like Grant, Spaatz benefited through the prodi- gal output of men and material from an industrial economy whose production was overwhelming. The pipeline that
