daylight air supremacy over Germany. Also like Grant, Spaatz benefited through the prodi- gal output of men and material from an industrial economy whose production was overwhelming. The pipeline that had supplied Eaker with only a slowly increasing force overflowed in late 1943 and early 1944 for Spaatz. The Allied victory in the Battle of the Atlantic and massive U.S. merchant shipping production turned the constricted flow of supplies that had slowed the U.S. buildup in Britain for the first one and a half years of the war into a fast-flowing river. As a consequence of delays caused, in part, by a January 1943 decision by Arnold and Spaatz to divert P-38s to the North African Theater, Eaker's first operational P-38 "Lightning" long-range fighter group (the 55th) of approximately seventy-five aircraft became operational the day after the Schweinfurt mission. The P-38s of the 20th Fighter Group went into action in December 1943, as did the first long- range P-51B Mustang fighters (the Ninth Air Force's 354th Fighter Group). In March the P-51 began to use new external fuel tanks (drop tanks), which en- abled it to go as far as any bombers in the theater. 10 As of December 30, 1943, the Army Air Forces in England comprised 4,618 * A loss rate of 3.8 percent per mission meant that 3.8 percent of the original force was lost on each mission. By the end of 25 missions the cumulative loss suffered by the original 100 air crews was therefore 64 air crews, even though only 3.8 percent, on average, were lost in a single mission. Reinforcement of the original 100 crews would have no effect on their chances for statistical sur- vival because new arrivals would be lost at the same rate. 288   ## p. 289 (#313) ############################################   us Lt.
