So determinedly did he press for WACS that in February 1944 General Arnold succeeded in obtaining a USSTAF allo- cation of them separate from that of the European Theater of Operations.

This effort to eliminate the sites, code-named CROSSBOW, would divert, over Spaatz's continued objections, much of the AAF's strength from both strategic and preinvasion bombing. After this first experience with CROSSBOW Spaatz noted, somewhat acerbically, that it was "very apparent from all conversations so far" that "everyone" ac
