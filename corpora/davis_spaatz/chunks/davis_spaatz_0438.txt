from both strategic and preinvasion bombing. After this first experience with CROSSBOW Spaatz noted, somewhat acerbically, that it was "very apparent from all conversations so far" that "everyone" accepted the CROSSBOW diversion from the main air effort. Spaatz went on to observe that if the Germans considered CROSSBOW so important, why had fighter opposition to raids on the sites decreased from November to December?23 From the beginning of January to February 15, the weather and CROSSBOW proved almost as adversarial to the U.S. daylight bombing offensive as the Luftwaffe. In that period the Eighth's heavy bombers flew combat missions on twenty-one days. Only six of those bombing missions went forward under com- pletely visual conditions, and only two of those six attacked strategic targets in Germany. Nine other missions struck V-1 launch sites in France.24 In eleven of the thirteen missions over Germany the AAF resorted to bombing directed by an early, inaccurate system of radar which enabled the Eighth to conduct only area bombing. Area bombing tormented the Germans but did not provide results any- where close to those obtained by visual means. The Eighth had only twelve B-17s 296   ## p. 297 (#321) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE ENGAGED equipped with H2X radar equipment. They arrived in October 1943 with hand- built equipment and served as pathfinders (PFF), or lead planes, for bomber groups.25 Spaatz and Doolittle worked them hard. Their crews became exhausted. The American H2X derived from the British-developed H2S radar bombing system. H2X was critically important in increasing American bomb tonnage dropped on Europe because it enabled operations in overcast conditions. Its con- tribution to the weight of the U.S. bombing effort in 1944-1945 was second only to the success of the U.S. long-range fighter escorts in preserving the bombers themselves. That H2X stemmed from British, not American, efforts constituted another indictment
