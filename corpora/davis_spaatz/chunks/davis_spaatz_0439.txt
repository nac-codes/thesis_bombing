944-1945 was second only to the success of the U.S. long-range fighter escorts in preserving the bombers themselves. That H2X stemmed from British, not American, efforts constituted another indictment of prewar U.S. military air thinking. America's failure to anticipate the need for long-range fighter escort and to develop as early as possible the ability to locate and bomb targets through clouds left U.S. strate- gic bombers operable at only a fraction of their strength and almost ruined the efforts of the AAF. The Americans owed a great debt to the RAF not only for the P-51 but for H2X as well. Ever mindful of public perception, Arnold instructed Spaatz to abjure the term "blind bombing" for the H2X technique, because it gave "both the military and the public an erroneous impression."26 Spaatz agreed to use such terms as "overcast bombing technique," "bombing through overcast," "bombing with navigational devices over clouds extending up to 20,000 feet."27 He also pressed Lt. Gen. Carl A. Spaatz and his executive officer, Capt. Sally Bagby, Women's Army Corps, spring 1944.  *** 297   ## p. 298 (#322) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Arnold for more radar-equipped planes, explaining that the â€œresults of the past two months' extensive use of Pathfinder (H2X) aircraft in the Eighth Air Force have shown the equipment offers enormous possibilities for further intensifica- tion of the bombing offensive against Germany." He drove the point home by adding, "The most critical need of the Strategic Air Forces is for more Pathfinder aircraft. A few H2X airplanes now will profit our cause more than several hundred in six months" [emphasis in original].28 The bombing of Germany by nonvisual means continued a policy begun under Eaker in the last quarter of 1943. Although nowhere nearly as accurate as precision bombing, radar bombing allowed more frequent operations, main- tained the pressure on German cities, and forced the Luftwaffe
