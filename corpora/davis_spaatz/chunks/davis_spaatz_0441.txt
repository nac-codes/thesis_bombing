Eaker's tactics. AAF Field Manual 1-15, "Tactics and Techniques of Air Fighting," of April 10, 1942, and AAF Field Manual 1-5, of January 18, 1943, emphasized pursuit's air defense and escort roles, with a bow to ground support. The replacement for the latter manual, War Department Field Manual 100-20, sent a mixed message. In addressing the role of fighters belonging to a strategic air force, such as the Eighth, it stated, "Accompanying fighter aviation, where its radius of action permits, is also used to increase [the bomber's] security. Fighter aviation also furnishes air base defense for bombardment bases."30 That passage offered little encouragement for aggressive action.

The manual's tactical section reflected Spaatz's experience with the AAF in North Africa, as the strategic section reflected Eaker's experi- ence with the Eighth Air Force in Europe. Unlike Eaker, Spaatz and Doolittle decided on or before their arrival in Britain to intensify the campaign against the Luftwaffe by using their fighters in an offensive air-to-air role, instead of purely as escorts. Spaatz also intended to use the Ninth (Tactical) Air Force to assist in t
