sify the campaign against the Luftwaffe by using their fighters in an offensive air-to-air role, instead of purely as escorts. Spaatz also intended to use the Ninth (Tactical) Air Force to assist in the counterair effort, despite the fact that Leigh-Mallory intended to use it for preinvasion operations. Shortly after Spaatz's visit to Washington two months earlier, Arnold had expressed to Marshall similarly aggressive sentiments which were probably reflective of his own combative temperament but could have come, in part, from Spaatz. Spaatz might have discussed his experiences in the Mediterranean campaign with Arnold. In any case, Arnold recommended in a memo to Marshall that the Allied air forces "seek out and destroy the German Air Force in the air and on the 299   ## p. 300 (#324) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE ground without delay.

Both men must have realized and counted on the fact that a changeover to offensive fighter tactics would impose a far higher rate of attrition on both the Luftwaffe and the AAF. Arnold would have to support Spaatz with many replacement fighter pilots and aircraft. On several occasions, especially in his first meetings with Eighth Air Force staff personnel, Spaatz reiterated his desire to close with the Luftwaffe. On January 9, he visited the Eighth's War Room. There he met an old acquaintance, Col. Richard D'O.

The EOU served as the de facto target planning staff of the
