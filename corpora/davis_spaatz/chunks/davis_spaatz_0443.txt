rincipal link between the Eighth Air Force and the Enemy Objectives Unit (EOU) of the Economic Warfare Division of the U.S. Embassy, London. The EOU served as the de facto target planning staff of the Eighth. Hughes, an expatriate British subject with numerous British decorations and long-time service in the British Indian Army, served his new country ably not only by applying his considerable intellect to the complicated issues of targeting but also by using the British "old boy" network to gain entrée to British intelligence and targeting agencies.34 Spaatz told Hughes of his main objective to knock out the Luftwaffe by hit- ting it in the air, on its airfields, and at its fighter factories: It is my belief that we do not get sufficient attrition by hitting fighter factories, therefore we must place emphasis on airdromes and knocking them down in the air. Our mission is destroying the German Air Force, and that we will hit pri- mary objectives when weather permits, but at other times will choose targets as stated above, which will bring fighters into the air.35 Spaatz had voiced this concept of targeting vital economic objectives to force Luftwaffe attrition almost two years earlier,36 and it remained one of his guiding principles throughout the war. On subsequent days Spaatz repeated to Hughes and to his operational com- manders, Anderson and Doolittle, that he considered his chief mission the destruction of the Luftwaffe and that he would not even wait for "proper weather [in which] to bomb the priority targets."37 Spaatz's official "Opera- tional Directive" instructed Doolittle to hit the airframe factories and the German fighters “in the air and on the ground."38 On January 21, in the first of a weekly series of "Eyes Only" reports to Arnold, Spaatz optimistically wrote that he needed only a few days of visual bombing to wreck the remaining fighter and ball-bearing factories. Then, "all other attacks will be made on the basis of destroying enemy air force in a
