wrote that he needed only a few days of visual bombing to wreck the remaining fighter and ball-bearing factories. Then, "all other attacks will be made on the basis of destroying enemy air force in air and on ground. Such attacks will be made so far as possible under conditions most favorable to ourselves and normally will be against objectives which force German fighters into combat action within range of our fighters."39 300   ## p. 301 (#325) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE ENGAGED By late January, Spaatz had come to the realization that "we must continue to attrit the German Air Force on the ground whenever we can operate." In a let- ter to Arnold, Spaatz stated his policy: I feel you would become very impatient with me if this very large striking force spent most of its time on the ground or in training flights, waiting for the few days when visual bombing permits hitting our primary targets-the aircraft fac- tories. I also feel sure that to confine our operations to that alone would not deplete the German Air Force at the necessary rate.40 Neither Arnold nor Eaker, who had held similar views while leading the Eighth, disagreed with these sentiments. What made Spaatz's formulation unique was his insistence on attacking the Luftwaffe on the ground as well as in the air. Thanks to Spaatz's experience in Tunisia and particularly in Sicily, he had first- hand knowledge of the devastating effect of a prolonged counterair campaign on the Axis air force bases in the Mediterranean. Hundreds of German planes, many repairable, had littered Sicilian airfields and fallen into Allied hands. Spaatz reiterated this point to Arnold: "I feel personally that this matter of hit- ting airdromes from U.K. requires a shot in the arm, both as to methods of attack and frequency of attack. I believe that in our penetration into Germany that advantage must be taken of the use of intruder aircraft."41 Spaatz expressed sim- ilar views to the Assistant Secretar
