tack and frequency of attack. I believe that in our penetration into Germany that advantage must be taken of the use of intruder aircraft."41 Spaatz expressed sim- ilar views to the Assistant Secretary of War for Air, Robert A. Lovett: I believe that some of the methods applied in the Mediterranean are applicable here. . . . My tendency will be to place a little bit more emphasis upon swatting the enemy on his airdromes whenever possible and [on forcing] him to fight under conditions most advantageous to us.42 Spaatz also communicated this insistence on attacking the Luftwaffe before it could become airborne to Eisenhower and Tedder. On January 22, Spaatz dis- cussed his plans for USSTAF with Eisenhower. They were, first, to attack fighter and ball-bearing plants whenever conditions permitted visual bombings and, second, to attack “targets in Germany under conditions most favorable to obtain maximum destruction of German fighters in the air and on the ground."43 Later in the day Spaatz discussed his plans with Tedder. They "agreed that attacks so far on airdromes had been unfruitful here, possibly due to wrong method of attack."44 By choosing to attack the Luftwaffe rather than to defend against it, Spaatz had found the way to break the German fighter force. After December 1943, the number of U.S. fighter aircraft on hand in fully operational tactical units dramat- ically increased. The AAF had the means as well as the method of taking the battle to the Luftwaffe.45 By April 1944, American fighter sweeps and intruder missions, which Spaatz and Doolittle had launched once they had sufficient long-range fighter aircraft, were disrupting all types of German air activity— trainee pilots could not even be assured of practicing in the air unmolested.
