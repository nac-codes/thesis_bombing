In January ULTRA revealed Hitler's orders to cut back Luftwaffe meteorological operations and shorten the recuperation period for wounded pilots. By February 6, ULTRA supplied further evidence of a Luftwaffe comb-out of its noncombatants to provide pilots and to meet the needs of the land forces.49 The knowledge that the enemy's resources were becoming ever tauter must have added to Spaatz's determination to main- tain and increase the pressure on the foe. Spaatz knew that if enough Luftwaffe fighter planes went down, Germany could neither defend its industry nor contest the air over the beachhead. The requirements of both POINTBLANK and OVERLORD for air superiority necessitated knocking out the Luftwaffe by no later than May 1. Spaatz had 120 days in which to ruin the offensive power of a large, modern air force. An examination of the Eighth's first mission of the year, on January 11, proved typical of many of the missions of the next few weeks. Weather forecasters predicted clear weather over key aircraft plants at Oschersleben and Halberstadt and in the Brunswick area. The nature and location of these targets, some less than a hundred miles from Berlin, assured a heavy and active defense effort by the Luftwaffe. The Eighth's eleven groups of P-47s, joined by two groups of P-38s, provided cover from the Dutch coast to within fifty to seventy miles of the tar- gets. A lone P-51 group would escort the first of the bomber formations all the way to and from the target.50 As the heavy bombers left their bases in Britain, the weather deteriorated, making takeoff and assembly difficult. Nevertheless, 663 B-24s and B-17s left their fields. Weather continued to worsen, causing the 2d (B-24s) and 3d (B-17s and B-24s) Bombardment Division
