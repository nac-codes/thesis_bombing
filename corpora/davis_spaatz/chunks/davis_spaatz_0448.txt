eriorated, making takeoff and assembly difficult. Nevertheless, 663 B-24s and B-17s left their fields. Weather continued to worsen, causing the 2d (B-24s) and 3d (B-17s and B-24s) Bombardment Divisions to abort their flights short of their primary targets. Instead, they bombed targets of opportunity in western Germany. The remaining 291 bombers hit their targets but suffered severely from fierce Luftwaffe reaction. Using improved tactics and fuel tanks developed in the sum- mer and fall of 1943, the German fighters waited until most of the escorts had left and then attacked the bombers. Forty-two American heavy bombers failed to return 13 percent of the force engaged. All 44 American P-51s fought well, but weakened their effort by spreading themselves over too large an area in an attempt to defend the widely dispersed U.S. bomber formations. Even so, the P-51s were credited with more German aircraft kills than 177 P-47s which had escorted the bombers part of the way to the target area. Obviously, the Germans had been able to avoid the P-47s but not the P-51s,51 but the P-51s also reached the initial rendezvous point too soon, and thus had insufficient fuel to cover the bombers on their return from the targets to the P-47s and P-38s providing with- drawal escort. Meanwhile, the weather over England degraded further, and the returning 1st Bombardment Division planes had to land on unfamiliar runways belonging to the 2d and 3d Divisions. Subsequent air reconnaissance revealed that the plant at Oschersleben had suffered severe damage, and one of the Brunswick targets, Waggam, site of an aircraft production complex, had received 303   ## p. 304 (#328) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE  LM COR 27870 LM 16347 LM LM LMC 87044 Early model P-47s over England, summer 1943. direct hits on almost every one of its assembly plants.52 Spaatz and Maj.
