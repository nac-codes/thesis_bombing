to run an Air Force continuously hampered or grounded by weather."56 On January 29 and 30, conditions over England improved enough to allow the dispatch of large missions against Frankfurt-am-Main (over 800 heavy bombers) and Brunswick. Unfortunately, both missions had to bomb through heavy overcast with the assistance of H2X. By the end of January 1944, little time remained before POINTBLANK's subor- dination to OVERLORD. Spaatz had at most two months to devote the full force of USSTAF to strategic objectives because by April 1, sixty days prior to the sched- uled launching of the cross-channel operation, the needs of the invasion would take primacy. On January 26, Spaatz wrote Eaker, “I have reviewed the problem of strategic bombing of our enemies, and the thing that has struck me most is the critical time factor. We have very little time in which to finish our job.” On February 3, the Eighth sent more than 700 bombers in a pathfinder-led attack on Wilhelmshaven. Bad weather caused 100 of those bombers to abort and another 61 to bomb targets of opportunity in Emden. The next day, another pathfinder/bombing-through-clouds raid directed at Frankfurt-am-Main suffered from weather and navigational problems, and only 233 of 433 bombers sent out bombed their primary target. The remainder again bombed various targets of opportunity. This pattern, but on a lighter scale, continued until February 19.57 On February 17, Portal issued a new bombing directive to both Spaatz and Harris confirming target priorities agreed on in mid-January. The primary objec- tive remained the destruction of the Luftwaffe. Single- and twin-engine fighter airframe and airframe component production and Axis ball-bearing industry tar- gets were again accorded first priority; second priority went to installations sup- porting German fighter air forces and other objectives such as CROSSBOW, "Berlin and other industrial areas," and targets in southeastern Europe, such as cities and transportation tar
