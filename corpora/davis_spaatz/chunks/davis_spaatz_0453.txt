Bernard L. Montgomery, Commander, 21 Army Group. Montgomery's army group, composed of the British 2d Army under Lt. Gen. Miles Dempsey and the U.S. First Army under Lt. Gen. Omar N. Bradley, would conduct the ground assault. After Montgomery had established and enlarged the beachhead, the Allies would create additional Commonwealth and American armies, where- upon Bradley would form an all-American army group (the 12th). Bradley's first additional army would be the U.S. Third Army under the redoubtable Lt. Gen. George S. Patton. Each of the service components of the Allied Expeditionary Force had a clearly defined mission. The naval forces would convoy amphibious assault troops to Normandy, prevent German naval interference (minimal at best), keep the seaborne supply lines to France open, and provide naval gunfire support to the troops. The 21 Army Group would force its way ashore, form and expand a beachhead, and, after a few weeks, break out of the beachhead and begin an offensive across France and as far as necessary into Germany to defeat the Third Reich. The AEAF would maintain air supremacy over the invasion convoys, the beachhead, and subsequent operations of the ground forces. It would further interfere with and delay as far as possible the movement of German reinforce- ments toward the beachhead, would transport and supply the airborne assault forces, and would provide necessary air support for the ground forces. (See Chart 5, Chain of Command, Allied Expeditionary Force, February 13, 1944.) To accomplish his mission Leigh-Mallory had two Allied air forces assigned to his operational control, the British 2d Tactical Air Force under Air Marshal Arthur Coningham and the U.S. Ninth Air Force commanded by Maj. Gen. Lewis Brereton. Coningham's force consisted of three groups: the newly formed No. 83 and No. 84 Groups made up of fighters and fighter-bombers taken from Fighter Command, reconnaissance aircraft acquired from the dissolution of Army Co-operation Com
