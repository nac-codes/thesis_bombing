s disturbing in its implication. He states that the British Chiefs of Staff have forwarded to the American Chiefs of Staff a paper which proposes that the Combined Chiefs of Staff shall dictate in detail the organization of tacti- cal air forces for OVERLORD."82 Eisenhower objected strongly, asking Marshall to employ his full authority to oppose the scheme. He also pointed out that he and other veterans of the Mediterranean had learned several hard lessons in air power, which he did not want thrown away by "rigid directives." Eisenhower particularly objected to a proposal for two separate tactical air forces: "I simply cannot conceive of such an idea." He had come a long way from the general who had condoned the parceling out of air power in Tunisia. Eisenhower continued, â€œI hear that Tedder, who I have assumed to be my chief air man, is really intended to be an officer without portfolio, and that a man named Mallory is to be my chief air man."83 Eisenhower did not object to Leigh-Mallory, whose qualifications as a fighter expert, he thought, would be most useful at critical stages of the cam- paign. What he resented was his being unable to use Tedder as he wanted because of high-level British interference.84 After meetings with Marshall and Arnold in Washington, Eisenhower warned Bedell Smith on January 5 that he anticipated trouble in securing the necessary approval for the integration of all forces essential to the success of the cross-channel invasion. Eisenhower noted, "I suspect that the use of these air forces for the necessary preparatory phase will be particularly resisted.

Eisenhower therefore requested that Tedder proceed to London at once and consult with Spaatz and others on the plan.85 Eisenhower assumed
