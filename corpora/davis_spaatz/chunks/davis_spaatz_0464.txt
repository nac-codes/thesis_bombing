der Eisenhower both administratively and operationally. Giles agreed that Spaatz and Eisenhower would be left to settle command arrangements between themselves.87 In the afternoon of Eisenhower's first day of work as Supreme Commander, January 17, he and Spaatz met. Eisenhower admitted that he had received no clarification of the "present confused air situation" while in Washington.88 Both agreed to soft-pedal any dramatic action and to proceed with the current cumber- some arrangements. Eisenhower directed his chief of staff immediately to publish an order giving Spaatz administrative responsibility for all U.S. air units in the theater. He also approved the plan to place his own headquarters at WIDEWINGS, Bushy Park, putting himself and Tedder near USSTAF Headquarters.89 On January 22, Spaatz and Tedder discussed air command assignments. They both believed that their old Mediterranean methods would serve admirably for Operation OVERLORD; Tedder should preside over a joint command post, and RAF Bomber Command, the Eighth Air Force, and the tactical air forces should all have representatives present at daily meetings held in USSTAF'S War Room. These flexible proposals so pleased Spaatz that he told Tedder that all he needed to know was what to hit and when.90 On January 24, both confirmed this prelim- inary discussion and agreed that the "operation must be conducted the same as 314   ## p. 315 (#339) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE ENGAGED in the Mediterranean area, no matter what type of organization was directed by topside."91 While Spaatz and Eisenhower sought to pin down USSTAF'S place in the command structure, Arnold, Portal, Spaatz, and others simultaneously tried to define its immediate objectives.
