a new bombing directive from Portal since the implementation of POINTBLANK in June 1943. The advent of USSTAF, the imminence of the invasion, and the effec- tiveness of the Luftwaffe fighter defenses all indicated the necessity of a new directive. After initial proposals had passed back and forth across the Atlantic, Spaatz, Portal, Harris, Air Vice-Marshal Norman H. Bottomley (Deputy Chief of the Air Staff), Air Marshal Douglas Evill (Vice-Chief of the Air Staff), and Leigh-Mallory met on January 19 to hammer out a modified bombing directive.

The RAF would not countenance any arrangement that might subordinate it to the AAF. Eisenhower, with his usual political acumen, realized this fact and struck the suggestion from Spaatz's report to Arnold.93 He counseled Spaatz to drop the idea, observing that "the political situation would not permit an over-all air commander at this time." Eisenhower told Spaatz that he did not require a des- ignated overall commander; all that he required was that operational control of all air power, at the proper time for OVERLORD, "be assured by a single air com- mander." Spaatz admitted that USSTAF could fulfill its functions without an overall air commander, but he believed that its lack might jeopardize t
