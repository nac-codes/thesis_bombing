als finally accepted Spaatz's compromise proposal; of the nine P-51 groups scheduled for the European Theater of Operations, the Eighth would get seven and the Ninth would retain two. Spaatz commented in his diary, "Leigh-Mallory's attitude in this was surprising to me, since after hearing arguments on both sides, he agreed to P-51's going to Eighth Air Force, based on over-all situations."97 Leigh-Mallory proved less amenable in matters involving the Ninth Air Force's participation in strategic bombing missions. Strategic missions consisted of much more than simply flying the heavy bombers and escorts to their objec- tives and returning them. Punishing the Luftwaffe as well as destroying targets required large-scale assistance from the Ninth. The Ninth's fighter-bombers and 316   ## p. 317 (#341) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE ENGAGED medium bombers would fly diversionary raids or strike Luftwaffe fighter fields in missions timed to coincide with the takeoff, assembly, and landing of Luftwaffe defensive fighter forces. In addition, the Ninth's formations would help to confuse German fighter controllers by cluttering up the early warning system with hundreds of additional planes. Spaatz called these coordinated strikes "absolutely essential" to the maxi- mum protection of heavy-bomber formations and the destruction of the Luftwaffe. Spaatz took note of the fact that in two major operations at the end of January no medium bombers had supported strategic strikes. They bombed CROSSBOW (V-1 launch sites in France) targets for which Leigh-Mallory, in his purely British capacity as head of Air Defense of Great Britain, had prime responsibility. This situation appeared to Spaatz to be symptomatic of the prob- lems the AAF would confront "if and when" USSTAF came under Leigh- Mallory's control. "Leigh-Mallory's concern with what is in front of him,‚Äù said Spaatz "may hamper POINTBLANK Operations."98 Spaatz, supported by his Deputy for Operations,
