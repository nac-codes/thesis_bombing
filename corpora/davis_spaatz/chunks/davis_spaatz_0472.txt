ary 19, 1944, USSTAF's weather forecasters predicted an event eagerly awaited by the American heavy-bomber leaders in Europe: the breaking up of the cloud cover over central Europe for an extended period. Headquarters, USSTAF, ordered Operation ARGUMENT to begin the next day. This operation, planned since early November 1943, called for a series of combined attacks by the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces against the Combined Bomber Offensive's highest-priority objectives. During these attacks, RAF Bomber Command agreed to make night area bombing attacks on the same targets. (See Map 8, Greater German Air Industry Targets.) Because the attacks called for a joint effort by both of its component air forces, Headquarters, USSTAF, departed from its normal supervisory and pol- icy-making activities to take direct responsibility for mounting operations. Accordingly, as a courtesy to his old friend, Spaatz alerted Eaker* first rather than Twining, Fifteenth Air Force Commander, of the impending implementa- tion of ARGUMENT, requesting that forces bomb the Regensburg and Augsburg aircraft assembly plants or the ball-bearing works at Stuttgart. Spaatz also * Although he was Commander of the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces (Twelfth U.S. Air Force and British 1st Tactical Air Force), Eaker had only administrative, not operational, control over the Fifteenth. Spaatz, however, always treated Eaker as if the latter had operational control of the Fifteenth, in effect making a new line of command. 319   ## p. 320 (#344) ############################################  NETHERLANDS Münster Düsseldorf BELGIUM Cologne FRANCE Rhine R.
