Spaatz agreed to cancel the message. 109 The failure to obtain the use of the Fifteenth added to the tension at Spaatz's headquarters on the night of February 19-20. Even as the Lancaster heavy bombers of RAF Bomber Command mounted a heavy strike over Leipzig, one of the Eighth's principal targets for the next day, Spaatz's subordinates debated the wisdom of following up the RAF's effort with a Sunday punch.
