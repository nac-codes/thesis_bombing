109 (day-fighter) aircraft. The AAF offi- cial history, basing its assertions on examination of postwar records, cited a delay of one month's production of Ju 88s and severe damage to about 32 per- cent of Bf 109 manufacturing capacity. But other official histories admitted that the raids, like most AAF raids, damaged the machine tools less severely than the buildings that surrounded them. Those tools, when cleared of rubble and dis- persed to other parts of Germany, would continue to produce more aircraft.117 When the results reached Park House on the evening of February 20, Spaatz, according to one witness, was euphoric, "on the crest of the highest wave he had ever ridden."118 That evening Spaatz gave all the credit to Anderson for having persevered in his fight to save the mission.119 For the next five days, until the weather once again closed in, the Eighth and the Fifteenth Air Forces fought their way to and from targets deep inside the Nazi homeland. The Luftwaffe reacted savagely, provoking heavy and pro- longed combat with great attrition on both sides. The Fifteenth Air Force, which lacked P-51s, lost 89 bombers, compared with 158 lost by the Eighth, but actu- ally suffered a higher percentage loss. 120 In all, USSTAF lost at least 266 heavy bombers, 2,600 air crew (killed, wounded, or in German hands), and 28 fighters.121 Almost half of those losses occurred on the last two missions, when the Germans took advantage of mistakes that left the bombers unescorted or underescorted. 122 In February, the Eighth wrote off 299 bombers, one-fifth of its force, 123 whereas the Luftwaffe wrote off more than 33 percent of its single- engine fighters and lost almost 18 percent of its fighter pilots. 124 According to the AAF official history, the damage inflicted by the week's missions caused a two-month delay in German fighter aircraft production.125 At the end of February, Luftwaffe Field Marshal Erhard Milch, in charge of aircraft production, informed Albert Speer, G
