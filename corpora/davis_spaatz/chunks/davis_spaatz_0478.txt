k's missions caused a two-month delay in German fighter aircraft production.125 At the end of February, Luftwaffe Field Marshal Erhard Milch, in charge of aircraft production, informed Albert Speer, German Minister for Armaments Produc- tion, that he expected the March production figures to equal only 30 to 40 per- cent of the February total. 126 As a result of this meeting, the two set up a "Fighter Staff" to push through a large increase in fighter production. The Fighter Staff estimated that, at the time of its establishment at the end of February, 70 percent of the original buildings of the German aircraft industry had been destroyed. Damage to machine tools was less severe.127 The delay in German fighter production was even more significant than the actual number of fighters never produced. By the time the aircraft industry recovered in late spring and early summer, the Luftwaffe's situation had totally changed.

A second antenna in the starboard wing homed on warning radar in the tails of British bombers. Radar also appeared in the night-fighting version of the Bf 110 (opposite, top), some of which could fire on enemy aircraft overhead with a unique upward-aim- ing cannon. The Bf 109 (opposite, middle), in production since 1937, had evolved by 1944 into a nearly 400-mph fighter armed with machine guns and a 30mm cannon. The lightweight, nim- ble, and
