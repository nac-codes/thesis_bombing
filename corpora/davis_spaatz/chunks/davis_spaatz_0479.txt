rd-aim- ing cannon. The Bf 109 (opposite, middle), in production since 1937, had evolved by 1944 into a nearly 400-mph fighter armed with machine guns and a 30mm cannon. The lightweight, nim- ble, and heavily armed FW 190 (opposite, below), introduced in 1941, outclassed the early Spitfire but was handily mastered by later Allied fighters such as the P-47 and P-51. The world's first mass-produced jet fighter, the Me 262 Swallow (Schwalbe) (below), entered combat in June 1944. As an interceptor the Me 262 carried four 30mm cannon and flew at 540 mph. Adolf Hitler unwittingly reduced its effectiveness by decreeing that the new aircraft be used solely as a bomber.  711   ## p. 325 (#349) ############################################     GJ Fi   ## p. 326 (#350) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE the catastrophic curtailment of training programs and operations. By July 1944, hundreds of the newly assembled fighters were grounded from lack of fuel. Had they been delivered in April or May when fuel was available, they might have made POINTBLANK a more risky undertaking. Big Week also affected replacement production by persuading the German leadership and aircraft industry to undertake a large-scale and immediate disper- sal program. This program eventually rendered the aircraft industry relatively invulnerable to bombing, but it caused more production delays and increased indirect labor costs by 20 percent 128 while heightening demands on the German railway system. This situation further strained the economy and left production even more dependent on uninterrupted transportation. 1 129 Although postwar research has shown that the missions between February 20 and 25 accomplished less than was originally estimated by the Allies, what made Big Week "big" was not the physical damage inflicted on the German fighter industry and front-line fighter strength, which was significant, but rather the psychological effect it had on the AAF.
