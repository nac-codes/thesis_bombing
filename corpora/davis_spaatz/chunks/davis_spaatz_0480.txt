ade Big Week "big" was not the physical damage inflicted on the German fighter industry and front-line fighter strength, which was significant, but rather the psychological effect it had on the AAF. In one week, Doolittle dropped almost as much bomb tonnage as the Eighth had dropped in its entire first year. At same time, Bomber Command conducted five heavy raids over Combined Bomber Offensive targets losing 157 heavy bombers for a loss rate of 6.6 bombers per 100 sorties, which slightly exceeded the American rate of 6 bombers per 100 sorties.130 In trial by combat, the AAF had shown that daylight precision bombing not only operated as claimed, but at no greater cost than the supposedly safer and less accurate night area bombing. What is more, USSTAF, thanks to its fighter escorts, claimed the destruction of over 600 enemy aircraft, while Bomber Command could claim only 13.131 In their own minds, Spaatz and other high-ranking American air officers had validated their belief in their chosen mode of combat. Spaatz fairly glowed in a letter he sent to Arnold summarizing the month: "The resultant destruction and damage caused to industrial plants of vital importance to the German war effort and to the very existence of the German Air Force can be considered a conspicu- ous success in the course of the European war."132 Spaatz went on to compare the relative contributions of the month by both the AAF and the RAF. The Eighth flew 5,400 more sorties than Bomber Command and dropped some 5,000 more tons of bombs, all with a lower loss rate. 133 The AAF had come of age; the long buildup in Britain had produced results at last: During the past two years as our forces slowly built up and the RAF carried the great part and weight of attack some circles of both the Government and the general public have been inclined to think that our part in the battle was but a small one. I trust that this brief comparison of effort will enable you to erase any doubts that may exist in some min
