Eisenhower and Tedder, as hardly disinterested parties, refereed this dispute with varying degrees of impartiality. Each of the contestants took up distinct positions, which, depending on the fortunes of his own command, his commitment to the invasion, and the imminence of the invasion date, he defended at length. Unlike Harris, Spaatz never questioned the basic premise that at some point prior to the invasion his force should come under the direct control of the Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force. Naturally, given his personal and pro- fessional biases, he differed, at times sharply, with Leigh-Mallory and others over the timing, the direction, and the degree of effort demanded of his forces. Spaatz insisted that any plan adopted must lead, at least, to air parity over the invasion area by the time the troops left their ports to hit the beaches.137 He believed that his forces should begin close assistance to the invasion sixty days before launching. Support begun earlier would duplicate effort and perhaps neu- tralize the effects of his strategic bombing campaign against Germany by pre- venting any follow-up of the blows he intended to deliver. Spaatz also believed that USSTAF possessed sufficient forces to devote a large simultaneous effort to the invasion and to the strategic campaign. He would resist any invasion plan that he believed would require his forces to participate beyond the point of diminishing returns.
