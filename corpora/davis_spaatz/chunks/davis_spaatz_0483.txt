In November 1943, according to Capt. Harry Butcher, Eisen- hower's naval aide, Spaatz told President Roosevelt's adviser, Harry Hopkins, that, given three months of clear weather, he could defeat Germany and render the invasion unnecessary. Therefore, he favored, as a better investment, the strengthening of Allied forces in Italy to gain the Po River Valley and position the bombers even closer to Germany. 138 After the war, Spaatz implied that Butcher had not gotten his argument "quite straight" and claimed that, instead of mounting the vast, expensive cross- channel operation, he favored "sweeping around" to and through the Balkan states.139 This somewhat Churchillian strategy of attacking upward from south- ern Europe reflected Spaatz's doubts about the possibility of gaining and main- taining another successful lodgment in Europe in the face of determined opposi- tion. The Salerno campaign had come close to failure against an enemy not nearly so well prepared or fortified as would probably be encountered in France. In mid-February, Spaatz, in a private conversation with the U.S. Ambassa- dor to England, John G.

Spaatz did not see the possibility of a successful assault if the ground troops had only the benefit of air power applied tactically for their immediate support. "Strategic bombing of sufficient intensity is necessary first," Spaatz believed: â€œThe landin
