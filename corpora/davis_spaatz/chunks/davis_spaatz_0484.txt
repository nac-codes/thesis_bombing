ault if the ground troops had only the benefit of air power applied tactically for their immediate support. "Strategic bombing of sufficient intensity is necessary first," Spaatz believed: “The landing of ground troops should be the pushing over of a top- pling wall."141 He would, naturally, resent attempts to cut back the Combined Bomber Offensive before it had undermined the German war economy. As late as April 10, Spaatz, in a conference with Vandenberg, who had arrived in London to assume the post of the senior American officer and Deputy Commander of Leigh-Mallory's Allied Expeditionary Air Force, questioned the whole basis for OVERLORD and suggested alternatives. He characterized the operation as "highly dangerous." Its outcome was "extremely uncertain,” and its failure would "have repercussions which may well undo all of the efforts of the strategic bombing efforts to date." H2X enabled USSTAF to bomb through overcast, overcoming its greatest obstacle, weather, and, hence, provided one more reason not to launch OVERLORD. Spaatz continued: If I were directing overall strategic operations, I would go into Norway where we have a much greater chance of ground force success and where I believe Sweden would come in with us. Then, with air bases in Sweden, we would attack Germany from four sides (U.K., Italy, Russia and Sweden) simultane- ously. Why undertake a highly dubious operation in a hurry when there is a surer way to do it as just outlined? It is better to win the War surely than to undertake an operation which has ... great risks. 142 328   ## p. 329 (#353) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE ENGAGED This curious proposal of Spaatz's may have had, if successful, the geopoliti- cal advantages of denying Swedish iron ore and ball bearings to the Germans and of closing the Baltic, while imposing upon the Germans the requirement to defend another large air sector. The proposal revealed not only a complete rejec- tion, if not a basic misu
