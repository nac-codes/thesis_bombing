rrent operational program would undo everything achieved to date, allowing Germany the time to harden and disperse its indus- tries and to use its production lines in an uninterrupted period just before the invasion. Thus, any subordination of Bomber Command to a detailed tactical plan might actually have a detrimental effect on OVERLORD. 144 Two events, however, combined to undercut Harris's contentions. His win- ter bombing campaign over Germany encountered increasingly resourceful, accurate, and costly interception from the German night-fighter force, which, by the end of March 1944, had become tactically dominant. Bomber Command's losses mounted steeply and could no longer be sustained by its machines and air crews.145 In the first three months of 1944 its losses from all causes were 796 aircraft, compared with 348 in the same period in 1943.146 Then, in early March 1944, Portal ordered a series of experimental night precision bombing attacks on French targets, including railway marshaling yards. These attacks produced out- standing results, unequivocally demonstrating the abilities of Harris's units to pulverize the OVERLORD targets scheduled for them.147 By the end of March Harris had lost much of his credibility and with it a decisive voice in the prein- vasion air debate. 329   ## p. 330 (#354) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE The target of Spaatz's and Harris's fulminations, Leigh-Mallory, indomit- ably and in his own phlegmatic fashion, pressed for the adoption of the preinva- sion plans drawn up by the AEAF. He had originally assumed that, as comman- der of the air forces in direct support of the invasion, he would also assume the command of the strategic bomber forces when they passed to the control of the Supreme Commander. This assumption, which soon proved illusory, did not endear him to either Spaatz or Harris, nor did their opposition to Leigh- Mallory's claims endear them to him. The chief architect of
