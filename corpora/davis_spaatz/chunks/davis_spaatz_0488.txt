of an intensive attack on the Belgian and northern French rail- way system, directed in particular at rail marshaling yards and associated main- tenance facilities. This attritional attack on the railways would so lower their carrying capacity that the German response in units and material to the invasion would be fatally slowed. Zuckerman's transportation bombing required the par- ticipation of all Allied air forces because of the large number of targets to be destroyed and kept suppressed. It also provided for 45,000 tons of bombs, out of an entire preinvasion program of 108,000 tons, to be dropped on the communi- cations system. In his estimates of the bomblift required to neutralize the system, Zuckerman called for the Eighth Air Force to supply 45 percent of the preinva- sion effort. Bomber Command, with a bomblift capacity 60 percent greater than the Eighth's, would supply 35 percent of the preinvasion effort, and the Ninth Air Force would supply the remaining 20 percent. Zuckerman allotted only 20 percent of the Eighth's effort to POINTBLANK. 149 330   ## p. 331 (#355) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE ENGAGED  A captured German photo of damage to the Fieseler aircraft plant, Kassel, Germany, after RAF and Eighth Air Force raids. The AEAF plan's use of all available air power strongly appealed to both Eisenhower and Tedder, who found themselves in the position of having to yoke the AEAF, USSTAF, and Bomber Command into the invasion program. Eisenhower needed direct control over all available planes in Britain to guaran- tee their support for the invasion. He therefore sought a preinvasion air plan that could employ all available air forces. Tedder agreed. Unlike Leigh-Mallory, Harris, and Spaatz, each of whom was identified with a particular type of air warfare, Tedder had not risen to prominence through a fighter or bomber back- ground. Rather, he had come to the fore as a leader of large air forces consisting of all types of aircr
