Spaatz met again to review air command arrangements. Eisenhower asked Spaatz how the current system could be made to work with Leigh-Mallory in his present position. Spaatz replied that no sys- tem that left Leigh-Mallory in command of the strategic air forces would 335   ## p. 336 (#360) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE work.167 He recommended as "the only practical solution" the formalization of the Joint Planning Committee, which was already working on the POINTBLANK program and on a plan to merge it into OVERLORD. After he and Harris had ensured that this plan conformed to the limitations and capabilities of their forces, 168 the CCS could issue a new bombing directive redefining target priori- ties and transferring the strategic air forces to Eisenhower's direction. Spaatz implied he would not approve any plan that allowed Leigh-Mallory control of all air operations for an extended period prior to the invasion. He conceded, of course, that "plans for the employment of Air in the actual assault of OVERLORD, including the softening immediately prior thereto, must of necessity be drawn up by Leigh-Mallory, with representatives from RAF Bomber Command and USSTAF familiar with the capabilities of these forces."169 While Spaatz did not object to Leigh-Mallory's operating within his own area of expertise, he was determined to have a voice in the use of U.S. forces. Eisenhower accepted this plan with two modifications. He asked that Portal have representation on the committee, and second, that from time to time the plan be checked against actual bombing results and modified if necessary. These changes brought the RAF Chief of Staff formally into the process, increasing the probability that the RAF and the CCS would approve any plan drawn up by the committee. Portal would also balance Harris, who tended to operate semi-inde- pendently. Eisenhower's second change allowed him the flexibility to change air plans as events dicta
