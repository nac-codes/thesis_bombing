duction targets. Those strikes, in conjunction with bombing-through-overcast missions, had pushed the loss rate of the German fighter force to an unsustain- able level. The Luftwaffe lost to all causes 12.1 percent of its fighter pilots in January and another 17.9 percent in February.184 Thus, in two months almost one out of every three of Germany's fighter pilots had been killed or disabled, including some of its most skilled aviators. Wastage of machines was high, too. Luftwaffe fighter units wrote off 33.8 percent of their total strength in January and another 56.4 percent in February, a 90 percent turnover in two months. 185 The Eighth, too, had suffered severely, losing 211 heavy bombers (19.5 percent of its force) in January and 299 (20.2 percent of its force) in February.186 The Eighth also lost 172 fighter aircraft in combat and 190 fighter pilots to combat or accidents for the first two months of the year. 187 Spaatz, however, thanks to resources of men and mat√©riel reaching him, not only sustained such losses but actually increased his strength on hand.

In those two months a measure of confidence returned to the Eighth, which, thanks to increasing numbers of long-range escort-fighters, was no longer afraid to fly deep into Germany. This restoration of spirit, the attrition of the Luftwaffe, and the damage to Germany's air industry, although not decisive in themselves, were three large steps toward the accomplishment of POINTBLANK. In comparison with the steady strides forward on the operational side of the war, Spaatz and USSTAF remained enmeshed in disputes concerning the trans- portation plan and air command arrangements. The latter, at least, gave some hope of speedy resolution, while the former would drag on, not completely resolved, almost until the invasion. 339   ## p. 340
