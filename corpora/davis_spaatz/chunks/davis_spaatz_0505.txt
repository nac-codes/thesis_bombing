the air plan for support of OVERLORD met the approval of both Eisenhower and Portal, acting in his capac- ity as the agent of the Chiefs for the Combined Bomber Offensive, “the respon- sibility for supervision of air operations out of England of all forces engaged in the program, including the United States Strategic Air Force and British Bomber Command, together with any other air forces that might be made available, should pass to the Supreme Commander.”6 Eisenhower and Portal would jointly supervise those strategic forces not used by the invasion in accordance with agreements they had previously reached. The British Chiefs added that, at pre- sent, they had no plans to use the reservations inserted into the agreement, and, if they did, they would immediately inform the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.7 The U.S. Joint Chiefs balked at once. This proposal did not give Eisenhower unquestioned control of the strategic air forces. The British protested that the Supreme Commander himself found the plan acceptable-to no avail. Even Eisenhower had second thoughts and insisted on untrammeled control of the strategic bombers for the invasion period. Once again, he thought of resigning if the matter continued to drag on ad infinitum.8 On April 7, barely two months before the invasion, the Combined Chiefs agreed that the strategic air forces would operate under the Supreme Commander's "direction." This was appar- ently less ambiguous than allotting him "the responsibility for supervision." At the same time, the Combined Chiefs approved, with a few exceptions on targets, the air plan developed for the invasion. Formal direction of the strategic air forces passed to Eisenhower on April 14,9 confirming the informal command structure already in place. 344   ## p. 345 (#369) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE DEFEATED The Dispute over Strategic Targeting Simultaneously, the strategic air forces, through their representatives on the Joint Planning Committee fo
