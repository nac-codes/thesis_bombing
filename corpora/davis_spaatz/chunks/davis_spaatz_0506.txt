################################  THE LUFTWAFFE DEFEATED The Dispute over Strategic Targeting Simultaneously, the strategic air forces, through their representatives on the Joint Planning Committee for the OVERLORD air plan, spent much of March arguing the merits of Zuckerman's transportation plan versus USSTAF's oil plan. The strategic air forces would come into the Supreme Commander's hands only after approval of the air preparation plan. Until the airmen could agree on a plan, the formalization of the air command structure would hang fire. For practical purposes, however, the strategic air commanders had no inten- tion of actually employing their veto. Spaatz and, by now, even Harris accepted the necessity of some strategic support for the invasion. Moreover, Eisenhower would surely override any veto by appealing to the CCS, who would defer to him in any matter directly touching on the success of the invasion. Their veto power gave the strategic air commanders leverage in obtaining a command system and a plan for air employment more in keeping with their own ideas than might other- wise have been possible. Although their positions were not invulnerable, Eisenhower would find it difficult and very disruptive to replace them with more malleable commanders, who would probably lack their expertise and prestige. By late February, Spaatz and others had recognized that the Combined Bomber Offensive had progressed to a point, thanks to the attrition of the Luftwaffe's fighter forces inflicted in January and February, at which time the destruction of targets other than the German aircraft industry was not only feasible but desir- able. Spaatz thus ordered the formation of a USSTAF planning committee to consider future actions. He did so partially in response to the transportation plan, which the AEAF had presented to him in Februaryâ€”a plan that USSTAF regarded as unsound. He laid down three guiding principles for the committee: (1) the plan must provide for air supremacy
