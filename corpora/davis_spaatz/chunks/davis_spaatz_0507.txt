He laid down three guiding principles for the committee: (1) the plan must provide for air supremacy at the time of the invasion; (2) the plan should take into account a possible early collapse of Germany prior to the invasion; and (3) if Germany did not collapse, the plan should nevertheless make a maximum contribution to the success of OVERLORD. 10 With pressure for adoption of the transportation plan gaining momentum every day, Spaatz urgently required a viable alternative on which to base his opposition. He pushed the planning committee to complete its work; they pre- pared a final draft in thirty-six-hours, 11 presenting to Spaatz on March 5, a "plan for the Completion of the Combined Bomber Offensive." Quickly dubbed the oil plan it called for a "re-clarification" of POINTBLANK directives and, after examining ten discrete target systems, selected three German production programs-rubber, bomber aircraft, and oil. To those three, it added the already accepted targets of German fighter production and ball bear- ings. Oil received top priority followed by fighters and ball bearings, rubber, and bomber aircraft. The plan emphatically rejected railroad transport as a strategic target. Such a system had too many targets, had built in too much noncritical civilian traffic and long-term industrial traffic that could be suppressed or 345   ## p. 346 (#370) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE diverted before military traffic would be significantly reduced, and its destruc- tion would take too long to have a significant military effect. In contrast, the oil plan required fifteen days' visual bombing for the Eighth Air Force and ten for the Fifteenth Air Force. 12 The plan assumed that the destruction of only fourteen synthetic oil plants and thirteen refineries would account for more than 80 percent of production and 60 percent of r
