erican force available for containing the aircraft industry or striking at other targets of opportunity. 14 The synthetic oil plants also presented a practical bombing problem, which was not as important in early 1944, when strategic airmen had only minimum disposable force, as it would become in the winter of 1944-1945, when they had enormous bomber fleets. For technical and logistical reasons the Germans had chosen to build their synthetic oil plants away from urban areas. These plants could only be bombed if they could be located by visual means. The American H2X radar's resolution or return was so inaccurate that it could only locate a city area. Although synthetic plants were huge, they were considerably smaller than a city. Hence, bombing oil plants meant using the very few days of visual bomb- ing weather to hit targets outside German cities. In the winter of 1944â€“1945 syn- thetic oil targets absorbed all visual bombing days. The Americans were left with little choice but to resort to H2X-assisted raids on targets within German cities for the majority of their bombing effort, with calamitous results for the German civilian population. 346   ## p. 347 (#371) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE DEFEATED Upon receiving the plan on the evening of March 5, Spaatz and his staff, as usual, began their discussion before dinner and continued it into the wee hours. Walt W. Rostow, then a first lieutenant in the Enemy Objectives Unit (EOU) of the Office of Strategic Services, which served as USSTAF's unofficial target intelligence section, recorded in 1981, "Despite the effort to emphasize, within the plan, the will to complete the attacks on the POINTBLANK systems, General Spaatz quickly appreciated that it was to all intents and purposes an Oil Plan." Spaatz then "explored at length the issues at stake, especially the capabilities of the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces with respect to the number of targets involved. He then ordered the plan com
