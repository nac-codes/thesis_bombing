. . . Concentration against one common system, by both day and night, is essential."17 Tedder's reasoning was, of course, apparent to the adherents of both plans. The oil plan allowed a non-centralized air com- mand system under which the strategic air forces would operate without close cooperation with the tactical air forces. The transportation plan required a uni- fied air command in order to yoke both the strategic and tactical air forces into a coordinated attack on a complex, wide-spread, resilient target system. The dispute between the adherents of the transportation plan and its oppo- nents, who criticized it on strategic and tactical grounds, continued until mid- May 1944. During a series of meetings held throughout March the transportation plan's detractors mobilized increasing opposition.

In a memo dated March 13, he explained, "In view of the recent progress made against the GAF,
