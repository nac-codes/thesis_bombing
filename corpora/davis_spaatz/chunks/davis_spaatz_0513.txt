argets are in diffi- cult areas . . . and partly because I am not sure of the real vulnerability of the new synthetic oil plants."22 On March 16 the Joint Bombing Committee met again. Tedder began the meeting completely in favor of the transportation plan, but the united opposition of the RAF Assistant Chiefs of Staff for Plans, Bomber Operations, and Intelligence caused him to waver and he, with Portal and Eisenhower, referred the transportation plan to the British Joint Intelligence Committee for review. Spaatz noted optimistically, "Hoped by all concerned 348   ## p. 349 (#373) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE DEFEATED here that Tedder will repudiate AEAF Plan of his own accord," an action that would avoid hard feelings all around.23 Tedder, however, did not abandon the transportation plan, even in the face of the Joint Intelligence Committee Report, which supported the oil plan. The latter report, according to Tedder, was based on unsubstantiated and invalid assumptions.24 Meanwhile, Eisenhower had reached the end of his tether. If a meeting scheduled for March 25 did not decide between the competing plans, he stated, "I am going to take drastic action and inform the Combined Chiefs of Staff that unless the matter is settled at once I will request relief from this command."25 At the March 25 bombing policy conference which would decide between the competing plans, Spaatz, Tedder, and Eisenhower were joined by Portal, Harris, Leigh-Mallory, and various intelligence officers and experts on Axis oil. During the preceding week Spaatz and Tedder had prepared and circulated briefs detailing their positions and had marshaled last-minute agreements to attract fur- ther support for their proposals. Apparently, Tedder persuaded Portal to back the transportation plan. Harris, too, gave the plan lukewarm support. He opposed the oil plan because he disagreed with the concept of designing a strategic bombing strategy around a single-target system. C
