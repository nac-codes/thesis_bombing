Second, Tedder believed that only an all-out attack on the transport-action sys- tem would sufficiently disrupt enemy movement before and after D-day to give the invasion the greatest chance of success. Third, Eisenhower asserted that "the greatest contribution that he could imagine the air forces making" was the hin- dering of enemy movement and "that everything he had read had convinced him that, apart from the attack on the G.A.F., the Transportation Plan was the only one which offered a reasonable chance of the air forces making an important contribution to the land battle during the first vital weeks of OVERLORD." In fact he did not believe that there was any other "real alternative."28 Then the group examined the oil plan. Spaatz and F. L.

Spaatz, congenial, even convivial, in his mess or at ease, usually performed woodenly at set-piece conferences,29 as he did at this one. He had already circulated his views in his brief and so he con- fined himself to reiterating three of its conclusions: (1) strategic attacks on the railways would not affect the cou
