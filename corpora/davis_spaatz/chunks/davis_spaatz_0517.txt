Conversely, USSTAF doubted that the transportation plan would ever 350   ## p. 351 (#375) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE DEFEATED have a decisive effect on the enemy.

Lawrence added that the Germans had large reserve stocks in the west, so they might not immediately cut back operations in France, but they would certainly feel the pinch in the west four or five months after the plan's start. Portal immediately seized on Lawrence's comments to administer the coup de grâce to the immediate adoption of the oil plan stating that they "showed con- clusively that the oil plan would not help OVERLORD in the first few critical weeks." He softened the blow by strongly suggesting that, once the initial inva- sion crisis had passed, the oil plan had "great attractions." Eisenhower agreed. This ended the meeting's consideration of Spaatz's alternative to the transporta- tion plan.32 Talk then turned to the use of strategic bombers. Harris doubted that he could carry out precision attacks against all twenty-six targets allotted to him in the time period before D-day. Despite a rising rate of casualties, he wanted to continue his attacks over eastern Germany for as long as he had enough hours of darkness. Eisenhower, conceding that the transportation plan would cause Bomber Command very little change in its programs, said, "The more important question was whether the 8th and 15th Air Forces could achieve their part in [the transportation plan].” Spaatz replied that one-half of his visual bombing attacks would have to strike Luftwaffe targets and the other half would have
