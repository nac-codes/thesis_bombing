15th Air Forces could achieve their part in [the transportation plan].‚Äù Spaatz replied that one-half of his visual bombing attacks would have to strike Luftwaffe targets and the other half would have to hit a tar- get system capable of producing "at least some enemy fighter reaction, and so attrition." He had chosen the oil plan over the transportation plan precisely because the former would guarantee constant air battles and consistent attrition of the Luftwaffe's fighter force. Portal disagreed. He believed that the Luftwaffe would defend the railways once it realized the Allies had begun an all-out campaign against them. Spaatz emphasized the importance of the location of the targets chosen; his forces must fly well into Germany in order to generate the maximum amount of air fighting, and for tactical reasons some of the transportation targets ought to be in the same area as Luftwaffe targets. Tedder agreed, anticipating that he would have no problem coming up with targets to fit Spaatz's requirements. Portal then raised another problem-the large numbers of civilian casualties almost certain to result from bombing the marshaling yards in or adjacent to French towns. He reserved to the British government the opportunity to consider the possible con- sequences.33 This caveat, which few at the time remarked on, would eventually delay complete execution of the transportation plan for several weeks until Churchill could satisfy himself that the bombing would not redound to Britain's discredit. The bombing policy conference ended with Portal and Eisenhower giving Tedder, not Leigh-Mallory, instructions on coordinating the execution of the 351   ## p. 352 (#376) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE plan with the air commanders involved.34 At this time Portal and Eisenhower also stated their intention to put in place the air command arrangements on which they had previously agreed, subject to final approval by the Combined Chief
