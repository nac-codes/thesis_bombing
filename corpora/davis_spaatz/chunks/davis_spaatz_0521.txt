he would only have to divert, at most, half of his effort, much of it on days the Eighth could not bomb Germany using visual means in any case. He could employ the remainder of his force with a free hand to continue increasing the Luftwaffe's already ruinous attrition rate. The latest version of the transportation plan also assigned RAF Bomber Command twenty-six rail targets in France, thus ensuring Harris's participation and remov- ing a specter that had troubled Spaatz since the plan's inception. In early February he had remarked to Zuckerman, "What worries me is that Harris is being allowed to get off scot-free. He'll go on bombing Germany and will be given a chance of defeating her before the invasion while I am put under Leigh- Mallory's command."43 It is also possible that Spaatz had not given up on the oil plan. If he could demonstrate that bombing oil targets could produce a vio- lent air reaction by the Germans, then selecting oil targets would clearly fall into the purview of his directive to destroy the Luftwaffe. Spaatz may have lost a round on points but he had not lost the fight. On March 31 he stepped back into the ring with memos to Portal and Eisenhower titled "The Use of Strategic Bombers in Support of OVERLORD," in which he accepted the proposition that French railways required heavy attacks. But, after noting that neither the oil plan nor the transportation plan had, as yet, a qualita- tive measure of effectiveness, he rejected an attack on German railways and sug- gested that oil targets would be just as easy to bomb and more effective in the long run: The effect from the Oil attack, while offering a less definite input in time, is certain to be more far-reaching. It will lead directly to sure disaster for Germany. The Rail attack can lead to harassment only. In weighing these two, it appears that too great a price may be paid merely for a certainty of very little.44 Spaatz then offered the possibility of simultaneously executing both the oil a
