sment only. In weighing these two, it appears that too great a price may be paid merely for a certainty of very little.44 Spaatz then offered the possibility of simultaneously executing both the oil and transportation plans. Eighth Air Force fighter-bombers could bomb both French railway targets and synthetic fuel plants in the Ruhr. RAF Bomber Command could also make daylight attacks against French rail targets or bomb synthetic fuel plants in Stettin or, if they wished, the Ruhr at night. In Romania, the Fifteenth Air Force might bomb transportation targets, and the 353   ## p. 354 (#378) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Russians might advance far enough to send their limited-range planes against Ploesti. To Spaatz, bombing the transport lines around Ploesti was the key to hampering German military operations in the Balkans and the southern USSR, restricting the flow of refined and crude petroleum from Ploesti, and contribut- ing to the general dislocation of the German rail system. If the Soviets could take or neutralize Ploesti, the Germans would be extremely vulnerable to air attacks on the synthetic fuel plants, Hitler's only remaining significant source of oil. "These possibilities," in Spaatz's opinion, "therefore, lend weight to the advantage of early attack upon the synthetics in order to obtain the earliest pos- sible threat. That impact might well be far earlier than currently estimated."45 Finally, Spaatz recommended the following target priorities in order of importance for his two air forces: For the Eighth: 1. The Luftwaffe and ball bearings, 2. The nineteen rail targets already selected in occupied countries, and 3. The thirteen major synthetic oil plants. For the Fifteenth: 1. The Luftwaffe and ball bearings, 2. Rail transport in Romania and selected targets in southern France, 3. Synthetic oil plants in southern Germany, and 4. Political targets in the Balkans.46 At the end of March, the transportation
