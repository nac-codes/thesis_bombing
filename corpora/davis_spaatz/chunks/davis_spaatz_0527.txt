ll result in greatly increased heavy bomber losses, and we will be losing many opportuni- ties to deal punishing blows to the German Air Force.55 The matter obviously required a decision from higher authority. On March 20, after a regular commanders' conference, Spaatz insisted to Eisenhower56 that they meet with Tedder and Leigh-Mallory to resolve the issue. Eisenhower ruled in favor of Spaatz;57 the Ninth Air Force remained undivided. The incident, like earlier ones, did little to help the relationship between the two men and their organizations. The AAF official history, not known for criticism of its own, noted of the situation: The failure to achieve cooperation between USSTAF and AEAF, coupled with other differences over the training of Ninth Air Force units and over the control of the strategic air forces themselves, created an atmosphere of distrust and sus- picion between the two headquarters, which was an exception rather than the rule in Anglo-American relations in the European theater.58 357   ## p. 358 (#382) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Operations This bureaucratic and policy trench-fighting in March 1944 had no effect on operations. Both Allied air forces and the Luftwaffe suffered brutal and unprece- dentedly high losses as the skies of occupied Europe served as a battlefield by day and by night in the continued struggle for mastery of the air. As mentioned, the German night-fighter forces during March reached such a level of effective- ness that RAF heavy-bomber losses became prohibitive. As a result, RAF Bomber Command temporarily discontinued night attacks over Germany. The month culminated in the disastrous Nuremberg raid on the night of March 30-31, in which it lost 96 out of 795 bombers-the greatest number of Allied heavy bombers ever lost on a single mission.59 The mission went so awry that the citizens of Nuremberg never even knew that an RAF force had been directed toward their city.
