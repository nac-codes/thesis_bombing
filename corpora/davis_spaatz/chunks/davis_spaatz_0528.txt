number of Allied heavy bombers ever lost on a single mission.59 The mission went so awry that the citizens of Nuremberg never even knew that an RAF force had been directed toward their city. The Eighth Air Force also suffered its worst single day's loss on March 6, when the Reich's air defenses downed 69 out of 730 bombers during the Eighth's first major attack on Berlin.60 For the month, Bomber Command lost 278 heavy bombers, while the Eighth lost 232 fighters and 299 heavy bombers (plus 41 heavy bombers written off as not repairable). In addition, the Eighth had 3,111 bombers with repairable damage.61 The Fifteenth Air Force reported 99 bomber losses, most incurred on non-POINTBLANK missions.62 The German fighter force, too, suffered astronomical casualties, losing 511 pilots (21.7 percent of its force) and writing off 56.4 percent of its aircraft, its worst percentage loss of the war.63 Aircraft the Luftwaffe could replace, but experi- enced pilots it could not. Luftwaffe fighter casualties, the vast majority incurred in daytime combat, reflected not only the intensity of the fighting but changes in American tactics and a surge in the number of American long-range escort fight- ers. By the end of March, USSTAF had taken a large step toward its goal of day- light air supremacy over Germany and Europe. The operational confidence gained during Big Week, fueled by over-opti- mistic intelligence reports of damage inflicted, led Spaatz and his subordinates to change both bomber and fighter tactics. Between March 3 and March 9, the Eighth launched five major attacks, none with fewer than 500 heavy bombers, on Berlin. Spaatz reported to Arnold, "The operations during the past week had the major purpose of forcing the German fighter force into battle. Three attacks were made without any attempt at deception, the route followed on each attack being exactly the same."64 More important than the direct routing of heavy bombers was the more aggressive employment of U.S. fight
