without any attempt at deception, the route followed on each attack being exactly the same."64 More important than the direct routing of heavy bombers was the more aggressive employment of U.S. fighter forces. Four developments contributed to this change: 1. The freeing of the U.S. fighters from the restrictions of close escort, 2. The arrival of large numbers of U.S. long-range fighter aircraft, 3. The development of the relay fighter escort system, and 4. The increased strafing of German ground targets by U.S. fighter aircraft. 358   ## p. 359 (#383) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE DEFEATED Upon their arrival and throughout the first three months of 1944, Spaatz and Doolittle had insisted that the Eighth go after the Luftwaffe at every opportunity. Maj. Gen. William Kepner, head of VIII Fighter Command, said in July 1944, "The minute Spaatz and Doolittle came here they directed that I take such steps as I felt necessary to lick this German Air Force. If it meant getting out and scouring the skies, even . . . thinning down the escort, that would be okay with them."65 On January 21, in one of his first meetings with the Eighth's subordinate leaders, Doolittle announced the new theme,66 which he based on his experience in the Mediterranean.67 He emphasized that although "the role of protecting the bombardment formation should not be minimized," fighters "should be encour- aged to meet the enemy and destroy him rather than be content to keep him away. "68 Spaatz agreed with this view. A year earlier in North Africa, when he had also confronted a situation of air parity or slight inferiority, Spaatz had high- lighted certain principles on air employment. His third principle addressed close escort of bombers: "Do not give close support to Heavy Bombers [emphasis added]. This was not followed in early operations, causing heavy losses in fighter units, particularly of P-38's."69 Upon his return to Washington, in February 1944, AAF Chief of Sta
