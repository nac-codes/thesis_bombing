Even so, if a plane had sufficient defensive firepower, as the B-17 and B-24 in theory did, it might not ever need 359   ## p. 360 (#384) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE escort (which, until January 1944, it could not get on deep-penetration raids in any case). AAF Field Manual 1-15, "Tactics and Technique of Air Fighting," April 10, 1942, made the task of close escorts clear: "Their mission precludes their seek- ing to impose combat on other forces except as necessary to carry out their defensive role."74 When it addressed recommended tactics for escorts, the man- ual stressed their defensive nature: "Forces in special support counterattack immediately when hostile fighters make direct attacks on the defended forma- tion. When possible, withdrawal from combat will be made when a threat against the defended formation has been removed."75 At no time did either FM 1-5 or FM 1-15 refer to any type of escort other than close escort. Medium and loose escort, both employed by the Twelfth Air Force in the Mediterranean, appar- ently became useful to the AAF through combat experience. It would seem that Eaker and his fighter commander, Maj. Gen. Frank O'D. Hunter, hampered by insufficient numbers of escorts, poorly trained groups, and inadequate range for the fighters they did possess, had erred chiefly in following "the book" too closely. As FM 1-15 acknowledged, "Distance from the supported force will be influenced by relative speeds, escort strength, and visibility conditions."76 Spaatz, Doolittle, and Kepner had the "escort strength" their predecessors lacked, and could thus place their fighters in loose escort. The doctrine of ulti- mate pursuit introduced by Spaatz and Doolittle, however, stood official doc- trine on its head. It turned the escorts into aggressors, which attacked rather than counterattacked and did not withdraw from combat but pursued from the tops of t
