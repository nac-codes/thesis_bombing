ittle, however, stood official doc- trine on its head. It turned the escorts into aggressors, which attacked rather than counterattacked and did not withdraw from combat but pursued from the tops of the clouds to the tops of the trees. By the end of January, the Eighth abandoned pure close escort, substituting a system based on the doctrine of "ultimate pursuit," which allowed U.S. fight- ers to follow the enemy, wherever he might be, until they destroyed him in the air or on the ground.77 By the end of February, the escorting fighter groups spread out in formations twenty-five to thirty miles wide and frequently sent a squadron or more directly ahead to sweep the routes in front of bomber forma- tions.78 If no enemy aircraft attacked the bombers or hovered nearby, two-thirds of the fighters were permitted to search both flanks and above and below the bombers for enemy fighters. As a result, combat took place at all altitudes, and small formations of U.S. fighters returned from Germany at a low level, which encouraged them to shoot up targets of opportunity en route.79 Luftwaffe Maj. Gen. Adolph Galland, commander of the German day-fighter force, recorded the effect of the new U.S. tactics in his postwar memoirs: American fighters were no longer glued to the slow-moving bomber formation, but took action into their own hands. Wherever our fighters appeared, the Americans hurled themselves at them. They went over to low-level attacks on our airfields. Nowhere were we safe from them, and we had to skulk on our own bases. During take-off, assembling, climb and approach to the bombers, when we were in contact with them, on our way back, during landing, and even after that the American fighters attacked with overwhelming superiority.80 360   ## p. 361 (#385) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE DEFEATED Coincident with the arrival of Spaatz and Doolittle, large numbers of long- range P-38 and P-51 fighter aircraft appeared in the theater, while the
