###########################  THE LUFTWAFFE DEFEATED Coincident with the arrival of Spaatz and Doolittle, large numbers of long- range P-38 and P-51 fighter aircraft appeared in the theater, while the P-47, already present in large numbers, increased its escort range by one hundred miles. (See Maps 9 and 10 and Table 4, which illustrate increases in range and number of escort fighters.) These increases in numbers and range helped the Americans refine their escort technique. The escort ranges represented only a fraction of the fighters' rated capabilities. But several factors-the necessity to provide for an emer- gency combat reserve for each plane; the fuel consumed by delays in takeoffs, landings, and forming up; and less than optimum weather conditions-combined to limit their range to, at best, three-eighths of their rated maximum. Escort imposed further range restrictions because of the speed difference between the bombers and their "little friends." On penetration, the bombers, usually carrying their full wartime emergency weight overload, averaged 150 mph (indicated air speed). The fighters, throttled back for optimum gas consumption, averaged at least 100 mph (indicated air speed) faster. For example, P-47s that were not flying escort duty conducted sweeps well beyond Berlin-far beyond their escort range. To maintain stations with the bombers, the fighters had to weave back and forth, so that side-to-side mileage had to be subtracted from their straight-line range. To maximize the amount of escort available to medium- and long-range mis- sions, the Eighth Air Force developed a relay escort system. In this system, a single fighter group, instead of providing escort to a single bomber formation all the way to and from a target an impossibility given its range-would fly straight to a prearranged rendezvous point, meet the formation, escort it 150 to 200 miles to another rendezvous point, hand it over to a second fighter group, and then fly home.81 This system mini
