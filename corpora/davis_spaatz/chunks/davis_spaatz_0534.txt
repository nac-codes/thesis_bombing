ly straight to a prearranged rendezvous point, meet the formation, escort it 150 to 200 miles to another rendezvous point, hand it over to a second fighter group, and then fly home.81 This system minimized the fuel consumed in weaving back and forth, extended the fighters' range, and provided escort all the way to and from the tar- get. As the deep-penetration raids flown in 1943 had shown, if bombers did not have escort all the way, the Luftwaffe would simply wait until they had flown beyond their escort and then attack. At first glance, this system had the apparent disadvantage of using several times more fighters than necessary for a given mission, but this was not the case. The relay system maximized escort through- out the entire mission. During the first half of 1944, before it had converted all but one (the 56th Fighter Group) of its fighter groups to P-51s, the Eighth employed three types of fighter aircraft, each with a different range. The relay system allowed the P-47s to escort the shallow-penetration leg of the mission, the P-38s to escort the medium-penetration section of the mission, and the P-51s to provide deep-penetration and target support.82 This system proved of special value in February and March when the shorter range P-47s formed the bulk of available escort aircraft. Overlapping the P-47, P-38, and P-51 relays allowed the long-range fighter groups to double the bombers' protection for a few min- 361   ## p. 362 (#386) ############################################   Map 9 Escort Ranges for the P-47 Hamburg Elbe R INITIAL RANGE R-47 50 100 Miles London Newmarket NORTH SEA 475 MI FEB 1944 1944 Bremen 425 MI FEB 1944 Amsterdam 375 MI AUG 1943 340 MI JUL 1943 Antwerp 230 MI JUNE 1943 175 MI MAY 1943 Rhine R. and RAF SPITFIRE MAXIMUM RANGE WITHOUT TANKS Seine R. 75 GAL BELLY TANK Paris 108 GAL BELLY TANK 2 X 108 GAL WING TANKS 150 GAL BELLY TANK Frankfurt Stuttgart Berlin Leipzig Prague Vienna Danube R.
