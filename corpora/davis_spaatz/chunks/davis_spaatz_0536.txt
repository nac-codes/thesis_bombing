s supported the Eighth's deep-penetration missions, was probably overjoyed to regain full use of some of his force. In any case, German ground controllers almost never managed to get all of the fighters available to them massed for a single blow, thus the escort seldom had to deal with overwhelming numbers of attackers. The Germans depended on carefully timed assaults by intact formations to knock down the heavy bombers.

A relatively few escorts, even if they shot down no enemy fighters, could disrupt German formations and timing, causing them to lose much of their effectiveness. Even in the worst case, the Germans would have time for only one or two passes against the B-17s and B-24s before some of the escorts arrived to disrupt them. It took a brave, determined, and skilled pilot to make a successful attack on a heavy-bomber formation alone. The relay system led directly to the increased strafing of German ground tar- gets by U.S. fighters. Sometime in February, individual fighter pilots on their own began to fly close to the ground on return relay flights and to strafe German aircraft, facilities, and other targets of opportunity.85 To encourage this practice and to invite the pilots to focus on Luftwaffe fields and facilities, the Eighth began to record official "kills" for planes destroyed on the ground.
