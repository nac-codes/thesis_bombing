of opportunity.85 To encourage this practice and to invite the pilots to focus on Luftwaffe fields and facilities, the Eighth began to record official "kills" for planes destroyed on the ground. Finally, by March all fighters were routinely ordered to descend to low altitude and conduct fighter sweeps on their return trips.86 Although given a unique twist by its application to the relay system, the practice of pursuit aircraft strafing ground targets while returning from other missions had a certain measure of doctrinal approval. In April 1940, FM 1-5 had ruled: The attack of surface objectives by pursuit may be combined with the perfor- mance of other missions of a higher priority. Opportunities may be presented 365   ## p. 366 (#390) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE for the attack of appropriate targets by pursuit forces returning from missions without having expended all their ammunition. In such cases the attack of appropriate surface objectives as a part of a specific mission or as a general procedure is normal.87 This clause in the FM 1-5 of April 1940 probably reflected U.S. analysis of the aggressive and freewheeling tactics employed by the German Condor Legion in Spain and by the Luftwaffe in the Polish campaign of 1939, when aircraft apparently used every opportunity to strafe columns of retreating, disorganized enemy military personnel and civilian refugees, neither of whom presented a significant antiaircraft threat. FM 1-5 of January 1943 rescinded the entire clause following U.S. experience in Tunisia and British experience in the Western Desert. Unlike the Poles and the French, Germans both at and behind the front in North Africa had the ability to put up deadly amounts of light anti- aircraft fire. Such volumes of fire made it extremely costly for fighters to attack appropriate ground targets, such as personnel and light vehicles. The manual forbade the use of fighter aircraft for ground attack missions
