mes of fire made it extremely costly for fighters to attack appropriate ground targets, such as personnel and light vehicles. The manual forbade the use of fighter aircraft for ground attack missions unless (1) no other aircraft were available, (2) fighters were not needed to gain or main- tain air superiority, and (3) fighter aviation did not need to be conserved for future employment in its normal role.88 The writers of the January 1943 FM 1- 5 apparently envisaged fighter ground attack as a tactic of attrition used only in extraordinary circumstances.

Because the Germans soon supplied their airfields with liberal amounts of light flak, ground strafing became a battle of attrition on both sides. By then, however, the Eighth Air Force had established air superiority over Germany and could afford some losses. Given Spaatz's and Doolittle's counterair experiences in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, the doctrinal underpin- nings of their tactics, although interesting, appear to have had no discernible effect on the development of their relay/ground attack system. In the relay system, as elsewhere, ULTRA and other signal intelligence greatly aided the U.S. fighters' efforts. In March ULTRA intercepts revealed the damage done by the low-level fighter attacks. On March 8, a Luftwaffe intercept stated, "The enemy has recognized our own tactics of taking off and getting away from the airfield with all serviceable aircraft before attacks on our ground organization. In the event he has recently put aside a part of the escorting force to attack these aircraft and has achieved successes in this connection."89 Sixteen days la
