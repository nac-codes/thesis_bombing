fore attacks on our ground organization. In the event he has recently put aside a part of the escorting force to attack these aircraft and has achieved successes in this connection."89 Sixteen days later, as Allied fighter pressure increased, the command organization of the Luftwaffe's home fighter forces reported repeated attacks on aircraft landing at bases in the home war zone. The report further noted American tactics: "They imitate the landing procedures of German fighters or effect surprise by ap- proaching the airfield in fast and level flight. The difficulty of distinguishing friend from foe often makes it impossible for flak artillery to fire on them.”90 With such direct encouragement, the Eighth had decided by April to launch pure fighter sweeps in weather unsuitable for bombers to keep up the pressure over western and central Germany. In addition to ground attack sweeps, the Americans began to launch "free sweeps" toward German fighters in suspected concentration areas in order to disperse them before they could mount attacks on the U.S. bombers.91 Tactical signal intercepts gave further impetus to the new sweep tactics. RAF “Y” Service, a tactical intercept organization, cooperated fully with the Eighth. Upon detecting through in-the-clear transmissions of German ground controllers large concentrations of German fighters assembling to attack the bombers, "Y" Service vectored groups out on sweeps into the German forma- tions.92 By the end of March, although the Germans had ceased to use radio tele- phones, British intelligence had worked out new methods of timing P-51 sweeps. The British intelligence official history claims that these new methods "contributed a good deal to the Eighth Air Force's success in its policy of delib- erately seeking out German fighters and forcing them to accept combat."93 Attacking German ground targets took a heavy toll of American fighter pilots, who suffered five times more casualties in strafing than in air-to-air com- bat
