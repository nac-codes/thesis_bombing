By the end of March, the twin-engine fighters sel- dom arose to defend against American daylight raids.101 The increasing numbers of American escorts forced the Luftwaffe to modify its single-engine fighter tactics. As early as mid-December 1943, map exercises at I Fighter Corps Headquarters had demonstrated that commitment of individ- ual single-engine fighter groups alone had little chance of success. A single group would become too involved in fighter-to-fighter combat with the escorts. On December 29, 1943, I Fighter Corps ordered future attacks on Allied heavy- bomber formations to employ a wing formation of at least three closely aligned groups to ensure that at least one group of fighters penetrated to the bomber stream.102 These larger formations required longer time to marshal, offered tar- gets that were easier for Allied air controllers to identify, and proved difficult for increasingly inexperienced German fighter pilots. Throughout March and for the rest of the air war against Germany, U.S. fighter escorts so efficiently accompanied their bombers that large U.S. losses resulted only when navigational or timing errors by either bombers or fighters caused them to miss their rendezvous, or when a small contingent of the escorts was overwhelmed by large numbers of enemy fighters, which then broke through to attack the bombers. 103 The March 6, 1944, Eighth Air Force mission to Berlin, which will be discussed in detail below, illustrates many of the tactical and operational changes involved in the increased use of escort fighters. The harsh weather of the winter of 1943-1944 continued unabated in March. 370   ## p. 371 (#395) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE DEFEATED It allowed only two days of visual bombing over Germany-on March 8, when the Eighth lost 37 of 623 bombers disp
