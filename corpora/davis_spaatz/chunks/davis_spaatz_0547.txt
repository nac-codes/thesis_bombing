e American pilots, sweating profusely despite the cold, in leather clothes and restrictive oxygen masks, dared not try any but the slightest wobble of evasive action for fear of crashing into each other in forma- tion. Once a bomber spouted smoke or flames and, laboring, fell back from the safety of the formation, the fighters finished it off like predators stalking a herd. The crew of a fatally injured bomber had little time to escape before hun- dreds of gallons of fuel or six thousand pounds of bombs exploded. If the bomber began to spin, the centrifugal force it generated trapped the crew within it. Many airmen were crushed and broken by the tail surfaces of their own bombers when the slipstream grabbed them as they exited and brutally pushed them to the rear. Anyone who bailed out started a five-mile descent to ground by falling through other bomber formations, perhaps meeting grisly death on props and leading wing edges. Soon the sky filled with falling men, loose hatch cov- ers, ejected shell casings, and spinning pieces of debris. Parachutes-white U.S. and brown German, either of which could be collapsed by the close passage of aircraft-dotted the sky. The Germans did not have things all their own way. When the slow twin- engine Bf 110s and Me 210s, made even clumsier by the large racks and rockets carried under their wings, attempted to close within rocket range of U.S. bombers, American escorts sliced through their formations killing or scatter- ing the Zerstörers (destroyers), leaving the survivors shaken. On March 6, Zer- störergeschwader Horst Wessel scrambled nine aircraft: two aborted because of mechanical problems, one was damaged, five were lost in air-to-air combat (with one pilot killed and four wounded), and the unit's commander landed his damaged plane at a different airfield. 105 When the single-engine FW 190s and Bf 109s formed up to assault the bombardment divisions, squadrons of P-51s * The matter of actual kills versus claims by Eighth Air
