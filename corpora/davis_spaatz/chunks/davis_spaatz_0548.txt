ane at a different airfield. 105 When the single-engine FW 190s and Bf 109s formed up to assault the bombardment divisions, squadrons of P-51s * The matter of actual kills versus claims by Eighth Air Force bomber gunners was a matter of controversy. The number claimed always exceeded the number actually lost by the Germans by a factor of at least eight or nine to one. In part, these inflated claims resulted from the inability of any one gunner to be sure that his bullets and not someone else's accounted for a particular plane. The natural confusion of the battle compounded the inability of the participants to assess enemy casual- ties correctly and accurately. Nor did the Eighth have a remotely foolproof method of debriefing the returning crews to eliminate multiple counting. For morale and propaganda purposes the AAF could not admit that men pointing sticks would have been hardly less effective than .50 caliber machine guns in killing German fighters. However, the heavily armed bombers certainly had enough deter- rent firepower to force the Luftwaffe pilots to launch disciplined, coordinated attacks from a respect- ful distance, which cut down by an unknown, but large, factor the total number of attacks delivered and losses inflicted during any one raid. In this book, the author used as a rule-of-thumb U.S. fighter claims, not bomber claims, to approximate actual enemy losses. Any overcount in fighter claims, possibly one or two in ten, would be cancelled out by the actual losses inflicted by the bomber gun- ners.

As the fighters dueled, a P-51 stuck on the tail of an FW 190, shredding it with bullets from its six .50-caliber machin
