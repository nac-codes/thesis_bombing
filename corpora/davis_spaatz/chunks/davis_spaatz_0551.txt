Normandy invasion. Clockwise from above: B-17s of the 381st Bomb Group run up for a mission. Top to bottom, the P-38 Lightning, the P-51 Mustang, and the P-47 Thunderbolt were the three principal escort types on which U.S. bombers depended. German flak (below) acquires the altitude of a bomber formation over Kassel, Germany. Each burst scattered some 1,400 metal fragments, any of which could cripple a bomber. A pair of B-17s (opposite, below) maneuver with H2X radar domes fully deployed. The H2X radar dome replaced the standard B-17 belly turret and was used to identify and bomb objectives through cloud cover. A gun camera registers the beating given a German flak tower (opposite, left, above) by an Eighth Air Force fighter in the low-level sweeps that ceaselessly harassed German defenders. Spotters (opposite, right, above) man the plotting table at the control center of the 65th Fighter Wing at Saffron-Walden, Essex, in England.    ## p. 376 (#400) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE The Germans lost 34 fighters shot down, 12 damaged beyond repair, and 25 damaged.111 On October 14, 1943 (Eighth Air Force Mission no. 115), the 291 attacking American bombers again lost 60 of their own number and claimed 186 German fighters shot down, 27 probably destroyed, and 89 damaged.112 The Luftwaffe actually lost 31 destroyed, 12 written off, and 34 damaged.113 On March 6, the 730 American bombers lost 69 but claimed only half of the number of Germans as in the earlier two contests: 97 German fighters destroyed, 28 probably destroyed, and 60 damaged. A far larger force had suffered a 9.5 per- cent loss rate (half of that of the two earlier missions) and suffered far less contact with enemy fighters. Antiaircraft fire accounted for one-third of the bombers lost in the Berlin raid, a much higher percentage than in the Schweinfurt raids, that reveals the decline in German fighter effectiveness. As to escort statistics for the three raids
