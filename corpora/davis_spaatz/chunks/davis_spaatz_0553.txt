rmans had lost heavily enough that they offered no concentrated opposition over the return route, even though they had sufficient time to land, refuel, and rearm. Some of them managed to pick off several stragglers.116 Two subsequent raids on March 8 and 9 met less opposition, even though the weather on March 8 allowed visual bombing and, therefore, excellent condi- tions for Luftwaffe takeoffs, landings, and air-to-air interceptions. The Americans lost 37 bombers and 18 fighters, while their fighters claimed 79 destroyed, 8 prob- ables, and 25 damaged, plus 8 destroyed, 4 probably destroyed, and 7 damaged on the ground.117 In this attack, few twin-engine fighters presented themselves, presumably because they had suffered severely two days earlier.

The Germans did not wish to expend their force in questionable takeoff and landing conditions. For the week, the Eighth wrote off 153 heavy bombers lost attacking Berlin, only 25 fewer than during Big Week.118 By the end of March 1944, the Eighth had written off 349 heavy bombers- 23.3 percent of its force.119 Ominously for the Germans, so heavily had the Eighth been reinforced that this figure represented a sortie loss rate of only 3.3 percent a drop from both January and February.120 The AAF official his- tory claimed that "by April 1, 1944 the GAF was a defeated force."121 The events of April 1944, a black month for the Eighth, tend to refute that claim. The weather in April, as in March, proved poor. Nevertheless, the Eighth launched strikes of more than 400 heavy bombers on fifteen of the month's days, thirteen of the attacks on targets inside Germany; 122 nine of those strikes employed, for at least some of the groups involv
