hed strikes of more than 400 heavy bombers on fifteen of the month's days, thirteen of the attacks on targets inside Germany; 122 nine of those strikes employed, for at least some of the groups involved, visual methods of sighting. The first raid of the month, on April 1, set the tone for the entire month-it was a fiasco. Of 440 heavy bombers dispatched, only 165 bombed targets, and some of those bombed the town of Schaffhausen in neutral Switzerland, angering the Swiss and causing both the AAF and the U.S. government a great deal of expense and embarrassment.

The Germans may also have chosen to conserve their fighter forces depleted in March's air battles.

This tactic, fortunately not repeated, sent a chill throughout the Eighth, which feared that the Germans had finally begun to take advantage of the heavy bombers at their weakest moments --when they milled about, out of formation, in the air over their congested air- fields waiting to land in the evening or to form up in the morning. These peri- ods, sometimes hours long, were clearly visible to the Germans on their radar equipment. On April 29, the Eighth lost sixty-three heavy bombers over one of the Reich's most heavily defended targets, Berlin. In this raid, as in others, the heav- iest losses were taken by groups that failed to meet their
