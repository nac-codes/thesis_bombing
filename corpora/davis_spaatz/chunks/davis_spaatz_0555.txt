e Eighth lost sixty-three heavy bombers over one of the Reich's most heavily defended targets, Berlin. In this raid, as in others, the heav- iest losses were taken by groups that failed to meet their escorts. 123 Brig. Gen. Orvil A. Anderson, the Eighth's operations officer, had an immediate first impression that the April 29 mission was "the poorest operation . . . I've seen during the year... I've been here."

In an account of April 5, Spaatz emphasized to General Giles that properly con- ducted fighter sweeps inflicted real attrition on the Luftwaffe by destroying its aircraft on the ground and demoralizing personnel. Spaatz added, Inasmuch as the pilots are briefed to shoot up any moving target within Germany, [emphasis added] 750 or 1000 fighter a
