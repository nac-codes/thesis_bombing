It is my plan to keep this type of attack going. 127 The rise in the number of claims of enemy aircraft damaged or destroyed on the ground by Eighth Air Force fighters amply illustrates the increasing use of the counterair sweep; from 1 plane in the last two weeks of January to 40 in February, to 113 in March and 712 in the first twelve days of April.128 This tac- tic was not employed without cost. Combined with fighter attacks in support of preinvasion operations, it sent fighter losses up from 232 in March to 338 in April to 475 in May.129 Many of the best of the Eighth's fighter pilots lost their lives or spent the rest of the war in prisoner-of-war (POW) camps because of the intense light antiaircraft fire they encountered. Although they were hated by their pilots, these missions increased Luftwaffe attrition. 130 In April 1944, the Eighth Air Force wrote off as lost or not repairable 422 heavy bombers, 131 more than in any other month of the air war over Europe. This represented a loss of about 25 percent of the heavy bombers on hand in tac- tical units, an increase of 1.3 percent over March's figures.132 Despite the addi- tion of 6 new heavy bombardment groups,133 which raised the Eighth to a total of 39 heavy bombardment groups and 1,872 heavy bombers, the sortie loss rate climbed to 3.6 percent from March's 3.3 percent. 134 The heavy-bomber losses of the Fifteenth Air Force jumped from 99 to 214,135 many of those the result of POINTBLANK missions. German losses remained high, too. Some 447 Luftwaffe fighter pilots,
