134 The heavy-bomber losses of the Fifteenth Air Force jumped from 99 to 214,135 many of those the result of POINTBLANK missions. German losses remained high, too. Some 447 Luftwaffe fighter pilots, 20 percent of the total force, would never fly combat again, nor would 43 percent of their fighter aircraft. 136 The Luftwaffe's home fighter com- mand lost 38 percent of its pilots.137 These figures had declined from the previ- ous month, but the loss of trained pilots could never be made good. Morale Problems All the work of the fighters flying escort and conducting ground attacks did not prevent the loss of hundreds of U.S. heavy bombers to enemy fighters. In March, the morale among American heavy-bomber crews began to buckle, as thirty-seven crews chose internship on the Continent. In April, fifty-two crews, or one of every eight planes lost, chose to land and present themselves for intern- ment in either Sweden (twenty planes) or Switzerland (thirty-two planes).138 In contrast, from December 30, 1943, to February 29, 1944, only five crews had landed in neutral countries. 139 Most of the crews interned during April in Sweden had participated in exceptionally deep missions into Poland. They might have despaired of achieving a safe landing in far-away England and selected the easier course. That excuse seems questionable, however, in light of the fact that the Eighth's crews had bombed some of the same targets before, yet had chosen 379   ## p. 380 (#404) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE to return to their bases. Of course, some planes, many heavily damaged, may have survived to land on neutral territory because the Luftwaffe fighter force had lost its ability to pick off those that had fallen out of formation on their return flight. Despite these extenuating factors, too many crews voluntarily, for whatever reason, did not return to their bases. Another symptom of poor morale was displayed by Eighth Air Force crews sent b
