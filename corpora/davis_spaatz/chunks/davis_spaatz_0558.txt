flight. Despite these extenuating factors, too many crews voluntarily, for whatever reason, did not return to their bases. Another symptom of poor morale was displayed by Eighth Air Force crews sent back to the United States on thirty days' leave at the end of their combat tours. In early April Arnold wrote to Spaatz: "Reports reaching me from trust- worthy sources, as well as my own personal observations, lead to the conclusion that the behavior of returned combat personnel does not always reflect credit upon the AAF." Arnold concluded with the admonition, "Whatever the method, however, it is imperative that immediate and adequate measures be taken to improve the attitude, conduct, and military bearing of AAF personnel being returned to this country."140 The air crews were sunk in pessimism; they had worked and fought to exhaustion to send out a full effort almost every other day for weeks. Their reward, given the high loss rates, was apparently a far better than even chance of ending up killed in action or being taken prisoners of war in Germany rather than returning to the States. As overwork, exhaustion, and high losses bred depression, so did changes in the crew rotation policy initiated by Arnold and introduced by Spaatz and Doolittle. The heightened pace of bomber operations meant that a bomber crew, after three and one-half to four months of training, could complete a tour in as little as two months. The AAF could not afford such waste. On January 30, Doolittle introduced a policy of retaining selected crew members after they had completed their twenty-five-mission tour, anticipating by almost two weeks a similar change in rotation policy throughout the AAF.141 In mid-February, Doolittle explained to his commanders his reasons for doing so: (1) the AAF had completed its expansion program, it no longer needed expe- rienced crews to be returned to the United States to form new units; (2) the com- ing cross-channel invasion meant as many as two missions a day,
