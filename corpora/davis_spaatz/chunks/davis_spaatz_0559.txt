eted its expansion program, it no longer needed expe- rienced crews to be returned to the United States to form new units; (2) the com- ing cross-channel invasion meant as many as two missions a day, making a tour of twenty-five missions impractical; (3) greatly increased fighter support had lowered the loss rate, making it possible for more crews to complete their tour; and (4) increased experience raised the effectiveness of the force. Doolittle added a final exhortation: This Air Force is now approaching the most critical phase of the war with Germany. During the next few months it is mandatory that we secure complete air superiority over the German Air Force in this Theater. In order to accom- plish this end in the time allotted, we must adopt every expedient to improve the effectiveness of the Air Force and to keep it at a high level of operational efficiency.14 142 380   ## p. 381 (#405) ############################################  THE LUFTWAFFE DEFEATED In March, Doolittle sought to convince his combat crews that when they fin- ished a tour they were not "through with the war."143 He notified them that "hereafter relief of combat crew personnel from regular participation in opera- tions will not take place upon completion of any specified number of sorties." He added, "Combat crews have also been informed that they are relieved from duty only to provide time for suitable rest and recuperation. At the end of this period, they are considered to be again available for combat assignment." To give the crews a goal to strive toward, Doolittle further ruled that combat crews would be eligible for relief after thirty sorties.144 In practice, unit commanders routinely relieved crews after thirty missions, but the threat of indefinite assign- ment lingered to the detriment of morale. On March 13, Spaatz and Doolittle saw for themselves how brittle morale had become when they visited the 100th Heavy Bombardment Group at Thorpe Abbotts. The 100th had lost fifteen bomber
