ave confirmed suspicions harbored by top AAF officers, such as Doolittle and Fred Anderson, that members of the British press had embarked on â€œan anti-American bombing effort."148 Both had complained earlier that the British press seemed out to "belittle" the American effort, and they suspected a "sinister movement" to discredit the AAF.149 Spaatz, whose own intelligence estimates showed a 300-fighter decrease in the Luftwaffe since January, objected mightily to Peck's statements and insensi- tive timing. On the previous day, April 11, the Eighth had suffered its second worst casualty total of the war, losing sixty-four planes, including nine interned 381   ## p. 382 (#406) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE in Sweden. The 3d Bombardment Division sustained particularly high casualties because it had conducted an unescorted raid aimed at Poznan, well inside Poland. The Germans, free to employ their twin-engine fighters, handled it roughly. This, or the worsening weather over the primary target, had led the 3d to bomb Stettin and Rostock, targets far short of Poznan, and to return early.150 The bombers may have unloaded on German targets because Eighth Air Force policy forbade the use of H2X bombing methods over occupied countries- reflecting the attitude that any collateral civilian casualties inflicted by relatively inaccurate bombing-through-clouds techniques ought at least to be German and that any bomb dropped on Germany would do some harm, no matter how infinitesimal, to the enemy war effort. Spaatz conducted both a front-door and a back-door campaign to ameliorate the effects of the RAF statement. He and his staff at Park House that evening decided not to try to conduct a countercampaign in the British press. 151 They probably recognized that any such effort might backfire. Instead, Spaatz wrote a stinging letter to Portal but did not sign it or send it through official channels, which, of course, kept it out of offic
