because it gave the theater commanders power to replace his attacks on German "industrial and military systems," the effects of which were measurable, with area bombing, the effects of which were not, in order to break down German morale. Not only would such a proposal increase the theater commanders' power at Spaatz's expense, "it will probably nullify my control of Combined POINTBLANK operations at critical times with no balanced judgments [with] regard to issues involved." Spaatz urged Arnold to advocate that the CCS "adopt a policy of resisting all but genuinely necessary demands for diversion of effort."

The CCS, with Arnold's agreement, approved a cable to Portal authorizing him "to capitalize on favorable opportunities for Morale visit: Lt. Gen. Carl A. Spaatz and Brig. Gen. Robert B.
