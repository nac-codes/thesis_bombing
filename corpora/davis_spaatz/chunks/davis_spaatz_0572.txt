April 5, it went after Ploesti's marshaling yards, but actually hit oil targets each refinery complex had its own commercial railway yard, and "sloppy" bombing of the yards inflicted damage on the oil centers. As the AAF official history states, "It was thought wise to begin the undertaking surrepti- tiously under the general directive which called for bombing transportation tar- gets supporting German forces who were facing the Russians." With some satisfaction the history notes, "Most of the 588 tons of bombs, with more than coincidental inaccuracy, struck and badly damaged the Astra group of refiner- ies near by."181 389   ## p. 390 (#414) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Twice more, on April 15 and 26, hundreds of U.S. heavy bombers returned to Ploesti, where they inflicted "incidental" damage to oil refineries. These raids alerted the Germans. By the time the Fifteenth obtained Portal's official permis- sion to blast Ploesti, in May 1944, they had greatly intensified their artificial smoke screen, antiaircraft artillery, and fighter defenses. As a result, H2X bomb- ing and a much greater expenditure of effort were required to achieve the accu- rate delivery of the required amount of high explosives on target. 182 But German imports of finished oil products, mostly from Romania, fell from 186,000 tons in March to 104,000 tons in April to 40,000 tons in June. 183 The April raids obvi- ously had inflicted great damage. Even as the Fifteenth Air Force began its clandestine oil offensive, setting the stage for attacks on synthetic plants, Spaatz continued to seek a way for the Eighth to begin one as well. Although approved by Eisenhower, the transporta- tion plan had at least temporarily failed to gain Churchill's endorsement. When Churchill and the British War Cabinet reviewed it on April 3, they blanched at an attached Bomber Command estimate predicting 80,000 to 160,000 French civilian casualties from the bombing of
