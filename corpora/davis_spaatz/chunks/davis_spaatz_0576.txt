ed. 197 On April 18 and 19, two strikes of more than 775 heavy bombers each, directed against Berlin and Kassel respectively, had lost a com- bined total of only 15 bombers. 198 Spaatz and USSTAF wanted to experiment with the oil targets to see whether striking them could continue to force attrition on the Luftwaffe.199 Spaatz personally still believed that oil should have priority second only to the destruction of the Luftwaffe.200 Finally, the morale of his command needed boosting.201 If oil bombing proved as successful as he sus- pected it would be, his men would see that their efforts were effective. If Spaatz could not gain Eisenhower's approval, he feared that the entire AAF strategic effort in Europe might fail, or at least fail to keep the Luftwaffe out of the air over the invasion beaches. Apparently, Eisenhower was hard to convince. At one point in the meeting Spaatz may have threatened to resign if he could not have a greater voice in the employment of his force.202 Such an act would probably have completely soured Allied air relationships at a critical stage prior to OVERLORD. Spaatz had done his best to keep his disputes with the RAF out of the public eye. A more flamboyant airman would have had less respect from the British and might have been harder to deal with than Spaatz, who, in every case except this, had proved himself a loyal and self-effacing subordinate. Spaatz's departure and his reasons for it could not have been concealed any better than Patton's notorious slapping incident. The press would undoubtedly have given the story top play, bringing air strategy arguments out into the open and exposing them to public criticism. In any case, convinced either by the logic and vehemence of Spaatz's arguments or by his promise to give up his command, Eisenhower gave him verbal permis- sion to take the two days he needed.203 It must have seemed a small price to pay given the possibly disruptive consequences of strictly adhering to the transporta- tion
