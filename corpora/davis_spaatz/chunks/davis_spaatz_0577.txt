nhower gave him verbal permis- sion to take the two days he needed.203 It must have seemed a small price to pay given the possibly disruptive consequences of strictly adhering to the transporta- tion plan. During the meeting Eisenhower may also have taken Spaatz to task for his laggardly performance on behalf of the transportation plan. As of April 19 the Eighth had not bombed a single one of its assigned rail targets.
