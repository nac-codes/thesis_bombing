would bomb CROSSBOW, and on the next two suitable days it would attack oil targets.2 206 That very day Spaatz and Doolittle sent 892 B-17s and B-24s against CROSSBOW targets in France. The Luftwaffe offered no opposition, and the Eighth lost 9 bombers to antiaircraft fire.207 On April 21, Spaatz and Doolittle, on board their own B-17, watched their bombers form up for the first oil attack. The weather turned foul; strong winds and clouds extended to 30,000 feet, causing the entire mission to abort. Even Spaatz, despite high hopes, admit- ted that he was glad the Eighth had canceled the mission rather than attempt it in impossible circumstances.208 Not until May 12 would the right combination of weather over bases and targets allow the first blow against oil. Meanwhile, the Eighth conducted nine CROSSBOW missions, sending out 2,941 sorties and losing 33 bombers to flak or the junk heap of non-repairable aircraft.209 Two days after his meeting with Eisenhower, Spaatz sent the Eighth over its first transportation target-Hamm, Germany, the largest rail marshaling yard in Europe. This action may have fulfilled his bargain with the Supreme Commander. In March and April 1944, the battle of air attrition between USSTAF and the Luftwaffe fighter force continued over German-occupied Europe. In the first week of March a single raid on Berlin lost 69 heavy bombers; in the last week of April a mission to the same target lost 63. The number of the Eighth's bombers attributed lost to enemy fighters climbed from 178 in March to 314 in April.210 The fierceness of these battles reflected the AAF's and Spaatz's policy of forc- 393   ## p. 394 (#418) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE ing combat at every opportunity. New techniques-employing long-range escorts on deep-penetration sweeps and encouraging aggressive tactics and atti- tudes against the enemy in the air and on the ground-paid dividends in March and April 1944, as the Luftwaffe fig
