tional limitations which have been wisely used in the past will not be applicable to the present emergency situation. Greater risks are justified, and infinitely greater demands on personnel are mandatory. Further, for the imme- diate future it is even desirable to invite an opposition when we have fighter escort, rather than... to evade it.213 Doolittle later recalled that, once, after he had canceled a mission, Spaatz told him "If you haven't got the guts to run a big Air Force, we'll get someone else."214 Spaatz never doubted that he could overcome the Luftwaffe, undermine the German economy, and guarantee air supremacy over Europe and the invasion beaches provided he had suitable weather, replacement of his losses, and free- dom to use his force.
