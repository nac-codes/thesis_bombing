Targets selected are those which we anticipate will force the GAF into the air against us.' -Spaatz to Arnold, May 10, 1944 The Oil Plan Is Implemented In the five weeks before the Allied landings at Normandy, the AAF contin- ued to execute its main tasks: the elimination of the Luftwaffe, the neutralization of V-1 launch sites, and the interdiction of the German transportation system in France. In the days just preceding and during the assault phase of OVERLORD, USSTAF put aside these tasks to provide maximum direct support of the inva- sion. Spaatz contributed substantially to the attainment of the Allies' and the AAF's goals. The Eighth Air Force entered May with 39 operational heavy-bombardment groups, to which the Fifteenth added another 20, for an authorized front-line strength of 2,832 B-17s and B-24s. Spaatz used this force in a manner calculated 395   ## p. 396 (#420) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE to provoke combat with the Luftwaffe so as to inflict fatal attrition upon it.

The nonex- istent Luftwaffe reaction to missions flown against CROSSBOW and transportation targets in late April and the first week of May confirmed speculation. This decline produced not cheer but apprehension within USSTAF and sus- picion that the Luftwaffe meant to conserve its forces for action against the expected invasion. On May 6, at an Allied air conference held at AEAF Head- quarters, Stanmore, Spaatz admitted his fear that the Germans "were conserving their effort against the threat of invasion" and that they might leave the home- land undefended in order to bring all their fighters to bear on the beachheads.3 Spaatz probably based his assessment on reports received
