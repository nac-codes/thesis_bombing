t the threat of invasion" and that they might leave the home- land undefended in order to bring all their fighters to bear on the beachheads.3 Spaatz probably based his assessment on reports received from the RAF's Air Intelligence Branch (AI). On April 30, AI noted that the Luftwaffe had main- tained its strength and predicted a German air strength of 1,950 aircraft spread from Norway and northern Germany to southern France, with 750 immediately available to oppose the invasion. Estimated strength increased throughout the month. On May 25, AI placed total German strength in the west at 2,350 planes; the 900 immediately available included 500 bombers and 220 single-engine fighters.4 But AI, in information gleaned from ULTRA, attributed this situation to a conservation policy stemming from a shortage of pilots. In February, for example, decrypts indicated Luftwaffe intentions to use aircraft from flying schools and training units in case of emergency.5 Spaatz believed that attacking oil targets would nullify the Germans' inten- tion to conserve their aircraft and pilots and force the Luftwaffe up to protect its sources of fuel. On May 12, weather conditions finally permitted a full-scale visual attack on several crucial synthetic oil-producing plants. Aside from two costly strikes on April 29 and May 8 over Berlin, which usually produced heavy German reaction, this attack attracted the heaviest opposition in three weeks. Fifteen combat wings-886 heavy bombers plus 735 escorting fighters left Britain to bomb their targets. The leading division, the 3d, which was under- escorted because one of its assigned fighter groups had mistakenly rendezvoused with a trailing division, saw its remaining escort swamped by a large force of German fighters, which, in forty minutes, downed 32 bombers before they could reach their targets. This single massed blow accounted for most of the 46 bombers lost. The other two bombardment divisions lost only 2 bombers to enemy fighters and 12
