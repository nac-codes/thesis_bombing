s for the German war economy. ULTRA intercepted an order, dated May 13, showing that the previous day's mission had greatly alarmed the Germans. This order, from the Luftwaffe Operations Staff in Berlin, stripped heavy and light antiaircraft guns from the Eastern Front and from the fighter- manufacturing plants of Oschersleben, Leipzig-Erla, and Wiener Neustadt for the protection of hydrogenation plants at Zeitz and Politz.14 A history of USSTAF and ULTRA called this intercept "one of the most decisive and timely pieces of intelligence received in this war."15 It gave proof that the Germans regarded oil as the target system of paramount importance-even above the production of fighter aircraft. A week later the Allies intercepted an order directing the German armed forces to convert an even higher percentage of their motor transport to power supplied by highly inefficient wood fuel generators. 16 When he learned of these messages, Tedder dropped his opposition to the oil plan and is reported to have remarked, “I guess we'll have to give the customer what he wants.”17 398   ## p. 399 (#423) ############################################  FINAL PREPARATIONS  SYNTHETIC OIL PLANT OF The first oil raid: Bomb damage to a synthetic oil plant in Bohlen, Germany, May 12, 1944. After the war, captured documents from Speer to Hitler revealed the dra- matic and almost instantaneous effect of May's bombings. On June 30, Speer reported the state of production of aviation fuel to Hitler. In April, the Luftwaffe consumed 156,000 tons of the 175,000 tons of aviation gasoline manufactured by the synthetic plants; the average daily production in April was 5,850 tons. The attack of May 12 reduced that average to 4,821, but production had recov- ered to 5,526 tons per day by May 28, when the Allies completely knocked out the plant at Leuna. The May 29 attack stopped all production at Politz, and the two strikes combined dropped daily production to 2,775 tons. The total output for May of 15
