llies completely knocked out the plant at Leuna. The May 29 attack stopped all production at Politz, and the two strikes combined dropped daily production to 2,775 tons. The total output for May of 156,000 tons fell 14,000 tons short of essential planned consumption. In June, thanks to more attacks, production rose above 3,000 tons on only two days. 18 On June 7, ULTRA deciphered the following message, dated June 5, from the Luftwaffe Operations Staff, As a result of renewed encroachment into the production of a/c [aircraft] fuel by enemy action, the most essential requirements for training and carrying out production plans can scarcely be covered with the quantities of a/c fuel avail- able. In order to assure the defense of the Reich and to prevent the readiness for defense of the G.A.F. in the east from gradually collapsing, it has been neces- sary to break into the strategical reserve.19 Portal sent a copy of this decryption to the Prime Minister, saying, "I regard this as one of the most important pieces of information we have yet received." 399   ## p. 400 (#424) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Portal also recommended a concentrated bombing attack on synthetic oil targets by all Allied strategic bombers as soon as they could be spared by the invasion.

Churchill replied, "Good."20 Even as the Eighth Air Force staggered the Germans under punishing round- house blows, the Fifteenth Air Force continued pounding Ploesti. As a result of Spaatz's visit to the MAAF and the Fifteenth at the end of April, USSTAF finally obtained Portal's approval of oil as a legitimate target.21 Spaatz per- suaded Portal that the Fifteenth had grown so large that for tactical reasons it should hit other important targets, such as refineries, near the Ploesti marshaling yards.22 No longer obliged
