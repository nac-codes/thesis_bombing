atz per- suaded Portal that the Fifteenth had grown so large that for tactical reasons it should hit other important targets, such as refineries, near the Ploesti marshaling yards.22 No longer obliged to conduct on the sly its missions against oil, the Fifteenth sent almost 500 heavy bombers to Ploesti on May 5 and followed with 700 on May 18, 460 on May 31, and 300 on June 6. Results were, for the most part, excellent. It also bombed small crude oil targets in the Balkans while the RAF kept up a heavy mining campaign in the Danube River.23 A postwar exam- ination of captured German records reveals that, at the time of the Fifteenth's bombing of Ploesti and other Balkan petroleum targets, German imports of fin- ished oil products had fallen from 186,000 tons in March 1944 to 104,000 in April and 81,000 in May. By August, when the Russians occupied the gutted ruins of Ploesti, German oil imports had dropped to a mere 11,000 tons.24 On June 4, Eisenhower's headquarters publicly proclaimed the existence of the oil offensive.25 Churchill Delays the Transportation Plan By May 1, five weeks after the transportation plan had been endorsed by Eisenhower, it had not been endorsed by Churchill, who remained worried about the potential political side effects of killing and maiming French civilians. Spaatz, too, worried. He believed that, although actual casualties might vary widely, the Germans would greatly exaggerate their number for propaganda pur- poses.26 On April 22, after discussion with his personal staff and Bedell Smith, Spaatz met with Eisenhower on the subject,27 bringing the draft of a letter with him in which he spelled out his objections and proposed an alternative: I would feel seriously remiss in my duty if I did not bring to your attention the serious implications involved with these attacks. Many thousands of French people will be killed and many towns will be laid waste in these operations. I feel a joint responsibility with you and I view with alarm a mili
