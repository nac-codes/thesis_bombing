On the night of April 19, Churchill still doubted that any suffering caused by the transportation plan justi- fied its results. He raised the possibility of attacking synthetic oil targets,34 but Portal and Tedder repeated their opinion that such a tactic could not succeed by D-day. Even after the British Chiefs of Staff asked for a speedy decision, Churchill demurred, although he admitted that the longer the decision remained in ques- tion, the stronger the case for the transportation plan became.35 On April 26, the Prime Minister agreed to put the matter before the War Cabinet.
