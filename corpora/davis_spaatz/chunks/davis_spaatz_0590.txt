Eisenhower remained adamant. To abandon the transportation plan at this juncture was unthinkable. He wrote to Marshall, "There is no other way in which this tremendous air force can help us during the preparatory period, to get ashore and stay there. The Prime Minister talked to me about bombing 'bases, troop concentrations and dumps.' "38 Churchill's reference to dumps and troop concentrations echoed Spaatz's letter on civilian casualties to Eisenhower; such similarity of phrasing points to close collaboration between Spaatz's head- quarters and Churchill's staff. On April 22, Doolittle, for instance, attended a dinner at 10 Downing Street where he was prepared to discuss and support USSTAF's views on the oil plan.39 In the space of a week, both Churchill and Spaatz, using virtually the same language, proposed to Eisenhower that the use of American heavy bombers in the transportation plan be restricted. On May 2, Eisenhower sent Churchill a more detailed reply, written for the most part by Tedder,40 which patiently reviewed the rationale behind the trans- portation planâ€”it was intended to weaken and confuse the rail network at a crit- ical time, rather than to choke it off entirely.

After noting that a limitation to 100 to 150 casualties per mission would "emasculate" the transportation plan, the reply concluded with Eisenh
