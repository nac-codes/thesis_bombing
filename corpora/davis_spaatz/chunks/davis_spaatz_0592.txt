in Churchill did not start at the subsequent Defence Committee meeting. The transportation plan, said Churchill, â€œwill smear the good name of the Royal Air Force across the world." Churchill asked whether the plan could be implemented at a cost of less than 10,000 dead. Tedder expressed his hopes of keeping the number of French dead below that number, although he could make no guarantees. The committee then considered a suggestion from Lord Cherwell, Churchill's chief scientific adviser, that bridges might be better alternative targets than rail centers. Tedder rejected the suggestion out of hand. In the end, the committee instructed Tedder to report its discussion and conclusion to Eisenhower, after reviewing the trans- portation plan to ensure no more than 10,000 French casualties.45 On May 7, Churchill informed Roosevelt of the British government's con- cern over the "slaughter" of French civilians, which might "leave a legacy of hate." He noted "the great differences of opinion in the two air forces-not between them but crisscross about the efficacy of the 'railway plan' as a short- term project." Then he asked for Roosevelt's opinion: It must be remembered, on the one hand, that this slaughter is among a friendly people who have committed no crimes against us, and not among the German foe, with all their record of cruelty and ruthlessness.
