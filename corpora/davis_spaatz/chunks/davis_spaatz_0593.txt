ir opinion might militate against the success of 'OVERLORD' or cause additional loss of life to our Allied forces of invasion.47 This ended the matter. Having received no support from the Combined Chiefs of Staff or the President and having been opposed by Eisenhower, Churchill allowed the transportation plan to proceed without interference. Happily, civil- ian casualties from rail center attacks before D-day proved to be less than half of those predicted; approximately 4,750 were killed.48 Whereas Churchill had opposed the transportation plan on political grounds, Spaatz attempted to overturn it on practical grounds. He had already gained Eisenhower's permission for two days' visual bombing of oil targets; these mis- sions demonstrated the effectiveness of the oil plan as a strategic alternative. In addition, by late April and early May, he began to offer a tactical alternative to the transportation plan. He pushed for an interdiction campaign directed first against the Seine and Loire River bridges, important rail junctions, and open stretches of track, and then against ammunition and fuel dumps, ordnance 403   ## p. 404 (#428) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE depots, and other military establishments large enough to offer a suitable tar- get.49 He chose not to present those plans on March 25 because he did not want to appear to overstep his authority. Churchill's opposition to the transportation plan, however, kept alive the possibility of a replacement. Thus Spaatz sought to substitute his oil and interdiction campaign. The details of USSTAF's interdiction campaign, which the Enemy Objectives Unit had prepared in mid- and late February,50 circulated throughout the Allied air establishment and beyond. This was apparently done sub rosa or by word of mouth, perhaps with Spaatz's approval. Churchill, at one point, advocated the adoption of portions of the plan to Eisenhower. Lord Cherwell kept suggesting bridge attacks.
