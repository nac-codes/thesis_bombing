done sub rosa or by word of mouth, perhaps with Spaatz's approval. Churchill, at one point, advocated the adoption of portions of the plan to Eisenhower. Lord Cherwell kept suggesting bridge attacks. By May, additional information supporting the interdiction advo- cates' position had become available with the completion of Operation STRANGLE, a campaign conducted by Allied air over a period of almost two months in Italy against all types of targets along whole sections of track rather than one type of target. By the end of the operation, May 12, it had switched primarily to attacks on bridges, because they had proved to be better targets.51 On trips to Italy at the end of April, Spaatz and Anderson had the chance to review STRANGLE's results first hand and brought back enthusiastic reports of its success in bridge breaking. Experts had predicted that the tactic would require the expending of huge numbers of bombs and had thus deemed it unrewarding. STRANGLE had demonstrated that it was entirely feasible with modest numbers of bombs and that it was, moreover, a highly effective block to enemy move- ment.52 RAF Air Intelligence joined USSTAF in backing bridge attacks. AI reports of bridge attacks in Italy during February and March, based on photo- graphic reconnaissance and high-grade signal intelligence, testified to the tac- tic's "not unimpressive" effect.53 Given this evidence and Churchill's ongoing political concern, a concern that certainly percolated to Spaatz's headquarters, the experimental bombing of the Vernon rail bridge over the Seine on May 7 assumed special significance. It occurred when Churchill, who had run out of time in fighting the transportation plan, needed some hard evidence to quiet its advocates. Spaatz also had to provide a demonstration of the effectiveness of his alternative tactical proposal. Their chance came when Montgomery's 21 Army Group Headquarters requested the destruction of several bridges by the air force to interfere with the
