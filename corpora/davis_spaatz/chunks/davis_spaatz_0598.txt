him to go ahead.59 Just before noon the next day, a flight of fighter- bombers from the 365th Fighter Group, specially trained in low-level bombing, left England for France. Twelve planes and escorts attacked the bridge at Vernon, and another twelve with escorts attacked additional bridges. Within a few minutes and under the gaze of German Field Marshal Irwin Rommel, who happened to be there,60 the P-47s, with only six tons of bombs, destroyed the bridge and a nearby ammunition factory, at the cost of two planes lost and five damaged. The flight leader reported "the most intensive light flak they had yet encountered."61 Another flight damaged three more bridges at Oissel, Orival, and Mantes-Gassicourt the same day.62 This brilliant piece of beginner's luck was the most accurate bridge raid of the campaign in northwestern Europe; the typical bridge cut took 173 tons.63 The next morning, May 8, every major figure in the bombing plan controversy found a set of post-attack aerial photographs on his desk showing the bridge lying at the bottom of the Seine. Like the ULTRA intercept on German oil, they removed all doubt about the cost-effectiveness of attacking bridges with fighter-bombers rather than heavy bombers.64 On May 10, Leigh-Mallory, after assessing the raid's effectiveness, ordered his tactical forces to begin cutting the bridges over the Albert Canal in Belgium and along the Meuse. Because of security considerations, the AEAF did not bomb the Loire bridges until D-day.65 Tedder ceased his oppo- sition.66 As its advocates had claimed, pre-D-day bridge-breaking also proved eas- ier on the French civilian population than bombing marshaling yards. Less than 1,000 French civilians died as a result of it.67 Almost as an afterthought the British and the Americans finally asked an official representative of General Charles de Gaulle's Free French government-in-exile its opinions on the matter of killing French civilians. Churchill, who had little love for the stubborn
