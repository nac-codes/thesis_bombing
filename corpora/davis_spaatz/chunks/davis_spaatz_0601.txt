These so-called "Chattanooga Choo-Choo" missions on May 21, 25, and 29 and June 2, 3, and 4 damaged hundreds of loco- motives, cut the rails in numerous places, and forced the Germans to bring in train crews of their own nationals to man the trains along dangerous lines after the French crews deserted in large numbers. Daylight traffic almost completely halted. The bridge campaign also continued. From May 11 through May 26, Allied aircraft attacked bridges in Belgium and northern France. On May 24, the ban on the Seine bridges, imposed because of security considerations, was removed, and by D-day, June 6, all Seine River rail and road bridges below Paris were at the bottom of the river or otherwise unusable, all at the cost of about 220 tons of bombs per bridge.75 While the medium bombers and fighter-bombers of the AEAF downed bridges and shot up trains, the Eighth Air Force le
