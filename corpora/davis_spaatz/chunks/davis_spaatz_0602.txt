iver or otherwise unusable, all at the cost of about 220 tons of bombs per bridge.75 While the medium bombers and fighter-bombers of the AEAF downed bridges and shot up trains, the Eighth Air Force lent its efforts to pre-D-day preparations. On April 22, it's bombers inaugurated their part in the transporta- tion plan by striking the largest railroad marshaling yard in Europe, at Hamm, Germany. Hamm was the rail gateway to the Ruhr, Germany's largest industrial area, and the Eighth's bombs left it crippled for the rest of the war.76 On May 1 and 11, its fighters participated in the "Chattanoogas" while its heavy bombers conducted large-scale raids on French rail center targets. In the two weeks before the invasion, USSTAF delivered the bulk of its tonnage on transportation targets. In missions on May 23, 25, 27, and 30 and June 4, it delivered more than 13,000 tons of bombs. Of the twenty-three rail centers assigned to it, the Eighth damaged fifteen so severely that they needed no additional bombing. It also inflicted great damage on the remaining eight.77 RAF Bomber Command participated more heavily against rail centers than USSTAF, dropping 46,000 of 71,000 tons expended. Spaatz's initial fear that Bomber Command would get off scot-free while he had to tie himself to the transportation plan never materialized. German rail transport was reduced by another one-third from the beginning of January 1944.78 The authorities and participants, both Allied and German, have continued to dispute the relative effectiveness of the various methods employed against rail traffic. Tedder and Zuckerman naturally claimed that the transportation plan was the most important contributor to its decline.79 The official AAF history, in con- trast, quoted just as many sources with the opposite opinion and concluded with a statement by the AAF Evaluation Board: "The pre-D-day attacks against French rail centers were not necessary and the 70,000 tons involved could have been devoted to altern
