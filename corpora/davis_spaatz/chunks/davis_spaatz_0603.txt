opinion and concluded with a statement by the AAF Evaluation Board: "The pre-D-day attacks against French rail centers were not necessary and the 70,000 tons involved could have been devoted to alternative targets."80 The fact remains that the pre-D-day air campaign imposed severe and damaging injuries to the German military's mobil- ity and logistics, which undoubtedly hurt the German effort on D-day and after. In conjunction with its interdiction campaign, Allied air power also sought to neutralize all 100 usable enemy airfields within a 350-mile arc from the 410   ## p. 411 (#435) ############################################  FINAL PREPARATIONS planned invasion beaches. The British wanted the airfields within 130 miles of the invasion area singled out in order to put the Luftwaffe at the same opera- tional disadvantage as their own aircraft operating from British bases. The Eighth, which flew its first antiairfield mission of the campaign on May 9, exe- cuted the lion's share of this phase of pre-D-day preparations. Of the airfields within 130 miles of Caen, the left flank of the invasion, Bomber Command had responsibility for 8, AEAF for 12, and USSTAF for 20. The Eighth and the Fifteenth also had responsibility for neutralizing the 59 fields more than 130 miles but less than 350 miles from Caen. Large missions by the Eighth on May 23, 24, and 25 and missions by the Fifteenth damaged many but when it became evident, probably from ULTRA sources, that the Luftwaffe had not begun to occupy its advanced bases in France, the Allies discontinued their attacks.81 As air preliminaries for the invasion proceeded, Leigh-Mallory laid the groundwork for the final phase of preinvasion activities. In the week before the invasion he would have control of all assisting air forces. On May 23, less than two weeks before D-day, scheduled for June 5, he inaugurated a series of daily morning Allied Air Commanders' Conferences on projected operations and the allotment of tasks betwee
