The next day, Leigh-Mallory disapproved the key airfields plan, whereupon 412   ## p. 413 (#437) ############################################  FINAL PREPARATIONS Vandenberg suggested that he consult Tedder. This Leigh-Mallory did and reported back to Vandenberg that not only Tedder but Eisenhower had approved his own plan to bomb the road choke points between German reinforcements and the beachheads. Reluctantly, Vandenberg then signed the order for an attack on eleven French cities.87 On June 3, Tedder, Spaatz, and others trekked to Stanmore for the daily Air Commanders' meeting. Spaatz suggested changes in the employment of the strate- gic forces. In his view, the plan for strategic air support after the initial D-day strike was too rigid and it lacked provisions for any counterair effort. He probably based his appraisal on the need for a counterair effort on the reports emanating from RAF Air Intelligence. On May 25, AI predicted that approximately 1,600 German aircraft would be engaged against the beachhead by D-day plus four days and that there would be 1,100 to 1,250 German sorties on the day of the invasion. On May 30, ULTRA identified only ten groups (280 planes) of single-engine fighters in Germany, because of the transfer of other groups to the west.88 Spaatz proposed withholding a reserve for airfield bombing and the flexible employment of his force according to the flow of the ground assault, rather than the execution of a set scheme of attacks on targets fixed before the battle. Leigh- Mallory ridiculed the suggestion, maintaining that fighters and fighter-bombers could provide the necessary counterair effort. But Spaatz persisted, believing that Leigh-Mallory had committed the Eighth Air Force to â€œusing a doubtful means of delaying enemy ground movements and neglecting a punitive means of reducing his air efforts."89 Leigh-Mallory would not reconsider his position, and, as Vandenberg noted in his diary, "a slightly acrimonious air prevai
