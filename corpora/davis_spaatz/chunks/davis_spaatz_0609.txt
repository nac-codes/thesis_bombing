aircraft.94 As Spaatz stated in late June 1944, "The concentrated attacks on the Luftwaffe, production, and product, paid the dividends that we always envisioned, the dividend being beyond expectation. During the entire first day of the invasion enemy opposition in the air, either fighter or bomber, was next to nil."95 The battle for air supremacy over the beachhead never occurred, because the AAF had already defeated the Luftwaffe over Germany. D-day and the Luftwaffe's feeble reaction in the following weeks amply proved Spaatz's oft-repeated con- tention that the greatest contribution the strategic air forces could make to OVERLORD was the smashing of the German fighter force. This offensive achieve- ment ranked with the defensive victory of the RAF in the Battle of Britain. The demise of the German fighter force was a turning point in the air war. * H-hour, the time when the first assault craft would land and release its troops onto the beach, was 6:30 A.M. for the American invasion beaches (Omaha and Utah) and 7:00 A.M. and 7:30 A.M. for the British landings. Among the factors dictating selection of H-hour were at least an hour of day- light before it (for preliminary bombardment) and tide at half-flood (to expose German obstacles) and rising (to ensure two high tides in daylight for maximum unloading of supplies). 414   ## p. 415 (#439) ############################################  FINAL PREPARATIONS When Spaatz returned to London from the Mediterranean in late December 1943 to form the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe, he had two primary tasks: to justify and execute the AAF's portion of the Combined Bomber Offensive against Germany and to ensure the success of the U.S.-British cross-channel invasion to the best of his ability. These tasks required him to serve two masters, Arnold and Eisenhower, both of whom had, at times, very different conceptions of the part they wished him to play. Arnold had fought for the creation of USSTAF because he believed that
