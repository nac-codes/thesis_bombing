e two masters, Arnold and Eisenhower, both of whom had, at times, very different conceptions of the part they wished him to play. Arnold had fought for the creation of USSTAF because he believed that the American strategic air forces in Italy and England should have a single, able air- man to coordinate, control, and command them. Arnold had another objective as well. As he told Spaatz in late February 1944: The other, and perhaps equally important, motive behind the formation of the United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe was my desire to build an American Air Commander to a high position prior to the defeat of Germany. It is that aspect particularly which had impelled me in my so far successful fight to keep your command parallel in stature to Harris' command and, therefore, parallel to Ike's. Arnold further felt the need to ensure the AAF a proper share of the victory. He told Spaatz: If you do not remain in a position parallel with Harris the air war will certainly be won by the RAF, if anybody. Already the spectacular effectiveness of their devastation of cities has placed their contribution in the popular mind at so high a plane that I am having the greatest difficulty in keeping your achievement (far less spectacular to the public) in its proper role not only in publications, but unfortunately in military and naval circles, and in fact, with the President him- self. Therefore, considering only the aspect of a proper American share in credit for success in the air war, I feel we must have a high air commander some place in Europe. Today you can be that commander [emphasis added].‚Åπ Eisenhower, in contrast, wanted control of the strategic forces in order to guarantee the success of OVERLORD. He required that control as early as possi- ble-far longer than desired by Arnold, who initially conceded only that the heavy bombers would come under the Supreme Commander during the assault phase of the invasion. In addition, Eisenhower intended to use his control of
