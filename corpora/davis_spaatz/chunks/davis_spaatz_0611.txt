d by Arnold, who initially conceded only that the heavy bombers would come under the Supreme Commander during the assault phase of the invasion. In addition, Eisenhower intended to use his control of the strategic air forces to implement a plan whose aims, requirements, and methods of execution raised profound doubts in the minds of many senior airmen, includ- ing Spaatz. Spaatz, of course, had his own ideas; he did not meekly follow the dictates of his powerful superiors. Against Arnold's hopes, he did not do his utmost to main- tain a position independent from Eisenhower's.

From the beginning of his tenure, Spaatz clearly saw that the attainment of the goals of both POINTBLANK and OVERLORD depended on a single factor-the destruction of the Luftwaffe.

Spaatz remorselessly pursued that goal, pushing the men under his com- mand almost to the breaking point. Doolittle, under the watchful eyes of Anderson and Spaatz, sent his men and machines into the air day after day. By March, the Eighth Air Force often abandoned deception tactics and flew straight to their targets in order to provoke attrition. The primary reason the Eighth made the long, hard, costly trip to Berlin was not just to bomb Hitler's capital but to forc
