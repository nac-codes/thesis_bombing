presumably they did soon after the raids. Spaatz used variations of this same subterfuge in his unsigned letters to Portal on morale and to Eisenhower on civilian casualties, and in obtaining per- mission to interdict bridges. In these instances, the results justified Spaatz's actions and judgments. That he did not show similar restraint in his dealings with Leigh-Mallory is understandable. He did not believe that Leigh-Mallory was competent to perform his duties or, because of his high-handedness and 416   ## p. 417 (#441) ############################################  FINAL PREPARATIONS insensitivity, deal with Americans. Because Leigh-Mallory insisted on having a headquarters top-heavy with British personnel and tried to interfere with his relationship with the Ninth Air Force, Spaatz apparently decided that, in this instance, the rules of Allied unity need not apply. Spaatz continued to question Leigh-Mallory's plans until the eve of the invasion. The efforts of the AAF in this period cost dearly in blood and mat√©riel. From January 1 through May 31, the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces lost 2,351 heavy bombers on combat missions. They wrote off another 254 from accidents and unrepairable battle damage. The Eighth and Ninth Air Forces lost 983 fighters and suffered 18,403 casualties (5,427 killed in action, 11,033 missing in action or interned, and 1,943 wounded). Ninety percent of those men, most of whom were missing in action or prisoners of war, would not fight against Germany again. The Fifteenth and Twelfth Air Forces lost 595 fighters and sustained 7,285 casu- alties (2,780 killed in action, 3,452 missing in action, and 1,053 wounded). The Fifteenth probably suffered 80 percent of the AAF's personnel losses in the Mediterranean. This expenditure of resources gained the Allies air supremacy over Europe. With air supremacy came the freedom to bomb at will any target in Germany and the freedom invade France without Luftwaffe interference. The achievement of air
