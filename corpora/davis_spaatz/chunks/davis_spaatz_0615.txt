e of the invasion greatly reduced the Germans' ability to shift heavy units rapidly to the invasion beachhead. The units eventually arrived but battered, piecemeal, and late, which gave the Allied ground forces the time they needed to consolidate their positions. 417   ## p. 418 (#442) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE In the first six days of June, the Eighth bombed only tactical targets in France in support of the OVERLORD assault. Out of 14,230 tons dropped, the Eighth dropped 7,018 on the Pas-de-Calais coastal defenses as part of Allied preinvasion deception efforts, and 4,852 on D-day. 101 Aside from in some mea- sure keeping Hitler's attention fixed on Pas-de-Calais as the most probable inva- sion site, this effort probably contributed little to the success of the invasion. There was no testimony among the German defenders at the Normandy beaches of any discomfiture attributable to Allied heavy bombers. USSTAF's preinvasion bombing certainly damaged the Germans, but those efforts seem small compared with the efforts of Bomber Command and the AEAF, which by themselves would have sufficed to fulfill the Allies' goals for preinvasion air operations. If USSTAF had spent that same effort demolishing the German oil industry, the Allies might have won the war earlier. Spaatz did everything in his power to keep his bombers over Germany where they could bomb oil targets and maintain air supremacy. 418   ## p. 419 (#443) ############################################  Part Five The Mortal Blow From Normandy to Berlin, June 6, 1944-May 9, 1945   ## p. 420 (#444) ############################################    ## p. 421 (#445) ############################################  Part Five The Mortal Blow During the last eleven months of the war in Europe the Anglo-American Allies successfully established themselves on the Continent, broke out of their beachhead to drive across France to the German border, fought an arduous cam- paign to
