war in Europe the Anglo-American Allies successfully established themselves on the Continent, broke out of their beachhead to drive across France to the German border, fought an arduous cam- paign to penetrate the German border defenses, repelled Hitler's last-gamble counteroffensive, crossed the Rhine River to meet the westward advancing forces of the Soviet Union, and finally forced the unconditional surrender of the German state. The Army Air Forces and its senior officer in Europe, Carl Spaatz, played a large role in achieving Allied victory. Operating under Dwight Eisenhower's direct control from June to September 1944 and thereafter inde- pendently, the United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe crushed the already defeated Luftwaffe while seeking a balance between its strategic mission of destroying the German war economy and its tactical responsibilities to aid the advance of the Allied ground armies by all means possible. Because his dual positions as the commander of both USSTAF and the AAF in the European Theater of Operations gave Spaatz administrative control of all AAF units in the theater, he became the de facto leader of almost all U.S. Army Air Forces fighting the Nazis. Even Ira Eaker, AAF commander of the Medi- terranean Allied Air Forces, often consulted with Spaatz and tended to defer to his judgment. The head of the AAF, Arnold, certainly viewed Spaatz as the prin- cipal U.S. airman in Europe. Arnold did his utmost to support Spaatz with men and matériel while charging him with the task of enhancing the image and status of the AAF at every opportunity. Thanks in part to his close and easy relationships with the Supreme Comman- der Allied Expeditionary Force, Eisenhower, and the Deputy Supreme Commander, Tedder, Spaatz balanced the competing and sometimes contradictory demands on his command's capabilities with an éclat that brought promotion for himself and, more important, prestige and credit to the AAF. 421   ## p. 422 (#446) #############
