sometimes contradictory demands on his command's capabilities with an éclat that brought promotion for himself and, more important, prestige and credit to the AAF. 421   ## p. 422 (#446) ############################################    ## p. 423 (#447) ############################################  Chapter 12 Summer 1944: CROSSBOW, THUNDERCLAP, and Strategic Bombing (June-September 1944) My own opinion of the present situation is that so far the Germans have been very successful in that all the power of the Americans and the British is being contained in a nar- row beachhead by fourteen half-baked . . . divisions, thereby relieving Germany of the pressure of the bombard- ment to which they have been subjected during the past six months.¹ -Spaatz's Command Diary, June 17, 1944 From June to mid-September 1944, the fighting on the ground between the Western Allies and the Germans divided into two distinct phases: (1) the landing and expansion of the beachhead (June 6 to July 24) and (2) the breakout from the beachhead and pursuit of the defeated Germans to the French-German border (July 25 to September 10). Whereas the operations of the Allied tactical air forces had to adapt to the exigencies of the ground situation, the operations of the strategic air forces developed differently. Spaatz, although subordinate to Eisenhower until the middle of September, had his eyes on a perspective beyond that of some ground and tactical air leaders who wished to put themselves into a position from which they could attack and destroy Germany. Spaatz already had the means available to attack deep within Germany. He fought to retain his forces for the Combined Bomber Offensive, while the ground soldiers continu- ally pressed him to divert his planes to tasks on the front line or relatively close behind it. They believed that a well-timed, heavy air strike might provide the final element needed to achieve the decisive breakthrough. 423   ## p. 424 (#448) #################################
