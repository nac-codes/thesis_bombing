close behind it. They believed that a well-timed, heavy air strike might provide the final element needed to achieve the decisive breakthrough. 423   ## p. 424 (#448) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE This argument could never convince a strategically minded airman like Spaatz. He pleaded that large formations of heavy bombers did not easily lend themselves to concentration on a single decisive point necessary for the support of a land attack. The Eighth often launched missions consisting of several hun- dred heavy bombers, but when they reached their target area, they separated into component bomb wings (100 to 150 bombers) or bomb groups (40 to 50 planes) to deliver their ordnance on individual targets. This practice increased bombing accuracy and avoided possible problems when too many bombers hit the same target at too close intervals. These problems included dust and smoke clouds obscuring the target, antiaircraft artillery, and air congestion disrupting forma- tions and causing highly spread bomb patterns. In any case, the Army did not need, except in cases of emergency, the constant support of heavy bombers and their escorts when the tactical air forces had ample numbers of fighter-bombers and medium bombers at the beck and call of the ground forces. Spaatz's efforts to maintain the strategic bomber offensive in the face of diversions to retard the German V-1 attacks on England, to support the ground forces, and to engage in morale bombing as opposed to precision bombing over Germany constitute the theme of this chapter. Initial Operations Before the invasion Spaatz had agreed to aid the assault phase of the opera- tion. For that critical phase the Eighth Air Force ceased its attacks directed against German industry and devoted its efforts to the bombing program called for in preinvasion and invasion deception plans. From May 30, when the Eighth struck aircraft production targets in Germany and then temporarily hal
