From May 30, when the Eighth struck aircraft production targets in Germany and then temporarily halted strate- gic attacks, until June 18, when it resumed missions against industrial targets in Germany, the Eighth flew exclusively in support of the invasion. In June the Eighth dropped 44,209 tons of bombs on France, almost 76 percent of its effort for the month.2 The Germans, too, meant to put their maximum air power into the skies over the beachhead. To that end, in the four days following D-day they sent more than 300 single-engine fighter aircraft in addition to the 170 already in France to fly ground support for the troops battling the Allies.3 This action, however, proved disastrous. The Luftwaffe drew its planes from the fighter force defend- ing the homeland against attacks by Allied heavy-bomber forces and assigned them to fledgling pilots, who had just replaced the veteran pilots killed or dis- abled in the spring, were minimally trained for antibomber operations, and had no ground support training. In their flights to the forward airfields they suffered an accumulation of losses not only from Allied aircraft, who knew their flight plans from signal intelligence decryptions,4 but also from their own faulty navi- gation and from landings on unfamiliar fields.5 The Luftwaffe literally telegraphed its punches to the Allies.
