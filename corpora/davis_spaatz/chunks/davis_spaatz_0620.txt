d distributed the Luftwaffe's messages at least as quickly as the intended recipients.6 The Luftwaffe Enigma machine was simpler than its army and navy equivalents in that it possessed one less code-setting wheel or rotor. Consequently, the ULTRA organization had fewer difficulties deciphering the Luftwaffe's messages than those of the other German armed forces. As early as 2:30 P.M. on June 6, ULTRA learned that eighteen fighter groups had left Germany for France.7 By June 8, it learned that seven more groups had arrived, and it passed their exact locations on to Allied operational units. Within six days of the invasion, June 12, ULTRA knew that because of the fierce pressure exerted by the Allies, the Luftwaffe had given up on fighter-bombing, ordering the removal of bomb racks and the reconversion of their aircraft to their pure fighter configuration.8 This action, which eliminated the fighters' capacity to deliver bombs, proved that the Luftwaffe had abandoned its ground support role and had been forced entirely into defense against Allied air attacks. By the end of the first week, the Luftwaffe's strength stood at 1,100 machines, its highest of the cam- paign. The British Air Ministry greatly overestimated this force at 1,615 aircraft, but noted a very low serviceability rate, 33 percent for fighters and 16 percent for fighter-bombers. The average daily fighter effort ranged from 250 to 300 sorties. RAF Air Intelligence noted that bomber groups operated at only 65 percent of 425   ## p. 426 (#450) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE establishment.9 Heavy attacks by the Eighth over airfields on June 14 and 15â€” based on information from ULTRA intercepts-applied the coup de grace. On June 16, the Luftwaffe withdrew five shattered groups for refitting in Germany. Their replacements at the front, also drawn from domestic air defense duties, fared little better. During the month of June 1944, the total fighter force avail- a
