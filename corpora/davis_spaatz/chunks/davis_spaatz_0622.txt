al unpredictability and unnerving buzzing sound that shut off just before impact, provoked extraordinary anxiety and led to extreme pressure on the Allies to reduce the threat. In all, between June 13 and September 1, 1944, 5,890 flying bombs landed in England. They killed 5,835 persons and seriously injured an additional 16,762. London suffered 90 percent of all casualties.11 Each weapon killed, on the average, one person and seriously injured almost three more. In contrast, during the ten-day Battle of Hamburg in July 1943, the RAF and the AAF killed almost 50,000 German civilians, most as the result of a single fire storm on the night of July 27-28.12 (See Map 13, Operation CROSSBOW Network.)

Spaatz objected to both solutions; previous bomb- ings of launch sites had proved ineffective and terror bombing could produce no predictable result to justify the abandonment of precision bombing. At first the Allies failed to react, but the firing of 300 buzz bombs on the night of June 15-16 necessitated some countermeasure. On June 18, Churchill visited Tedder a
