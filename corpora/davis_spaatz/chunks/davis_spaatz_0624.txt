istorians acknowl- edged, "CROSSBOW Operations during the second half of June indicated that the Germans had again created for the Allies a diversionary problem of the first magnitude."18 From the beginning of this new phase of CROSSBOW, Spaatz voiced his objections to the amount of force he had to devote to it and to the targets selected for it. Like most of the AAF's commanders in Europe, Spaatz believed that mass bombing of the launch sites accomplished little. The Germans had hardened the large sites with vast amounts of concrete, making them impervious to the most powerful bombs. They had, for the most part, abandoned the large sites to concentrate on small, well-camouflaged positions almost impossible to spot from the air. Spaatz wished to bomb the electrical system in Pas-de-Calais, which would stymie the functioning of the large sites and supply areas. The British, who controlled the V-1 targeting selection from the Air Ministry, incorpo- rated these proposals into their plans but did not emphasize them.19 They con- tinued to expend most of the heavy-bomber effort on large launch sites, with negligible results.

At the same time he initiated within the theater a similar program variously called APHRODITE or WEARY-WILLIE.20 Finally, he offered two suggestions closer to his true purpose that of main- taining the Combined Bomber Offensive. He offered to bomb the German facto- ries making the V-1's gyroscopes and the large, recently discovered V-1 storage depots in France.21 The bombing of factories in Germany would serve Spaatz'
