He offered to bomb the German facto- ries making the V-1's gyroscopes and the large, recently discovered V-1 storage depots in France.21 The bombing of factories in Germany would serve Spaatz's twofold purpose of halting the V-1 attacks and of luring the Luftwaffe into the sky. On June 29, he hand-carried a letter to Eisenhower expressing his views on the main tasks facing USSTAF. In it he pointed out that the defeat of the Luftwaffe had taken place over Germany and not the occupied countries: "I con- sider the primary tasks of the Strategic Air Forces now to be the denial to the German ground. . . of the means with which to effectively continue resistance and the continuation of the neutralization of the German Air Force."

The V-2 was a supersonic rocket whose advent the Allies feared perhaps even more than that of the V-1. No defense, save the destruction of its takeoff platform, could work against the swift, powerful V-2. Spaatz did not believe that operations against V-1 firing sites could be suffi- ciently decisive on any one day to justify diverting the strategic air forces from their primary tasks on the few days of favorable weather over Germany. As for the use of heavy bombers in support of the ground forces, Spaatz noted, “In the absence of a major ground force emergency, I do not believe that the results from the tactical use of heavy bombers will constitute as much support to OVERLORD as the use of the same force against cri
