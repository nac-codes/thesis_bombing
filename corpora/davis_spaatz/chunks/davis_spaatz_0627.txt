ceived an allocation of targets giving the Eighth Air Force sixty-eight CROSSBOW targets as compared to thirty for Bomber Command and only six for the AEAF, he strongly protested to Eisenhower, "If we are to con- sider all these targets as a high priority obligation, the implementation of our strategic bombing plans will be seriously hindered."26 At the forefront of Spaatz's objections lay the realization that long summer days provided unparalleled oppor- tunities for his own forces but denied opportunities to Bomber Command, which could not penetrate deeply into Germany during the short summer nights in north- ern Europe. A short winter's day later could not replace a long sunlit summer's day, which gave the U.S. bomber formations license to penetrate as deeply as pos- sible into German-occupied Europe. Spaatz pointed out to Eisenhower: 430   ## p. 431 (#455) ############################################  STRATEGIC OPERATIONS  ZA Germans preparing to launch a V-1 flying bomb across the English Channel. It must be borne in mind that the U.S. Strategic Air Force is the only force presently in a position to make deep penetrations in strength beyond the Ruhr and therefore must be responsible for the largest share of the strategic task of denying to the enemy the means with which to effectively continue resistance.27 Spaatz also noted that CROSSBOW would interfere with USSTAF's tactical target assignments (bridges, POL [petroleum, oil, and lubricants] dumps, and airfields). Because of the "present restricted operational capabilities" of Bomber Command and the limited range of the tactical air force, he recommended that they be directed to maintain a fixed percentage of their force for CROSSBOW. For his part, he promised to put in a strong effort against the V-2 launch sites when he could not fly over Germany. "Such an arrangement," he stated, "should insure adequate effort against the CROSSBOW installations and... will not force one command to carry a greater burden than
