when he could not fly over Germany. "Such an arrangement," he stated, "should insure adequate effort against the CROSSBOW installations and... will not force one command to carry a greater burden than another to the detriment of the other priority tasks and the war effort as a whole."28 On the same day Spaatz discussed the CROSSBOW situation with Tedder. They agreed that current crazy-quilt air command arrangements interfered with the coordination of the CROSSBOW campaign. Spaatz used this chance to empha- size the need to continue operations over Germany in order to shorten the war and to continue the destruction of the German fighter force. He hoped to strain the Luftwaffe's depleted daylight fighter force to such an extent that its crack night fighter force would have to join daylight battles.

From July and August until Allied ground troops overran the sites around September 1, Bomber Command, USSTAF, and the AEAF rained bombs on the entire identified V-weapon target systemâ€”from the German experimental rocket research station at Peenemunde on the Baltic, through the manufacturing plants at Russelshiem and Ober Raderach, through the power stations and elec- trical switching sites in France, to the storag
