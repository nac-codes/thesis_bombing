The campaign lasted seventy-seven days. In just two months-July and August-the Allied air forces expended 16,566 sorties and one-fourth of their total tonnage on CROSSBOW targets,33 all, however, to little avail. The AAF offi- cial history admits that the rate of V-1 firings continued "essentially unhin- dered,"34 and concludes, "The CROSSBOW campaign of the summer of 1944 must be regarded generally as having failed to achieve its objectives. Indeed it seems to have been the least successful part of the over-all effort."35 Reprisal Bombing and THUNDERCLAP The ineffectiveness of CROSSBOW raised the specter of another diversion of the strategic bombing effort. The failure of the rate of V-1 firings to drop by early July 1944, which was apparent to residents of London, led to demands for the diversion of the strategic air forces to retaliation or counterterror raids over Germany. These demands were behind Air Chief Marshal Harris's request to schedule Bomber Command with the Eighth on a daylight mission over Berlin on June 21, 1944. Portal informed Churchill that he, Spaatz, Tedder, and Eisenhower favored the operation. More than 2,000 bombers, including 700 from Bomber Command, would drop 6,500 tons of bombs. "At the lowest," said Portal, â€œit will be a pretty good answer to the results achieved in the last few days by the 'flying bomb'."36 Operational considerations, such as the effective- ness of the German night fighter force and the lack of night-time flying hours (at the time of the summer solstice in European latitudes), also influenced Harris's decision to participate in a daylight raid. However, at 1:00 A.M. on June 21, Harris, with Tedder's concurrence,37 scrubbed the mission. Base weather did not look favorable. Harris
