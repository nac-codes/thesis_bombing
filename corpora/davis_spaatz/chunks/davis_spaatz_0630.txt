nfluenced Harris's decision to participate in a daylight raid. However, at 1:00 A.M. on June 21, Harris, with Tedder's concurrence,37 scrubbed the mission. Base weather did not look favorable. Harris did not approve of Doolittle's decision to send only half of his bomber force over the main target area, which increased the risk of flak to the low-flying RAF. He also had misgivings because mission plans revealed that the number of escorts sup- 432   ## p. 433 (#457) ############################################  STRATEGIC OPERATIONS plied the British might drop from 300 to 150 or less.38 This decision was greeted with relief by Spaatz and Doolittle, who no longer had to stretch their escort fighters to cover the bomber formations of both air forces.39 The Eighth sent 1,000 bombers to the Berlin area: 368 B-24s bombed targets in the vicinity of the city, and 560 B-17s, using visual bombing techniques, released 1,371 tons of bombs, 20 percent of them incendiaries, on the military and civilian government area in the center of the city. This was the ninth release since March 6 by the Eighth of 750 or more tons on the heart of the city.40 The idea of reprisal raids for the V-1, once started, gained a life of its own.

The authors of this plan, however, did not wish the attack to be tarred with the brush of terror bombing. They sug- gested striking utilities, transportation networks, government buildings, or minor industries.41 Churchill raised the subject of reprisal raids at his Chiefs of Staff meeting on July 1, suggesting that the British announce their intention to flatten lesser German cities in turn if V-1 attacks c
