1 Churchill raised the subject of reprisal raids at his Chiefs of Staff meeting on July 1, suggesting that the British announce their intention to flatten lesser German cities in turn if V-1 attacks continued. The British Chiefs agreed to postpone action to allow for a thorough study. In the meantime, Churchill took up the policy with Bedell Smith, who approved it, and Tedder, who considered it ineffective and "wickedly uneconomical."42 At the British Chiefs of Staff meet- ing on July 3, Portal spoke against retaliatory bombing, warning that it gave "invaluable proof" to the Germans that their V-1 policy had succeeded and amounted to entering into negotiations with the enemy. The Germans would not alter their plans for the sake of unimportant towns, and such bombing would divert resources from more important communications and oil targets. The other Chiefs agreed to further study.43 At his War Cabinet meeting that evening Churchill ordered his Chiefs to take up the matter the next day. Portal presented further arguments against the idea. Fearing that the Germans might resort to counter measures, such as mur- dering downed air crews from British reprisal raids, he recommended adding V-1 attacks to the list of war crimes for which the Nazis would be held accountable after the war. "We could not hope to keep pace with the Germans in a campaign of reprisals," he concluded. The British Chiefs agreed to prepare a report on all aspects of retaliatory bombing, including the use of poison gas.44 The report, prepared by the Air Staff and the Ministry of Economic Warfare, took twenty- four hours and reflected Portal's views. "No threat," he reasoned, â€œis likely to deter Hitler in his present fix. Indeed it may well encourage him to order more F.B.'s [flying bombs] and make still further efforts to increase the scale of attack." A threat to bomb the towns (1) implied a guarantee not to bomb them if Hitler stopped his V-1 campaign and (2) opened the door to the Germans on 433
