High Command, the army, and the civilian population. Because of its importance as a center of population, industry, com- munications, and administration, Berlin was selected as the target of the commit- tee's campaign. The results of such bombingâ€”the disruption of governmental services and communications at a critical juncture, as well as the demoralization of minor civil servants-would lead to an overall breakdown of public morale. Berlin had the operational advantage of being free of weather restrictions (its size made it easy to locate on radar scopes), and it could be attacked on short notice because both air forces knew the route to and the defenses of the city. The committee proposed to deliver 20,000 tons of bombs in a four-day and three- night round-the-clock blitz of the administrative center of Berlin.48 According to the British, Spaatz was in "general agreement" with the recommendations, but preferred "that no reference should be made in it to the concurrence of his unof- ficial representative at the meeting which discussed it."49 Spaatz's reasons for withholding "official" concurrence were not clear. Apparently, the plan's focus on population bombing troubled him. On July 21, after receiving advance notice of the morale committee's report, he discussed the issue with Eisenhower, who stated, "We will continue precision bombing and not be deflected to morale bombing."50 Yet on the same day, Spaatz's Deputy for Operations, Maj. Gen. Frederick L. Anderson, issued a USSTAF policy direc- tive to both the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces. Noting Spaatz's oft reiterated and continuing intention to bomb precision targets, Anderson categorically denied any intention to area-bomb. But having denied the intention, Anderson proceeded to authorize the practice: "We will conduct bombing attacks through 434   ## p. 435 (#459) ############################################  STRATEGIC OPERATIONS the overcast where it is impossible to get precision targets.
