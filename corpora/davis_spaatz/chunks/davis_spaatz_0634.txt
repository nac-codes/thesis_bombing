Such attacks will include German marshalling yards whether or not they are located in German cities."51 As Anderson and Spaatz well knew, bombs dropped on targets in cities using overcast bombing techniques would cause great collateral damage. Apparently, it was acceptable to attack German civilians if they lived in cities. with military targets, but not acceptable to make German civilians targets in and of themselves. In fact, thanks to four missions against Munich, which bombed through overcast and carried large percentages of incendiaries, Eighth Air Force records showed a wartime high for tonnage dropped on "towns & cities" of 9,886 tons in July 1944.52 Anderson and others in USSTAF did not regard this policy as hypocritical. They knew they had not aimed these raids at civilians, but rather at military targets. They judged themselves by their motives rather than their results. The committee's final draft, submitted to the British Chiefs of Staff on August 3, placed even greater emphasis on population bombing and gave the plan of attack on German civilian morale a code name-THUNDERCLAP.53 The operational details called for 2,000 Eighth Air Force bombers to drop 5,000 tons, under visual conditions, on a 2½ square-mile area of central Berlin, esti- mated to contain a daytime population of 375,000. A bomb density of 2,000 tons per square mile would produce approximately 137,500 dead and 137,500 seri- ously injured. If necessary, the Fifteenth Air Force could participate, and Bomber Command could follow up with a night incendiary raid.54 The plan continued to percolate through the AAF and RAF staffs. Kuter ques- tioned it, writing to Anderson, “Since any such attack will feature U.S.A.A.F. units in the limelight, we should consider whether the recent buzz bomb attacks have not instilled
