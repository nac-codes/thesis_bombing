It listed four lines of action whose accomplishment would fulfill the air mission in Europe, including "undermining of German morale by air attack of civil concentrations." In discussing that action AWPD/1 stated: Timeliness of attack is most important in the conduct of air operations directly against civil morale.

However, if these con- ditions do not exist, then area bombing of cities may actually stiffen the resistance of the population, espec
