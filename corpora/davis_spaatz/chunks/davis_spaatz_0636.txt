and sus- tained bombing of cities may crash that morale entirely. However, if these con- ditions do not exist, then area bombing of cities may actually stiffen the resistance of the population, especially if the attacks are weak and sporadic.. It is believed that the entire bombing effort might be applied to this purpose when it becomes apparent that the proper psychological conditions exist. In one of its annexes AWPD/1 spoke of Berlin's role in the anticipated air war. Immediately after strategic bombing had heavily and visibly damaged its economic targets, "or immediately after some major set-back of the German ground forces, it may become highly profitable to deliver a large scale all-out attack on the civil population of Berlin. In this event any or all of the bombard- ment forces may be diverted for this mission."55 Spaatz, as Chief of the AAF Staff, Arnold, as Commanding General of the AAF, Army Chief of Staff Marshall, Secretary of War Stimson, and President Roosevelt had all endorsed AWPD/1 before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Kuter and Spaatz may have objected less to the concept of a campaign or mis- sion against morale then to the timing of THUNDERCLAP. In any case, like any good staff officer, Kuter began to prepare a contingency plan for the remote possibility that the AAF, "even though we are strongly opposed at this time to such methods," might participate in such an operation. Kuter selected a dozen smaller cities, "ancient, compact, historic, wide-spread and of as much industrial importance as possible." The AAF would warn the cities that one of them would be destroyed (to cause panic in all twelve) and finally all forces would deliver a concentrated attack on the selected city.56 Arnold may never have seen this plan, but he objected strongly when the British proposal to attack civilian morale reached his desk. He preferred not to direct the attack solely at Berlin or the German people. He suggested a six-day-long series of sweeps by all av
