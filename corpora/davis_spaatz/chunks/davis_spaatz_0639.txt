He noted that although he had always insisted that USSTAF bomb precision targets he was "always prepared to take part in anything that gives real promise to ending the war quickly." Eisenhower promised Spaatz, "The policies under which you are now operating will be unchanged unless in my opinion an opportunity arises where a sudden and devastating blow may have an incalculable result."66 Spaatz expressed stronger views to Arnold, who, unlike Eisenhower, did not require his subordinates to eschew inter-Allied bickering: I have been subjected to some pressure on the part of the Air Ministry to join hands with them in morale bombing.
