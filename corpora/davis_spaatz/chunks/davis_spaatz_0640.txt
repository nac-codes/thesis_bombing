Only the last-gasp Operation MARKET- GARDEN paratroop drop in Holland, scheduled for mid-September, seemed to offer hope of a quick breakthrough. Had the paratroopers succeeded in establish- ing a bridgehead over the Rhine, the moment for launching THUNDERCLAP might have arrived. Instead, MARKET-GARDEN proved a costly failure. Ironically, the British and the Americans may have missed their opportunity. One can only speculate on the results of an antimorale raid coming on the heels of the July 20 assassination attempt on Hitler. For a brief instant before Hitler savagely and sadistically retaliated against the plotters, confusion reigned. If nothing else, a raid at that time would have further roiled an already boiling pot. The Allied breakout from the Normandy beachhead, which would have occurred at approximately the same time, might have added the final push. Talk of THUNDERCLAP subsided with the establishment of a stalemate on the Western Front in September 1944 but would be resurrected under a different set of cir- cumstances four months later. THUNDERCLAP and its planning illustrated how confident air power leaders still were in the bomber fleet as an effective striking force. In the period between the two world wars, Western air power experts and general public alike sub- scribed to the view that a massive strategic bombing attack, delivered in a sud- den stroke at the beginning of hostilities, might quickly end a war between major powers. This so-called bolt from the blue was intended to totally disrupt daily life and inflict such horrific casualties on civilians as to compel the recipient power to capitulate. Yet, long after Chinese, British, and, especially, German civilians had demonstrated a
