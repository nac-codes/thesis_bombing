upt daily life and inflict such horrific casualties on civilians as to compel the recipient power to capitulate. Yet, long after Chinese, British, and, especially, German civilians had demonstrated a capacity to withstand the heaviest of aerial bombardments, Allied air planners still seriously proposed a back-breaking, seventy-two-hour operation of THUNDERCLAP's magnitude. The estimated casualty figures were more akin to those predicted in 1935 by the RAF Air Staff-150,000 casualties in the first week of the bombing of London69—than those to be expected in 1944. Even the opera- tion's code name evoked the image of the prewar bolt-from-the-blue mentality. 438   ## p. 439 (#463) ############################################  STRATEGIC OPERATIONS Strategic Bombing in the Summer of 1944 Following the successful breakthrough at St. Lô, described later in Chapter 13, the Allies advanced spectacularly through France.

A week later an armored reconnais- sance squadron crossed the 1939 German border. By that time, however, the Allied armies had literally run out of gas as they forged ahead of their supply lines. This enforced halt at the German border, combined with the frantic but successful effort of the Wehrmacht to cobble together a solid defensive line, turned a war of movement back into a war of position. Once the ground forces established themselves on the Continent, Spaatz hoped to return his command to what he considered its primary task-the strate- gic bombardment of Germany. In June 1944, the Eighth Air Force conducted only four missions over German industrial targets. On June 18 and 20, it at- tacked oil targets, losing 50 heavy bombers and writing off 4 more. On June 21, the Eighth lost an additional 45 heavy bombers in a raid on the center of Berlin. On June 29, Doolittle's bombers again attacked oil targets. Neverthele
