avy bombers and writing off 4 more. On June 21, the Eighth lost an additional 45 heavy bombers in a raid on the center of Berlin. On June 29, Doolittle's bombers again attacked oil targets. Nevertheless, of the 320 heavy bombers lost by the Eighth in combat in June, at least 55 percent fell in action against CROSSBOW sites or in missions against airfields, bridges, and other tactical targets in France.70 For the first time, losses of heavy bombers to antiaircraft artillery exceeded those lost to Luftwaffe fighters.71 That fact indi- cated three features of June operations: the German transfer of hundreds of fighters to ground-support roles; the preponderant number of missions flown by the Eighth against tactical targets defended, if at all, solely by flak; and the increasing efficiency and number of expanded radar-directed German antiair- craft artillery batteries. In January 1944, flak had accounted for only 27 bomber losses;72 in June, the Eighth lost 2Â½ bombers (201) to flak for each one lost to enemy fighters (80). Each month from June 1944, in the case of the Eighth Air Force, and July, in the case of the Fifteenth, until the end of the war in May 1945, USSTAF lost more bombers to flak than to enemy fighters. From September 1944 to May 1945, the Eighth lost 511 bombers to fighters and 1,263 to flak.73 During the same period the Fifteenth lost 33 B-17s and B-24s to fighters and 681 to flak.74 The effectiveness of German antiaircraft stemmed, in part, from a reorgani- zation and vast expansion of the Reich's flak defenses ordered by Hitler in response to RAF raids in 1943.75 From August 1943 to June 1944, personnel devoted to the antiaircraft reorganization doubled, to 300,000, including 75,000 secondary school students, 45,000 Soviet POW volunteers, and 15,000 women.76 This increase in personnel enabled the Germans to field larger num- bers of heavier antiaircraft guns. These heavier 135mm weapons could place their shells far higher than 88mm antiaircraft guns.
