.76 This increase in personnel enabled the Germans to field larger num- bers of heavier antiaircraft guns. These heavier 135mm weapons could place their shells far higher than 88mm antiaircraft guns. Large-caliber weapons elimi- nated much of the relative immunity to flak that the higher flying B-17 had 439   ## p. 440 (#464) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE enjoyed over the B-24, whose optimal performance altitude was 3,000 to 5,000 feet lower. German countermeasures consumed vast quantities of manpower and mat√©riel sorely needed elsewhere. The thousands of high-velocity artillery pieces and the thousands of tons of ammunition they either consumed or kept idle in reserve would have greatly aided hard-pressed German defenders on the Eastern Front in their efforts to halt the Soviet advance. Because strategic bomb- ing raids were restricted by weather conditions and shifting priorities, German flak forces were spread thin to defend many areas. Yet, most defensive flak forces fought only a few days a month, further accentuating the drain they imposed on the Reich's economy with long periods of enforced idleness that tied up needed resources. Moreover, by October 1944 the Germans, unknown to the AAF, had devel- oped the ability to track the bombers carrying H2X radar. This ability greatly aided their range computations.77 Even such missions as the November 25, 1944, attack by the Eighth Air Force on the heavily defended Leuna oil plant, in which 766 bombers dropped their explosive cargoes through thick clouds and suffered 209 (27 percent) aircraft damaged by flak,78 did not alert the AAF to its new vulnerability. A visual attack on October 7 by 142 B-17s of the 1st Bom- bardment Division on another oil target, Politz, near Stettin, left only 19 unscathed and lost 17, with 30 heavily damaged and 76 slightly damaged. The lead ships, equipped with H2X, suffered particularly heavy damage.79 All this, however, lay in the future.
