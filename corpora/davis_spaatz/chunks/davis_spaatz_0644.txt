tin, left only 19 unscathed and lost 17, with 30 heavily damaged and 76 slightly damaged. The lead ships, equipped with H2X, suffered particularly heavy damage.79 All this, however, lay in the future. At the end of June 1944, Spaatz still pressed to have his planes released for missions over Germany. In July, after Spaatz gained Eisenhower's agreement that the days offering visual conditions over Germany ought to be used for bombing,80 the Eighth sent missions into Germany twelve times. So quickly did the weather change over central Europe that one-half of those missions employed H2X radar bombing over the target. Four of the missions struck oil targets, while the others attacked aircraft production, ball-bearing plants, and the experimental rocket station at Peenemunde.81 Of the 352 bombers lost by the Eighth in July, strategic missions accounted for at least 212 lost and 35 written off,82 70 percent of the month's losses. The Fifteenth sent out fifteen strategic missions, thirteen of them directed all or in part against Axis oil targets. It lost 196 heavy bombers in June and 317 more in July, the costliest month in its history. The Fifteenth's losses reflected how effectively antiaircraft artillery defenses were being employed by the Germans at Ploesti and other oil targets. Given the difference in aircraft on hand between the Fifteenth (1,407 heavy bombers) and the Eighth (3,492 heavy bombers) in July 1944,83 Twining's forces suffered casualties at more than twice the rate of Doolittle's. The figures demonstrate the return of both air forces to the Combined Bomber Offensive. Despite such heavy casualties during their raids of June and July, efforts of the Eighth and Fifteenth further aggravated Germany's critically low oil supply. 440   ## p. 441 (#465) ############################################   4 A German holding an antiaircraft range finder in the field. 0   ## p. 442 (#466) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE ULTR
