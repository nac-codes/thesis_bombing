case. After observing that only the regaining of air superiority could combat Allied heavy bombers, he offered wildly inflated production figures for single- and twin-engine fighters, claiming production of Germans preparing to fire 88mm antiaircraft artillery.  442   ## p. 443 (#467) ############################################  STRATEGIC OPERATIONS 4,500 in July and predicted 6,500 to 7,000 a month by the end of the year. Those totals were more than double the actual production achieved. Provided man- power and oil stocks did not evaporate, Speer hoped to free Germany from the bomber threat and to increase production of oil.86 This intercept must have con- firmed Spaatz's resolve to continue the oil offensive and the counterair cam- paign. For USSTAF, August and the first part of September brought no change in routine. The Eighth attacked the CROSSBOW system; aided the ground forces by striking tactical targets; and (most important, from Spaatz's point of view) launched ten missions into Germany, seven of them strikes against portions of the oil industry.87 The Fifteenth Air Force flew thirteen strategic missions against Balkan and German oil targets.88 On August 24, the two air forces coor- dinated their efforts in combined raids on synthetic oil plants in Germany; on the same day, all oil production ceased at Ploesti, which the Soviets occupied a few days later. From April through August 1944, the Fifteenth expended 13,649 tons of bombs and lost 350 heavy bombers solely against Ploesti.89 A warning from the British Joint Intelligence Committee on August 7 had helped to spur Spaatz to maximum effort against oil. A vast program was being instituted by the Germans to repair the oil plants as rapidly as possible.90 Henceforth, the oil campaign became a race between the Allied bombers to destroy and German labor to repair. For the month of August, the Eighth lost 331 bombers in combat, more than 70 percent of them (238) to antiaircraft artillery. The Fifteenth, whos
