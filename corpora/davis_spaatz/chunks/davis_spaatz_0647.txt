Allied bombers to destroy and German labor to repair. For the month of August, the Eighth lost 331 bombers in combat, more than 70 percent of them (238) to antiaircraft artillery. The Fifteenth, whose total bomber force was less than half that of the Eighth, lost 254 heavy bombers, 112 of them to flak and 91 to enemy fighters.91 These oil attacks as had those in July reduced Speer to a state of frustration. He recalled, "Again and again I had explained to him [Hitler] that it would be pointless to have tanks if we could not produce enough fuel." Speer added that, even as he attempted to cope with the oil bombings, "I was aghast at the incom- prehension of our leadership." He implored Hitler to reserve a significantly larger part of the fighter-plane production for the home front and "to give suffi- cient high priority to protecting the home hydrogenation plants by fighter planes so that in August and September at least partial production will be possible." At the end of July, Speer obtained from Hitler and Goering a promise to set aside a force of 2,000 fighter planes to be available by the first of September,92 and he secured authorization to have his subordinate, Edmund Geilenberg, placed in charge of restoring fuel production. Within two months Geilenberg had 150,000 workers, many of them slave laborers, assigned to rebuilding the synthetic plants. By late autumn he had 350,000 workers, many diverted from essential armaments production, assigned to restoring oil production.93 This diversion, together with the huge antiaircraft organization, created another drain on the German war effort directly attributable to strategic bombing. None of Speer's and Geilenberg's efforts could prevent a serious decline in Germany's oil situation.
