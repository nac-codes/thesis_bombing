Imported oil had fallen to 11,000 tons, a mere 10.6 percent of April's figures. ULTRA described fuel shortages cutting into the Luftwaffe's operations on the Eastern Front. On August 10, air units withdrawing from France were ordered to evacuate fuel stocks down to the "last drop." Five days later, the Luftwaffe's high command ordered Luftflotte 3 (or the 3d air fleet) in France to curtail operations in order to release fuel for training 120 crews per month for the west or to accept a lower training fuel allocation sufficient for 40 crews per month.94 From all sources the Germans garnered 345,000 tons of finished oil products, 42.6 percent of April's total.95 This decline was attributable solely to USSTAF's oil bombing cam- paign. Attacks on the hydrogenation plants disrupted other parts of the German chemical industry. These plants produced methanol and nitrogen, key compo- nents in synthetic rubber and explosives. The Germans had no natural source for either substance and could not easily substitute for them. Speer morosely recorded, "From October 1944 on, our explosives consisted of 20 percent rock salt, which reduced their effectiveness correspondingly."
