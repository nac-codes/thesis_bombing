h reduced their effectiveness correspondingly." Problems of the American Strategic Air Forces During the summer of 1944, Spaatz did not spend all of his time attending Air Commanders' Meetings or justifying the need for strategic bombing of Germany. He spent much of his time and effort in somewhat more mundane administrative concerns. Personnel considerations topped the list. Although a complete study of the Eighth Air Force's personnel difficulties would fill a large volume, Spaatz expended considerable energy on three interrelated problems: crew morale, crew replacements, and internment of crews in foreign countries. As the AAF official history admits, "Low morale among air crews, particu- larly in the Eighth Air Force, was a nagging problem during the middle of 1944."97 The ground crews, who maintained, serviced, and repaired aircraft, also suffered from poor morale brought about by an entirely different set of circum- stances. Aside from matters that soldiers have grumbled about since the profes- sion of arms began, such as food, boredom, and the general incomprehensibility of most actions or decisions by the powers that be, AAF ground and air crews in Europe fought two different types of wars. The ground crews did not rotate back to the United States after a set period; they stayed with their units throughout the war. Added to the certainty of no home leave-although leave spent in England was not unpleasant were primitive working conditions and long hours. Britain was as civilized and developed a country as any in which the AAF worked in 1944. Even so, the Eighth's bomber and fighter fields, for the most part, offered few hangars and covered working spaces. In periods of heavy oper- ations in wintertime, the ground crews, who worked during the night and in the early morning, suffered greatly from the cold and damp.
