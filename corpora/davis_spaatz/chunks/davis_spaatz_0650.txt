During the summer, the ground crews had to work harder and harder in response to dramatically increasing numbers of missions. Of course, they did not risk their lives or suffer to the same extent as those in the infantry or on the front lines. However, they were exposed to the rigors of the flight line, where boring and dangerous conditions steadily took their toll. As Eaker noted to Arnold in a sum- mary of operations, dated June 1, "Those [ground crews] who have been in the theater approaching two years are definitely weary and not as keen as they were and their work falls off."98 The air crews fought a private war, the horizons of which extended little beyond themselves or their planes. Throughout the summer the Eighth Air Force's percentage of aircraft lost per sortie rate declined. The rate dropped from 3.6 percent in April to 2.2 percent in May, 1.1 in June, when the Eighth flew only four strategic missions, and 1.5 percent in both July and August. The lower loss rates greatly increased an air crew's chances of completing its tour of duty. Unfortunately, the apprehension level of the crews did not decline. Many still seemed to react as they had when loss rates were higher. The lengthening of the combat tour in February 1944 from twenty-five to thirty missions dealt a blow to everyone's morale. Even at 1.5 percent loss per sortie for thirty missions, a crew member stood a 36 percent chance of not surviving. With the summer came increased numbers of missions and the opportunity for some crews to finish their required tour of thirty missions in as little as sixty-two days.99 The Eighth retained some crews for more than thirty missions. On July 1, for example, 117 crews, almost 4 percent of the crews on hand,
