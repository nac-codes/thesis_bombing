quired tour of thirty missions in as little as sixty-two days.99 The Eighth retained some crews for more than thirty missions. On July 1, for example, 117 crews, almost 4 percent of the crews on hand, had thirty missions.100 Eighth Air Force reports identified the causes of poor morale as the lack of understanding of the difficulties of combat crews by their superior officers, inadequate fighter escort on some missions, the seemingly elastic limit on combat tours, and too frequent missions.101 The air crew rotation policy instituted by Spaatz and Doolittle in the spring of 1944 dampened spirits further. Before its imposition, air crews completing their combat tours returned to the United States. and, in practice, flew no more combat missions. However, heavy losses compelled Spaatz and Doolittle to dis- continue the permanent release of at least some trained crews that had finished their initial tours. They were obliged to return to Europe for another tour of duty after a month's furlough of rest and recreation in the United States. They as well as crews already into their first tour who could easily picture themselves in the same situation naturally felt aggrieved. Arnold, apparently, wished to halt any furloughs. The low morale of the crews returning to the United States was obvi- ous and did nothing for the AAF's public image. The ideal solution to the prob- lem-lack of trained manpower-would have been a replacement pipeline full of crews-a goal the AAF never managed to achieve. In fact, at least as seen from AAF Headquarters in Washington, USSTAF's furlough scheme threatened to upset the carefully crafted training program for 446   ## p. 447 (#471) ############################################  STRATEGIC OPERATIONS  Eighth Air Force ground crews servicing a P-38.
