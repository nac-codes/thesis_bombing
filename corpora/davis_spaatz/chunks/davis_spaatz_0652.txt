Giles, Deputy Commanding General, AAF, and Chief of the AAF Staff, informed Spaatz that "General Arnold had contended successfully that every crew going to the wars is entitled to an even chance at surviving its tour. . . it has . . . been necessary that we train two crews for every one you lose."102 Once Spaatz's forces achieved their goal of two crews per heavy bomber, the replacement and force build-up flow would of necessity slow. The two-crew-per-bomber policy had become the foundation of AAF crew training. From his office in the Pentagon, where he poured over the figures detailing the ebb and flow of personnel through training, Giles attempted to con- vey to Spaatz the importance that AAF Headquarters had attached to continuing a proven system. He noted that Spaatz's retention of crews in Europe threatened to cause backlogs and delays throughout the replacement pipeline and that Any change in what is now a smooth machine would not be good. As you can see, a major leave and furlough policy in our four largest air forces would force a considerable change and a downward revision in our crew training which might not be smart until we see the final victory more immediately ahead than we now see it.

But he also wished to retain the right to return, temporarily, for rest and recuperation certain key personnel such
