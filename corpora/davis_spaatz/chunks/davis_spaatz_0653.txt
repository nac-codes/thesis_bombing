the date the Eighth would reach its authorized strength of two crews per aircraft. But he also wished to retain the right to return, temporarily, for rest and recuperation certain key personnel such as group and squadron commanders, lead pilots, bombardiers, and navigators.104 The Eighth reached its goal of double crews in July. The Fifteenth, which had a higher casualty rate, had only one and one-half crews per plane on July 31,105 The number of Eighth Air Force crews interned as a result of crashing or landing in neutral countries jumped from eighteen in May to thirty-eight in June and forty-one in July.106 Although these crews and planes amounted to only a tiny fraction of the totals sent out, Arnold received the statistics with alarm, especially after he read reports of interviews with interned crews conducted by U.S. diplomatic personnel. The 2d Bombardment Division seemed particularly prone to this problem, in part because the B-24's longer range, as compared with the B-17's, allowed it to fly deeper penetration missions. On deep missions a crew in a damaged plane might be more likely to land in neutral territory than to chance a long, dangerous return trip to Britain. In June, three-quarters of the crews interned belonged to the 2d Bombardment Division (28 of 38); in July about 40 percent of interned crews belonged to the 2d Division (15 of 41). During the June 20 raid on Politz, an oil target in Poland, conducted by 358 2d Division B-24s, an eye-popping 20 bombers landed in Sweden. The next day, the fourth in a row in which the Eighth launched more than 1,100 bombers, 14 more bombers (7 from the 2d Division) on missions to the Berlin area landed in Sweden. 107 In mid-July, Spaatz suggested to Arnold that battle-experienced, intelligent, senior USSTAF air officers join the diplomatic representatives in Sweden and Switzerland to interview the crews and to evaluate and investigate the reasons for their landings from a more professional perspective. 108 On July
