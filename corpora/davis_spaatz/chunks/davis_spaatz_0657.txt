to Arnold that morale, after a drop-off in July,117 had recently improved considerably. "Not only were the airmen confident of their airplanes, their methods, and themselves, but they felt sure they were doing more to win the war than either the ground forces or the RAF." Wilson's infor- mal investigation, plus other investigations conducted on Arnold's behalf, and the findings of specially detailed USSTAF officers who interviewed the interned crews convinced Arnold and Spaatz that the morale problem had been greatly exaggerated. 118 The advance of the ground forces to the western borders of Germany virtu- ally ended the internment controversy. Once crews could land safely in France, instead of farther away in England, the attractiveness of Sweden and Switzerland  Lt. Gen. Carl A.

Later, in the winter of 1944-1945, the Soviet advance to the eastern borders of Germany allowed crews whose planes were damaged in deep mis- sions to Berlin and beyond to land in Soviet-occupied territory instead of Sweden. Of all the bombing by USSTAF during the summer of 1944, only the strate- gic bombing of oil, with its side effects on the German chemical industry, has- tened eventual Allied victory. CROSSBOW bombing did little more than crater the Pas-de-Calais district. Nor would morale bombing, given the blows subse- quently withstood by the German populace, have furthered the Allied cause effectively. For Spaatz and the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe, the summer of 1944 represented a season-long fight to prevent the weakening of the strategic bomber offensive with the diversion of the heavy-bomber effort to other important, but less crucial, tasks. Spaatz succeeded, by and large, in fending off all but the most necessary distractions from the main strategic effort. After establishing the dra- matic potential
