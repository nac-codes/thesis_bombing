r important, but less crucial, tasks. Spaatz succeeded, by and large, in fending off all but the most necessary distractions from the main strategic effort. After establishing the dra- matic potential of the oil plan in the May 1944 raids, he managed to pry out of Eisenhower enough freedom of action to continue and steadily increase in scale the assault on the life's blood of the German military machine. Finally, Spaatz showed once again his flexibility and common sense by, on the one hand, reject- ing such extreme air power proposals as terror-bombing and, on the other, send- ing his heavy bombers into direct support of ground troops (discussed in the next chapter), an action not contemplated by prewar bombing enthusiasts. 451   ## p. 452 (#476) ############################################    ## p. 453 (#477) ############################################  Chapter 13 Summer 1944: Heavy Bombers in Close Air Support (July-August 1944) Technically viewed, the bombing was good.' -AAF official history on COBRA, 1951. Though the results were not what we expected, it never occurred to us that we could fail after the use of such mass aircraft.2 -After-action questionnaire of U.S. 9th Infantry Division on results of COBRA, 1944 In July and August 1944, the Allied strategic bombers departed from their customary tasks of attacking vital military or political targets and engaging in counterair and interdiction campaigns to directly assist the Allied ground forces on the battlefield. The Allied ground forces, bogged down in the excellent defensive terrain of Normandy, required heavy-bomber assaults in addition to those planned for D-day. This foray into large-scale close air support presented unique and unanticipated command, control, and technical problems to the Eighth Air Force and Bomber Command as they sought to fulfill obligations for which they lacked methods and training. These close air support missions were, of course, diversions from the strategic effort. Not all Allie
