d Bomber Command as they sought to fulfill obligations for which they lacked methods and training. These close air support missions were, of course, diversions from the strategic effort. Not all Allied airmen agreed with the necessity of heavy bombers in close air support. Tedder, for instance, believed that Leigh-Mallory had oversold the army on the need for air support. But Spaatz, although he might have preferred to attack targets in Germany, 453   ## p. 454 (#478) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE assented, without coercion by Eisenhower or Tedder, to all requests to aid the ground forces. The complex interplay between the command and control of the bombers, the technical difficulties associated with heavy-bomber strikes close to friendly troops, and the effects of conflicts among air leaders on the entire equa- tion are the themes of this chapter. Initial Attempts at Ground Support Although the Allied air forces had cut the Luftwaffe at the front to bits, the Allied ground forces, under the overall command of Gen. Montgomery's 21 Army Group, encountered stiff resistance. The Germans kept the Allies on their relatively cramped beachhead. On the Allied left flank, the British 2d Army could not take the city of Caen or break into the clear area beyond the River Orne. On the Allied right the U.S. First Army, under Lt. Gen. Omar N. Bradley, found itself enmeshed in the bocage, or hedgerow country. Hedgerows, earthen dikes four feet high covered with tangled vegetation, provided perfect static defensive positions that slowed the American advance to a crawl.3 From the air, however, the bocage appeared insignificant. Allied airmen found the failure of the ground forces to expand the beachhead rapidly in the face of determined enemy resistance frustrating. On June 14, at the Daily Air Commanders' Meeting at Stanmore, Air Marshal "Mary" Coningham announced that his own information on the situation at the front did not jibe wit
