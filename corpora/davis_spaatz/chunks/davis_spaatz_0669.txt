p against more or less since D-Day is the school of thought which takes the view that air support given to the Army should be the minimum rather than the maximum, on the principle that if you give the Army an inch it will take a mile. This school of thought urges as a principle that really heavy Air Forces should not be employed on the battlefront, but elsewhere beyond and outside it. I maintain, and have always, that heavy bombers can produce a concentration of high explosive infinitely greater than any which can be pro- duced by any other means.3 To prove his point, Leigh-Mallory arranged for Bomber Command and the Eighth to aid Montgomery's lunge forward on July 8. Tedder warned Leigh- Mallory "that he was in danger of leading the Army up the garden path by his sweeping assurances of help." Tedder was convinced that neither the army nor Leigh-Mallory fully understood the limitations of air support on the battlefield or the role of air power outside the battle area.38 During the night of July 7-8, Bomber Command dropped 6,000 half-ton bombs directly on northern Caen39 and on targets 6,000 yards beyond the British front lines, with negligible damage to the Germans. The raid devastated about 2'Â½ square miles, leaving practically contiguous craters, none of which measured less than 20 feet across, that blocked all the roads to Caen save one.40 The Eighth bombed bridges and tunnels beyond the German lines. The bombing, according to Zuckerman, who observed and prepared a detailed report on it soon 460   ## p. 461 (#485) ############################################  HEAVY BOMBERS IN SUPPORT after it occurred, did not result in any Allied casualties but neither did it demoral- ize or materially affect the Germans.41 Zuckerman concluded that a great deal of French property was unnecessarily destroyed, and he expressed some doubt as to whether the batteries and other strong points listed by the British 2d Army were even in the target area. He sug- gested, in future, bombin
