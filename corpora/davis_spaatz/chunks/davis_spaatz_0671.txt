If he does not like the situation, he will have to clear out." As for Tedder, if he objected, "then he or I will go. My mind is now fully made up. Either I am to be allowed to direct, if necessary, the whole air forces available to the full and immediate support of the Army or I shall resign on that issue."47 On July 11, Leigh-Mallory blithely went to see Portal and informed him of his intentions to restructure the air command in Normandy.

Portal sided with Tedder.49 The situation remained unresolved until after Operation GOODWOOD. On July 18, Bomber Command and the Eighth Air Force provided direct support for the next British assault.
