ombers were more accurate than the American heavy bombers. As illogical as it seemed, British night tactics pro- duced more precise bombing than American daylight tactics. The Americans flew compact formations in which only the lead bombardier made full use of his accurate Norden Visual Bombsight (M-9). This practice produced closely grouped bomb patterns and many missed targets. When several groups bombed a target, as they usually did, however, some of the bomb patterns landed directly where they should have. Because Bomber Command could not fly formations at night, each bombardier made all bombsight corrections. 462   ## p. 463 (#487) ############################################  HEAVY BOMBERS IN SUPPORT Moreover, whereas the Eighth used radar only in its lead planes, almost all British bombers carried radar and crews trained in more accurate radar bombing. In addition, by the summer of 1944, Bomber Command was employing a â€œmas- ter bomber" or airborne air controller who stayed over the target for an entire mission and adjusted the bombing as it occurred. For the last year of the war, Bomber Command, plane for plane, not only delivered more tonnage but deliv- ered it more effectively.52 Of course, if the British had had to fly their lightly armed bombers in formation, in daylight, without escort from their short-ranged Spitfires, the analysis of bomb plots might well have tilted toward the Americans. The failure of Montgomery's much ballyhooed attack led to a round of recriminations among top Allied leaders. The airmen, in particular, expressed keen disappointment. The normally unflappable Tedder began to agitate for Montgomery's dismissal and wrote to his old friend, Lord Trenchard, the founder of the RAF, that he and Eisenhower had been "had for suckers" by Montgomery.53 At a high-level SHAEF staff meeting on July 21, Tedder asked Bedell Smith when the army would get to the V-1 launch sites in the Pas-de- Calais region of France. When Bedell Smith replied it wou
