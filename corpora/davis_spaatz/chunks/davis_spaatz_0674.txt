ry.53 At a high-level SHAEF staff meeting on July 21, Tedder asked Bedell Smith when the army would get to the V-1 launch sites in the Pas-de- Calais region of France. When Bedell Smith replied it would not be soon, Tedder sarcastically remarked, "Then we must change our leaders for men who will get us there."54 Leigh-Mallory felt "bitterly disappointed, for it does not seem to me that the breakthrough which we produced has been exploited and pressed to a conclusion."55 Eisenhower fumed as well. He acidly noted that the air forces had dropped a thousand tons of bombs for each mile of Montgomery's advance and wondered whether the Allies could afford to move through all of France at such a cost.56 Operation COBRA of The Eighth's next and last ground support mission in July proved to be both its most effective and its most controversial, because some of its bombs dropped short of the intended target area, landed among American troops, killed over one hundred of them and wounded hundreds more. This mission, flown in support Lt. Gen. Omar N. Bradley's Operation COBRA, greatly assisted the ground forces in their attack, which eventually penetrated the German main line of resistance and produced the opportunity for the long-awaited Allied breakout from the Normandy beachhead. The plan for COBRA came almost solely from Bradley, who first expounded it, and his chief subordinate, who would execute it, Maj. Gen. J. Lawton "Lightning Joe" Collins, at that time Commander of the U.S. VII Army Corps. Bradley had decided on the plan's outline by July 10,57 and he presented it to his staff and to his corps commanders on July 12. COBRA differed from the usual pattern of American offensives.
