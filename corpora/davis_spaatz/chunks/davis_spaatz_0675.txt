As Russell F.

The senior German officers on the scene expected a breakthrough at any moment.59 Second, Bradley insisted that a heavy aerial bombardment immediately pre- cede the beginning of COBRA. From its inception, Bradley intended that the air bombardment include the use of heavy bombers. As Bradley described it, "Realizing the great power we had in our Air Force, I wanted to secure some- place where we could use a great mass of power to virtually wipe out some German division opposing part of our line and then punch a hole through." Bradley chose the straight stretch of road running from St. Lô through Périers to Lossay, having determined60 that it could support the large force he intended to deploy. The air bombardment, in Bradley's mind, offset the lack of artillery firepower available. He told his chief of artillery, Brig. Gen. Charles E.
