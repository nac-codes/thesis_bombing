, in Bradley's mind, offset the lack of artillery firepower available. He told his chief of artillery, Brig. Gen. Charles E. Hart, that if he had had ten times the number of guns, he might have dispensed with air support.61 Lack of artillery ammunition, at least as much as lack of artillery pieces, prevented an extensive gunfire bombardment. The Allied supply situation, restricted to what could come in over the original landing beaches, did not allow for a surfeit of shells. Bradley also wanted the "blast effect" of the bombs, which, with their thin metal casings, greatly exceeded the blast effect of artillery shells of similar weight.62 Because Bradley himself had originated the idea of employing heavy bombers, he had several preconceived notions about how they should be used. He required that the air bombardment fall into a rectangular area approximately 4 miles long and 134 miles deep, 7,000 yards by 2,500 yards.63 The area covered the entire front of his initial attack. He also required that only 100-pound frag- mentation bombs be dropped64 to prevent excessive cratering that would hamper the advance of the infantry and, more important, the mechanized forces. He planned to withdraw his troops 800 yards from the front line.65 A withdrawal of only 800 yards cut the safety margin exceedingly fine, but Bradley wished to avoid placing his troops too far away to follow up the attack without delay and letting the Germans reoccupy the conceded space, which would, in turn, force his men to fight through an enlarged defensive position. Bradley also wanted the 464   ## p. 465 (#489) ############################################  HEAVY BOMBERS IN SUPPORT air bombardment conducted rapidly; if it stretched out over several hours, it would lose its shock effect. Bradley recognized that the airmen would prefer to approach the target box at a right angle to the front, flying from north to south, first crossing over the American lines and then dropping their bombs on the Germans t
