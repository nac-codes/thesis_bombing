they found arrayed the full panoply of Allied air leadership-Tedder, Leigh- Mallory, and Spaatz-accompanied by Vandenberg, Brereton, Doolittle, Coningham, and lesser lights.70 In his memoirs Bradley glossed over the differ- ences between himself and the air chiefs. He baldly stated: Air's enthusiasm for COBRA almost exceeded that of our troops on the ground, for air welcomed the St. LÃ´ carpet attack as an unrivaled opportunity to test the feasibility of saturation bombing. Leigh-Mallory proposed a heavier concentra- tion of bombers than the Allies had ever before put into the air." Bradley left the meeting with a commitment for 1,500 heavy bombers, almost 900 medium bombers, and 350 fighter bombers.72 Bradley's description masked the serious differences he had had with the other airmen in attendance, who had initially insisted on a safety zone of 3,000 yards to separate his troops from the bombing. They agreed to reduce the safety zone to 1,500 yards, which still did not satisfy him. In the end he agreed to with- draw the troops only 1,200 yards. The heavy bombers, however, would not strike the front edge of the target box and would thereby add 250 yards to their 465   ## p. 466 (#490) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE  Maj.

Fighter-bombers would cover those 250 yards with their own more accurate and easily deliverable ordnance.73 Leigh-Mallory even attempted to gain the participation of Bomber Command, but Bradley and Vandenberg both vetoed his idea. Bomber Command was equipped to drop only large bombs whose craters might retard the advance.74 At the meeting, Quesada and Bradley insisted that the bombers fly parallel to the front,75 When some of the airmen present agreed with them, they appar- ently assumed that all of the airmen present agreed with them. In this they were mistaken. They had unknowingly run afoul of the air command
