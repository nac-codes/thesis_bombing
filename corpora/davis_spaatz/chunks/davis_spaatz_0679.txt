They had unknowingly run afoul of the air command system, which at that moment was suffering from tangled lines of authority and was riven with even greater personal animosity than usual. On the American side of the house several principals were involved in a game of musical chairs. Two days before the July 19 meeting Eisenhower and Spaatz had accepted Marshall's recommendation that Brereton vacate his post as Commander of the Ninth Air Force to assume command of Combined Airborne Headquarters, which consisted of all British and American airborne divisions in the theater (a force of three divisions), plus separate troops, the IX Troop Carrier Command, and RAF transport and troop carrier formations.

The Ninth's Deputy Commander, Maj. Gen. Ralph Royce (another member of Spaatz's West Point Class of 1914), would take over Vandenberg's old post as Deputy Commander in Chief, AEAF. Although the principals had learned of these moves, the War Department and Marshall had not yet approved them. This left most of the American tactical air high command in a state of flux. If his diary is a reliable guide, Vandenberg spent a considerable amount of time during this period stewing over the "Royce- Brereton-Vandenberg triangle."78 Quesada apparently continued, blissfully unaware of his superior's command changes until later. Brereton may well have been "kicked upstairs”—at least, Bradley thought so.79 He said of Brereton, "Ike knew Brereton was not pulling his weight. I had told Ike he was har
