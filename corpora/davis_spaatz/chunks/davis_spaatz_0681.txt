July 19, Tedder noted: Montgomery will not deal with Coningham, but only with L-M [Leigh- Mallory]. This entails Broadhurst, Coningham's subordinate, dealing direct with L-M.... L-M has even moved his own personal caravan... with Monty. L-M seems to be cashing in on the discomfiture of his own subordinate.82 This finished Leigh-Mallory as far as Tedder was concerned. In his postwar memoirs Tedder proceeded directly from the end of GOOD- WOOD to the air command situation. GOODWOOD's failure allowed him to squelch Leigh-Mallory's ambition to take a more active role. 467   ## p. 468 (#492) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE  Field Marshal Bernard L.

"I could not help feeling," wrote Tedder in
