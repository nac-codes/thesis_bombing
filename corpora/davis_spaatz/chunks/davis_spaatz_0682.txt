wished to move forward to direct the tactical battle at the expense of Coningham, then he, Tedder, would resume total direction of the strategic air forces. "I could not help feeling," wrote Tedder in 1966, "that Leigh-Mallory's large assurances to Montgomery encouraged the unhealthy tendency of the Army to rely on air-power for support of a kind which it could not confer."85 Bradley, and probably Quesada, could have had little idea of the quagmire into which they had stepped.

Bradley had, of course, heard the protests of Vandenberg and Brig. Gen. Orvil A.

He and the Air Chiefs had set the date for COBRA for the morning of July 21, less than thirty-six hours away.87 The Air Chiefs had also completed the air command arrangements for COBRA, a bizarre mishmash that excluded USSTAF and the Eighth Air Force from most command decisions and left the heavy bombers subject to the orders of men who understood little of the technical difficulties involved in their opera- tion. Tedder, who had approved the mission in the first place, would provide top-level supervision; Leigh-Mallory would set the time and date of the opera- tion; Brereton would plan the bomber attack; and
