. Tedder, who had approved the mission in the first place, would provide top-level supervision; Leigh-Mallory would set the time and date of the opera- tion; Brereton would plan the bomber attack; and Quesada would coordinate the air attack with the ground forces.88 Inclement weather forced the postponement of COBRA from July 21 to July 24. This postponement gave the Eighth the chance to send a 1,100-bomber raid against German aircraft production plants on July 21 and a 280-bomber attack on French airfields on July 23. On the evening of July 23, AEAF's meteorolo- gists predicted that the weather on the next day would be suitable for COBRA. USSTAF's weathermen had a different forecast. They predicted heavy to mod- erate clouds for July 24 and better conditions for July 25 in the St. Lô area. They foresaw good bombing weather over Berlin and central Germany on July 24. At 9:30 P.M. on July 23, Spaatz's Deputy for Operations, Maj. Gen. Frederick L. Anderson, called Leigh-Mallory for an immediate decision as to the target because the Eighth needed to know which bombs to load, 500-pound general- purpose bombs and incendiaries for Berlin or fragmentation bombs for St. Lô. Leigh-Mallory, relying on his own forecasts, set the starting time for COBRA's air bombardment at 10:00 A.M. On the morning of July 24, AEAF's meteorolo- gists revised their estimates and called for slowly breaking clouds from 11:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M. Therefore, at 6:30 A.M. Leigh-Mallory delayed the attack for two hours, rescheduling it for 12 noon.89 Despite the unease of their own Eighth Air Force weathermen, 1,586 B-17s and B-24s left their bases to participate in COBRA. Leigh-Mallory flew to Bradley's headquarters. Vandenberg and Smith flew forward as well. They saw little; except for a brief period when the clouds thinned somewhat, the skies stayed heavily overcast with a ceiling of only 5,000 feet. Leigh-Mallory had no choice but to call off the mission and reschedule it for the next day. 469   ##
