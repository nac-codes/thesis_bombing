the clouds thinned somewhat, the skies stayed heavily overcast with a ceiling of only 5,000 feet. Leigh-Mallory had no choice but to call off the mission and reschedule it for the next day. 469   ## p. 470 (#494) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Unfortunately, the timing of this decision-he waited until the last moment to cancel―revealed Leigh-Mallory's unfamiliarity with the handling of heavy bombers and reflected unfavorably on his ability to command such formations. The cancellation caused tragedy and confusion. Incredibly, the ground forces had no direct communications link to the bombers in the air. Quesada passed Leigh- Mallory's halt order back to Stanmore by radio-telephone, where its receipt pro- duced immediate consternation in the Daily Air Commanders' Meeting, which had convened, as usual, at 11:00 A.M. Tedder, Spaatz, Harris, Doolittle, and Eaker (who had come up from the Mediterranean for his and Spaatz's end-of- the-month meeting) were nonplussed. Doolittle said that the bombers were only seven minutes from their targets and could not be recalled now. He assumed that the planes would return fully loaded if they could not bomb visually. Spaatz wanted to know who had set the attack for noon, when the Eighth's weathermen had predicted solid overcast at that time, with a chance of some clearing only at 2:00 P.M. Bradley, he said, had indicated that he could wait until 3:00 P.M. for the bombing to start. "Why," asked Spaatz, "had the earlier time been selected?”90 No one present could answer him.

In the second bombardment division to pass, one group (35 bombers), after making three runs to identify its target, released its bombs. The third bombardment division to arrive over the target box found weather conditions slightly improved, and 317 bombers loosed their loads, 550 tons of high explosives and 135
