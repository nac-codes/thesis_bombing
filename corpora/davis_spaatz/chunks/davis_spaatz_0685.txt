et, released its bombs. The third bombardment division to arrive over the target box found weather conditions slightly improved, and 317 bombers loosed their loads, 550 tons of high explosives and 135 tons of fragmentation bombs, before finally receiving the recall order.91 All the heavy bombers had approached and bombed at a right angle, or perpendicular, to the front line. Some had dropped short, directly onto their own troops. They killed 25 men and wounded 131 more of the 30th Division. The performance enraged Bradley. Thanks to the confusion caused by bombing after the cancellation of the air phase of COBRA and some indecision as to whether the ground phase was also postponed, his troops had to fight hand-to- hand to regain the start line.92 The German LXXXIV Corps defending St. Lô optimistically (and prematurely) reported that it had shot the American offensive into the ground with a great expenditure of artillery ammunition.93 Bradley could scarcely believe that the bombers had not struck parallel to the front. At his command post he found Leigh-Mallory equally upset. “But what worries me more than anything else," Bradley told Leigh-Mallory, "is the fact that those heavies came in over our heads instead of parallel to the Périers road. I left Stanmore with a clear understanding that they would fly parallel to the road."94 Vandenberg and Brig. Gen. Frederic H. Smith, his deputy, attempted to explain to Bradley, Leigh-Mallory, and Quesada why the mission could not be carried out as planned-to little effect. Bradley did not even mention them in his memoirs, but Vandenberg noted sourly in his diary, "General Bradley gave the appearance of having very little idea as to the cloud conditions required for 470   ## p. 471 (#495) ############################################  HEAVY BOMBERS IN SUPPORT heavy bombardment, a situation we attempted to remedy."95 Before leaving Bradley's headquarters, Leigh-Mallory promised to check on the bombers' direction of attack.
