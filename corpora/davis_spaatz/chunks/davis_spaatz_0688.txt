nary opportu- nity beckoned if only Bradley's forces could go forward, and the blow could not be long delayed. A more ominous signal, which indicated that the Germans might have begun to realize their vulnerability to Bradley's forces in this section of the beachhead, dated late July 22, decrypted 8:18 A.M. July 23, from the German Seventh Army Luftwaffe liaison, urgently requested reconnaissance of powerful new U.S. forces with tanks (Patton's Third Army) opposite the 17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division.102 (See Map 14, Operation COBRA Area, Night of July 24-25, 1944.)
