lery. I gave them a green light this time. But I promise you it's the last."110 Bombs from between thirty-five and sixty heavy bombers and forty-two medium bombers fell within American lines,111 all as a result of human error.112 The bombers were working under what were for them unusual conditions. They had planned to bomb at 15,000 to 16,000 feet, but cloud cover over St. Lô forced them to recompute their sights while airborne and to bomb at 12,000 feet. In descending to the lower altitude, formations loosened up, as nervous pilots sought air space in congested areas over the target. Elongated bomb patterns resulted as the groups followed standard procedure and released their bombs when the lead plane dropped its bombs. On the ground, a prevailing wind from the south quickly dissipated the smoke from the marking shells fired by American artillery. This smoke soon mixed with the clouds from the attack and drifted back toward the American lines, masking any aiming points.113 The all- important St. Lô-Périers road, visible on the map, like much else in Normandy, proved less prominent from the air. Years later Quesada berated himself: 474   ## p. 475 (#499) ############################################  HEAVY BOMBERS IN SUPPORT  1 The shattered aftermath of Operation COBRA near St. Lô, France, July 26, 1944. Now, everybody made a mistake, including Pete Quesada, in thinking that the St. Lô road was a good and visible demarcation point that anybody could see, and it turned out not to be so. The St. Lô road was ... rather obscure . . . and I have always condemned myself. . . [for] not having flown over this road myself and looked at it.114 In fact, many bombardiers, well aware of the first day's tragedy, took great pains not to bomb short on the second day. One-half of the 1st Bombardment Division, approximately 150 to 200 bombers, delivered their loads beyond the target. Unfortunately, 2 to 4 percent of the bombers dropped short. One bom- bardier had trouble with his bom
