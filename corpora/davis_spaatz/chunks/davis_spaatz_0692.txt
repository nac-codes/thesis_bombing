t Bombardment Division, approximately 150 to 200 bombers, delivered their loads beyond the target. Unfortunately, 2 to 4 percent of the bombers dropped short. One bom- bardier had trouble with his bombsight and recomputed visually, with poor results; another failed to identify vital landmarks properly; and a command pilot failed to observe the order to drop by bomb group, ordering "bombs away" when his wing leader, several hundred yards ahead of the pilot's formation, dropped his bombs. 115 The next day Spaatz talked to Doolittle, Eisenhower, and Bradley. In sum- marizing the operation, Spaatz made four main points: 1. Short bombing, like short rounds from supporting artillery fire, was an unavoidable fact of life. 2. The mass of bombs dropped on St. LÃ´ had so demoralized the enemy that the demoralized U.S. troops had still succeeded in achieving a break- through. 475   ## p. 476 (#500) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE 3. Because of their striking power and potential for tremendous damage, masses of heavy bombers should not be routed over friendly troops. 4. All our bombing experience shows that lateral error is greater than range error. To achieve the foregoing, the Air Commander himself must determine what weight of effort can be placed in any area selected by the Army Com- mander and must have the power to decide whether or not an area can be attacked at all.116 Spaatz's problem with lateral dispersion, also known as drift, raised an issue seldom discussed in other analyses of COBRA. That was perhaps for two reasons: (1) either the strategic airmen had become so accustomed to analyzing bomb plots that they regarded it as a given and subconsciously assumed that everyone understood, or (2) the airmen believed it to be so technical that they could not possibly explain it to an outsider. In a perpendicular approach, if a plane released bombs at the proper time, its forward momentum would be imparted to its bombs and would
