ining bombardiers in the formation corrected for range only and released their bombs when they saw the lead plane release its bombs. Most of the bombardiers in a formation did not cor- rect for drift. This procedure was obviously not ideal for maximum bombing efficiency but had been adopted for safety's sake. By 1944 the bombardier was actually able to take over control of his aircraft from the pilot when he adjusted his sight 476   ## p. 477 (#501) ############################################  HEAVY BOMBERS IN SUPPORT and allowed the bombsight, through its electrical connection with the automatic pilot, to adjust course. In a formation, kept tight to maximize each aircraft's defensive power and the compactness of its bomb patterns, the danger of midair collision would have greatly increased had each bombadier maneuvered inde- pendently to correct his aim. Hence, only the formation's lead bombardier made the necessary corrections; the others conformed to his movements. 118 It was hardly likely that the Eighth could or would change this practice for a single mission with only a few days' notice. If timing and lateral dispersion problems necessitated a perpendicular approach, why, then, did Spaatz recommend parallel bombing for future support missions requiring heavy-bomber participation? He did so to avoid psychologi- cal damage to the assault troops. The day after the COBRA bombardment, Spaatz recorded in his Command Diary, If by any chance a gross error in the leading formations causes bombs to fall among our troops, the psychological effect of succeeding waves of bombing becomes terrific since, if one of our formations errs, in the minds of the soldiers on the ground the same error may be made by others, and their worry and anxi- ety builds up to tremendous proportion. 119 Lt.
