He visited immediately before and after combat opera- tions whenever possible.  477   ## p. 478 (#502) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Parallel bombing would reduce the number of planes passing over the troops. Spaatz also recommended selecting more aiming points to reduce the con- centration of planes and potential errors at a single point-a 1,500-yard safety margin simply did not suffice. Finally, Spaatz conceded to the ground comman- der, Bradley, the right to suggest the target area, but he reserved to the air com- mander the right to determine the weight of effort placed on any specific point and "the power to decide whether or not an area can be attacked at all."120 As Spaatz well knew, he and Doolittle had had too little voice in determining either the time of the attack or its feasibility under prevailing weather conditions. Although Spaatz had defended the work of the Eighth to Eisenhower and Bradley, the performance of the 2d Bombardment Division, made up entirely of B-24s, apparently had not pleased him. In contrast to American ground force leaders like Bradley, Patton, and even Eisenhower, who openly relieved several division commanders and lesser officers promptly, if not too promptly, for inad- equate performance, Spaatz did not deal harshly with his subordinate comman- ders. If they failed the test of combat, he quietly sent them to other posts. This seems to have been the fate of the commanding general of the 2d Bombardment Division, Maj. Gen. James P. Hodges. In mid-August the Eighth reorganized. It reduced VIII Fighter Command to a paper organization and assigned its fighter groups directly to the three bom- bardment divisions, which became air divisions. This reorganization enabled the same bomber and fighter formations to operate together for extended periods and thus ensured close coo
