to the three bom- bardment divisions, which became air divisions. This reorganization enabled the same bomber and fighter formations to operate together for extended periods and thus ensured close cooperation between them, with the goal of reducing the number of occasions on which either type of aircraft would miss an all-impor- tant air rendezvous. Bombers without constant escort still proved easy marks for the Luftwaffe. As part of the reorganization, Maj. Gen. William E. Kepner, who had a rep- utation as a troubleshooter, took over Hodges's bombardment division. Within twenty days of COBRA, Hodges found himself in Washington as Assistant Chief of the Air Staff, Intelligence, Headquarters, AAF. He never held another combat command and retired in 1951 still a major general. This reassignment had been in the works before COBRA. On the day of the bombing, Hodges attended a lun- cheon given by Spaatz's Chief of Intelligence, Brig. Gen. George C. McDonald, where he met the top British intelligence officers and was processed into the "real Blackmarket Intelligence business."121 Hodges's new post was, appar- ently, not highly regarded. His predecessor as Assistant Chief of the Air Staff, Intelligence, Brig. Gen. Thomas D. White, upon leaving the assignment, pun- gently commented to McDonald, "I never have had an unhappier job tho' few people know it; A-2 will forever suck the hind tit [sic] in the AAF."122 From January 1944 through July 1944, the 2d Bombardment Division's bombing accuracy had fallen far behind that of the 1st Division's and, for five of those seven months, behind the 3d Division's as well.123 In the Eighth, the B-24 was considered inferior to the B-17, mostly because of its lower effective com- 478   ## p. 479 (#503) ############################################  HEAVY BOMBERS IN SUPPORT bat air ceiling and poor center of gravity, caused by many modifications, which made it more prone to flak losses and more difficult for pilots to operate.
