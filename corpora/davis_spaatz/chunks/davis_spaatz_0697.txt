###  HEAVY BOMBERS IN SUPPORT bat air ceiling and poor center of gravity, caused by many modifications, which made it more prone to flak losses and more difficult for pilots to operate. However, it had performed well for the Fifteenth Air Force.124 The aircraft's capabilities did not account for the poor achievements of Hodges's units. The 2d Division did badly during COBRA, leading the mission on both July 24 and 25. Its lead bombers had the easiest time because the smoke of previous groups did not obscure their aiming points and targets and because enemy flak had not had time to find its range and adjust for atmospheric conditions. On July 25, thirteen of the 2d's forty-five squadrons bombing dropped short of the target area; two of those dropped 2,800 to 3,000 yards short, among the American troops. In the 3d Division, which followed, six out of thirty-six squadrons bombed short, with one of those the 100th Bomb Group-dropping bombs into the American lines. In the 1st Division, only one squadron bombed short of the target area, by a mere 100 yards, and five groups withheld their cargoes and hit alternate targets because they could not identify their aiming points. One-half of the 1st Division bombed beyond the target area; obviously, its bombardiers had taken to heart the briefings concerning the proximity of U.S. troops to the target box.125 After Hodges left the 2d Division, its bombing accuracy improved to equal or surpass that of the other divisions. In January, February, and March 1945, it significantly outdistanced them.126 As the breakthrough progressed and the troops and commanders had a chance to assess the damage inflicted on the Germans, emotions cooled. By July 28, Bradley wrote to Eisenhower: "This operation could not have been the suc- cess it has been without such close cooperation of the Air. In the first place the bombardment we gave them last Tuesday was apparently highly successful, even though we did suffer many casualties ourselves."127 Later
