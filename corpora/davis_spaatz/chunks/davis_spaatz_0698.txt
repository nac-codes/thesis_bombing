without such close cooperation of the Air. In the first place the bombardment we gave them last Tuesday was apparently highly successful, even though we did suffer many casualties ourselves."127 Later Missions in Support of Ground Operations Montgomery requested another heavy-bomber mission for early August to assist an offensive by his newly established 1st Canadian Army.

At 10:00 P.M. on August 7, Leigh-Mallory once again tried to make last- minute changes in operational plans.

Spaatz was seeking to avoid the confusion that was very likely to result if the two Allied bomber forces attacked the same pinpoint targets. Then Spaatz called Leigh- Mallory back and obtained his agreement to place more American bombers over the aiming points in question.130 The next day the Eighth dispatched 678 bombers to follow up the initial bombardment of 637 RAF aircraft.131 The 2d Bombardment Division did not participate in this attack. This combined attack incorporated several lessons learned from the St. LÃ´ and earlier air bombardments. Bomber Command did not bomb directly ahead of the troops. Instead, it delivered large bombs, with their accompanying crater- ing effect, on both flanks of the assaulting Ca
