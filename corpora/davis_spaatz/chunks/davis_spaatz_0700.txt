s of bombs. Two of their four aiming points were well covered. Clouds of dust prevented the bombing of one point and allowed only 30 percent of the bombers to drop on the other. 133 Two 12-plane formations, unfortunately, bombed short, killing 65 and wounding 265 Canadians and Poles in areas packed with unsuspecting members of the 1st Polish Armored Division and the 3d Canadian Infantry Division, many of them sitting in their vehicles moving or waiting to move up to the front. Some of the bombs fell on the tactical headquarters of the Canadian division, wound- ing its commander, Maj. Gen. R.F.L. Kellor, and forcing his evacuation.134 The discomfiture caused by the shorts, the 5-minute safety delay between the bom- bardment and the renewal of the ground assault, the 1,500-yard safety margin, 480   ## p. 481 (#505) ############################################  HEAVY BOMBERS IN SUPPORT and the two divisions' inexperience caused the attack to bog down. It halted on August 9 after gaining 13 kilometers. 135 AAF after-action reports revealed the near impossibility of preventing such short bombing. In one bomb group an antiaircraft round hit the lead plane just after it had decided to bypass the primary target, which was obscured by smoke. The round caused a fire in the bomb bay. The pilot, fearing for the lives of him- self and his crew, salvoed his bomb load. The rest of the formation followed his lead. Their bombs landed in the friendly city of Caen. In a second instance, the lead bombardier and pilot, confused by a course change to avoid intense flak, performed â€œexceedingly poorly," misidentifying their targets and dropping the formation's bombs just to the south of Caen.136 Such errors were inevitable on any large mission. The only way to keep them from adversely affecting the friendly assault troops was to bomb so far behind the enemy front line that any direct advantage the troops might gain was elimi- nated.
