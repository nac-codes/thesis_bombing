ualties, including 65 killed and 91 missing, many blown to bits. A recent history of the RAF explained why: It appeared that someone had omitted to inform Bomber Command that the Army's standard color for marking its positions was yellow; this was Bomber Command's target-indicating colour, and 77 aircraft which had gone astray 481   ## p. 482 (#506) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE proceeded to bomb on yellow marks—(the more the troops burnt yellow flares to show their position the more the errant aircraft bombed them).139 Once again the Poles suffered along with the Canadians. Ironically forty-four of the bomber crews dropping short were Canadian. The RAF, adding insult to injury, almost killed one of its own in a concentration of short bombs-Air Marshal Coningham-and a Canadian corps commander. 140 Allied heavy bombers did not fly another close support mission until November 16, 1944, when they participated in the preliminary bombardment of Operation QUEEN, a U.S. First Army offensive in the Huertgen Forest region near Aachen. Their overall performance in close support during the campaign in northwestern Europe indicates that heavy bombers were not entirely suitable weapons. They did not belong on the tactical battlefield unless all other ground or tactical air firepower available was insufficient. A flyswatter and a sledge- hammer can both kill flies, but the ease of use of the former made it far easier to control and more effective than the sound and force of the latter. In three out of four cases, close support of the ground troops, although spectacular, achieved little for effort involved. The ground troops did not achieve a breakthrough. In the fourth case, at St. Lô, the heavy bombers expedited the success of a massive ground offensive by undercutting German resistance and probably saved Ameri- can lives. The attacks in support of Montgomery, who faced the bulk of the Germans' high-quality armored formations, cou
