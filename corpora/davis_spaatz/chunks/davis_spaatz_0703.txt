ve ground offensive by undercutting German resistance and probably saved Ameri- can lives. The attacks in support of Montgomery, who faced the bulk of the Germans' high-quality armored formations, could do little because he did not have the pre- ponderance of strength necessary to overwhelm the troops facing him.

This blow would have succeeded in any case, but the heavy-bomber attack helped the assault to penetrate the German lines more quickly and with fewer American casualties. 482   ## p. 483 (#507) ############################################  Chapter 14 Stalemate on the German Frontier (September 11-December 15, 1944) There is no conclusive evidence of any intention of the Germans to quit.' -Spaatz to Arnold, September 24, 1944 To what extent the ground forces can advance during the ensuing late fall and winter months is anyone's guess. However, it is my prediction that unless the weather is extremely unusual, the ground advances will be very lim- ited until the good weather of spring again permits the overwhelming air cover to which they have become accus- tomed. Barring a disintegration within Germany itself or the benefit of a spell of good weather in October or November, I foresee a repetition of the winter in Africa and last winter in Italy.2 -Spaatz to Lovett, October 1, 1944. From the middle of September through the middle of December 1944, the U.S.-British ground forces engaged in a series of sanguinary battles from the Swiss border to the North Sea. As the Allied armies inched forward against the stout resistance o
