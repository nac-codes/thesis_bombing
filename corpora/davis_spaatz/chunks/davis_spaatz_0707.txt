changing command arrangements between Eisenhower and the strategic air forces. Because OVERLORD had obviously succeeded, Portal wished to invoke the provision, previously agreed upon by the CCS, of preinvasion air agreements that called for the independence of Bomber Command and USSTAF sometime after the establishment of the Western Allies on the Continent.10 Instead of supporting this move, as might have been expected, Spaatz opposed it. Spaatz assumed that Portal intended "to attempt to obtain a decision for the return of the strategic forces to the status existent January 1, 1944,"11 and he had no wish that Portal resume his role as chief interlocutor of the Combined Bomber Offensive.
