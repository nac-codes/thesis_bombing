strategic air forces should be placed under your command. 17 At the Second Quebec Conference, September 12-17, 1944, Arnold, how- ever, "flopped over" on the issue of independence for the heavy bombers. 18 During the conference, which dealt mainly with European occupation policy and the war against Japan, Portal gained Arnold's consent and the approval of the CCS to detach the strategic air forces from Eisenhower's control. This air issue had meant more to Portal than to any of the other Chiefs. By bringing Harris, who, like Spaatz, had enjoyed comparative freedom under Eisenhower's lenient yoke, back under the control of the Air Ministry, Portal hoped to rein him in.19 In August, Harris had obtained Tedder's and Eisenhower's permission to mount twelve area attacks on German cities when his forces were not required elsewhere.
