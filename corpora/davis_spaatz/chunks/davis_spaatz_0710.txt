d Portal's suggestions, but the next day, September 13, the British and American Chiefs agreed to the substance of his new command arrangements.26 The CCS directive to Spaatz and Air Marshal Norman Bottomley, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, RAF, announced the new command structure and specified certain target priorities. The CCS vested joint executive responsibility for the control of strategic bomber forces in Europe in the Chief of Staff, RAF, and the Commander, AAF, who in turn, des- ignated Bottomley and Spaatz as their representatives for the purpose of provid- ing control and local coordination through consultation. The directive required support of the ground and naval forces and charged Spaatz and Bottomley with the task of coordinating their actions with the theater tactical air forces. After accepting current target priorities, it added six further objectives: 1. Counter air force action consisting of policing current production facili- ties; 2. Direct support of land and naval forces whenever the Supreme Commanders called for it; 3. The bombing of important industrial areas when weather made other tar- gets impractical, and the use of blind bombing techniques if necessary; 4. Attacks in support of the Soviet armies, when authorized by the CCS; 5. Continued support for British Special Operations Executive/American Office of Strategic Services* operations; and 6. Targets of opportunity, such as the German fleet or submarines.27 These objectives reflected particularly the concerns of the Combined Chiefs. The first three points were already part of current directives to the bomber forces. Before accepting the change, both the American and British Chiefs had ensured that the heavy bombers would be available for other purposes if needed. Point 3 authorized RAF area bombing, while point 4, inserted at the behest of the British,28 introduced an entirely new consideration, of little importance until January and February 1945. *The British Special Operations
