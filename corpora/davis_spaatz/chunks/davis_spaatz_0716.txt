The memo also indi- cated his willingness to employ his force during bad weather over Germany, even though it was dependent on inaccurate H2X radar. This method, as Spaatz well knew, performed best over built-up areas (cities) but had little ability to pick out individual targets (marshaling yards, etc).43 H2X accuracy improved greatly if any part of a bomb run could be done visually. Moreover, transporta- tion sites offered a good subsidiary system when bomb groups that were unable to hit their primary target often found that openings in the clouds presented them with targets of opportunity, such as marshaling yards.
