This view, which emphasized short-term results, mirrored the hopes still prevalent that the Germans would collapse with one more good push.

The Allied air leaders began to search for new ways to employ their forces. At one of the last of Leigh- Mallory's Daily Air Commanders' Meetings, on September 29, held at Versailles, Air Marshal Coningham suggested "that it might be a matter of months before the Army would make any considerable move into Germany, and that the only hope of a quick finish to the war was from a collapse inside Germany.‚Äù50 In view of that prospect, which might allow the Germans time to raise a large force of jets and to improve their antiaircraft defenses, he pressed for an immediate, concentrated attack to cripple either German morale or the jet aircraft industry. He was seconding a proposition Spaatz had voiced moments earlier that, with three or four continuous days of good weather predicted for October, an all-out effort might prove profitable. Leigh-Mallory agreed, pointing out that the tacti- cal bomb line already in effect provided an ideal basis for a division of labor between the tactical and strategic forces. Spaatz then clarified his proposal, indi- cating that he envisaged an all-out attack by the combined strategic and tactical forces outside the tactical area. Such an attack "was bound to have considerable
