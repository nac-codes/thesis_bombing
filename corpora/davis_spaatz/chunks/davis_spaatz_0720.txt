tz then clarified his proposal, indi- cating that he envisaged an all-out attack by the combined strategic and tactical forces outside the tactical area. Such an attack "was bound to have considerable effect on morale, especially if kept up for two or three days."51 Bottomley attempted to throw cold water on the whole idea. The inhabitants of 100 smaller cities in Germany made up only 10 percent of the population- not enough, in his opinion, to influence the German High Command. The Chiefs of Staff, he continued, had already approved THUNDERCLAP (a maximum-force, combined strike by USSTAF and Bomber Command on Berlin) for implementa- tion when German morale showed signs of cracking. Until then, the German war effort ought to remain the primary target. Besides, any all-out attack would have maximum impact if tightly focused on a single objective, such as transportation in a single region. To defuse the effort over a wide area against something as amorphous as morale would have little long-term benefit. Bottomley concluded by requesting that the air forces place priority on the transportation network of the Saar and Ruhr industrial regions in support of the ground effort that Eisenhower intended to direct against them.52 The meeting ended with no agree- ment on any all-out massive attack. Soon afterward, however, both the Air Ministry and USSTAF began to formulate plans53 for widespread maximum- force attacks against Germany (code-named HURRICANES I and II). Spaatz strongly supported the HURRICANE plans. On October 1 he wrote to Lovett: I have urged and started the development of a plan for the full-out beating up of Germany with all the Air Forces at our disposal, if and when we have a proper weather break. 494   ## p. 495 (#519) ############################################  STALEMATE He did not know whether such an operation could be decisive, but, he wrote, "To my mind it represents the only means of terminating the war this year with our forces" [emphasis added].5
