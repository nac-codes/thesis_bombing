###  STALEMATE He did not know whether such an operation could be decisive, but, he wrote, "To my mind it represents the only means of terminating the war this year with our forces" [emphasis added].54 Spaatz believed that the plans were a necessary gamble. How much to wager remained a question. As he explained to Arnold on October 4, oil remained the overriding priority, but, he went on, "I must emphasize that the war with Germany is not over and with the stagnation of the ground front, it may be up to Air to force Germany out of the war." Spaatz then described the HURRICANE plans, both of which had RAF approval. HURRICANE I Concentrated Bomber Command and the Eighth Air Force, plus portions of the theater's tactical air forces, against targets in western Germany, primarily the Ruhr area. This event was to be closely tied with the maneuver of the ground forces. The attack was to be all-out, except when weather permitted attack on high-priority oil targets throughout Germany. HURRICANE II required good weather over all of Germany and involved a concentration of all U.S. and British air forces from the Mediterranean and Britain over Germany. This force was to attack targets in the following priority: (1) oil; (2) ordnance depots; (3) motor transport depots and armored force vehi- cle depots; and (4) transportation. The Allies would be hitting something almost everywhere they could reach. Both plans kept oil targets foremost.55 Spaatz would not loosen his grip on oil, the life's blood of the Nazi military machine.
