ll, would require the employment of the strategic air forces in an almost exclusively tactical manner.59 In response to Marshall's request for frank comment, Eisenhower mentioned his logistical dif- ficulties but also volunteered that more infantry and supplies might produce a quicker conclusion. In the same message Eisenhower supported strategic use of the heavy bombers. Poor weather prevented them from flying in direct support of the ground forces. Also, noted Eisenhower, "We know in these conditions our best bet has been to keep hammering constantly at the enemy's oil."60 The British Chiefs of Staff also discounted the chances of ending the war before the start of the year. The Air Staff, in particular, objected to diverting the heavy bombers from oil targets, which, if freed from attack, would rapidly regain much higher production levels. Consequently, the British asked Marshall to shelve the directive, which he did on November 1.61 The bombing results of September and October had shown the inconclusive- ness of the campaign against ordnance, tanks, and motor transport. Oil targets had absorbed most of the visual bombing days, and USSTAF had employed blind bombing techniques for part of most raids against military equipment tar- gets. This produced less accurate bombing. Meanwhile, the German front-line troops showed no equipment shortages attributable to the bombing, and postwar analysis revealed no major effects. By the end of October, the Allies were ready to try different target systems.62 The British Air Staff, for its part, wanted a new directive that would enable it to get better control over Harris. Since the CCS directive of September 14 placing him again under Portal, Harris had proceeded on his own course as he continued to do at least until the beginning of 1945. During the last three months of 1944, Bomber Command dropped 53 percent of its bombs on cities, 15 per- cent on railways and canals, 18 percent on miscellaneous targets, and only 14 percent
