After referring to the current opera- tions of the strategic and tactical air forces, he continued, "I am not satisfied that on these lines, we are using our air power effectively. The various types of operations should fit into one comprehensive pattern, whereas I feel that at pre- sent they are more like a patchwork quilt."66 Tedder believed that the one com- mon factor underlying the entire German war effort, from political control to troop supply, was communications. He argued, â€œOur primary air objective should be the enemy's communications. Road, water and rail are inte
