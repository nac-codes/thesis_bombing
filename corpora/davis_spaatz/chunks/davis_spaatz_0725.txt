ying the entire German war effort, from political control to troop supply, was communications. He argued, â€œOur primary air objective should be the enemy's communications. Road, water and rail are interdepen- dent and complementary, and our Air operations should play on that fact. The present oil plan is the key to movement by road or air, and, moreover, directly affects operations in the battle area."67 Tedder had integrated the oil plan into his own, adding two factors that he believed would make his antitransportation system effort even more telling than the one that had preceded OVERLORD. First, all loss of transport traffic would be a dead loss to the German war effort. In France, the Wehrmacht required only 20 percent of all rail traffic, with much of the remainder going to support the French economy. In Germany, any loss of transportation would eventually pro- duce a shortage or delay in the German war effort. In Germany, bombed-out transport lines could be replaced only at the cost of other vital programs, whereas, in France the Wehrmacht could use a large portion of the 80 percent of remaining capacity to replace bombed-out capacity. Second, noted Tedder, "In FRANCE and BELGIUM the programme of attacks on rail centres was severely limited, both as regards selection of targets and as regards weather conditions, by the need to avoid civilian casualties; no such limitations affect attacks on German rail centres."68 Tedder had concluded that by concentrating heavy bombers over marshaling yards, oil targets, the canal system, and "centres of population" in the Ruhr, and backing up that con- centration with the tactical air forces' operations against trains, rail embank- ments, and selected bridges, the Allies "would rapidly produce a state of chaos which would vitally affect not only the immediate battle on the West Wall, but also the whole German war effort."69 British intelligence buttressed Tedder's arguments. As early as July 1944 the British Joint Intelligen
