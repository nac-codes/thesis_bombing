e. In May and June, when Bomber Command devoted a great part of its strength to 25,000 night sorties over France in support of OVERLORD, the night fighters shot down 265 British heavy bombers. In September and October, when Bomber Command flew more than 16,000 night sorties against targets in Germany, the British credited only 36 losses to enemy night fighters.74 As Allied ground forces advanced they disorganized the Luftwaffe's fighter defenses, but when they were halted at the German border they stretched the Allied bomber effort in two ways. (See Map 15, Front Lines, 1944-1945.) The inability of the Allied logistics system to keep pace with the rapid advance of its armies led to the diversion of an entire B-24 combat wing, composed of four combat groups (approximately 200 bombers), to the task of ferrying supplies to the forward troops; and the scarity of supplies led Eisenhower to limit the broad- based advance of his forces in favor of a single narrow thrust. After some hesita- tion between alternatives offered by Montgomery, who championed an airborne thrust across Holland to the Rhine, and Bradley, who advocated an attack through the Saar to the Rhine, Eisenhower settled on Montgomery's proposal, code-named Operation MARKET-GARDEN. In its planning and execution, Montgomery's airborne operation tied up the theater's air transport craft, mak- ing them unavailable to the ground forces throughout the theater, and it diverted the Eighth Air Force from strategic targets in Germany.75 From August 29 to September 30, USSTAF directed the Eighth Air Force to conduct cargo trucking operations to assist the Allied armies in France. Starting with a small force of fewer than 30 aircraft on August 29, the operation grew to 200 by September 8. Eventually 225 B-24s made the daily trek from supply sources in England to the Continent. In the first ten days the planes carried 1,383 tons of supplies, mostly medicine and food, to Orleans/Briey Airfield, seventy miles south of Pari
