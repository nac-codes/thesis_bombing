ted by the First Allied Airborne Army operating under the command of Montgomery's 21 Army Group, was part of the Allies' bold attempt to break through the German lines in Holland and into Germany itself. At the very least the Allies hoped to cut off the German Fifteenth Army in Holland, turn Germany's border defenses, and position 21 Army Group around the north flank of the Ruhr.79 The opera- tion achieved none of these goals. As the official U.S. Army history stated, “By the merciless logic of war, MARKET-GARDEN was a failure.”80 Two features of the operation impinged on the strategic air forces: the lock- ing up of the theater's air transport assets and the diversion of the strategic effort to the direct support of the ground forces. In the first four days of the operation, September 17-20, the Eighth committed both its bombers and its fighters. General Doolittle, a few days after the close of the affair, estimated that "MARKET cost four (4) major and two (2) minor heavy bomber missions in September."81 On September 17, 875 of the Eighth's heavy bombers dropped fragmentation bombs in support of MARKET-GARDEN, while another 703 of its fighters strafed enemy antiaircraft positions, for a loss of 2 bombers and 14 fighters. On September 18, 254 B-24s dropped supplies for the paratroops. That mission lost 8 bombers to flak, and about half of the remainder received battle damage. Its 575 fighter escorts lost 20 aircraft and wrote off 9 more upon return to base, all to flak.82 At the Daily Air Commanders' Meeting on September 19, Doolittle com- plained that because the involvement of all of his fighters in support of the troops prevented the use of heavy bombers elsewhere, "he hoped that it [MARKET- GARDEN] would not be extended beyond the four days, as in addition to prevent- ing heavy bomber operations, it was proving very expensive in fighters."83 The Eighth continued its commitment to the ground offensive until September 26, during which time it limited those bombers
