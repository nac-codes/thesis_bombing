t- ing heavy bomber operations, it was proving very expensive in fighters."83 The Eighth continued its commitment to the ground offensive until September 26, during which time it limited those bombers not involved in the operation to shal- low penetrations into western Germany. It bombed marshaling yards, airfields, and military equipment targets but no major oil targets.84 In addition to the diversions caused by MARKET-GARDEN, weather greatly affected the operations of USSTAF in the autumn of 1944. In mid-December, Spaatz ruefully commented in a letter to Lovett, "We have been facing unusual handicaps from weather in our operations."85 On the same day, he wrote to Arnold, "Weather is, of course, the serious handicap in any operation at this time of year. Practically all of our bombing for the last two months has been PFF [blind bombing]. The amount of rainfall exceeds, in the opinion of experts to whom we have talked, any experienced for the last thirty years."

The AAF official history noted that in the last quarter of 1944, 80 percent of the Eighth's and 70 percent of the Fifteenth's missions employed, at least in part, blind-bombing devices.87 An Eighth Air Force Operational Analysis Section report on the bombing accuracy for the period September 1 to December 31, 1944, graphically depicted the effects of weather on operational performance. Of the seventy-three days in the period in which the Eighth conducted heavy-bomber operations, visual means could be used on only twenty-six days. Only 14 percent of the Eighth's bombing was done by visual means under good visibility. Even in good visibility (no cloud cover, no German smoke screens, or haze), high altitude and smoke from preceding bombing meant that only 30 percent of the bombs landed within 1,000 feet of their aiming point. Thirty-five percent of the bombing employed
