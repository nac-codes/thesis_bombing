ke screens, or haze), high altitude and smoke from preceding bombing meant that only 30 percent of the bombs landed within 1,000 feet of their aiming point. Thirty-five percent of the bombing employed H2X through complete cloud cover. The possibility that bombs would land within 1,000 feet of an aiming point was 150 times greater with good visibility than with H2X through 100 percent cloud cover.88 Even for visual targets, bombing accuracy in the fourth quarter of the year fell a dramatic 40 percent-a drop that the report attributed to more heavily defended targets, longer missions, and poor flying conditions. More flak at the target meant increased altitudes and decreased accuracy. Table 5 shows the abysmal results obtained for 58 percent of the bombing employing H2X. An official postwar survey admitted, "It cannot be said that this equipment [H2X] was in any sense a precision bombing instrument."89 The German synthetic oil industry, particularly, benefited from cloud cover and man-made smoke screens. Large-scale visual attacks on September 11, 12, and 13 brought the production of aviation fuel to a virtual halt from September 11 to 19.90 For the month, the fourteen chief hydrogenation plants produced only 5,300 tons, one-thirtieth of their May 1944 production.91 In October, how- ever, the Eighth dropped more tonnage on military equipment targets than on oil targets. It also conducted only three oil raids using completely visual means. As a result, German aviation gas production tripled to 16,400 tons. In November, the Eighth did not have a single completely visual attack on an oil targets. Although it devoted 39 percent of its bombing effort (16,147 tons) aided by 32 percent of the Fifteenth's efforts (4,837 tons) and 24 percent of Bomber Command's (13,060 tons), German aviation gasoline production doubled again to 35,400 tons. In December, the Eighth Air Force diverted much of its energy to helping the ground forces repel the German Ardennes counteroffensive at t
