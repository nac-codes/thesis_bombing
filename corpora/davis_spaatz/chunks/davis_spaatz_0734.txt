an aviation gasoline production doubled again to 35,400 tons. In December, the Eighth Air Force diverted much of its energy to helping the ground forces repel the German Ardennes counteroffensive at the Battle of the Bulge. Hitler's last gamble to win the war on the Western Front, which began December 16, was initially successful but within two weeks it had been contained by the Allies. Communications bombing and tactical support for the Battle of the Bulge lowered the Eighth's capacity to bomb oil targets. Conse- quently, the Eighth delivered only 2,940 tons of bombs, only 7.2 percent of its 504   ## p. 505 (#529) ############################################  STALEMATE Table 5 The Relationship between H2X Bombing Accuracy and Cloud Cover September 1-December 31, 1944 Estimated Percentage of Bombs within Standard Distances around Assigned Aiming Point Reported Cloud Cover 1,000 Feet 1/2 Mile 1 Mile 3 Miles 5 Miles Percentage of Total Eighth Air Force 10/10 0.2 1.2 5.6 39.8 58.5 35 8-9/10 1.0 7.3 22.5 67.4 82.0 15 6-7/10 2.0 12.5 36.5 84.0 90.5 4-5/10 4.4 22.8 48.5 89.1 96.0 53 5 3 Based on Eighth Air Force Operations Analysis Section, "Report on Bombing Accuracy, Eighth Air Force, 1 September to 31 December 1944," April 20, 1945, Spaatz Papers, Subject File 1929-1945. total monthly tonnage, on oil targets. The Fifteenth, however, picked up the slack, employing 43.5 percent of its total effort and dropping 6,939 tons on oil targets. Bomber Command, with its ability to drop heavier bombs than the AAF, delivered the most punishing single blow in a night attack, December 6-7, on Leuna-Merseburg. This attack, combined with two Eighth Air Force raids, stopped all production at Leuna for December, the chief reason German aviation gasoline production declined to 23,400 tons in that month.92 Despite diversions and weather, the offensive against oil targets in the fall of 1944 kept the total of oil production from all sources in Germany to only one- third of production in Jan
