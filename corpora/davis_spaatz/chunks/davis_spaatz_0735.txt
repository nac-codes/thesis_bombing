that month.92 Despite diversions and weather, the offensive against oil targets in the fall of 1944 kept the total of oil production from all sources in Germany to only one- third of production in January 1944.93 (See Chart 8, Total German Synthetic Fuel Production, 1940â€“1945.) The oil plants required repeated attacks in part because of the Germans repair efforts and in part because of the low accuracy of the bombing. Out of every 100 bombs dropped on oil plants, 87 missed the target completely, 8 landed in open spaces inside the plant causing no damage, 2 landed on the plant, but failed to explode, 1 hit pipelines or other utilities causing repairable damage, and 2 hit buildings and important equipment.94 505   ## p. 506 (#530) ############################################   Each bomb represents 2000 tons of bombs dropped Black indicates tonnage estimated to have hit plant R.A.F. - number of raids 10 17 6 10 8 17 5 11 12 10 3 U.S.A.A.F. 10 5 11 18 21 16 28 19 6 10 20 380 360 Total Synthetic Production 340 320 300 280 260 Fischer Tropsch K XK KOK KOK K 240 220 Hydrogenation 200 180 160 140 XK KKKK 120 Aviation Gasoline Production 100 80 60 40 DK KOK XK XX KKKK DKKKKKK KKKKKK 00 100 80 KKKKKK KKKK 20 0 thousands monthly averages of metric 1940 1941 tons per month JFMAMJ JASOND JFMA 1942 1943 thousands of tons estimated Chart 8 1944 1945 to have hit plant 0.7 1.0 1.7 2.1 1.7 1.4 2.9 1.5 1.5 2.3 1.9 0.3 Total German Synthetic Fuel Production, 1940-1945   ## p. 507 (#531) ############################################  STALEMATE These figures emphasize the vital importance of visual bombing; postwar data indicate that full visual bombing of the oil plants scored five times as many hits as full-instrument attacks.95 In the last third of the year the Eighth devoted increasing attention to rail installations, tracks, marshaling yards, and stations-components of the mar- shaling yard target complex.96 The Eighth delivered the bulk of its bombs non- visually, which meant that t
