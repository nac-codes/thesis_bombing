tention to rail installations, tracks, marshaling yards, and stations-components of the mar- shaling yard target complex.96 The Eighth delivered the bulk of its bombs non- visually, which meant that the area around the target, invariably a city, was drenched. In September, the Eighth released 13,053 tons of bombs (33 percent visual sighting, 32 percent of monthly total) on marshaling yards, exceeding the total of the previous three months, in which it had assisted the ground troops and bombed CROSSBOW targets. The figure went up in October to 18,844 tons (5 per- cent visual sighting, 43 percent of monthly total), fell in November to only 11,829 tons (14 percent visual sighting, 29 percent of monthly total) when the Eighth rained bombs on the oil industry, and rose in December to 22,921 tons (30 percent visual sighting, 55 percent of monthly total) when the Eighth aided the ground forces against the German Ardennes counteroffensive by pummeling enemy transport lines feeding the attack.97 This deluge of bombs played havoc with the German rail system or Reichsbahn. The Reichsbahn and, to a lesser extent, the German river and canal transport system, like the bloodstream carrying oxygen, carried coal to German industry. Without coal, all war production would grind to a halt, as the factories and power plants consumed the last of their stockpiles. The Reichsbahn also trans- ported other raw materials and finished and semifinished assemblies from sub- contractors to factories, while hauling completed arms and munitions to military depots. Troop trains and military supply trains had the highest priority, followed by coal trains. All other traffic, including essential war production traffic, would be cut back in favor of the highest-priority trains. In striking the marshaling yards and canals, the Eighth tightened the same deadly tourniquet around the artery supplying coal to the German war economy as it had around the synthetic oil plants feeding the German military machine
