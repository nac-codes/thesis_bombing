rds and canals, the Eighth tightened the same deadly tourniquet around the artery supplying coal to the German war economy as it had around the synthetic oil plants feeding the German military machine. If the oil campaign was Spaatz's contribution to winning the war, the trans- portation campaign was Tedder's. Tedder was fortunate that Spaatz willingly aided him because Harris continued his area bombing campaign. Spaatz had sound technical reasons for striking marshaling yards. The terrible weather of the fall of 1944 compelled his forces to bomb blind, which meant bombing tar- gets that could be picked up on H2X. As mentioned earlier, the Germans had located synthetic oil plants away from cities. Although large, these facilities were not large enough to give a consistently identifiable return on H2X radar. They had to be bombed by visual means in order to achieve a reasonable return on the effort invested to get to them. Bombs that missed the synthetic plants usually fell in open country where they did little harm. However, H2X had no trouble locating cities and the marshaling yards within them and, given any 507   ## p. 508 (#532) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE break in the clouds, the yards would be well hit. But therein lay the tragic conundrum of the strategic bombing campaign: a well-hit marshaling yard meant a well-hit city, with block upon block of residential areas gutted, families left homeless, small businesses smashed, and workers and othersâ€”including women and children-blown to bits or, more likely, burned or crushed by the hundreds, if not the thousands.* Eighth Air Force policy increased the likelihood of area bombing. On October 29, 1944, a memorandum defining standard procedure for operations set the policy for attack on secondary and last-resort targets: 1. No towns or cities in Germany will be attacked as secondary or last resort targets, targets of opportunity, or otherwise, unless such towns contai
