) in the area between the Moselle and the Saarland had ruined weeks of repair work, eliminated telephone facili- ties, and made it impossible to reroute trains.103 This cumulative destruction of the yards took its toll on the economy. Items of military necessity, troop and vital supply trains, could get through on a single track, which could be opened in a few hours or days. Even so, point-to-point travel times in Germany lengthened. But one through line did not a functioning *The Geheimschreiber was a more advanced machine than the Enigma and was used for Hitler's and other high-ranking officials' traffic. 510   ## p. 511 (#535) ############################################  STALEMATE marshaling yard make. Raid after raid, repair after repair, each not quite as good as the last, reduced the capacity of the yards in an ever-descending spiral, doom- ing the German war economy. The thousands of separate items needed for pro- duction, not to mention coal, piled up at the factories and shaft heads or lay idle in marshaling yards or sidings, as the trains to haul them could no longer be put together. By November the Reichsbahn got a chilling glimpse of its future. It could not even keep its own fireboxes full. Instead of the normal twenty-day supply of hard coal, the system's supply stood at eleven days on November 5, ten days on November 11, nine on November 18, eight days on November 20, six days on December 1, and five days on December 12. The east suffered as badly as the west, and in the south, cut off from the Ruhr by shattered rail lines, empty bins testified to a complete coal famine. 104 When the Reichsbahn resorted to brown coal for its fuel, locomotive power dropped, repair intervals tripled, and a much larger smoke cloud made the engines easier targets for roving Allied fighter-bombers and fighters. Reduced to a hand-to-mouth fuel situation in one of the greatest coal producing countries in the world, and unable to marshal necessary trains, the Reichsbahn impo
