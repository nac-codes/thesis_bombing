2 (#536) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE the Sturmgruppe (literally storm group, a special bomber assault unit consisting of heavily armored FW 190 fighters equipped with rapid-firing 30mm cannons), the Luftwaffe pounced on the 445th Bomb Group, whose 37 B-24s had wan- dered out from under the protective umbrella of its escort. In the three minutes between the bombers' plea for help and the arrival of the 361st Fighter Group's P-51s, Sturmgruppe II/JG4's 48 aircraft disrupted the formation and shot down 26 bombers; 2 more badly damaged bombers crashed in France. This was the largest loss by a single group during a mission ever experienced by the Eighth. The other 1,155 bombers dispatched lost only 2 bombers to enemy action. The Sturmgruppe's heavily armed and armored planes proved a double- edged weapon. Additional weight severely hampered their maneuverability. The nimble Mustang P-51s of a single squadron of the 361st probably saved the remainder of the 445th; they certainly avenged their comrades. They intercepted the Sturmgruppe and its escort of Bf 109s, shooting down 18 fighters-the Eighth Air Force record for kills by a single squadron in a single day.107 This increase in Luftwaffe activity did not go unremarked by Spaatz or Arnold. On September 3, Maj. Gen. Frederick L. Anderson, with Spaatz's approval, warned Arnold of USSTAF's concern over the progress of the Germans in fielding their new jet fighter, the Me 262. Anderson described the attacks the AAF in Europe planned to make on the enemy's jet airframe, engine, and fuel-manufacturing facilities, and on the experimental and training airfields. Two of USSTAF's greatest worries were (1) the Germans' obvious intention to use their jets against Allied photographic reconnaissance aircraft and (2) the small, dispersed underground sites where the jets themselves were assembled. Anderson requested the earliest possible deployment of the American jet fighter, the P-80
