connaissance aircraft and (2) the small, dispersed underground sites where the jets themselves were assembled. Anderson requested the earliest possible deployment of the American jet fighter, the P-80.108 Arnold replied that the AAF in the United States was working hard to meet Spaatz's requirements. New, more effective P-51s and P-47s had gone into production, and so would the P-80 when its development was finished. Arnold also promised to send the latest bombing-through-overcast radar devices as they became available. 109 The terrible losses absorbed by the 445th had a sobering effect on the heavy- bomber commanders. Although the Luftwaffe never duplicated the September 27 feat, the Americans had to assume that it would. On September 28, Doolittle wrote to Spaatz. He cited a gradual increase in the strength and aggressiveness of the Luftwaffe as a reason periodically to give "first priority to the conduct of winter air operations on the German Air Force-in-being to insure that their air- craft productive capacity does not get out of hand." Doolittle added, "It is inex- pedient for us to permit them to build up their force to a point where, even though we fly the maximum number of our limited escort fighters on every deep penetration bomber mission, they are able, in their periodic attacks, to take a serious toll of bombers."110 Three weeks later, a still worried Doolittle described the new Sturmgruppe tactics: 512   ## p. 513 (#537) ############################################  STALEMATE The Germans have developed a "line abreast" method of attack and it has proved so effective that they are now using it almost to the exclusion of other forms of attack. The concentrated fire from "line abreast" attacks has greatly reduced the effectiveness of the defensive fire of our bombers. Once a 'line abreast' attack is launched, it is practically impossible to break up that particu- lar attack unless our fighters are in a position between the bombers and the attacking enemy.
