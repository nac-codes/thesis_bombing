bombers. Once a 'line abreast' attack is launched, it is practically impossible to break up that particu- lar attack unless our fighters are in a position between the bombers and the attacking enemy. Split-second timing is necessary and we do not have enough fighters to give close cover to all of our bombers. Doolittle pleaded for the forward deployment of a new and more effective Allied radar. He informed Spaatz that microwave early warning radar (MEW) should come forward to Luxembourg where, with its 250-mile range, it could observe enemy fighter formations as they formed up, direct and control friendly fighters, pinpoint bomber forces and direct them to the vicinity of their targets in overcast, and help Allied aircraft locate home or emergency fields in very bad weather. “It is my personal opinion," added Doolittle, "and that of our fighter controllers, that with our M.E.W. located on the Continent, operated by the Eighth Air Force and tied in with this headquarters by adequate communica- tions, the effectiveness of Eighth Air Force fighters will be increased at least 50%."112 Spaatz shared Doolittle's feeling of alarm, but he focused on potential and actual German technical advances. At the beginning of October he wrote to Lovett, “The Luftwaffe has raised its head a bit in the past week or so by means of jet propelled or rocket planes that are now able to carry on reconnaissance which was denied to them prior to D-Day and up until quite recently."113 At about the same time he wrote to Arnold expressing a more pessimistic outlook: "There is every chance, I think, that the Germans may be using proximity fuzes* or an improved type of radar control for their flak. We can't prove this yet and our increased flak losses may be due simply to the fact that they are concentrat- ing all their available flak in a smaller area." Spaatz also expressed concern about German jet aircraft: “The Hun has still got a lot of fight left in him, even in the air, and we must concentr
