trat- ing all their available flak in a smaller area." Spaatz also expressed concern about German jet aircraft: “The Hun has still got a lot of fight left in him, even in the air, and we must concentrate to kill him off if possible before he can develop these new threats against us."114 * The proximity, or variable time (VT), fuze was an "influence" fuze. The fuze contained a miniature wet-cell battery and a five-tube two-way radio activated by the impact of the firing artillery piece. It transmitted a 140-foot doughnut-shaped signal, which, in proximity to aircraft or the ground, reflected back to the fuze, triggering an electric impulse that detonated the shell. Although it was difficult to manufacture, and, as a consequence, had a high dud rate, it was the most effective antiaircraft fuze of the war. It eliminated the extremely difficult problem of fuze setting for larger antiaircraft artillery guns, increasing the effect of antiaircraft fire by approximately 300 per- cent. The shell was developed in strict secrecy and first employed by the U.S. Navy in the Pacific. The V-1 campaign in the summer of 1944 prompted its use in England. Not until mid-December 1944 did the Americans employ it on the European continent. See Frank E. Comparato, Age of the Great Guns: Cannon Kings and Cannoneers who Forged the Firepower of Artillery (Harrisburg, Pa.: Stackpole, 1965), pp. 265–267, for a more detailed description of the fuze and its effectiveness. 513   ## p. 514 (#538) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE RAF Air Intelligence added to Spaatz's unease. On October 1, AI estimated, correctly, that in September the Germans had reached a new monthly high in single-engine fighter plane production and predicted, incorrectly, that the upward trend would continue. AI assessed the current Luftwaffe single-engine fighter strength at 2,000 and guessed that it could rise to 2,500 in six months. An October 3 ULTRA decryption showed a Luftwaffe
