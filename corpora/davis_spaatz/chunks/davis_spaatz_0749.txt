er being briefed on the 12th Army Group's plans for an attack on November 10, Spaatz told Bradley of his concern about the German air buildup. Spaatz feared that daylight bombing into Germany would become very expensive and that the strategic air force might have to lose "about 40,000 crew members" in order to maintain present air superiority. Spaatz added that it was essential for the army to press forward to the Rhine in order to obtain advanced airfields that would enable the Ninth to move forward and the Eighth to send its fighters into the continental fields vacated by the Ninth. Such a move would almost double the effectiveness of his fighters, Spaatz declared. Bradley replied that if good flying weather appeared likely, he could advance the date of his attack to November 5. Spaatz responded that the strategic air forces were prepared to lay down a bar- rage wherever Bradley requested it, weather permitting. In any case, Spaatz promised to aid Bradley's attack by operating the Eighth's fighters just to the east of the Rhine to enable the Ninth's fighters to concentrate on Bradley's immediate front. 122 If nothing else, this interchange between Bradley and Spaatz demonstrated more integration and interdependence between the ground and strategic air efforts than is usually conceded by the proponents of either effort. This conversation probably had little influence on Bradley's plans; he made no mention of it in his memoirs. The U.S. Army official history does note, how- ever, that one reason Eisenhower and his advisers [Spaatz?] wished to avoid a halt in operations in November was that they feared such a pause might give the Germans the chance to increase jet fighter production and discover the proxim- ity fuze "which might blast Allied bombers from the skies."123 The weather, as Spaatz anticipated, did not cooperate. Patton's Third Army began its attack toward Metz on November 8. Hodges's First Army, which had included a massive air bombardment as a prelude to
