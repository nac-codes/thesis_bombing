he weather, as Spaatz anticipated, did not cooperate. Patton's Third Army began its attack toward Metz on November 8. Hodges's First Army, which had included a massive air bombardment as a prelude to its attack, postponed action from November 10 to November 16 because the heavy bombers could not fly until then. This attack, code-named Operation QUEEN, far exceeded the St. Lô/COBRA attack in technical efficiency. Unfortunately, its ultimate effective- ness came nowhere close to the proficiency of its predecessor in Normandy. In its preparations and execution QUEEN showed how far the Eighth Air Force had come in its ground support role. Instead of only a few days' preparation, Doolittle rehearsed his forces thoroughly for the assault. On November 7 he conducted a full-scale “experimental" practice attack on a target in England to 515   ## p. 516 (#540) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE test safety measures. He also insisted that he have more input into advance plan- ning; if he had only short notice, the Army "must expect the hazards incidental to support from heavy bombers."124 Unlike earlier bomber-support attacks, QUEEN employed elaborate measures to mark the front lines. In addition to sixty-four 90mm antiaircraft artillery pieces that fired colored shells, giant ground-marking panels laid out by the troops, and a string of barrage balloons, the Eighth set up a series of radio and radar beacons close to the line. The planes would bomb no closer than 3,600 yards from the troops, well over twice the margin used in the St. Lô attack.125 On the morning of November 16, a total of 1,191 Eighth Air Force heavy bombers dropped their fragmentation bombs through overcast, killing only one American soldier and wounding only three with short bombs. An additional 1,188 Bomber Command aircraft bombed and cratered areas flanking the assault in the hope of preventing enemy reinforcement. Unfortunately, this attack, World War II's large
