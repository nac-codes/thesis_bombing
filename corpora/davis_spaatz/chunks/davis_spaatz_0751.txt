short bombs. An additional 1,188 Bomber Command aircraft bombed and cratered areas flanking the assault in the hope of preventing enemy reinforcement. Unfortunately, this attack, World War II's largest air attack in direct support of ground troops, did not pro- duce results commensurate with efforts. Because of the large safety zone, most bombs fell beyond the German main line of resistance, striking artillery posi- tions and fortuitously cutting up a German infantry division caught in the open while relieving a front-line unit. After a few hours, enemy resistance stiffened. Subsequent fighting produced no spectacular breakthrough, only more dogged attritional warfare. The air commanders blamed the large safety zone for poor results, because it prevented a rapid follow-up by the ground forces. 126 Spaatz commented to Arnold: "As a result of these operations, it has very definitely been established that unless there is a quick follow up of the bombardment by ground troops, the enemy recovers from the shock and the effect of the bombing is vitiated."127 Other factors prevented this attack from achieving the tremendous results of the St. Lô breakthrough. First, the U.S. ground forces did not launch so highly concentrated an attack as in Normandy. Second, the Germans—in contrast to their attenuated situation in France had adequate reserves, which allowed them to seal any break in their lines before it became critical. Even if QUEEN had severely damaged the front-line troops, it would have made no lasting break. At the beginning of December the Allies seriously considered diverting more strategic effort to the direct support of their bogged-down ground troops to achieve an immediate end to hostilities. Why bomb strategic targets when the war might be over in sixty days? On December 5, the air commanders and Eisenhower met at Versailles "to devise some means of using the strategic air forces in such a way as to bring about an early decision on the Western Front.”"128 Aft
