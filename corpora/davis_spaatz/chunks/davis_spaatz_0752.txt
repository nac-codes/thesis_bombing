December 5, the air commanders and Eisenhower met at Versailles "to devise some means of using the strategic air forces in such a way as to bring about an early decision on the Western Front.‚Äù"128 After opening the meeting by acknowledging the stalemated position of the ground forces and the pressure from the CCS to end the war quickly, Tedder suggested possible solutions: (1) conducting another QUEEN-type operation or (2) providing continuous close support by heavy bombers over a long period of 516   ## p. 517 (#541) ############################################  STALEMATE time. By limiting the airmen to these two options, Tedder hoped that Eisenhower would understand what extended heavy-bomber support would cost him in terms of damage not inflicted on the interior of Germany. Spaatz spoke up immedi- ately. He could deliver 40,000 to 50,000 tons of bombs per month. Of that total, 10,000 tons of bombs were needed to keep German production down at ten oil facilities, which, if they could continue operating uninterrupted for a month, might bring forth 400,000 tons of all types of fuel. In addition, Spaatz suggested that the antitransportation attacks had begun to show results and should continue to receive "some effort." As for the Luftwaffe, it could be limited by air battle alone without Allied recourse to bombing. Hence perhaps 30,000 tons of bombs were left for tactical support.129 After Spaatz's recitation, Tedder skillfully guided the meeting toward the conclusion that he and most of the other airmen supported: the strategic air forces should mount QUEEN-like operations when required, but should also per- severe with the strategic bomber offensive. From Coningham and Quesada Tedder extracted agreement that heavy-bomber carpet bombing would not mate- rially assist the tactical air forces at present. Tedder also gained from Doolittle and Harris agreement that QUEEN-like operations would be the most effective type of ground support operation for the heavy bombers. D
