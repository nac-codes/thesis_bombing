tactical air forces at present. Tedder also gained from Doolittle and Harris agreement that QUEEN-like operations would be the most effective type of ground support operation for the heavy bombers. Doolittle noted that the Eighth had begun to train strategic air support parties and planned to have an air- borne air controller to assist in future operations. 130 The airmen emphasized to Eisenhower that they thought QUEEN-like opera- tions would be most effective only if they supported troops actually moving for- ward. Repeated and continued bombings of targets such as villages and towns immediately behind the front lines would accomplish virtually nothing. Eisen- hower agreed and closed by paying the air forces a compliment: "It was impos- sible to convince the Army that the battle of St. LÃ´ had not been won as a result of the direct support given by the 8th Air Force."131 The next day, Spaatz flew to Patton's headquarters and offered him the direct support of the heavy bombers during the attack on the Siegfried Line in a week or ten days. Because Patton's attack would occur at the boundary between Devers's 6th Army Group and Bradley's 12th Army Group, Spaatz also visited Devers on December 7 and Bradley on December 8.132 However, the German Ardennes counteroffensive caused the hurried shelving of this initiative. As the Eighth prepared for QUEEN and possible ground-support missions, Spaatz fretted over the Luftwaffe, which now had far more fighter aircraft than ever before. From the all-time high of 3,375 fighters in September, production fell off only slightly to 2,975 machines in October and to 2,995 and 2,630 in the last two months of the year. 133 If the Luftwaffe had possessed the fuel necessary to train its pilots properly and to oppose all raids in strength, this formidable force might have fulfilled the hopes of its masters. Despite their severe losses in the quarter ending December 31, 1944, the Germans placed 4,219 more aircraft 517   ## p. 518 (#542) ###
