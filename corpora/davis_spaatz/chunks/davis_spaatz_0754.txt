s formidable force might have fulfilled the hopes of its masters. Despite their severe losses in the quarter ending December 31, 1944, the Germans placed 4,219 more aircraft 517   ## p. 518 (#542) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE into service than they lost, 90 percent of them fighters.134 The Germans were at cross-purposes about how to deploy this force. Maj. Gen. Adolph Galland, the Luftwaffe day-fighter commandant, and Speer hoped to use it to defend Germany from the Allied heavy bombers. On October 5, Speer concluded a report to Hitler on the oil situation with this recommendation: "Raise the effective fighting capacity of the German fighter force to such a height as is absolutely possible, to add all available machines to its strength, and then concentrate this fighter force for the protection of the home armaments and war production."135 In the meantime, Galland, according to his postwar interrogations, suc- ceeded in convincing Goering and the Luftwaffe General Staff that the fighter forces needed a period of rest and rehabilitation before being returned to com- bat.136 Alternatively, Hitler may have decided at that point to allow the conser- vation of fighters in order to save them for his planned counteroffensive. In any case, probably unaware of Hitler's plans, Galland confidently began to imple- ment his own scheme. He stripped Italy and Austria of German fighters, increased the number of planes per group to 68, made sure that each group received fifteen hours (a pitiful amount) of special training in air defense, and reorganized the command structure to reflect the actual basing of his aircraft. By early November he claimed a strength of 3,000 aircraft, 2,500 of them oper- ational.137 The Eighth and Ninth Air Forces had a paper strength of 4,204 fight- ers, 138 with a high serviceability rate, and the British could add 2,000 more fighter aircraft. Galland claimed that he had achieved a satisfactory resolution
