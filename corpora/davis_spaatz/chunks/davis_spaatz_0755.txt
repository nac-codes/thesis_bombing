ces had a paper strength of 4,204 fight- ers, 138 with a high serviceability rate, and the British could add 2,000 more fighter aircraft. Galland claimed that he had achieved a satisfactory resolution to fighter leadership personnel problems and, although he admitted that fuel shortages hampered training, he maintained that all formations had had enough time to complete their courses. Galland planned to use this rejuvenated force in a series of "Big Blows" against the Eighth Air Force. The first interception would consist of 1,000 fight- ers, 300 to 400 of which would refuel and attack again. A further 80 to 100 night fighters would pick off cripples headed for Sweden or Switzerland.139 Under Galland's direction, the fighter force carefully practiced the tactics required for such a large-scale operation and awaited the combination of a clear day and a deep bomber penetration to put their preparations into practice. 140 With all in readiness by November 12, Galland hoped to shoot down 500 bombers in a sin- gle day. He expected to lose an equal number of fighters and 150 pilots. This effort, he thought, would force the Americans to resume bombing the aircraft industry (instead of oil targets) and perhaps give the Germans the chance to hold the Soviets while making a separate peace with the Anglo-American Allies.141 The weather in mid-November never provided the clear day both the AAF and the Luftwaffe hoped for. In late November Galland received orders to trans- fer fighters to the Western Front, ostensibly to defend against a coming Allied attack, but, as he subsequently realized, in reality to assist the counteroffen- sive. 142 Once engaged in the Battle of the Bulge, the pilots, without even mini- 518   ## p. 519 (#543) ############################################  STALEMATE mal training in ground support, and their machines rapidly succumbed to the massive air power the Allies applied to halt the attack.
