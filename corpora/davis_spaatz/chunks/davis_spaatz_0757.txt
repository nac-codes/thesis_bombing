Showing that he had grasped at least the outline of Galland's Big Blow, Spaatz continued: It has been increasingly evident that the GAF was being processed to become a major threat to our deep penetrations, in daylight, into Germany. The opera- tions last Thursday, at which time the GAF hit our penetration with a well laid plan, and in strength, resulted in an outstanding aerial victory for our forces.

In his opinion the Eighth had too few fighters; with the influx of new bomber groups in the spring and summer there was only one fighter t
