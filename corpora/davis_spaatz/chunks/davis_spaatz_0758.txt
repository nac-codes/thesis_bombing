to discuss the countermeasures necessary to avert the threat. In his opinion the Eighth had too few fighters; with the influx of new bomber groups in the spring and summer there was only one fighter to protect every two bombers. This shortage posed a serious problem because it offered Spaatz only two options: reducing the number of bombers sent on deep missions to a number which the fighters could adequately cover, or sending out the maximum number of bombers on each mission, knowing full well that a massive German attack might overwhelm both a thinly spread escort and its flock. Spaatz regarded the first alternative as unacceptable because winter weather limited the number of good bombing days to a handful. With key targets protected by weather, flak, and smoke screens, the only way to obtain a reasonable assurance of destruction was by concentrating the maximum force on each target.

Microwave early warning radar and "Y" signal intercepts helped, but, as he told Arnold, "a permanent movement of the Eighth Air Force fighters from the U.K. to the Belgium-Holland area is the only real answer to increasing our escort fighter density."147 Such a move could not occur until the British 2d Tactical Air Force moved forward and vacated its present fields, more commu- nications equipment arrived to supplement the already overloaded equipment on the Continent, and Montgomery succeeded in opening Antwerp.148 In the meantime, the Americans took countermeasures. On November 27, the Eighth sent two forces into Germany. The first, made up of 515 heavy bombers escorted by 2
