The first, made up of 515 heavy bombers escorted by 241 fighters, bombed marshaling yards in southwest Germany. The second force, composed of 460 fighter bombers, headed for four oil centers in northern and central Germany. Using radio deception methods to trick the Germans into mistaking fighter formations for heavy bombers and aided by both heavy overcast (which prevented ground observers from identifying the aircraft) and newly deployed very high frequency radar jammers (which partially blinded the German ground controllers), this force, vectored to the German fighter ren- dezvous areas by the newly positioned MEW radar, provoked strong German reaction. In the ensuing fighter melee the Americans claimed to have downed 98 enemy fighters, against a loss of 12 of their own.149 As Spaatz observed to 521   ## p. 522 (#546) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE General Giles, Chief of the Air Staff, two weeks later, "Our war is becoming a radar war. We depend heavily on the operational capabilities of a small number of radar sets of extraordinary performance." As H2X had increased the bombers effectiveness in the first half of 1944, the three MEW sets in the theater were largely responsible, Spaatz said, "for the superiority of our fighters over Germany. We are therefore willing to pay the high price of the introduction of new and complicated apparatus because the return is proportionately high.‚Äù150 Arnold, too, felt the growing threat of the Luftwaffe. In his reply to Spaatz's letter of November 5, he agreed on the urgency of getting the Eighth's fighters to the Continent. He displayed a more open attitude than Spaatz did toward the possibility of changing priorities such as increasing night bombing, sacrificing heavy bomber effort in favor of more fighter sweeps, or creating a strat
