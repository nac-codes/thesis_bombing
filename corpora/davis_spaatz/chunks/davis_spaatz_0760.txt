more open attitude than Spaatz did toward the possibility of changing priorities such as increasing night bombing, sacrificing heavy bomber effort in favor of more fighter sweeps, or creating a strategic fighter force to conduct additional fighter sweeps. Arnold closed on a hopeful note: "The staggering losses you have inflicted in the past few days suggest that numerical increases in aircraft may not reflect the true position of the GAF."151 Another letter from AAF Headquarters in Washington, this time from General Giles, further explained the attitude prevalent there. He admitted AAF Headquarters' concern over the growing strength of the Luftwaffe and men- tioned alternatives studied and rejected, including a suggestion for 500 addi- tional fighters. "If we are to hit the Germans low with the fighters and high with the bombers," wrote Giles, "it will have to be done with the means we know we possess." Giles also seconded Spaatz's desire to get the fighters to the Continent and supported the maximum use of heavy bombers. Finally, he expressed con- cern about the accuracy of the Eighth's blind bombing. 152 At USSTAF, examination of November's operations restored a certain amount of optimism. Spaatz wrote to Washington, "In spite of the buildup of strength, his [the enemy's] overall effectiveness has not increased. In recent operations, when he has come up to fight, we have destroyed as much as 25% of his forces.... "153 If Spaatz's airmen could only get a break in the weather, they could destroy the German fighter force and free the escorts to return to a purely offensive role. "In the meantime," he assured Lovett, "our motto is-the maxi- mum tonnage of bombs on Germany that the weather will permit."154 Three days after his letter, three German armies plus supporting troops stormed through the surprised American defenders in Belgium's Ardennes Forest region and began to drive for the Meuse River and Antwerp. If they suc- ceeded they would split the American and Bri
