s contributions of the Air Forces are found on the seventh page of the New York Times. General Arnold stated that he had been informed that the fault lay on the other side and that General Spaatz would have to correct it within his command, that he would not do the necessary [work] over here—it would have to begin with USSTAF and its commands.161 On November 30, Spaatz received yet another letter from Arnold, delivered by Colonel Smith, which elaborated on Arnold's demands for improved public relations: As you are no doubt aware, my concern is that through proper presentation to the press the American people be given the facts necessary to a correct evalua- tion of the part air power has played in the war, to the end that the United States should not make the mistake of allowing through lack of knowledge the tearing down in postwar years of what has cost us so much blood and sweat to build up. 162 Like all the professional soldiers of his generation, Arnold had never forgotten the pell-mell demobilization of the U.S. armed forces that had followed World War I. Smith, on the first leg of a trip to all the combat theaters where the AAF operated, brought with him a list of fifty points applicable to the writing of com- muniques and press releases. Arnold wanted the list distributed to all AAF pub- lic relations officers (PROS) and told Spaatz, "I feel your personal attention is needed in insuring that the point of view is adequately presented to each PRO.” As a parting shot Arnold observed, "I trust that with all of us approaching the vital question of public relations along more or less the same lines, we may regain with the American public the position which we now only hold in the minds of our enemies."163 By December 9 Spaatz had reorganized his public relations effort, installing Col. Hal Bowman, whom he had described as a fine officer with a first-class combat record, as a new Deputy Chief of Staff with the primary function of rep- resenting USSTAF to the press.
