set for the rapid extinction of the German economy. Yet, althouth it had begun to stumble, it continued to function at least until the beginning of 1945. As General Hansell put it, the strategic bombing offensive "fatally weakened" Germany in the fall of 1944. The bombing of oil, with its side effects on the explosives and synthetic rubber industries, and of transportation, with its disrup- tion of coal, ball bearings, and semifinished goods distribution, wreaked havoc on the German military machine and economy. Precision bombing had wrecked the oil plants in the summer 1944, but blind bombing in the autumn, although allowing a slight increase in production, kept the plants suppressed. Similarly, the blind bombing of cities containing marshaling yards dealt a body blow to the German rail system. Instead of being a quick, surgical means of destroying enemy war industry and morale, strategic bombing had developed into a weapon of attrition which bludgeoned Germany into submission. Several factors contributed to the failure of strategic bombing to end the war more quickly. The Combined Bomber Offensive was embraced in name only. Harris, following his strategy of area bombing, refused to cooperate even with his own Air Staff, thereby shortchanging the oil and transportation campaigns alike. Bomber Command's heavy bombs inflicted more damage than the lighter American bombs; more heavy bombs dropped on oil targets would have signifi- cantly increased the total damage to the synthetic petroleum industry. Harris's stratagem of area bombing of cities, merely because they appeared on his list of sixty-three cities suitable for bombing, wreaked great damage but did not neces- sarily contribute to a coherent anti-transportation campaign. The weather allowed only a few days of visual bombing, which the Eighth used to bomb oil targets; 70 to 80 percent of USSTAF's effort involved radar assistance. Under pressure from Arnold, Spaatz had to put more bombers into the air and use hi
