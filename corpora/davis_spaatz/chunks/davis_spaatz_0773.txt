December 18 and 19. On December 18, only 411 of 985 bombers bombed their targets; all used radar. The next day, 312 heavy bombers bombed tactical targets behind German lines; again, all of them employed radar-H2X for most of the targets and Gee-H for eight targets. On December 23, the Allies received help from the east-not the start of the Soviet winter offensive, but an area of high pressure, called by meteorologists a "Russian high," which cleared away the clouds, providing five days of flying weather. The next day the Eighth put up every bomber that could fly-2,046â€”and dropped 5,052 tons of bombs, all visually, on airfields and communications centers in western Germany, its largest single-day totals of the war.7 For the first four days of clear weather the Luftwaffe vainly sought to keep the Allied air forces from scourging the Wehrmacht's supply lines and railheads. The Eighth's fighters alone claimed 160 German aircraft, a figure added to the 69 claimed on December 23. The Eighth's losses for December 24 to December 28 amounted to 21 bombers and 25 fighters, while it dispatched 4,535 bomber sorties and released 11,245 tons of 532   ## p. 533 (#557) ############################################  VICTORY ordnance.8 On December 26, at a high-level staff meeting at SHAEF in Paris, Spaatz urged the ground forces to follow up the air attack as soon as possible, saying, "The Hun can't take the pounding we have been giving him in the midriff indefinitely."9 The whirlwind of bombs continued to fall. Between December 16 and January 4, the Eighth and Ninth Air Forces dropped 35,747 tons on tactical targets. 10 For the month of January the Eighth flattened marshal- ing yards and communications centers west and east of the Rhine with 24,496 tons of high explosives and incendiaries.11 The good flying days of the Russian high enabled the Eighth and Ninth Air Forces to bomb airfields, communication centers, supply dumps, and enemy troops so fiercely that the German attack lost
