erved that Luftwaffe forces supporting the offensive had so lost in serviceability and strength that they could no longer carry on without a period of bad weather for recuperation. 15 At the end of December, Spaatz visited Bradley's and Patton's headquarters. He and Bradley discussed the nature and extent of the strategic air forces' com- mitment to halting the German attack. Bradley expressed satisfaction and wanted more massive raids and bombing of communications centers behind German lines.16 They both agreed to play down several incidents in which bombs fell short, one of which was the bombing of the U.S. 4th Armored Division Headquarters, and the shooting down of many Allied planes by friendly fire.17 By not emphasizing those incidents, they apparently hoped to defuse hard feelings in both branches of the service. The Luftwaffe's increased effort in ground support during the battle had prompted Allied ground troops to fire at all overhead aircraft. On Janaury 1, as Spaatz flew to Hodges's headquarters in Liege, his own plane came under heavy, but fortunately inaccurate, antiaircraft fire from Patton's troops. Spaatz found that Hodges, too, wanted to continue hitting communications centers and marshaling yards in preference to carpet bombing in front of the troops. Spaatz left Liege with the impression that the strain of the offensive had begun to tell on Hodges. Spaatz commented in his Command Diary, "Hodges and staff did not make a very good impression and seem to lack aggressive- ness."18 Bradley recorded a similar thought.19 In his meetings with the generals, Spaatz had urged them to attack immediately, while the Germans still reeled under the full weight of nine days of successfully applied Allied air power.20 On New Year's Day, Spaatz saw firsthand the work of the Luftwaffe. That morning a force of more than 800 German fighters, employing strict radio silence, had swept over sixteen Allied airfields in Belgium and Holland. They destroyed 196 airplanes, 36
