31, one-third of the force attacked oil targets deep in Germany. Fortunately, the Fifteenth Air Force picked up much of the slack; from December 17 through January 8, it made eleven attacks on German and Austrian oil targets.27 Nonetheless, strategic targets in central Germany gained some respite. Third, the Battle of the Bulge delivered the coup de grace to the Reichsbahn. The previous autumn's bombing had exhausted the repair crews and all stores of spare parts and repair material. The system had already begun to falter, but the 536   ## p. 537 (#561) ############################################  VICTORY Battle of the Bulge opened an unstaunchable wound. The Reichsbahn strained every nerve and used every expedient to keep the troop and supply trains flow- ing to the offensive. The priority given the Wehrmacht drained the entire system. Thousands of cars were lost and even more mired in the huge backlogs created by poor coordination due to attacks on marshaling yards and disruption of telecommunications. By the end of the offensive, car placings (the forming of incoming rail cars into separate outgoing trains) in Germany stood at only one- third of what they had been during the same period in 1944. The Reichsbahn Direktorate of Essen and Cologne, the main shipping points of hard coal and brown coal respectively, fell to 39 percent and 16 percent of normal.28 Trains cluttered yards and sidings. By Christmas, 1,100 trains and 75,000 to 100,000 cars stood idle.29 That number rose to 1,994 by January 18. This situation con- tributed to ballooning car turnaround times up from six and a half days per car in November 1943 to twenty days by January 1945. At times, even the highest-prior- ity "Blitz" shipments were idled.30 Conditions were so bad that the Reichsbahn even resorted to the self-defeating expedient of purposely derailing trains to clear the tracks. On January 19, the system embargoed all freight everywhere except- ing Wehrmacht and coal traffic. The resulting
