Supplies to combat units fell by 11 percent compared with December.33 The Allies, however, did not fully appreciate the magnitude of the disaster inflicted by their transportation bombing. For instance, they did not decrypt the 537   ## p. 538 (#562) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE large commercial traffic of 20,000 weekly messages. Not until late February did a report commissioned by Bottomley demonstrate the value of this traffic, which contained a plethora of information on the German coal famine. On February 28, Spaatz and Portal received a fresh commercial intercept detailing the increase in unshipped coal tonnage at the mines and the closings of plants because of trans- port disorganization.34 Higher level GC and CS interceptions partially filled in the picture.
