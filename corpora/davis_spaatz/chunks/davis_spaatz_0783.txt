mage from Ninth Air Force P-47s to a rail yard near Cologne, Germany. Me 262s, each armed with four 30mm cannons, launched against the slower American escort fighters and lumbering heavy bombers haunted Spaatz's calcu- lations. A particularly hair-raising report from his chief of intelligence, Brig. Gen. George C. McDonald, greatly impressed Spaatz when it crossed his desk on January 3, 1945. This report, titled "Allied Air Supremacy and German Jet Planes," opened by stating dramatically, Maintenance of Allied Air Supremacy over Europe in 1945 is confronted by a serious threat. This threat menaces both continuance of our Strategic bombard- ment and the superiority, both offensively and defensively, of the fighter bomber cover under which our troops fight. This threat is the opposition of a large and increasing German jet plane fighter force, sustained by rapidly expanding capacity for... production. . . .38 McDonald expressed little doubt of the Germans' ability to have, at the most conservative estimate, 300 to 400 jets available for daily use by July 1, 1945, 539   ## p. 540 (#564) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE provided "they are given time and freedom from counter-measures." Because the jets did not run on high-octane aviation fuel but on kerosene and other lesser-quality fuels, the bombing of oil facilities could not immobilize them as it had conventional fighters. Although Allied bombing had halted at least 80 per- cent of production at the large and complex hydrogenation and Fischer-Tropsch process synthetic plants, which produced aviation and other high-quality fuels, synthetic plants producing low-grade benzoil were more numerous, more widely scattered, smaller, and less complex. Their production had only fallen by half, as had the domestic refining of crude oil. In all, German production of finished oil products declined from 900,000 tons in January 1944 to 303,000 tons in December.39 But a small amount of al
