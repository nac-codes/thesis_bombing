y half, as had the domestic refining of crude oil. In all, German production of finished oil products declined from 900,000 tons in January 1944 to 303,000 tons in December.39 But a small amount of almost any type of fuel would suffice for the Me 262. According to the report, this situation left the Allies two options: (1) either ignore the threat of the jets and gamble on the war's ending before July 1 or (2) initiate immediate countermeasures at considerable cost to the current bombing effort. Given the lowered expectations prevalent in the Allied High Command at the turn of the year, McDonald's report recommended bombing the jet-engine plants and the airfields associated with jet testing, training, and operation. McDonald pointed to the successful dispersal and underground placement of German jet assembly plants, and warned that since the same treatment of jet engine plants was surely imminent, bombing had to begin immediately, not in three months' time.40 He noted, “The question is not so much whether we can afford to initiate counter measures against jet development as whether we can afford not to. Such a program will be expensive for us in the dearest of all our resources which is visual bombing weather." McDonald realized that his sugges- tion meant the diversion of substantial bomb tonnage from other strategic tar- gets, but he added: Failure to take every possible precaution to neutralize this threat now may gravely compromise the capabilities of our entire bombardment effort within a few months. What is more, Allied troops have never fought successfully under anything less than overwhelming air superiority. The German jet program is capable of reversing that superiority by mid-summer.4¹ Finally, McDonald cautioned that "the Strategic Air Forces cannot be responsi- ble for the maintenance of Allied Aerial Supremacy over Europe unless they are given sufficient freedom from other demands to allocate the necessary propor- tion of visual strategic bombing again
