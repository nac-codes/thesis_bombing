They had estimated that 10,000 tons of visual bombing would set back the German program three months, which was "absolutely necessary to enable our own jet production to 540   ## p. 541 (#565) ############################################  VICTORY catch up." In addition, they emphasized the reported buildups in the Germans' production of oil, construction of submarines, and manufacture of armored fight- ing vehicles.43 As mentioned, the concentration of the Eighth Air Force on tactical bombing related to the Battle of the Bulge had slightly eased the pressure on Germany's oil industry. Also, early in 1945, new mass-produced, faster, snorkle-breathing U-boats had begun to enter service. These new submarines might allow the Nazis to successfully reopen the Battle of the Atlantic, jeopardizing the Allies' supply lines from the United States. The Allies had also completely lost their capability to decipher U-boat signals;44 a change in German code procedure had deprived the Allied navies of much of their knowledge of the location and inten- tions of the enemy. This loss accounted in part for the panic in Allied naval cir- cles that led to pressure on the airmen to bomb submarine construction yards. As for tanks, intelligence indicated that, upon manufacture, they reached the front in less than a month. The Germans had suffered severe tank losses in the Bulge, and the anticipated Soviet winter offensive would cause more; thus a campaign against tank
