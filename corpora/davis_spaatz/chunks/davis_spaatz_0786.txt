ture, they reached the front in less than a month. The Germans had suffered severe tank losses in the Bulge, and the anticipated Soviet winter offensive would cause more; thus a campaign against tank plants was essential in order to hamper the Germans' ability to replace losses. All these factors, Spaatz and Doolittle told Eisenhower, meant that the Eighth should return to strategic targeting at once. Eisenhower dis- agreed; the critical battle situation, he insisted, still required all the strategic bomber help that Spaatz could spare.45 Spaatz, however, did not give up. Latest intelligence, he said, had shown that the Germans would produce more oil than their minimum requirements in January, if unmolested by the Eighth. He probably expressed the general feeling in USSTAF that continuing to bomb marshaling yards and other tactical targets west of the Rhine would only lengthen the war46 by relieving German industry of the pressure of strategic bombardment. On January 6, with Bedell Smith's support, Spaatz gained Eisenhower's per- mission for two-thirds of the bomber force to resume oil attacks as a top priority, followed by tank plants and jet production, if necessary.47 The other third of his force, the Gee-H-equipped 2d Air Division, would assist the ground forces. Three days later, on January 9, Spaatz gained Smith's consent to bomb enemy jet production at the same priority visual bombing level as oil.48 Spaatz's concern about over commitment to tactical bombing reached the newly constructed Pentagon in Washington. In a pair of “Eyes Only" letters to Arnold, both dated January 7, Spaatz expressed the general pessimism and fear of German jets prevalent within USSTAF. In one letter he wrote: “Our estimate of the situation concerning the whole German war proposition does not lead up to the conclusion that German strength will crack in the near future." As for oil, Spaatz's intelligence estimates indicated that the Germans could operate along defensive lines if they
