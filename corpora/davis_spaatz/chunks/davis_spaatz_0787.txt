As for oil, Spaatz's intelligence estimates indicated that the Germans could operate along defensive lines if they practiced the strictest economy. He predicted German resistance to the bitter end and concluded: "Unless our ground armies succeed in obtaining a significant victory over German ground armies west of the Rhine in 541   ## p. 542 (#566) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE the reasonably near future, it will be necessary to reorient ourselves and prepare for a long, drawn out war."49 In the second letter, Spaatz addressed Arnold's fear of the growth of the Germans' conventional fighter force.
