terated, "The jet airplane represents a very grave danger to us and could cause great trouble if employed in the proper manner."53 On January 11 at the Weekly Air Commanders' Conference, Spaatz, Ander- son, and Doolittle reviewed the strategic bombing situation. "From the strategic point of view," lamented Anderson, "the picture is very sad!" The strategic air forces "were paying a tremendous price by concentrating on helping ground forces." Now oil, ball bearings, aircraft factories, and submarine yards would all have to be hit again. Doolittle backed up Anderson "100% or possibly even more." Unless the bombing of strategic targets resumed at once, German jets would prevent deep-penetration raids after July. Spaatz took note of Eisen- hower's agreement to release two-thirds of the Eighth to attack oil and jets. Then he suggested specific U-boat targets as well as armored fighting vehicles.54 Support for hitting the vehicle plants had originated in Eisenhower's headquarters55 and reflected the needs of the ground forces. Spaatz probably added them as part of his agreement with Eisenhower allowing USSTAF partial resumption of the strategic offensive. "Directive No. 3 for the Strategic Air Forces in Europe," agreed upon by Spaatz and Bottomley on January 12 and issued January 16, formalized the new strategic priorities. In his cover letter to Arnold, Spaatz stated simply, "A new directive is necessary at this time since we have recently had to revise our esti- mate of V-Day [Victory Day in Europe], and consequently must include the attack of target systems with a longer range application."56 After retaining oil, transportation, and important industrial areas as priority targets, it added both the authorization to employ "the necessary amount of strategic effort" required to neutralize jets and the instruction that the U-boat organization â€œwill be 542   ## p. 543 (#567) ############################################  VICTORY attacked whenever possible by marginal effort
