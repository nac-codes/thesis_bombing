The Air Staff in Washington found the directive "a very much too conservative approach to the problem." They asked Spaatz to consider raising the priority of U-boats and ground support.58 Portal, who did not agree that jets constituted a threat because he did not believe that the war would drag on, accepted the direc- tive as temporary. He hoped to revise it during the CCS meetings at the end of January,59 THUNDERCLAP and Dresden Even as Spaatz and Bottomley issued Directive No. 3, events had begun to overtake it.
