ss of at least 35,000 lives. One impetus behind the Allies' decision to bomb cities in eastern Germany, including Dresden, stemmed from a desire on the part of the British and Americans to support the Soviet offensive by knocking out transportation cen- ters serving the German Eastern Front, in order to prevent the rapid shifting of forces among sectors along it and the transfer of troops from the west to the east. Berlin, as the administrative center of the nation and the nerve center and trans- portation nexus for a large section of the Eastern Front, would be an obvious target of any effort to assist the Soviets' drive. Accordingly, on January 16 Spaatz's chief of staff ordered Doolittle to take a new look at Operation THUNDERCLAP and begin planning its execution.60 As mentioned in Chapter 12, the Allies first conceived of THUNDERCLAP as a combined Bomber Command-USSTAF daylight mission on Berlin in response to the German V-1 offensive during the summer of 1944. Because of opposition from Spaatz and others, it had been planned but not carried out. By early September 1944, USSTAF planners had filed it away for reconsideration when the situation in Germany deteriorated to the extent that one large blow on Berlin might shock its government into surrender.

The British, too, began to consider THUNDERCLAP. On January 22, Air Commodore Sidney O. Bufton, Director of Bomber Operations and Chairman of the Combined Strategic Targeting Committee (a combined USSTAF and British Air Staff agency that selected specific strategic targets and ranked them for bombing by the strategic air forces) suggested to Air Marshal Bottomley the launching of THUNDERCLAP while the Soviet offensive was in full stride.61
