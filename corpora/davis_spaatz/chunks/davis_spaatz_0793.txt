Churchill asked the Secretary of War for Air, Archibald Sinclair, what plans the RAF had made for "blasting the Germans in their retreat from Breslau."69 Sinclair passed Churchill's inquiry to Portal. Portal, hard at work preparing for the coming Malta and Yalta meetings, replied cautiously that oil, subject to the demands of the jet assembly factories and submarine yards, should continue to have top priority.
