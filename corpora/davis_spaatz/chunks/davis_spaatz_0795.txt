he primary aiming points were the Air Ministry, Gestapo headquarters, and the Alexanderplatz railway station, all in the governmental and administrative center of Berlin. At this point USSTAF still envisaged full implementation of the plan, including a follow-up raid by the RAF on the night after the American bombing.77 After meeting with Spaatz, Bottomley visited Tedder in Paris. According to Tedder they agreed to maintain oil as top priority when visual conditions existed, with first Berlin, then Leipzig, and, finally, Dresden as the next targets.78 In the meantime Spaatz had already put in train a large operation over Berlin. He insisted, however, that this attack have specific aiming points such as "industrial plants, Administrative Headquarters or, possibly, railway stations."79 Thus, he confirmed the AAF's policy of at least attempting to hit strategic tar- gets rather than resorting to intentional area bombing. On January 31, Bottomley radioed the results of his meeting with Spaatz to Portal in Malta.80 The next day Spaatz read the same message at the Weekly Allied Air Commanders' Conference, where no one present questioned it.81 According to an intelligence briefing at the same conference, the German Sixth S.S. Panzer Army had left the Bulge in the west and was presumed headed toward the Eastern Front. In the message, Bottomley, after noting first priority to the main synthetic oil plants, stated, "Next in order of priority for Air Forces operating in the UK is attack of Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden and associated cities where heavy attack will cause great confusion in civilian evacuation from the east and hamper movement of reinforcements from other fronts."82 Like all the agreements between Spaatz and Bottomley since September 1944, this one on bombing priorities did not mean that Spaatz accepted every word as policy for USSTAF. Rather, it represented the usual compromise according to * I have found no records in Spaatz's, Doolittle's, or the Eighth Air Force'
