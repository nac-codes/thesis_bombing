t to the limit, since Spaatz anticipated a nonvisual attack and therefore knew the raid would be wildly inaccurate. Nonetheless, it would seem that Spaatz hoped-albeit faintlyâ€”that a heavy raid on Berlin just might crack the morale of the German High Command and produce a surrender. In fact, he admitted at least that much when he acknowledged in 1969 that, "We never had as our target, in foreign [German occupied?] Europe, anything except a military target-except Berlin."106 On February 3, 1945, heavy bombers of Eighth Air Force mission No. 817 left their fields and turned to the East, toward Germany. What was their mission? To give incidental aid to the Russians, assuredly yes. To comply with suggestions from Washington and from the Chief of Staff, also yes. But Doolittle's and Spaatz's reactions indicate an additional goal. The mission is unique among the approximately eight hundred Eighth Air Force missions flown under USSTAF's 551   ## p. 552 (#576) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE command, for the nature and vehemence of Doolittle's objection to his targets. Eleven days later, for instance, Doolittle made no objection whatsoever to hitting the marshaling yards in Dresden. Nor did he object to hitting the three rail yards in Berlin on February 26. But the whole tenor of his communications with Spaatz shows his perception that this was a terror raid as suggested by THUNDERCLAP. Likewise, Spaatz's direct orders to "hit the center of the city" are unique. He knew that bombing rail yards meant bombing city centers. He often ordered raids on transportation and other targets within cities, but in no other instance did he specify it explicitly as he did for this mission. On January 16, four days after the start of the Societ offensive, he had THUNDERCLAP delivered to the Eighth Air Force. On January 25, he agreed with Tedder to have the plan ready for instant implementation. On January 30 and February 2, he insisted that Doo
