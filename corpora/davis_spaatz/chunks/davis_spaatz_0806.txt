In the center of the city, industrial and residential property suffered severe damage, while government offices along the Wilhelmstrasse, including the Air Ministry, Reich Chancellory, Foreign Office, and Gestapo headquarters (primary aiming points on the THUNDERCLAP target list), received numerous hits. 107 Many bombs missed their aiming points and fell into residential areas of the city. 108 For the tenth and last time the Eighth had bombed the civil and military government area of Berlin.109 But Doolittle employed only his B-17s; the more vulnerable B-24s, in keeping with Spaatz's verbal directive to send at least 400 bombers against oil whenever pos- 552   ## p. 553 (#577) ############################################  VICTORY sible, went to bomb the Magdeburg synthetic oil plant. Of the 434 B-24s dis- patched, 116 bombed the oil plant. Most of the rest bombed the Magdeburg mar- shaling yard using H2X, when clouds obscured the primary target. The Germans, in accordance with their standard policy, declared the Berlin raid a terror-bombing attack, and stories in their own and neutral presses claimed 20,000 dead.110 In this instance the German government and propaganda organs had been hit where they hurt. The AAF official history uncritically accepts a fig- ure of 25,000.111 Recent figures based on records of the Berlin City Archives and the Bundesarchiv indicated losses of 2,893 dead, 729 seriously injured, 1,205 slightly injured, and 120,000 left homeless.112 Given the relative accuracy of the visual bombing employed and the sparing use of fire bombs by the Eighth on this mission, the lower figures were probably closer to the truth. This mis- sion, unusual because of its accuracy and low volume of fire bombs, apparently struck its assigned targets-rail junctions and the center of government. But the heavy damage inflicted on residential areas showed that, even under favorable conditions, AAF precision attacks on city areas had considerable "sp
