targets or targets of opportunity. On February 9, another 1,300-plane mission against the same targets was thwarted by the weather. Secondary targets were again bombed. On February 13, USSTAF called the Eighth to report that the weather would be "beautiful" over Dresden and Chemnitz. The Eighth drew up three plans: Plan A, for a short mission over western Germany in case of marginal weather; Plan B, for the 1st and 3d Air Divisions to bomb Dresden and the 2d Division to bomb Chemnitz (after these cities' names, the planners noted, "Beat'em up"); and Plan C, for the 1st and 3d Air Divisions to bomb Dresden and the 2d Division, in case it could not climb over the clouds to eastern Germany, to bomb transport and jet targets in central Germany. 122 After post- poning the attack for twenty-four hours because of the weather, 1,377 B-17s and B-24s set out on February 14 to bomb marshaling yards in Dresden and Chemnitz and to bomb the oil plant in Magdeburg. The 340 B-24s of the 2d Air Division that were redirected from Plan C because of the possibilty of visual oil bombing and sent against synthetic plants found bad weather and diverted to Magdeburg's marshaling yards, where they dropped 811 tons of bombs (215 tons of them fire bombs) by H2X; the 294 B-17s of the 3d Air Division that were diverted from Plan C because of the heavy RAF raid on Dresden the previ- ous night, employing H2X, dropped 718 tons of bombs (228 tons of fire bombs) on the Chemnitz yards; and 311 B-17s of the 1st Air Division, using visually assisted H2X, dropped 771 tons of bombs (including 294 tons of incendiary bombs) on the Dresden marshaling yards. 123 But several eyewitnesses in Dresden never even noticed the American bombs. 124 Some of the city's inhabitants failed to pay much attention to this mission because on the previous night, February 13-14, 796 Lancaster heavy bombers of Bomber Command, in a two-wave attack, had released 2,646 tons of bombs, including 1,181 tons of incendiaries, into the
