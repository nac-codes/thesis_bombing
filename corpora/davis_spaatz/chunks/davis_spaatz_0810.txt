ion because on the previous night, February 13-14, 796 Lancaster heavy bombers of Bomber Command, in a two-wave attack, had released 2,646 tons of bombs, including 1,181 tons of incendiaries, into the very heart of the city. Much of Dresden's antiaircraft defense, including almost all the heavy guns capable of reaching high altitudes, had left to serve as antitank units on the Eastern Front or to supplement flak defenses at points hit more often by the Allies. Thus, British and American raids met no opposition. The British, in par- 556   ## p. 557 (#581) ############################################  VICTORY ticular, benefited from the lack of interference because their airborne controller could bring his planes in undisturbed and direct them to drop their cargoes in a newly developed fan-shaped pattern that maximized the coverage and effect of incendiary bombs. The RAF conducted a technically perfect fire-raising attack on the city. 125 Several factors had to combine to create the phenomenon of a fire storm. Weather had to be favorable-dry with low humidity. Many large fires had to be started in a short time. The built-up city area had to be blanketed with a bomb mix, that included large percentages of incendiaries and high explosives. The large percentage of incendiary bombs made it impossible for individual efforts to stop the fires, while high-explosive bombs drove the populace and most fire guards into shelters, discouraged fire fighters, smashed water-main networks, created road blocks, broke windows, and opened up buildings and holed roofs. Unlike a large fire, which starts at a single point and spreads by easy stages over the course of several hours, a fire storm's huge blaze starts with incredible rapid- ity. Within twenty minutes after the first attack wave struck Hamburg (in July 1943), two out of three buildings in a four-and-one-half square-mile area were ablaze. This quick buildup made fire fighting impossible. As flames broke through the roofs, a colum
