nts and recent arrivals had ever experienced a major bombing. They had little idea of how to protect themselves. 127 The 311 American B-17s, which for this mission carried approximately the same percentage of fire bombs as the Lancasters, attacked shortly after 12:00 557   ## p. 558 (#582) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE P.M. After releasing 771 tons of ordnance, they reported a low-lying haze of smoke that prevented observation of their bombs' fall. Nevertheless, immediate post-raid analysis of strike photos taken by the attacking bombers, indicated "that the majority of the bombs dropped fell into heavily built-up areas of the city," and stated, "damage to the city should be severe."128 The next day, at an Allied Air Commanders' Conference, Doolittle reported that "the fires lit by Bomber Command the previous night had been re-kindled," and he noted with "greatest reticence" that the smoke had risen to 15,000 feet. 129 That same day, 210 B-17s unable to bomb their primary target, the synthetic oil plant at Ruhland, diverted to their secondary target, Dresden. Using H2X, they dropped 461 tons of bombs, all high explosives, on the stricken city.130 In all, the planes under Spaatz's command had flown 521 heavy-bomber sorties and had dropped 1,232 tons of bombs on Dresden. Their bombs mattered little, for the RAF had already virtually leveled the city. As a result of these raids the AAF official his- tory, relying, in part, on immediate postmission aerial photography, stated, â€œIf casualties were exceptionally high and damage to residential areas great, it was also evident that the city's industrial and transportation establishments had been blotted out."131 The Dresden raids, like earlier missions against Berlin, evoked bitter accusa- tions of terror bombing from the German propaganda machine and strong reac- tion in the neutral press.
