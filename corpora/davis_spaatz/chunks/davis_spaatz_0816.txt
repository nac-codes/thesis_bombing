too far from Directive No. 3, which the CCS had tacitly agreed to at Malta. He complained in a cable to Spaatz that the "insertion of what can be read as indiscriminate bombing of German cities is priority second only to synthetic oil plants." This, said Kuter, would divert too much strength from the effort devoted to submarines, violating the informal agreements reached in Malta between the Army, the AAF, and the Navy on the amount of air effort to be expended on the submersibles. Kuter added that unless intelligence showed that the bombing of German cities would have a dramatic effect on ultimate victory "we are not keeping good faith with the US JCS." He therefore requested the data supporting the decision to add east German cities to bombing priorities. Kuter did not, however, ask that the January 31 directive be rescinded. “It is understood,” he said, “that my questioning of your directive in General Arnold's name does not interfere with current execution of your direc- tive."139 Giles, who had received an information copy of the cable, told Kuter that AAF Headquarters had no information “as to the basis of decision to attack German cities on a continuous number two priority." Giles also noted that AAF Headquarters considered the cities as targets of opportunity that should not retain second priority.140 In his reply to Kuter and Giles on February 14, Spaatz detailed his thoughts on the Bottomley directive and defined current USSTAF strategic policy. He maintained that Bottomley's directive referred only to Bomber Command, and differed in detail from his own instructions to USSTAF, which were intended to be temporary. He had based them on "the premise that the Russian offensive and the maintenance of same was [sic] of primary strategical importance.” His most important contribution to the Soviets' winter offensive, he said, was the contin- ued bombing of oil production facilities. His second most important was the attacking of transportation in major cities fe
