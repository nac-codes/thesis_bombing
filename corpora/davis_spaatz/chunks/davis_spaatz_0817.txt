Since these attacks are primarily aimed at transportation, [emphasis added] it represents no change in priority but merely a change in emphasis from the battle in the West to the battle in the East. As for submarines, Spaatz stated, "It is not considered that this situation has any influence on the amount of effort which will be placed on the submarine system under current directive since attacks are influenced almost entirely by weather areas."142 Giles and Arnold, who did not know exactly how Spaatz's instructions dif- fered from Bottomley's directive, accepted Spaatz's answer on faith.
