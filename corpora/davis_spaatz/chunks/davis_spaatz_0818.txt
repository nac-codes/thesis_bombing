for promiscuous bombing of German cities for the purpose of causing civilian confusion. It has always been our view that the communica- tions objectives in large cities were to be attacked under existing priorities as stated in directive number 3."143 This cable had hardly left Giles's desk when Cowan's front-page story hit the streets of America. Arnold radioed another message to Spaatz: "Complete clarification has become essential to resolve my now existing confusion as to directives and priorities under which the Strategic Air Forces are presently oper- ating." Arnold requested urgent transmission of the text of USSTAF's current operating directive along with any comments Spaatz cared to make.144 Both Giles's and Arnold's cables arrived in Paris after Spaatz had left for the Mediterranean to confer, as he did periodically, with Eaker. Because the situa- tion required speedy response, Frederick Anderson, speaking for Spaatz, replied to the worried communications from the Pentagon.145 To Giles, who passed the messages on to Arnold, Anderson rejoined, â€œIt has always been my policy that civilian populations are not suitable military objectives." Anderson went on to explain the differences between Bottomley's directives and Spaatz's: "Although in general parallel in priorities and issued after mutual consultation, [they] often reflect the difference in capabilities of the two forces. On this occasion, I did not issue a complete new Directive since it was necessary only to change emphasis within the Priorities of Directive Number Three." Finally, Anderson observed that "such changes within the broad framework of formal Directives are almost a daily occurrence to keep abreast of the changing situation."146 Anderson next paraphrased for Giles the current directive to the Eighth Air Force dated January 30, 1945. It differed little from Spaatz's verbal orders to Doolittle on January 28. Visual attacks on oil had first priority, bombing attacks (probably through overcast)
