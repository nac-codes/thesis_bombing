It then became a communications linchpin of the southern part of the Eastern Front. The main rail lines from Leipzig and Berlin joined just outside the city, while the chief rail line to Prague and to Hungary and a main line due east to Breslau radiated from within the city. If the Allies could significantly retard or halt communications through Dresden, the German effort against the Soviets in that sector would weaken, perhaps fatally. Dresden's importance as a communications center made it a legitimate military target. 4. Did the Allied air attacks on Dresden deviate from established bombing policy? They did not. The RAF employed a main-force attack, as it had often done before, which started a fire storm-the intended, but seldom achieved, result of all main-force attacks on city areas.

This attack had been what was popularly known as a deliberate terror attack." Harris said that he knew "that in certain quarters, the value of these area attacks was disputed. Pforzheim was a town which contained innumerab
