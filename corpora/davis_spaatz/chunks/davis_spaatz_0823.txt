hat was popularly known as a deliberate terror attack." Harris said that he knew "that in certain quarters, the value of these area attacks was disputed. Pforzheim was a town which contained innumerable small workshops for the manufacture of precision instruments. This attack must have destroyed the 'home-work' of the population and their equipment." Harris finished by not- ing, "Bomber Command had now destroyed 63 German towns in this fash- ion."160 Of the 389 main-force attacks and 482,437 tons of bombs the RAF sent against German towns, Dresden had received only a single raid and 2,978 tons of bombs. In comparison, the RAF subjected Berlin to 24 main-force attacks (49,400 tons of bombs) and Essen to 28 such attacks (39,907 tons of bombs). 161 Nor did the American attack on Dresden deviate from established AAF pol- icy. Long after the war, in 1969, Spaatz succinctly stated his and USSTAF's rea- soning during this period, "When the Dresden operation came down, we bombed the military targets ... some marshaling yards. This is what we did. Now maybe some of the bombs fell on Dresden, but the target was a military target." Only one-third of the Eighth Air Force, carrying a high but not unusual percentage of incendiary bombs, attacked Dresden. As usual, when confronted with less-than-adequate visual conditions, the Eighth resorted to H2X to make its drops, which, assuming 30 to 50 percent cloud cover and standard accuracy, meant that only 30 percent of the bombs fell within half a mile of aiming points. 162 Following standard procedures, the B-17s had aimed for Dresden's marshaling yards located in the center of the city, and therefore dropped a good many bombs on the already devastated residential area. The Dresden raid was business as usual for the Eighth Air Force in the winter of 1944â€“1945. U.S. Bombing Policy during the Winter of 1944-1945 The Dresden mission, however, did highlight USSTAF's use of incendiary bombs and blind-bombing techniques over major German to
