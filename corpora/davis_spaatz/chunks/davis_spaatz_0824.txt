e winter of 1944â€“1945. U.S. Bombing Policy during the Winter of 1944-1945 The Dresden mission, however, did highlight USSTAF's use of incendiary bombs and blind-bombing techniques over major German towns and cities. The U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe freely employed both over German cities but rarely over cities in German-occupied Europe. One week after Dresden and after the Cowan story as well, Frederick Anderson informed the RAF Director of Bomber Operations, "It is the policy of the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe to limit attacks to military objectives and to use precision bombing tech- niques. When weather conditions preclude visual bombing, military objectives in Germany proper suitable for 'bombing through overcast' technique are selected for attack." Then Anderson differentiated between Germany proper and German-occupied territory: "Under normal conditions it is not our policy to attack targets in enemy occupied territory unless the target can be identified by visual means."163 564   ## p. 565 (#589) ############################################  VICTORY The weather of central Europe forced the Americans to develop a technologi- cal alternative to precision daylight bombing, which, except for fairly accurate short-range systems such as Gee-H and Oboe, meant H2X. H2X was, of course, inaccurate and fit only for locating large cities. Without H2X the Eighth Air Force could operate for only a handful of days in the fall and winter. During the fourth quarter of 1944, Berlin had only seven days of visual (less than 50 percent cloud cover) bombing weather; Munich, southern Germany, and southern Austria had five days; and central and western Germany had only three days of visual weather. Adding days of visually assisted weather (50 percent to 80 percent cloud cover or more than 80 percent with large local breaks in the clouds) doubled these numbers.164 The AAF could not justify a force of 2,000 bombers if it flew only once or twice a month. Hence, inaccurate
