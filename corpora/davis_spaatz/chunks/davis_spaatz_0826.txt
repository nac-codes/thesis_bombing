The Eighth did not even employ fire bombs against oil tar- gets, which postwar studies indicate could well have suffered worse damage if a higher percentage had been included in the mix of bombs dropped on them.168 Incendiary bombs had one function-the destruction of soft targets, that is, houses, commercial buildings, and administrative/governmental offices. In March 1945, the Eighth Air Force conducted a bombing campaign against German military bases, including barracks (Kasernes), the closest military equivalent to the civilian structures just mentioned.
