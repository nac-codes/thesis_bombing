Examination of the Eighth's attacks on Berlin from March 1944 to March 1945 and of those in France during May and June 1944 show a dramatic contrast in their use of incendiaries. In May 1944, the Eighth's heavy bombers dropped 19,854 tons on France, 745 of them incendiaries. 170 Of these, 685 tons hit German-occupied military airfields, targets by their very nature located at some distance from city areas. In June 1944, 44,209 tons of the Eighth's bombs fell on France, only 103 tons of them incendiaries (dropped mostly on airfields).171 Given Churchill's pressure to limit civilian casualties and destruction in occu- pied countries and the Eighth's policy of employing only visual bombing tech- niques over occupied territory, these figures seem to demonstrate the Eighth's desire and ability to limit damage as much as possible to purely military targets. The bombing of Berlin showed the other side of the coin. From March 4, 1944, to March 18, 1945, the Eighth sent fifteen major missions of at least 700 tons of bombs each, and four minor missions over Berlin. These missions lost 264 aircraft and placed 21,733 tons on the city, including 8,089 tons of incendi- aries or 37 percent of the total, a figure very close to the optimum for maximum destruction of soft targets. Of the four major raids with the least number of incendiaries (less than 20 percent apiece), three including the February 3, 1945, raid used visual bombing methods. More than 90 percent of all bombs fell on three targets: military and civil government areas (12,440 tons, 4,475 tons incen- d
