, three including the February 3, 1945, raid used visual bombing methods. More than 90 percent of all bombs fell on three targets: military and civil government areas (12,440 tons, 4,475 tons incen- diary), railroad stations (5,259 tons, 2,494 tons incendiary), and industrial tar- gets (2,410 tons, 937 tons incendiary).172 Those were legitimate military targets and served as aiming points for the Eighth's bombardiers. Berlin's size and the location of its targets, mostly in the heart of the city, meant that every bomb missing a target hit housing or other nonmilitary targets. On February 26, 1945, all three air divisions of the Eighth-1,135 heavy bombers-attacked three railroad stations with 2,778 tons of bombs, 44 percent of them fire bombs. The Schlesischer, Alexanderplatz, and Berlin-North stations were all located within two miles of the center of Berlin. Using H2X through complete overcast, the mission started large fires and killed many civilians. RAF Mosquito night-intruder bombers attacking twelve hours later reported fires still burning. 173 After the February 26 mission, with its 500,000 fire bomblets, the typical Berliner, with reason, would have been hard put to distinguish between RAF area bombing and AAF precision bombing. A further look at Eighth Air Force operations has revealed two egregious examples of the gap between bombing practice and stated bombing policy: the target categories "city areas" and "marshaling yards." The two most cited Eighth Air Force statistical summaries that cover the entire war do not list a target cate- gory "city areas" or "towns and cities."174 Both summaries were prepared from the same set of data within a month of the end of the war in Europe.
