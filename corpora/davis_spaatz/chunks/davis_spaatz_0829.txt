The Eighth Air Force Monthly Statistical Summary of Operations, gener- ated at the end of each month from May 1944 to April 1945, listed a "city areas" target category. For calendar year 1944, the summary reported that the Eighth dropped 43,611 tons on "city areas."175 Nor did these reports make any bones about their targets. The report for the May 8, 1944, Berlin raid baldly states, "Berlin city area attacked. Bombing raid done through 10/10 undercast on PFF markers. Believed that the center of Berlin was well hit."176 After reaching a high of 9,886 tons (41 percent incendiaries) in July 1944, when the Eighth con- ducted a series of H2X raids on Munich, the monthly "city area" totals steadily declined to 383 tons in December. A summary in a working paper from a USSTAF file, "Review of Bombing Results," shows a similar dichotomy according to time period. From January 1944 through January 1945, the Eighth dropped 45,036 tons on "towns and cities."177 From February 1945 through the end of the war, this summary showed not a single ton of bombs falling on a city area. Unless the Eighth had developed a perfect technique for bombing through overcast, such a result was simply impossible. Obviously, the word had come down to deemphasize reports on civilian damage. For instance, when Anderson cabled Arnold about USSTAF's press policy on the Dresden controversy in February 1945, he noted, â€œPublic rela- tions officers have been advised to take exceptional care that the military nature of targets attacked in the future be specified and emphasized in all cases. As in the past the statement that an attack was made on such and such a city will be avoided; specific targets will be described."178 The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, although not explicitly listing a target category such as cities or towns, had an interesting defi
