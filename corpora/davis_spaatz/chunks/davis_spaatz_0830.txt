ch a city will be avoided; specific targets will be described."178 The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, although not explicitly listing a target category such as cities or towns, had an interesting definition of "industrial areas." The survey placed three types of targets in "industrial areas‚Äù: (1) cities, towns, and urban areas; (2) public utilities (electric, gas, water, and telephone companies); and (3) government buildings. Given that definition the survey even managed to describe RAF area raids as strikes against "industrial targets."179 The target category "marshaling yards" received more of the Eighth's bomb tonnage than any other, somewhere between 175,000 and 200,000 tons of bombs. 180 At least 25 percent of all the Eighth Air Force bombs dropped over Europe fell on "marshaling yards." One-third of the American incendiary bombs dropped over Germany fell on the same system. As a matter of directive and policy for most of the period between September 1944 and April 1945, the same period in which the Eighth delivered 90 percent of the total tonnage dropped on the system, mar- shaling yards had the highest nonvisual bombing priority. During that period the Eighth Air Force dropped 168,038 tons of bombs, 70 percent (117,816 tons) blind and 30 percent (50,222 tons) visually. 181 Postwar research showed that only 2 percent of bombs dropped by nonvisual means landed within 1,000 feet of their aiming points. 182 Rail yards as such, however, were poor targets for incendiaries. If the fire bombs landed directly on or near rail cars, they destroyed 569   ## p. 570 (#594) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE or damaged them; otherwise, they could do little harm to the heavy equipment or trackage. The Eighth realized this. Of the 9,042 tons of bombs dropped on French rail yards, mostly during the pre-OVERLORD transportation bombing phase, when the Americans took scrupulous care to avoid French civilian casual- ties, 90 percent were
