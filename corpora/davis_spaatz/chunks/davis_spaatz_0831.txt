tons of bombs dropped on French rail yards, mostly during the pre-OVERLORD transportation bombing phase, when the Americans took scrupulous care to avoid French civilian casual- ties, 90 percent were visually sighted and only 33 tons were incendiaries. 183 Even over Germany itself, during Operation CLARION, when the Eighth bombed dozens of small yards and junctions in lesser German towns, it dropped, over a two-day period of visual conditions, 7,164 tons of bombs in all, but less than 3 tons of fire bombs, 184 185 In contrast, using H2X, the Eighth pummeled marshaling yards and rail sta- tions in large German cities with high percentages of incendiary bombs. For example, rail targets in at least four major cities garnered the following percent- ages of fire bombs out of all bombs dropped on them: Cologne, 27 percent; Nuremberg, 30 percent; Berlin, 37 percent; and Munich, 41 percent. "Marshaling yards" undoubtedly served as a euphemism for city areas. Because the yards themselves were not good targets for incendiaries, the prime purpose in employing such weapons was to take advantage of the known inaccuracy of H2X bombing in order to maximize the destruction of warehouses, commercial buildings, and residences in the general vicinity of the target. Large numbers of planes scattering their bombs around their mostly unseen and unverifiable aim- ing points surely would cause great collateral damage to any soft structures located nearby. The AAF never officially acknowledged that it had bombed German city areas as a matter of policy. Analysis of the Eighth's bombardment policy, of its employment of incendiary bombs, and of its targeting of "city areas" and "mar- shaling yards" clearly reveals that, despite denials, it did engage in the deliberate bombing of German population centers. There were only two discernible, but important, differences between the AAF's practice and the RAF's admitted pol- icy. First, unlike RAF Bomber Command, under the direction of Harris, the A
