centers. There were only two discernible, but important, differences between the AAF's practice and the RAF's admitted pol- icy. First, unlike RAF Bomber Command, under the direction of Harris, the AAF did not consider city areas its chief and preferred target. Whereas Harris repeatedly and sarcastically scoffed at any other target system as a “panacea,” the AAF preferred to bomb oil and other recognizable and identifiable target systems whenever visual methods would allow. Spaatz correctly believed that the bombing of crucial oil and transportation targets would end the war sooner, with less loss of life, than area bombing. Second, the AAF in Europe never developed, trained for, or employed the specialized fire-raising techniques used by Bomber Command. To do so would have openly acknowledged a city area bombing policy. Under nonvisual bombing conditions (night or heavy overcast), however, the points of attack and the bomb loadings of the RAF and the AAF were virtually indistinguishable, as were their results. Yet American air commanders were neither fools nor hypocrites. Michael S. Sherry far overstates the case when he brands them technological fanatics and speaks of the "evil of American bombing." His pairing them with Adolf Eich- 570   ## p. 571 (#595) ############################################  VICTORY mann, the Nazi S.S. officer responsible for the deaths of millions of Jews because they, like Eichmann, seemed to personify the "banality of evil" and were neither frenzied nor hateful seems particularly overblown.186 The Germans could have stopped the bombing by surrender. The victims of the Holocaust could not stop the slaughter by any means, and their numbers of casualties were vastly greater than the numbers of casualties inflicted by Allied bombing-even if the two types of death are comparable in other respects, which they are not. The contradiction of American bombing was that although the target category "marshaling yards" served as a euphemism for are
