, while the Ninth's medium bombers buzzed up and down the rail lines destroying locomotives and disrupting traffic. More than 3,500 heavy bombers and 4,900 fighters took part. The bombers attacked 219 transportation targets, while the fighters destroyed or damaged 594 locomotives and 3,803 rail cars. 189 Eisenhower's headquarters had requested CLARION in order to assist an offensive by Lt. Gen. William G. Simpson's U.S. Ninth Army, scheduled to begin the night of February 22-23. The Ninth meant to stage an assault crossing of the Ruhr River, clear the Cologne plain, seize Cologne itself, and close up to the Rhine, all of which he accomplished by March 7.

On February 5, Spaatz told Arnold that CLARION was cocked and primed, although he also noted that he no longer expected any single air operation to win the war. 193 The results of CLARION justified Spaatz's caution. The operation, which took place on February 22-23, failed to achieve its lofty goals. It did not precipitate a crisis among the railway workers, overwhelm the Reichsbahn's repair facilities, disrupt the railways enough to affect the front-line troops immediately, or drive home the war t
