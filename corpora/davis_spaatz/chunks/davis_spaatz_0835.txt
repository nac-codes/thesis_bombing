t did not precipitate a crisis among the railway workers, overwhelm the Reichsbahn's repair facilities, disrupt the railways enough to affect the front-line troops immediately, or drive home the war to the German people. CLARION did, however, destroy a consider- able amount of rolling stock and lowered the throughput capacity of several main rail lines for the duration of the war. The operation added further strain and attrition to a system already collapsing from the cumulative effects of the destruction being rained upon it.194 Although Anderson probably spoke for all of USSTAF when, a month later, he proclaimed it "singularly effective,”195 nei- ther USSTAF nor the rest of the Allied airmen repeated the operation—first, because it required a special set of weather conditions and, second, because it required all Allied air forces to give up their primary missions to concentrate on a special project with unquantifiable results. CLARION did provide a side benefit for the AAF, however the opportunity for USSTAF to stage a press blitz to counteract the reporting of the Dresden bombing. USSTAF had a United Press correspondent at Eighth Air Force to cover the planning; briefed the press in London and Paris; sent a planeload of reporters to front-line fields to cover the story; sent its own combat camera crews out to get movie and still footage of the operation, which it promptly released; and gained a fifteen-minute news spot on the domestic U.S. National Broadcasting Company network. 196 Each day from February 19 through March 4 the Eighth sent out more than 1,000 heavy bombers. With the exception of CLARION, which consumed two pre- cious days of visual bombing, the rest of the attacks-including a massive one on Berlin (February 26) and others on the communications centers at Munich (February 25), Leipzig (February 27), Halle (February 27), and Chemnitz (March 3)-used combinations of mostly radar and some visual bombing.197 In February the Luftwaffe mounted only one in
