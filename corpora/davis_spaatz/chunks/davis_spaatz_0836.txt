ULTRA intercepts showed that by the end of January the Luftwaffe had transferred 800 single-engine fighters to the east.198 Nonetheless, Allied intelli- gence noted darkly that German jets had begun to attack in numbers and forma- 572   ## p. 573 (#597) ############################################  VICTORY tions, indicating that problems in their deployment and tactics may have been solved. 199 February repeated the pattern of January when the Luftwaffe, heavily committed to the Battle of the Bulge and the Soviet offensive, had, for the most part, failed to oppose strategic bombing missions. Of course, in January, 75 per- cent of the Eighth's bomber effort went for tactical targets to aid the ground forces rather than to dislocate Germany's economy.200 The Eighth lost 314 bombers (49 to fighters) in January 1945 and another 227 bombers (14 to fighters) in February,201 The Fifteenth did not lose a single bomber to fighters in either month, although overall it suffered heavy bomber losses (88 in January and 147 in February).202 USSTAF lost large numbers of bombers to flak when it attacked targets defended by men and mat√©riel released from other parts of Hitler's shrinking domain. The 24 bombers lost to flak over Berlin on February 3 amounted to almost 15 percent of the month's total lost to antiaircraft fire. Even as Germany fell from the precipice, its defenses still func- tioned. In February, freed from the support requirements imposed by the Battle of the Bulge, the Eighth renewed its all-out war on Germany's economy. It fielded missions on twenty days in February, a
