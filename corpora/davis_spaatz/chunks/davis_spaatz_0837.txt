tioned. In February, freed from the support requirements imposed by the Battle of the Bulge, the Eighth renewed its all-out war on Germany's economy. It fielded missions on twenty days in February, as did the Fifteenth. These raids, plus those of Bomber Command, lowered German Bergius and Fischer-Tropsch pro- cess oil production from 37,000 to 13,000 tons a month, less than 4 percent of January's 1944 figure.203 For the month, USSTAF dropped more than 74,400 tons, including some 54,000 tons on transportation targets, while Bomber Command added another 45,900.204 The German economy, gravely weakened by the loss of Silesian industry and coal, Hungarian natural oil, and Polish syn- thetic oil, and with its railcars creaking to a halt, collapsed under this rain of bombs. "By the end of February," stated the AAF official history, "Nazi Germany was no longer an industrial nation."205 In March the twin titans of USSTAF and Bomber Command piled Ossa on Pelion, ranging over all parts of Germany. They dropped a wartime monthly high of almost 170,000 tons of death and destruction on the nearly prostrate Germans; USSTAF contributed 102,000 tons to that total.206 The Soviet army paused in its offensive, except in Hungary and East Prussia, to establish supply lines and organize the large territory they had taken from the Germans. The Western Allies drove the Nazis from the Rhineland and the Palatinate. After capturing the Ludendorff Bridge across the Rhine at Remagen on March 7, the Americans rapidly built up a strong bridgehead. In the last week of March, Montgomery's 21 Army Group crossed the Rhine, while Bradley's 12th Army Group and Devers's 6th Army Group broke out of their Rhine bridgeheads. By April 1, Montgomery's and Bradley's troops linked up at Lippstadt, sur- rounding the Ruhr and pocketing an entire German army group. This group sur- rendered on April 18, yielding 317,000 prisoners of war. In the meantime the Allies had continued their drive east to the River Elbe,
