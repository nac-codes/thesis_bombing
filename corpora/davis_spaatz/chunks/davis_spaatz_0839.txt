s in March-the only bombers it lost to enemy aircraft for all of 1945.209 On March 11, Spaatz wrote to Giles that because the American jet, the P-80, would not become operational until autumn 1945, the German's "technical advantage must be countered by overwhelming numbers of conventional fight- ers manned by pilots trained to both outthink and outshoot [the enemy]. Spaatz added, "There is little doubt that part, if not all of this force, will be com- mitted to the task of countering our strategic operations as soon as suitable tac- tics have been developed."210 A week later, March 18, Me 262s shot down at least six bombers. The next day, March 19, they made a concentrated attack on another bomber formation, causing Anderson to tell Spaatz, "A touch of the Hun's old cunning and aggres- sive spirit was apparent today."211 In addition, the Americans spotted at least one formation of thirty-six jets, the largest seen up to that time. Allied intelli- gence remarked that the formation "betokened a much more advanced state of development than previous reaction seemed to indicate."212 At the Air Com- manders' Conference on March 21, Doolittle informed the assembled airmen that "the threat which they had been anticipating had now materialized. Jets were now attacking in formations as large as 36 aircraft and were using more effective tactics." He also spoke of new tactics employed by the Germans: "Besides attacking the bombers, they were attacking the fighter escort immedi- ately on penetration in the hope of making them drop their tanks. "The time had come," he said, "for an all-out operation against the G.A.F. by both the Tactical and Strategic Air Forces."213 According to Doolittle, a massive two-day opera- tion to "posthole" jet airfield runways and to drop fragmentation bombs on dis- persal areas would reduce the Luftwaffe to a point at which USSTAF's fighters 574   ## p. 575 (#599) ############################################  VICTORY could engage in offensive operati
