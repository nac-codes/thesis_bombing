mbs on dis- persal areas would reduce the Luftwaffe to a point at which USSTAF's fighters 574   ## p. 575 (#599) ############################################  VICTORY could engage in offensive operations rather than tie themselves to bomber escort. Bottomley expressed some doubt about the necessity of such an operation, but Tedder recommended antiair strikes as soon as the air forces finished their com- mitments to support both Montgomery's assault crossing of the Rhine and the massive paratroop drop planned to assist it.214 In the last week of March the Eighth attacked the German jet airfields, achieving some success. Nevertheless, Doolittle reported at the next Allied Air Commanders' Conference that “the jet strength of the G.A.F. was increasing uncomfortably."215 A discussion of bomber priorities followed. Doolittle reiter- ated that the Eighth's losses to fighters had risen sharply since an “all-time" low in February. At the end, Tedder summed up the feeling of the airmen present, including Spaatz, "that more effort should be directed against the G.A.F. to pro- vide greater immunity to the Eighth Air Force, the Army, and supply aircraft.”216 As Tedder apparently realized, the Allies had such overwhelming superiority they could easily spare more effort to extinguish the Luftwaffe completely. Spaatz did not spend all of March worrying about the Luftwaffe's relatively feeble efforts. Other events gave him the opportunity to play the diplomat. During CLARION and again in early March, AAF units accidentally bombed Switzerland. An attack on February 22 on Schaffhausen which killed sixteen persons, and the attacks of March 4 on the Basel marshaling yards (fortunately, only nine heavy bombers dropped 21.5 tons by visual means) and on the "indus- trial area" of Zurich (heavy bombers using H2X dropped 12.7 tons of bombs) naturally created a furor. The February 22 attack had provoked Marshall to cable Eisenhower, "Will you please have someone look into this and let me know
