Four days after his return from Bern, Spaatz received official word of his nomination as a full four-star general with date of rank from March 11, making him senior, by one day, to Bradley. The news found him seated at the poker table in his headquarters near Paris. Eisenhower's naval aide, Captain Butcher, described Spaatz's reaction.

He would not make any recommendations to the President, however, until he had decided on what other four-star promotions to send forward.227 The same day, Eisenhower told Kuter, "no one
