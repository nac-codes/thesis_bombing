, the head of the Manhattan Project, Maj. Gen. Leslie R. Groves, asked Spaatz to bomb it. The Eighth sent 675 bombers with more than 1,400 tons of ordnance against it. Covering the true purpose of its mission by attacking the headquarters of the German army in nearby Zossen, the Eighth unleashed 672 additional bombers. Both missions succeeded in damaging their targets. All above-ground structures of the uranium plant were destroyed and the attack at Zossen incapacitated the Chief of the German General Staff, General Heinz Guderian.230 579   ## p. 580 (#604) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE The Eighth maintained its plans of operation, encountering no substantial interference. On March 15, Doolittle reported that only a deficiency of mainte- nance personnel limited his operations, not the Luftwaffe.231 As the Allied air- men watched the German economy wither under their assaults, they shifted their operations to targets not yet bombed to complete devastation. On March 13, Spaatz observed to Marshall, "There is much evidence that the German railroad system is becoming more and more demoralized, and that their [sic] oil position has almost reached the starvation point."232 The Allies' land advances in the west and the east, their violations of Swiss territory, and their discovery that the Germans had begun to shift large numbers of POWs still in their hands to the south, forced the Eighth in early March to close "the era of unrestricted straf- ing," much to the relief of American fighter pilots, who had suffered most of their casualties from light flak on low-level missions. They would now fly spe- cific strafing missions instead of free-lancing.233 By midmonth, Spaatz informed Washington of a change in priorities: "We have our strategic program well in hand and are shifting the emphasis of our attacks closer to the Ground Forces, first to help them across the Rhine and then to exploit the crossing."234 At the beginning of
