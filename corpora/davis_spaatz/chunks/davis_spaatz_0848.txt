He also said that he could never agree to such reasoning: Attacks on cities like any other act of war are intolerable unless they are strate- gically justified. But they are strategically justified in so far as they tend to shorten the war and so preserve the lives of Allied soldiers. To my mind, we have absolutely no right to give them up unless it is certain that they will not have that effect.

Besides, he pointed out, technical factors, such as a shortage of high-explosive bombs but ample supplies of incendiaries also meant either continuing area bombing or standing down the entire force. Finally, Harris mentioned Japan. "Are we going to bomb their cities flat" to help the army?
