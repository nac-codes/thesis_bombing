Spaatz added hopefully, "Wherever suitable, CLARION low altitude, small formation technique should be used to obtain maxi- mum effectiveness."248 At last, on April 12, Spaatz and Bottomley, after consulting Tedder, agreed on a final directive, Strategic Directive No. 4, which brought the strategic air war in Europe to a close. The top priority mission of the strategic air forces was "to give direct assistance to the land campaign." Operations to support the Soviet armies would occur only if directly requested by the Soviet High Command. Second pri- ority went to oil supplies, particularly gasoline in storage depots, enemy lines of communications, and "such other missions as may be requested by the Supreme Commanders." The directive next allowed policing attacks against the Luftwaffe and provided that the marginal effort would remain concentrated on U-boats. The area bombing catchall category "Important Industrial Areas" disappeared, as did the requirement to support clandestine intelligence activities.249 582   ## p. 583 (#607) ############################################    War's End.
