ts last raid on the Berlin area, German jets shot down 10 bombers, their highest single day's toll.254 The war in Europe had not yet ended for Spaatz. After witnessing the German surrender to the British and Americans at Reims on May 7, at Eisen- hower's behest, he accompanied Tedder to Berlin for the German surrender to the Soviets. The C-47 carrying Tedder, Spaatz, French General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, their assistants, and press representatives, left Reims airfield at 8:25 A.M. on May 8 and landed first at an ex-Luftwaffe field held by the Ameri- cans at Stendal, near the Elbe River.

At first, they refused to allow either Spaatz or de Lattre de Tassigny to sign but eventually relented. At 11:00 P.M., the Soviets presented the terms to the German plenipotentiaries, headed by Field Marshal Keitel, who signed after some momentary and pointless haggling.256 Pandem
