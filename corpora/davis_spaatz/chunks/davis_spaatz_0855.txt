g units, 20 percent of the German total. Overall, Anglo-American air power in Europe dropped 2,700,000 tons of bombs, flew 1,440,000 bomber sorties and 2,680,000 fighter sorties, and reached peaks of 1,300,000 men and 28,000 aircraft in combat commands.10 Spaatz drove home a strategic air offensive that had faltered from lack of resources. From January 1, 1944, through May 8, 1945, he wielded a weapon of frightful power. That a single modern strategic multiple warhead missile, or a nuclear missile submarine, or a strategic bomber can each carry several times the one megaton dropped by USSTAF in no way diminishes the issues raised by Spaatz's direction of the U.S. strategic bomber offensive. He more than any other person must bear the responsibility and consequences for the application of U.S. strategic air power to Germany. Some analysts have criticized the selection of targets. Maj. Gen. Haywood S. Hansell, Jr., one of the AAF's chief strategic and targeting planners, who par- ticipated in both AWPD/1 and AWPD/42 and led a B-29 bomber command against Japan, has faulted the failure to bomb the eight grinding-wheel manufac- turing plants* and electric power generation network.11 The United States Strategic Bombing Survey suggested that an investment of 12,000 to 15,000 tons per month on German transportation targets beginning in February 1944 instead of September 1944 would have caused the German war economy to col- lapse months earlier, in time for the effect of that collapse to be fully felt by the troops at the front. Although such arguments presuppose more detailed intelli- gence and more accurate intelligence evaluation than were available, their pro- ponents were correct in concluding that the strategic bombing effort could have been employed more efficiently, but only if Spaatz had been free to operate in a vacuum, with no necessity to respond to the bureaucratic, institutional, and oper- ational forces surrounding him. From March through July 1944, the needs
