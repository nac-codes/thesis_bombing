only if Spaatz had been free to operate in a vacuum, with no necessity to respond to the bureaucratic, institutional, and oper- ational forces surrounding him. From March through July 1944, the needs of OVERLORD and the beachhead undermined USSTAF's ability to conduct unfettered strategic bombing. Once Spaatz and Doolittle had obtained a measure of air superiority through their aggressive use of long-range escort fighters, the all-consuming bureaucratic bat- * The loss of abrasive grinding wheels would have crippled the German armaments industry by denying it the ability to machine metal castings such as gun barrels, shells, and crankshafts. 588   ## p. 589 (#613) ############################################  ASSESSMENT tle between the oil and transportation plans began. Having committed himself to the oil plan, Spaatz could hardly shift gears by pointing to other target systems even more likely to bring the Nazis to heel without appearing fickle or foolish.

In the summer of 1944, USSTAF crushed the German oil industry and, by September 14, was able to bomb where it willed, but nature robbed the strategic bombing campaign of its opportunity. Four months of bad weather did not pro- vide enough days of visual bombing to strike and restrike, if necessary, the oil plants, let alone other target systems requiring precise bombing.

By the end of January 1945 no new industrial target system would have made a significant difference. On the basis of performance, the American strategic bombing campaign ful- filled three-quarters of the Casablanca directive: it brou
