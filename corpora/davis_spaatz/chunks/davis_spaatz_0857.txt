industrial target system would have made a significant difference. On the basis of performance, the American strategic bombing campaign ful- filled three-quarters of the Casablanca directive: it brought about "the progres- sive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial, and economic system;" it did not, however, undermine the morale of the German people. The oil campaign of the summer of 1944 was the fulfillment of the prewar doctrines of precision bombardment. American strategic bombers selected an indispens- able military target system (oil shortages had a far greater effect on German armed forces than on German industry), attacked it by visual means, and brought aviation gasoline production to a virtual halt by September 1944. That was what American heavy bombers were supposed to do. The transportation campaign demonstrated the triumph of wartime necessity over prewar theory. Spaatz had produced an almost all-weather force of limited accuracy. The constant cloud cover during the autumn of 1944 negated any hope of consistent precision bombing-hence the selection of the marshaling yards, a target system of more economic than military importance. Any significant break- down of the German wartime economy would eventually have dramatic conse- quences at the front line. Employing bombing-through-clouds techniques, often partially assisted by visual means, USSTAF bombed out the marshaling yards, wrecked the coal transportation nexus, and brought German industry to its knees. The U.S. strategic bombing effort inflicted severe, if not fatal, damage to the German military and German war economy. Independently, the effort did not defeat Germany, as air power advocates had hoped. The slow buildup of forces, thanks in part to the bottleneck in Anglo-American shipping availability, the diversion of strength to the Pacific and the Mediterranean, operational difficul- ties, intelligence errors that led to overestimation of damage inflicted, and debates conc
