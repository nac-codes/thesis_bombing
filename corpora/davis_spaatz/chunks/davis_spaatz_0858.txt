shipping availability, the diversion of strength to the Pacific and the Mediterranean, operational difficul- ties, intelligence errors that led to overestimation of damage inflicted, and debates concerning targeting prevented the most efficient application of air power to crucial sectors of the German war economy. However, what the bomb- ing did accomplish was substantial in contributing to Germany's defeat.

In a war in which the effort of civilian workers on the production lines was as essential to victory as the fighting of soldiers on the front lines, the very existence of the strategic bombing offensive encouraged U.S. and British civilians and inflicted pain and suffering on the enemy. The British may have devoted 40 to 50 percent of their total war production to the air forces; the U.S. expended up to 35 percent; and the Germans up to 40 percent. German war production increased throughout the war, reaching its peak in the third quarter of 1944. Strategic air bombardment undoubtedly kept that increase from going higher still. It forced the dispersion of factories and the building of underground facilities, made German production more vulnerable to transportation disruption, lowered production by forcing smaller, more labor-intensive production units which denied the Germans the manufacturing economies of scale available to their enemies, disorganized work- ers' lives, and probably lowered their productivity. In ways great and smallâ€” and utterly incalculable-strategic bombing made German war production less efficient and less effective than it would have been if the bombers had not flown night after night and day after day. Strategic bombing also forced the Germans into an enormous defense and reconstruction effort, diverting the
