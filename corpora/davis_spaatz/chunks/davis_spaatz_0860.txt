Strategic bombing did not achieve the last task imposed by the Casablanca 590   ## p. 591 (#615) ############################################  ASSESSMENT directive: undermining "the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance" was fatally weakened. In its pursuit of that goal, chiefly by means of city or area bombing, Allied strategic bombing raised ques- tions of moral and ethical significance. During the war, area bombing was ques- tioned on the floor of Parliament, first by the bishop of Chichester in February 1944, and then by Richard Stokes in March 1945. Twenty-five years ago David Irving resurrected the ghosts of Dresden. One recent critic has written of the "evil of American bombing," calling it a "sin of a peculiarly modern kind because it seemed so inadvertent, seemed to have involved so little choice."13 Another has noted, "The most important factor moving the AAF toward Douhetian war was the attitude of the country's top civilian and military leaders," specifically blam- ing Arnold, Marshall, Eisenhower, Lovett, Stimson, and Roosevelt, but not Spaatz, as responsible for the shift to area bombing. 14 These critics and many others have recoiled at a policy that resulted in the death of more than 300,000 persons. It was the RAF that conducted most of the area bombing and, like the AAF, the RAF resorted to it because weaknesses in its operational technique left it no choice. Bomber Command persisted in area bombing after it had developed an accuracy surpassing even visual bombing, as practiced by USSTAF. To belabor the enemy with the only weapon available was one thing, but to continue to use it when better means were at hand delayed the end of the war and needlessly killed tens of thousands. If the RAF earned any blame for its conduct of the air war, it was for its area bombing conducted after June 1944. In the autumn
