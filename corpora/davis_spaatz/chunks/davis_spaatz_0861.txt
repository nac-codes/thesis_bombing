and delayed the end of the war and needlessly killed tens of thousands. If the RAF earned any blame for its conduct of the air war, it was for its area bombing conducted after June 1944. In the autumn of 1944 and the following winter, the AAF also turned to city bombing, ostensibly to destroy the rail yards. Lowering of morale, although sel- dom mentioned, was almost certainly an added and hoped-for consequence. In contrast to RAF bombing, AAF nonvisual bombing never became particularly accurate. Arnold, Lovett, Spaatz, Eisenhower, and Marshall knew that bombing- through-overcast techniques produced wildly imprecise results. If Stimson and Roosevelt did not know, it was because they did not ask. However wrong it may have been, the AAF's area bombing hastened the war's end. The RAF killed its hundreds of thousands, the AAF its tens of thousands. But opprobrium cannot be added up in a ledger book with exact amounts entered in each account. To whom should one assign the guilt for the 125,000 German civilians killed during the Russian storming of Berlin?15 How should one weigh the murder of 325,000 Jews by the SS at the Treblinka death camp between July 28 and September 21, 1942?16 To those who accepted the truism that two wrongs never make a right, then nothing can excuse the area bombing of the Allied strategic campaign no matter how evil the German state. At the other extreme, those who believed that any means justified the end find nothing abhor- rent in area bombing. Between those opinions lies a vast middle ground. Area bombing cannot be examined as a separate, unique phenomenon judged only by numbers of missions flown and bombs dropped versus people killed.
