is per- haps the only man that I have ever been closely associated with whom I have never known to make a bad decision." According to Doolittle, it was soundness of judgment that earned Spaatz Eisen- hower's trust. 19 Spaatz must be ranked as one of the premier airmen of World War II with Harris and Tedder. Spaatz commanded the largest heavy-bomber force of all time at the same time he had de facto control over two large tactical air forces. No other airman of the war had so vast an operational responsibility. His com- bined force was three times larger than that commanded by Harris, the British strategic bomber commander. Like Harris, Spaatz eventually resorted to a type of area bombing, but never with the unseemly relish of his British counterpart. Spaatz's effort was directed at a particular target system, rail yards, unlike Harris's which was aimed at the broad target category of industrial areas. Although Spaatz was more cooperative with his superiors than Harris, he did not gain the amount of respect and admiration from the air crews that Harris didâ€” probably because he eschewed the limelight. No government-sponsored press campaign extolled his efforts at the head of his command. Spaatz did not have the depth of strategic vision or the intellectual bent of Tedder, but he proved a 592   ## p. 593 (#617) ############################################  ASSESSMENT good coalition soldier, and his advocacy of oil was as great a factor in Germany's defeat as Tedder's advocacy of transportation. Coningham, Leigh-Mallory, and Eaker must rank below Spaatz. None of them commanded a force of comparable size. The first two were far too parochial in their views, and their difficult personalities did not fit them for larger roles. Eaker had abilities different from but equal to Spaatz's. He was more outgoing, articulate, and technologically interested in his trade. Eaker made an excellent coalition soldier, cooperating loyally with Wilson and Slessor in the Mediterranean. Fro
