s. His years of experience with mossbacked ground force and naval officers and his own ignorance of and antipathy toward ground matters gave him little appreciation of military problems other than those dealing directly with air. Spaatz did poorly at Leavenworth; the curriculum of its Command and General Staff School concentrated almost solely on ground prob- lems. Spaatz's judgment was not infallible. Passionate beliefs in the doctrine of precision bombing and in the independence of air power served him well in the great strategic debates revolving around air power, but they limited his ability to judge questions affecting the combined roles of all the services. He opposed the North African invasion because it weakened and delayed the strategic offensive 594   ## p. 595 (#619) ############################################  ASSESSMENT against Germany. He shared an unwarranted optimism with Eisenhower and Eisenhower's staff as to the feasibility of an invasion of France in 1942 or 1943. Given the poor initial performance of U.S. forces in French North Africa and the far greater resources that would have been available to the German defenders, such an invasion could only have resulted in disaster-as the British, based on their intelligence, argued. Even in mid-1943 Spaatz so overrated the effective- ness of his bombers that he boasted to Arnold that he could defeat Germany if only he could consistently get 200 heavy bombers airborne for each mission. Two years later, six or seven times that number could still not bring about Germany's fall without the help of a tremendous ground campaign. Spaatz's appreciation of OVERLORD was flawed as well. As an airman he doubted that the resources and mat√©riel expended on it justified its cost. He mis- trusted the ground forces' fighting capacity-without the support of facts. Similarly, in the operations before the Normandy breakout, he and the other air- men failed to understand fully the problems faced by the Army. Their criticism
