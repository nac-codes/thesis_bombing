e plan could not guarantee air superiority, and it implied that U.S. heavy bombers would serve under a British commander who did not sufficiently value strategic bom- bardment. Predictably, Spaatz rejected it out of hand. Even if his and Leigh- Mallory's personalities had meshed perfectly, he would have fought the plan because of its mishandling of strategic bombers and stifling of AAF pretensions to autonomy. Spaatz's fight against the transportation plan delayed its imposi- 595   ## p. 596 (#620) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE tion and resulted in its modification. As a result, attritional air battles over Germany were ensured and an effective bridge-busting campaign was launched, which, even the transportation plan's supporters admitted, added to its success. The oil plan, as all observers recognized, was Spaatz's finest moment. It ruined the Luftwaffe as a viable air force and dashed the weapon of mobility from the hands of the German ground forces. He selected a compact, crucial, vulnerable system of targets and pursued it relentlessly. Unfortunately, the oil campaign was only one of two such efforts mounted by the strategic bomber forces; Harris pursued his area bombing of German cities with equal tenacity. Spaatz's experiences in training and operations made him an excellent combat commander. Building on the foundation prepared by Eaker, Spaatz established the Eighth Air Force in Britain. He did not commit it to action until he was sure that he had at least trained it adequately, building on the little it had been given in the States. Similarly, in North Africa, he set up the Northwest African Training Command to bring his crews closer to the standards of his Allies and opponents. Yet his insistence on thorough training for and maximum performance by his air crews led directly to the ultimate irony of the strategic campaign. Given the technology available to him, Spaatz helped to produce a nearly all-weather for
