seen the ovens of the Third Reich still operating and the combat- ants of both sides still suffering in battle lines throughout Europe. That the war in Europe ended when it did is reason enough to place Spaatz in the front rank of the Allied leaders of World War II. 596   ## p. 597 (#621) ############################################  Although Spaatz's war in Europe ended with the German surrender in Berlin, his service to his country continued. On July 29, 1945, he arrived on the island of Guam to assume command of the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, which included the Mariana Islands-based Twentieth Air Force, under Lt. Gen. Nathan F. Twining, and the Eighth Air Force, still under Lt. Gen. James H. Doolittle and soon to be based on the island of Okinawa. After receiving authorization from President Harry S. Truman and General George C. Marshall, Spaatz ordered the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Three weeks later, on September 1, 1945, Spaatz stood on the deck of the USS Missouri to witness the surrender of the last of the Axis powers. He was the only U.S. military officer to attend all three surrenders, the first in Reims, the second in Berlin, and the third in Tokyo Bay. After the war, Spaatz succeeded General Henry H. Arnold as Commanding General, U.S. Army Air Forces. From that post he directed the AAF's campaign to separate itself from the Army. When the U.S. Air Force was established by Congress in September 1947, Spaatz became its first Chief of Staff. He retired in April 1948. Shortly thereafter, he became a columnist on military matters for Newsweek magazine. He worked for Newsweek until 1961, when, at the age of seventy, he retired again. Spaatz died on July 14, 1974. He is buried at the U.S. Air Force Academy, whose site he helped to select, in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 597   ## p. 598 (#622) ############################################    ## p. 599 (#623) ############################################  Statistical Appendice
