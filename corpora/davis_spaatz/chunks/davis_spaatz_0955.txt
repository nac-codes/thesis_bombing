Patton has been the subject of numerous biographies. One of the most illuminating publi- cations on his military thought and actions is Martin Blumenson, The Patton Papers (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1972-1974), in two vol- umes. These volumes are mostly in Patton's own words and they admirably reveal his mili- tary actions and philosophy. For the general's personal side, see Ladislas Farago, Patton: Ordeal and Triumph (New York: Ivan Obolensky, Inc., 1963); and Martin Blumenson, Patton: The Man Behind the Legend 1885-1945 (New York: William Morrow, 1985). 41. Howe, Northwest Africa, p. 447. 42. L[ucian] K. Truscott, Command Missions: A Personal Story (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1954), pp. 144-145. In contrast to the proliferation of material on Patton, almost noth- ing has been written on Fredendall's character or personality. Truscott, who served as Eisen- hower's representative at the front, had ample opportunity to observe Fredendall for his entire tour as commander of II Corps and to form a firsthand opinion. 43.
