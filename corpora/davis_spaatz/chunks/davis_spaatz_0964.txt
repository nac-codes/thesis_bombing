Anderson, subj: Revision of Training Literature, May 8, 1943, NARA, RG 165, OPD- 384, Case 39, box 1305. Colonel Anderson attempted to eliminate AGF coordination by insisting that input to revisions of an AAF man- ual need come only from the AAF. Brig. Gen. Hull overruled him, noting that revisions need not be unanimous. Anderson later gained much experience in air-ground cooperation as the commander of IX Bomber Command, a unit of medium bombers assigned to assist Lt. Gen. Omar Bradley's 12th Army Group during the campaign in northwestern Europe. 128. Memo for the Chief of Staff from Lt. Gen.
