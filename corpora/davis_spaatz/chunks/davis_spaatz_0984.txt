The narrative by the RAF Historical Section was prepared exclusively from original security-classified documentation. The bulk of its documentation comes from the Papers of Air Chief Marshal Leigh-Mallory, which have since found their way from the Air Ministry to the Public Records Office. It is probably the best, if not the only, history of the AEAF and presents the views of Leigh-Mallory clearly and accu- rately. 63. Terraine, A Time for Courage, p. 196. 64. Russell F.
