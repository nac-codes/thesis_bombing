#############  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Fighters, May 22, 1943, and rpt, Doolittle to Arnold, subj: Long Range Fighters, May 23, 1943, both in Doolittle Papers, box 19. In these documents Doolittle speaks of sending fighters on low-level sweeps ahead of escorted bomber formations to catch enemy aircraft on their fields and to strafe and bomb the fields. He implied an aggressive stance on the part of the escorting fighters by noting their capabilities of either preventing attacking fighters from "get- ting set" or of driving away heavily armored twin-engine fighters. 69.
