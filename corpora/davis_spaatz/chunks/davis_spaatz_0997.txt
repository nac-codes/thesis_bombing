See also Itr, Spaatz to Arnold, April 10, 1944, Spaatz Papers, Diary for a detailed history of the development of the USSTAF's ideas on fighter sweeps. As an over- whelming amount of anecdotal evidence demonstrated, U.S. fighter pilots took their briefings literally. They shot at cows in the fields, pedestrians, bicycle riders, farm carts, and any moving civilian or military vehicle. Not surprisingly the German population felt far more resentment toward fighter pilots, who appeared to make personalized attacks directed against individual Germans, than against bomber crews who killed, unseen, thousands of people from 20,000 or more feet up. Anecdotal evidence also suggests more retaliation by the German civil population against shot down fighter pilots than against bomber crews. 128.
