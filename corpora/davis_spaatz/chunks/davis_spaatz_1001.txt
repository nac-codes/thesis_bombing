Craven and Cate, Argument to V-E Day, pp. 306-307. 202. Rostow, Pre-Invasion Bombing, p. 148, note 28. Rostow maintains that in a personal conversation with one of the authors of the British Official History of the Strategic Bomber Offensive, Noble Frankland, he was told that Spaatz had confirmed in an interview with Frankland his threat of resignation. In addition, see Hansell, The Air Plan That Defeated Hitler, pp. 235-236. Hansell, who cites no sources, also claims that Spaatz threatened to quit unless he got two days over the oil targets. Conversely, Frankland has stated in a letter to this author dated January 3, 1986 that he has no record in his interviews of Spaatz confirming the resigna- tion threat. Frankland wrote, "Whether or not he [Spaatz] threatened to resign his command over the issue I do not know." 203. Entry for April 19, 1944, Command Diary, Spaatz Papers, Diary. 204. Ibid. 205.
