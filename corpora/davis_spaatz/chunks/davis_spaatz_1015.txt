acy for the last year of the war. Much of this improvement came from Bomber Command's use of electronic bombing aids, such as Oboe and Gee-H, whose accuracy surpassed that of the American-employed H2X. For similar cov- erage and a comparison of the average bomb weight carried by U.S. and British heavy bombers, see the Report of the British Bombing Survey Unit (BBSU), "The Strategic Air War Against Germany 1939–1945” (London: BBSU, 1947), pp. 42–50.

Although it was certainly written as a justification of Bradley's actions during the period, it seems entirely too polished and knowledgeable for a document written at the time and under stressful circumstan
