h it was certainly written as a justification of Bradley's actions during the period, it seems entirely too polished and knowledgeable for a document written at the time and under stressful circumstances. I assume this memo was written some time after the event, perhaps soon after the war, and inserted in the files, probably by Hanson, Bradley's personal aide-de-camp. It was proba- bly written closer in time to the actual events than Bradley's 1951 memoirs and is at least as authentic. See also Bradley, A Soldier's Story, p. 339. 61.

Bradley says Spaatz at- tended, but Vandenberg's diary implies that Spaatz did not attend. I could find no record in Spaatz's papers to confirm his presence.
