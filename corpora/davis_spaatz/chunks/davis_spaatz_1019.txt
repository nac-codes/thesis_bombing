An absolutely fair comparison of bombing accuracy between the two forces would have to account for such factors as opposition over tar- get, escort, weather over target, distance to the target, and availability and type of electronic aiming assistance. The following figures, which convey only a very rough measure of the Eighth's and Fifteenth's accuracy, are from the forces' final statistical reports (Statistical Summary of Eighth Air Force Operations, 17 August 1942-8 May 1945, prepared June 10, 1945.
