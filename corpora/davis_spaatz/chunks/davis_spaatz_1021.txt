Weigley, Eisenhower's Lieutenants, p. 204. Hamilton, Master of the Battlefield, p. 785, contains a misleading account of the Eighth's performance on August 8. In this hagiography of Montgomery the author claims that, after the brilliant initial Canadian breakout, bombers of Spaatz's Eighth Air Force ran amok, bombing their own troops and causing more casualties than on the first day of COBRA, when Collins had to close down the offensive and start again the following day. 136.
