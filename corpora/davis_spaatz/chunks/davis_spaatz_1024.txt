Carl Spaatz, 23 September 1944," Spaatz Papers, Diary. 48. Ibid. A list of "Relative Priorities" is attached to Spaatz's copy of the directive. For an example of how quickly these relative priori- ties would shift in the light of new perceptions, see TLM/F/S.34, "Notes of the 100th Air Commanders' Conference," September 26, 1944, Spaatz Papers, Diary. 49.
