This notation is signed C. S. [Carl Spaatz]. 106. Spaatz may have recalled portions of the prewar AWPD/1 plan in connection with bomb- ing Berlin. AWPD/1 (tab. 3, p. 3) had stated, in August 1941, "Immediately after some very apparent results of air attacks on the material objective listed above [power plants, oil, and transportation] or immediately after some major set-back of the German ground forces, it may become highly profitable to deliver a large scale, all-out attack on the civil population of Berlin. In this event, any or all of the bombard- ment forces may be diverted for this mission." See also interview, Gen. Carl A.
