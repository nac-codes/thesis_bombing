The bombing of Dresden has given birth to a large body of literature, both of accusation and justification. In addition to the previously cited works by David Irving and Alexander McKee, both highly critical of Allied policy, one should read the official AAF historical study on Dresden, "Historical Analysis of the 14-15 February 1945 Bombing of Dresden," prepared by Chief Historian Charles Angell in 1953, which can be found in the AF/CHO Dresden Subject File; and Melden E. Smith, "The Bombing of Dresden Reconsidered: A Study in Wartime Decision Making," unpub- lished Ph.D. dissertation, Boston University, 1971. 128.
