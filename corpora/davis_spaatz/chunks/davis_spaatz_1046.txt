For AAF numbers I have used what is considered the definitive War Department/Department of the Army casualty report. See Department of the Army, Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, "Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths in World War II, Final Report, 7 December 1941-31 December 1946" (Washington, D.C.: Depart- ment of the Army, June 1, 1953), pp. 84-88. Unfortunately, this publication does not break down casualties by numbered air force or lower AAF unit. See p. 5 of the work for a summary chart which reveals that, overall, the AAF suf- fered 52,173 deaths among battle casualties. Nor does the AAF have comprehensive casualty reports for World War II-era numbered air forces and smaller units. For the Eighth Air Force, the Eighth Air Force Association offers a figure of approximately 26,000 deaths. Kenneth P. Werrell in â€œThe Strategic Bombing of Ger- many in World War II: Costs and Accomplish- ments," The Journal of American History LXXIII (December 1986), p. 708, cites a figure of 29,000 deaths for USSTAF in Europe. This seems reasonable. Accurate casualty figures for the Fifteenth Air Force might well show that the organization made a more substantial con- tribution to European losses than is generally acknowledged. For Navy and Marine deaths, see Department of Defense, American Forces Information Service, Defense 91: Almanac (September/October 1991), p. 47, Chart Service Casualties in Major War and Conflicts (as of 733   ## p. 734 (#758) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE September 30, 1990). 5.
