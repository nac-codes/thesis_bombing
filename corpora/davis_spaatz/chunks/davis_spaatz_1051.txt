Papers of Carl Andrew Spaatz These papers, which comprise 379 containers, form the foundation of this volume. They were given to the Library of Congress by General Spaatz and the U.S. Air Force in 1948. They are divided into eight series, two of which proved of particular importance to this book-Diary and Notebooks, 1910–1953, and Subject File, 1929–1945. The diary file does not consist of Spaatz's private recollections and reminiscences. Rather, it contains copies of correspondence
