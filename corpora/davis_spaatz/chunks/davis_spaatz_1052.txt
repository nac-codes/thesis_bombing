this book-Diary and Notebooks, 1910–1953, and Subject File, 1929–1945. The diary file does not consist of Spaatz's private recollections and reminiscences. Rather, it contains copies of correspondence, cables, reports, meetings, and office diaries arranged chronologically, and personally selected by Spaatz at the time he received them for inclusion in this file. I could find no evidence of a systematic exclusion of derogatory or sensitive material from this file. The Subject File, which makes up half the collection, is a mixture of nuggets of historical gold and trivia. This file grudgingly yields extremely valuable information about almost every imaginable aspect of the air war in Europe. Archivists at the Library of Congress note that, year in and year out, the Spaatz collection is heavily used by researchers. Papers of Henry H. Arnold Papers of Hoyt S. Vandenberg Papers of Ira C. Eaker Papers of James H. Doolittle Papers of Nathan F. Twining Papers of Frank M. Andrews These collections, listed in order of their importance to this work, flesh out the full details of Spaatz's relationships with six of his most important con- temporaries. The Arnold collection provides copies of Arnold-Spaatz and Arnold-Eisenhower correspondence unavailable elsewhere. Arnold's personal notebooks on the great Anglo-American political and military conferences supply unique insights into his and the AAF's thinking. Vandenberg's diary gives useful information on his relationship with Spaatz, the extent of Spaatz's control of the Ninth Air Force, and relationship with Leigh-Mallory.
