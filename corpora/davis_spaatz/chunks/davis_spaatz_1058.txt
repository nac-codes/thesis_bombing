Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1955. Craven and Cate, recently reprinted by the Center for Air Force History, is the starting point for any serious study of the AAF in World War II. One of its chief faults, however, is its lack of perspective concerning air problems. It tends 748   ## p. 749 (#773) ############################################  BIBLIOGRAPHY to be subjective and is somewhat unreliable for enemy casualty and loss figures. On many doctrinal points it fails to present an objective viewpoint. Because the combat volumes are all well over thirty years old they lack the benefit of more recent scholarship. In addition, the source materials for several of the work's chapters seem to have been scattered or broken up, so it is difficult to identify and locate key documents used by the original authors. Despite quibbles about a few judgments and statistics, Craven and Cate nevertheless remains the authoritative history of the AAF during the war.
