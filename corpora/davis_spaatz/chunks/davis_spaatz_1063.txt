Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala.: Air University Press, 1984. The AAF Statistical Digest is a prime source for the quantitative analysis of AAF operations in this book. Murray's book provides data on both the AAF and the Luftwaffe, but, unfortunately, the author concluded his study in September 1944. One copy of the Annual Reports of the Secretary of War is available in the Army Library in the Pentagon, while a copy of the Reports of the Chief of the Air Corps is in the CAFH reference library. Greenfield's study gives the Army Ground Forces' view of close air support. Putney's work has an excellent introduction on World War II intelligence. 751   ## p. 752 (#776) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE British Official Histories Butler, J.R.M.
