"The Army and Its Air Corps: A Study of the Evolution of Army Policy Towards Aviation, 1919-1941" (Ph.D., Indiana University, 1976). Mierzejewski's work is a masterly exposition of the effects of Allied bombing on the German transportation system and the fatal damage done to the German war economy by the choking off of its coal distribution system. Tate shows that, contrary to myth, the Army made a sincere effort to support its air arm, despite limited resources. The works on Vandenberg and Lovett give useful details on the careers of those important men. Meilinger's work has recently been published by Indiana University Press. Articles Barnett, Lincoln.
