ant information, especially on the transportation plan. Eisenhower's papers are extremely valuable, especially if one is unable to make the haj to Abilene, Kansas, to check the originals. They must be used with care, however, because comments on personnel serving with or under him have been severely edited. Ambrose's biography of Eisenhower is probably the best military biography of the Supreme Commander. Anyone wishing to appreciate Spaatz's contributions as a pioneer aviator and as the second Commanding General of the AAF and the first Chief of Staff of the USAF should start with Mets's biography published in 1988, which covers Spaatz's entire career before, during, and after World War II, concentrating on Spaatz the man. Prior to the publication of Mets's book, Alfred Goldberg's fourteen-page article on Spaatz in The War Lords was the only published and reasonably widely available biography of Spaatz.
