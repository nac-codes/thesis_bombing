mma faced by the AAF when the pursuit of victory led it beyond precision bombing to city bombing. Sherry offers good research and stimulating writing in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to apply anti-Vietnam War morality to American bombing in World War II. Both books make a stronger case for the immorality of bombing Japan than Germany, focusing on the AAF's massive fire raid on Tokyo and on the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The current social trends rejecting nuclear war and open racism, one unheard of and the other not questioned in the 1940s, make the war against Japan a hot topic of modern research. The atrocities and racism of the Japanese regime are dismissed as cultural differences. Such a case cannot be made for the Germans. They belonged to the mainstream of Western culture, were Caucasian to a fault, and committed atrocities on a numbing scale. 757   ## p. 758 (#782) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Unpublished Material Cabell, C.P. Unpublished autobiography. Hughes, Richard D'O. Unpublished autobiography. Mets, David. Untitled manuscript biography of Spaatz, 1982. The Hughes autobiography gives useful inside details on the Eighth Air Force and USSTAF. I thank Professor W. W. Rostow for giving me the wartime chapters of this work. The edited version of Mets's work, published under the title Master of Air Power, is included under Memoirs, Biographies, and Published Personal Papers above. This manuscript is particularly strong on Spaatz's pre- World War II career and benefits from Mets's numerous interviews with Spaatz's family and associates. General Cabell was one of the AAF's leading intelligence officers. He also served in combat, leading a wing of Eighth Air Force heavy bombers. He was present in Spaatz's headquarters at Park House on the day of the initial Big Week mission, and he gives an important account of the events of that evening. The CAFH archives contains a copy of this work. 758   #
