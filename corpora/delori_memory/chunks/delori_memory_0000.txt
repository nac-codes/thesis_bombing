According to an investigation conducted by the US government in 1945, “about one third of the houses of the city were destroyed and German estimates show 60,000 to 100,000 people killed.”2 This quantitative depiction of the bombing does not give an accu - rate picture of how the population of Hamburg experienced the event. The blow caused by the firestorm caused the asphyxiation of thousands of people who had taken refuge in air raid shelters whilst others died in the Elbe river after having thought that it would save them from the fires. The bombing of Hamburg is only one segment of the air war that the Allies conducted against Germany and Japan. This air war caused about ten times more civilian deaths than the German and Japanese “strategic”3 bombings. Nowadays, most historians think that it had no significant effect on the course of the war ( Kershaw, 2011 ; Overy, 2013 ). The civilian social memories of the Allied airwars in Germany and Japan have varied in space and time. However, generally speaking, they have become critical, and thus both from a normative and military perspective. This was rapidly the case in Germany ( Friedrich, 2003 ; Sebald, 2004 (2001 )) and Japan ( Yoneyama, 1999 ), but it is also true for the countries that conducted this policy of massive bombing of civilian targets and people. In the United Kingdom, a moral and strategic cri - tique of these bombings emerged as early as 1941 thanks to the Committee for the Abolition of Night Bombing , which became the Restriction Bombing Committee a year later. The activities of this organization, as well as the stances taken by pacifist intellectuals such as Vera Brittain, were strengthened after the terrible bombings of Hamburg (July 1943) and Dresden (February 1945) ( Overy, 2016 ). This was obviously a
