e stances taken by pacifist intellectuals such as Vera Brittain, were strengthened after the terrible bombings of Hamburg (July 1943) and Dresden (February 1945) ( Overy, 2016 ). This was obviously a minority voice, but the small controversy over the meaning of this air war, particularly the so-called “area” raids on city centres and civil - ians, was significant enough to prompt the British authorities not to highlight this aspect of the war during the victory celebrations in July 1945 ( Knapp, 2016 ). In the United Kingdom, the social criticism of strategic bombing only grew in the 11 Understanding the fragmentation of the memory of the Allied bombings of World War II The role of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey Mathias Delori DOI: 10.4324/9781003147251-1410.4324/9781003147251-14  File: --- delori_memory.pdf --- Page 2 --- 156 Mathias Delori following decades. This trend is perceivable in the rhetoric of the history of the air war published by the official historians of the Royal Air Force in the early 1960s (Frankland & Webster, 1961 ). It sharpened following the publication of the first scientific (and critical) book on the issue ( Hastings, 1979 ). The civilian public debate on the Allied air war followed a different path in the United States. During the war, the collusion between the arm industries, the military, the propaganda services, and the cinematographic industry generated a “Military-Industrial Media-Entertainment Network” (MIMEN) which spread out the idea that strategic bombings could help to win the war at a lower eco - nomic and human cost (for Americans). For instance, “Walt Disney imagined an orgiastic destruction of Japan by the air in his 1943 animated feature Victory Through Air Power (based on Alexander P. de Seversky’s 1942 book), well before the United States could carry it out” ( Sherry, 2008 , pp. 177‒292). The MIMEN kept working after World War II. Besides, the supporters of strategic bombing implemented an article- and intervie
