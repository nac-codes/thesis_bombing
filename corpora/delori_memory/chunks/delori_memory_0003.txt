against civilians and those targeting factories or transport systems, and questions are asked about their respective effects. While there is no shortage of criticism, particularly among defence intellectuals close to the Navy and the Army ( Andrews, 1950 ; Copeland, 2017 ; Gentile, 2001 ), there is also an articulate discourse validating the thesis of the effectiveness of the Allied air war, including the controversial “area” bomb - ings directed against civilians. The supporters of these bombings are sometimes called the “Douhetians” in reference to Giulio Douhet, the Italian officer who prophesied during the interwar period that “By bombing the most vital civilian centres it could spread terror through the nation and quickly break down B’s mate - rial and moral resistance” ( Douhet, 1942  (1921) p. 37). It is difficult to measure  File: --- delori_memory.pdf --- Page 3 --- The memory of the Allied bombings of World War II 157 precisely the weight of Douhetian thought in the American military field after World War II. We do know, however, that it was sufficiently important until the 1990s to give meaning, internally, to the carpet-bombing of Korea, Vietnam, and Laos ( Dafinger, 2020 a; Gibson, 1986 ) and, to a lesser extent, to the bombing of Iraqi cities during the first Gulf War ( Gentile, 2001 ). A specific vector of memory ( Rousso, 1990 ) played an important role in the social construction of this spectacular case of horizontal fragmentation of memo - ries: the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS). The USSBS is an expertise launched at the end of World War II by President Roosevelt to under - stand the effects of the Allied air war. For several months, some 300 civilians, 350 military officers, and 500 soldiers stayed in Germany and Japan in order to gather empirical material concerning the effects of strategic bombings. The USSBS produced about 200 reports on Germany and almost as many on Japan. Although the USSBS was officially an “independent and
