ake of the USSBS in 1948 ( Dafinger, 2018 ). As a matter of fact, the USSBS synthesis reports ‒ the only reports that had an impact on the public debate ‒ all concluded that the Allied strategic bombing was “decisive,” including those that were intended to “demoralize” the population.5 This chapter revisits this key moment in the constitution of the belief of a part of the strategic studies field in the effectiveness of strategic bombing: the production of the main USSBS reports. I show that the conclusions of the synthesis reports are indeed very favourable to strategic bombing but that they mask a dissension within the USSBS board. The latter was composed of a military advisor ‒ Air Corps general Orvil Anderson ‒ and civilians of different backgrounds who knew little, if anything, about strategic bombing before they were appointed: diplo - mat George Ball, businessmen Franklin d’Olier and Henry Alexander, Paul Nitze  File: --- delori_memory.pdf --- Page 4 --- 158 Mathias Delori (who hesitated, then, between a career in the bank sector, the aircraft industry or in the government), and two academics: the psycho-sociologist Rensis Likert and the economist John K. Galbraith. Among these men, one expressed a particular voice: Galbraith, the head of the Overall Economic Effects Division . He came to the conclusion that “strategic” bombing in general had been ineffective and that those directed against civilian morale had even been counterproductive because they had contributed to remobilizing the bombed people against the aggressors.6 The conclusion of the synthesis reports on the “decisive” character of “strategic” bombings in general and of those directed against the “morale” of civilians in particular is due to the marginalization of Galbraith’s minority report. The argument follows a chronological plan. Most of the discussion focuses on the production of the reports between 1945 and 1947 and the knowledge/power operations that were associated with it. I conclude, ho
