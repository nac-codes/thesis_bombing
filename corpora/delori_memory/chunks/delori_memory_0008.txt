forces. More generally, the German people did not revolt against the Nazi regime, and the workers seemed to have gone to the factory with the same fervour until the very end. The Japanese case was different in that the war had been fought primarily from the air. However, capitulation did not come after the conventional bombings of Tokyo in February 1945 but on September 2, i.e., after the USSR entered the war against Japan (9 August 1945) and the two atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (6 and 9 August 1945).
