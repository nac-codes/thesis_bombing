, requested that the summary report emphasize the contribution of naval forces but also of the two atomic bombs. While this last request may have reflected his sincere conviction of the decisive role played by these bombs, one cannot exclude that it was underpinned, once again, by a bureaucratic interest. Indeed, the US Navy was radically opposed to the project of creating an independent air force, arguing that one does not need such a force ‒ and its thousands of flying fortresses ‒ to wage war with atomic bombs. A few planes launched from an aircraft carrier can suffice. Vice Admiral Ofstie expressed this opinion internally while other sailors spoke publicly to criti - cize “strategic” bombing ( Dickens, 1947 ). In this context, the “air force supporters” relied, once again, on the analyses of the Morale Division . In his pre-reports of early 1946, Likert hammered home the idea that the bombing of Tokyo in February‒March 1945 had had a devastat - ing effect on Japanese morale, rendering them “incapable of continuing the war.” Paul Nitze, the main author of the summary report on Japan, recycled this idea to establish the central thesis of the report:  File: --- delori_memory.pdf --- Page 8 --- 162 Mathias Delori Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testi - mony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey’s opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.13 Moreover, the summary report  explicitly called for the creation of an independent air force.14 This text outraged the senior officers of the Navy. During his hearing in the House of Representatives during the debate over the creation of the air force, Vice Admiral Ofstie used a technique documented by sociologists of controversy (Latour, 20
