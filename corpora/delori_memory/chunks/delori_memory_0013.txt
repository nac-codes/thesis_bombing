During his hearing in the House of Representatives during the debate over the creation of the air force, Vice Admiral Ofstie used a technique documented by sociologists of controversy (Latour, 2005 (1989 )): he opened the “black box” of the study he intended to disqualify. Without mentioning Galbraith by name, he explained that certain “civilian” members of the board did not, at first, consider validating the thesis of the effectiveness of “strategic” bombing or recommending the creation of an air force. These ideas were absent, he added, from the interim reports produced on 5 March 1946, 10 March 1946, and 1 May 1946. According to him, the USSBS secretariat had modified the text under “pressure” from supporters of the creation of an air force.15 According to David MacIsaac, this grand unpacking of a kind of inter-army war surprised some members of Congress who “complained about the damned militarists who seemed unwilling to give up their private armies” (MacIsaac, 1976 , p. 123). At the time, the Morale Division  had not produced any official and public study of its own (only internal pre-reports), not even on the German case. This came in May 1947 with the publication of the report on “The Effects of Strategic Bombing on German Morale.” The timing was particularly opportune. The US Congress was debating the bill that would lead, two months later, to the creation of the Air Force. The Morale Division  officially concludes that “strategic” bombings demoralized civilians The United Kingdom had also undertaken, in 1945, to assess the effects of “strate - gic” bombing. The summary report of this British Bombing Survey Unit  (BBSU) that began circulating in military circles in June 1946 stated that the bombing of transportation systems had had an interesting military effect, that the bombing of factories had had no measurable impact on productivity, and that the bombing of civilian morale had been a complete failure: “Insofar as the offensive against German cities
