these reports but chose to ignore them for two reasons. First, Likert felt that documents of this type produced in a totalitarian context could not be taken at face value. By so doing, he anticipated a debate that took place in academia when historians of the Holocaust and World War II discovered these reports in the 2000s ( Kulka & Jäckel, 2004 ). Second, one of his collaborators (or himself) felt that the reports are limited in that the Germans did not avail themselves of modern scientific techniques for the study of popular thought and feeling. Quantitative controls, sampling methods, and research design were completely lacking in the collection and interpretation of the material for those reports.17 Rensis Likert became known in the 1930s for having proposed a method of sta - tistical analysis that consists of measuring attitudes on a numbered scale. This method, commonly referred to as the Likert scale ( Likert, 1932 ), is still used today. The questions used as indicators can be closed or open-ended. In the first case, the interviewees are asked to specify their degree of agreement with a statement by choosing among the formulas “completely agree,” “rather agree,” “neither disa - gree nor agree,” “rather disagree,” and “completely disagree.” In the second case, the interviewees answer as they see fit. The analyst then assigns a code to each respondent’s answers to classify them on the scale. Likert convinced the USSBS secretariat to give him the means to carry out a large-scale survey with open-ended questions and coded answers among 3,700 German bombing survivors (and almost as many Japanese). The interviewees were asked about 50 questions on various subjects, including their reactions during and after the air raids. The interviewers were then asked to look for any sequences in the answers where the interviewees mentioned their “morale.” These indicators were then subsumed into a “morale index” which was set up as a “dependent” variable, i.e., to be explaine
