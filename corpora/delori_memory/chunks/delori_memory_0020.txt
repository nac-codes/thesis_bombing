re against groups or states of the Global South. In 1948, the US Air Force set up a research group on the European (mainly British) expertise on aerial “pacification” of the colonies during the interwar period. For five years, ten officers and six civilians paid by the fledgling air force sought to understand how the Royal Air Force had “pacified” Iraq, the Gulf of Aden, Palestine, Transjordan, East Africa, or the Indian subcontinent before World War II. These men reproduced what others have called the “myth of air control” ( Gray, 2001 ), i.e., the (disputed (Omissi, 1990 )) idea that punitive bombing of rebellious villages and tribes had helped Britain, France, and to a lesser extent Italy to preserve their colonial empires. This belief met the USSBS-produced belief in the “demoralizing” effects of “strategic” bombing. The synthesis between the USSBS and air control myths contributed to giving meaning, internally, to the bombing of civilians in Vietnam. Thomas Hippler notes in this regard that the war in Vietnam combined “the worst of two traditions: that of the total war between nation-states and that of the ‘small war’ of the insurrectionary or colonial type” ( Hippler, 2014 , p. 179). This tradition was also present in the US war in Laos and, to a lesser extent, in the Gulf War in 1991 ( Gentile, 2001 ), in Afghanistan in 2001, and in Iraq in 2003 ( Grosscup, 2006 ). The publication in 1998 (50 years after its production) of the critical report of the British Bombing Survey Unit contributed to weakening the Douhetian narrative within the field of “strategic” studies. Moreover, the “counter-insurgency” turn of the “war on terror” in the 2000s mechanically prompted many proponents of air power to cast some doubt on “classical,” “strategic” bombing. Indeed, the precepts of coun - terinsurgency warfare emphasize the importance of mastering violence against non- rebel populations in order to prevent them from becoming rebellious ‒ an idea that is the exact opposite
