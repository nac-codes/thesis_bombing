File: --- downes_strategic.pdf --- Page 1 --- [13][1] Defining and Explaining Civilian Victimization What is civilian victimization, and why do governments victimize civil- ians in warfare? I begin by defining the concept of civilian victimization, the phenomenon I seek to explain in this book. Civilian victimization is a military strategy chosen by political or military elites that targets and kills noncombatants intentionally or which fails to discriminate between com-batants and noncombatants and thus kills large numbers of the latter. I then outline the common forms of civilian victimization and provide illustrative examples. In the second part, I summarize three competing perspectives on civil- ian victimization: regime type, civilized-barbaric identity, and organiza-tion theory. The regime-type view maintains that domestic norms and institutions are the most important causes of civilian victimization. The civilized-barbaric identity argument, by contrast, contends that states kill an adversary’s noncombatants when they view the enemy as outside the community of civilized nations. Organization theory, finally, suggests that the cultures or parochial interests of military organizations are the prime causes of civilian victimization. The third section presents my theory of civilian victimization, which identifies two crucial factors: the growing sense of desperation to win and to conserve on casualties that states experience in protracted wars of attrition, and the need to deal with potentially troublesome populations dwelling on land that an expansionist state seeks to annex. I discuss the logic underpinning these two factors and the differing implications they have for the timing of civilian victimization. I also explain why target-ing civilians—even though it does not always work—is not an irrational gamble, but rather a calculated risk. I conclude with a short discussion of methods and cases.
