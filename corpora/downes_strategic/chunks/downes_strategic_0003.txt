Skeptics contend that nationalism and industrialization have eliminated the noncombatant category altogether because all citizens in modern states contribute to the war effort if only by going to work, paying taxes, or con-senting to the use of force. 7 This view clashes with the obvious fact that even in modern societies, there are many people who contribute little if anything to the war effort, and further that this relative disengagement (and absence of threat) makes a difference as to whether they may be killed. 8 Many indi- viduals work in sectors of the economy unrelated to the war effort; some, particularly children and the elderly, do not work at all. One study esti-mates that 75 percent of the population of an industrial country does not labor in war-related industries, and that even in industrial cities, 66 percent of the inhabitants are civilians. 9 Second, civilian victimization is a government-sanctioned policy or strat- egy, as opposed to random or uncoordinated attacks by a few military units. Intentional attacks on civilians, as Christopher Browning has pointed out, can take the form of arbitrary explosions of violence or revenge inspired by “battlefield frenzy,” on the one hand, or can represent “official government policy” or “standing operating procedure,” on the other hand. 10 Only the lat- t er comprises civilian vi
