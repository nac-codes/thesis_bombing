venge inspired by “battlefield frenzy,” on the one hand, or can represent “official government policy” or “standing operating procedure,” on the other hand. 10 Only the lat- t er comprises civilian victimization as defined in this book: it consists of a government policy of sustained violence against a noncombatant popu-lation, rather than haphazard outbursts of brutality by frustrated troops. This does not mean, however, that civilian victimization must be initiated by civilian leaders; in fact, it is sometimes initiated by the military on the ground, but once political leaders become aware of the strategy and ap-prove it—or decline to stop it—it becomes de facto government policy. 11 Third, civilian victimization consists of strategies that intentionally tar- get civilian populations but also strategies that—although not purposefully  aiming at noncombatants—nevertheless fail to distinguish between combat-ants and noncombatants. A strategy of civilian victimization, in other words, either targets civilians on purpose, or employs force so indiscriminately that it inflicts large amounts of damage and death on noncombatants. In certain cases, for example, belligerents openly declare or make statements of policy that designate noncombatants as the target of a strategy. British bombing policy in the Second World War, which charged Bomber Command with destroying urban areas in Germany to undermine “the morale of the enemy civil population and in particular, of the industrial workers,” falls into this category. 12 British policy clearly meant to kill German civilians in order to bring about the collapse of Germany’s will to fight.
