vilians were being killed, or sought to capitalize on the fear these deaths created among the enemy population. I argue, therefore, that civilian victimization should include all cases where it can be determined that belligerents intended to kill an adver - sary’s noncombatants, but it should not be limited to such cases. The concept should also include strategies that cause large numbers—tens of thousands—of civilian deaths owing to belligerents’ inability or refusal to discriminate between combatants and noncombatants or their failure to ex-ercise due care in their treatment of civilians. Finally, the scope of this book is limited to the killing of enemy noncom- batants during international wars. Victimization that occurs within the per-petrator’s recognized borders is included only insofar as it occurs during an interstate war and the targeted population shares the nationality of the enemy state (e.g., Greeks in Turkey during the Greco-Turkish war, 1919– 22). 19 Cases of killing perpetrated by nonstate actors—such as insurgent gr oups or terrorists—are excluded, as are instances of anticivilian violence that occur during civil wars, after an international war is over, or outside of war altogether. 20 EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 10:06 AM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

Massacres consist of “large-scale, face-to-face violence against civilians targeted as groups” and occur in a number of contexts. 21 Some massacres, as noted above, are generated by passions aro
