lians may also result from systematic devas- tation of the environment. According to Vegetius, devastation of an adver-sary’s land dominated the conduct of war in medieval Europe: “The main and principal point in war,” he wrote, “is to secure plenty of provisions and to destroy the enemy by famine.” “To attack your enemy’s economic base, isolate his castles, starve his population,” writes historian John France, “these were surer methods and more applicable to the usually limited ob-jectives for which men fought” in medieval times. 32 The infamous French devastation of the Palatinate in the late seventeenth century, for example—designed “to create an artificial desert that would preclude the enemy from undertaking offensive operations”—inflicted widespread civilian suffering not only in the Palatinate, but in Baden and Württemberg as well. 33 Destruc- tion of crops and food supplies—with the attendant civilian suffering—also occurred in wars of colonial conquest. French general Saint-Arnaud, for ex-ample, described France’s scorched-earth policy (known as razzia) in Algeria in the 1840s as follows: “We have burned everything, destroyed everything. How many women and children have died of cold and fatigue!” 34 “Grass no longer grows where the French army has set foot,” agreed another French-man. In a clear reference to Voltaire, he continued: “We have ravaged the countryside, killed, burned, carved up, and chopped down, all for the best in this best of all possible worlds.” 35 Finally, civilian victimization occurs when belligerents coerce groups of people to move in circumstances that are sure to kill many or most of them. In the process of fighting the Filipino insurgency from 1899 to 1902, for ex- ample, the U.S. Army forced much of the rural population—including the entire population of certain islands—into camps where many died owing to sickness and disease. 36 According to one American congressman who visited the Philippines, “You never hear of any disturbances
