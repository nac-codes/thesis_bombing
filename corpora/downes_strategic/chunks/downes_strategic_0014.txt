zation is a government-sanctioned policy in war- time that targets enemy civilians intentionally or fails to discriminate be-tween combatants and noncombatants. Belligerents need not put a gun to their victims’ heads for a wartime strategy to constitute civilian victimiza-tion. Widespread noncombatant suffering and mortality can be generated by systematic devastation of the environment, cutting off supplies of food, or forced relocation. Next, I elaborate the various theories that have been offered to explain civilian victimization, before turning to my own despera-tion and annexation arguments and a discussion of the methods and cases I use to test these competing theories. Regime Type and Civilian Victimization Two alternative explanations for civilian victimization focus on regime type. One argues that autocracies account for the lion’s share of noncom-batant targeting because democracies are uniquely restrained by their do-mestic norms, whereas the other contends that democracies are more likely to target civilians because institutions of accountability make democracies more cost-sensitive and needful of victory. Democracy: Restraint or Propellant? Scholars who invoke democracy to explain civilian victimization disagree over the effect that it has, and this dispute reflects the norms versus institu-tions divide in the broader democratic peace literature. Most of the empiri-cal studies to date find that democracies are less likely than nondemocracies to inflict civilian victimization and base their explanations in norms. R. J. Rummel, for example, notes that democracies are less likely to commit mass murder in foreign wars. In an examination of all wars since 1945, Benjamin Valentino, Paul Huth, and Dylan Balch-Lindsay find that democracies are less likely than authoritarian states to engage in mass killing.
