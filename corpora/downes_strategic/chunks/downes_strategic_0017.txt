in self-defense or to prevent human rights abuses. Yet liberal states routinely attacked and subjugated African and Asian tribes in the nineteenth century for reasons not remotely connected to security and have rarely intervened abroad to stop genocide. 50 Liberal democracies often sponsor war crimes tribunals, but hardly ever allow their own soldiers or statesmen to be tried for such violations. 51 Democracies have also under- mined or overthrown other democracies and supported brutal dictators when it suited their interests, such as fighting communism during the cold war or terrorism today. 52 Second, publics in liberal democracies—just as they do not always oppose war—do not uniformly disapprove of civilian victimization. A principled minority can always be counted on to denounce attacking noncombatants, but the majority of people—although firm believers in civilian immunity in theory—are prepared to countenance civilian deaths when their country goes to war. 53 This is why some authors argue that democratic institutions facilitate civilian victimization, either by forcing elites to attend to vindic-tive public opinion or by putting pressure on leaders to win wars quickly and at low cost. 54 Third, several analysts question the view that democracies are the only regime type whose domestic institutions systematically affect leaders’ be-havior. Democratic peace theorists argue that the risk of removal from office gives democrats incentives to avoid antagonizing voters. However, while the risks of losing power in a democracy from policy failure are no doubt higher than in less open political systems, the costs of being removed are much lower: democratic rulers are never punished by exile or death, whereas leaders of authoritarian regimes sometimes do suffer this fate. It is unclear whether the incentives created by the risks of losing power dominate those created by the potential costs. Indeed, recent scholarship on war termina-tion has found that—contrary to the d
