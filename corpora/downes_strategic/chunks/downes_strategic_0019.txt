viewed as the nation’s least popular conflicts. 59 Moreover, opposi- tion parties hardly ever dissent from governments’ choices to threaten or use force. This fact renders the support of the opposition—thought by some to be a signal of credibility to potential targets—rather uninformative. 60 The restraining power of public opinion on democratic leaders’ choices to go to war, therefore—or to victimize noncombatants once in a war—appears frail. Perceptions of Civilized Versus Barbaric Identity Other scholars argue that mistreatment of civilians is more likely to occur in conflicts in which belligerents view each other as “barbaric” or subhuman. John Dower, for example, has documented how racial hatred between Japan and the United States in World War II contributed to battle-field atrocities and eased the way toward incendiary bombing of Japanese cities. 61 Other historians have advanced this thesis to explain brutality in wars between Christian Europe and the Islamic Middle East, the mass ex-termination of native civilizations in the New World, and violence in wars of empire, arguing that the “rules, objectives and conduct of war were alto-gether different once civilization had been left behind.” Against barbarians, notes another analyst, “Methods of warfare that in Europe were morally and legally barred were considered legitimate in the face of an enemy who did not seem to subscribe to the same cultural code.” As a Greek officer put it after the Balkan wars of 1912–13, “When you have to deal with barbar- ians, you must behave like a barbarian yourself. It is the only thing they understand.” 62 Problems with the Argument Three flaws undermine the identity argument. First, it is not clear that objective differences in identity correlate with civilian victimization. For every historian who argues that wars between Christian Europe and the Islamic world were particularly brutal, for example, others contend that wars between Europeans were often just as savage. 63 Simil
