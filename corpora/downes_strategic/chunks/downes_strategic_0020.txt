very historian who argues that wars between Christian Europe and the Islamic world were particularly brutal, for example, others contend that wars between Europeans were often just as savage. 63 Similarly, Imperial Japan treated British and American prisoners-of-war with great brutality during World War II, but behaved just as atrociously toward fellow Asians in Korea, China, and elsewhere. 64 Furthermore, if the identity argument were correct, civilian victimiza- tion should have been more frequent in colonial and imperial wars than in interstate wars, since colonial conflicts were fought almost exclusively EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 10:06 AM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

My coding of the Correlates of War project’s list of  “extrasystemic” wars undercuts this hypothesis. 65 Using a wide variety of sources, I was able to judge in 84 of the 112 cases in the dataset whether the state actor employed a strategy of civilian victimization. Of those 84 cases, states targeted noncombatants in 29 percent of them. The frequency of civilian victimization in interstate wars—as shown in chapter 2—is about 30 percent for states that had a realistic ability or opportunity to kill enemy noncombatants. Similarly, data collected by Ivan Arreguín-Toft on the incidence of “bar- barism” (a strategy involving the systematic violation of the laws of war) in asymmetric conflicts since 1809—wars in which the strong side had at least a ten-to-one advantage in material power—contradict this hypothesis. Arreguín-Toft found that states used barbarism only about 20 percent of the time. 66 Although the majority of the cases in Arreguín-Toft’s dataset com- prise wars of imperial expansion, maintenance of empire, or decoloniza-tion, there are also a
