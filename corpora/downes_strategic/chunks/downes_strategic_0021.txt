only about 20 percent of the time. 66 Although the majority of the cases in Arreguín-Toft’s dataset com- prise wars of imperial expansion, maintenance of empire, or decoloniza-tion, there are also a substantial number of interstate wars and civil wars. To eliminate overlap with my dataset but still retain my focus on interna-tional conflict, I dropped these two types of conflicts and reanalyzed the data. Eliminating interstate and civil wars resulted in a slight increase in the frequency of barbarism, from 20 to 23.6 percent (N  106), but this fig- ure is still somewhat smaller than the frequency of civilian victimization in interstate wars. Arreguín-Toft also included many conflicts that do not ap-pear in any conflict dataset (including eleven between the United States and Native American tribes in the nineteenth century) as well as clashes that are ambiguous as to whether they are civil or colonial wars, such as rebellions by groups against land empires like the Ottoman or Russian Empires. Drop-ping these conflicts yields precisely the same result: barbarism occurred in 23.6 percent of the cases (N = 72). Thus, it does not appear that civilian victimization is more frequent in imperial and colonial conflicts than it is in interstate conflicts. A second reason to doubt the identity argument for civilian victimiza- tion is that demonization of the enemy is ubiquitous in war, yet civilian victimization is relatively rare. States in conflict almost always vilify each other, and political elites have considerable incentives to use such rheto-ric, both to convince their populations that war is justified and to mobilize them to fight the conflict. 67 The occurrence of civilian victimization in war, however, varies. Demonization, moreover, when it does occur, is likely to be motivated by clashes of interest rather than actual beliefs about the bar-baric nature of the enemy.
