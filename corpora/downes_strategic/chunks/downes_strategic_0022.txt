Third, although a sophisticated proponent of the identity thesis might argue that perceptions of identity are endogenous to war—that is, the pro-cess of fighting brutalizes the participants and convinces them over time that the enemy is barbaric—this, too, is unlikely to account for many cases of civilian victimization. For one thing, it is natural for men who are trying to kill each other to develop feelings of hatred for the enemy. Brutalization in this sense is ubiquitous, but civilian victimization again varies. Moreover, brutalization is most likely to occur in protracted wars of attrition and is thus at least partly a response
