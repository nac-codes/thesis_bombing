talization in this sense is ubiquitous, but civilian victimization again varies. Moreover, brutalization is most likely to occur in protracted wars of attrition and is thus at least partly a response to rising costs of fighting and desperation. Finally, brutalization affects soldiers on the battlefield more than those responsible for the strategic direction of the war and is thus probably a better explana-tion for battlefield atrocities than for policies of civilian victimization. 70 Military Organizations and Civilian Victimization Like the regime-type perspective, organization theory contains two dif- ferent arguments on the origins of civilian victimization: organizational cul-ture and parochial organizational interests. Organizational Culture Proponents of organizational culture argue that the prevailing culture in- side a military organization determines whether it will advocate a strategy that targets civilians. The culture of an organization refers to the beliefs, ways of doing business, and standard operating procedures that develop over time inside an organization based on its members’ perception of the organization’s mission and goals. In a military organization, “each service develops a culture to guide war fighting. These ‘paradigms’ either advocate or ignore specific means of warfare.
