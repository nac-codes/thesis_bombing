victimization before wars break out, and even fewer military organizations formulate such strategies in peacetime. Excep-tions, of course, exist. The development of an area bombing doctrine in the interwar period by Britain’s Royal Air Force is one example. Similarly, the Eisenhower administration’s New Look strategy in the 1950s emphasized massive retaliation in the event of Soviet aggression, entailing the obliter-ation of more than one hundred Soviet cities and millions of civilians in the process. 76 But these examples are few and far between. Moreover, even when militaries do have strategies that call for civilian victimization, these are not automatically and immediately carried out on the outbreak of war. It took two years for Britain to shift to area bombing in World War II as British leaders generally steered clear of targeting German civilians in the war’s early phases to avoid giving Hitler an excuse to bomb British cities. 77 EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 10:06 AM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

The enemy’s ability to retali-ate against the state’s own civilians also sometimes dictates a strategy that avoids noncombatants in a conflict’s early phases (as in the example above). Escalation to civilian victimization, however, eventually occurs whether or not it is compatible with military culture because it is a logical response to the rising costs of battle and/or the need to achieve victory or stave off de-feat. A “culture of punishment” is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for a state to target civilians. The parochial organizational interest argument also faces difficulties. For one, it seemingly overpre
