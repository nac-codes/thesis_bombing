“culture of punishment” is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for a state to target civilians. The parochial organizational interest argument also faces difficulties. For one, it seemingly overpredicts civilian victimization, since military branches are always competing for resources and influence yet civilians are rarely targeted. Moreover, if the argument is restricted to services trying to secure organizational independence, such as the U.S. Air Force in World War II, the question is why did services that were already independent—such as the RAF in Britain and the Luftwaffe in Germany—also bomb civilians? Fi-nally, if securing organizational independence is such an important motiva-tion for civilian victimization, why did the U.S. Air Force behave similarly in Korea—after achieving organizational autonomy—to the way it did in World War II, firebombing cities in North Korea? Desperation, Conquest, and Civilian Victimization I argue that states are prone to target civilians for one of two reasons: first, desperation to achieve victory and lower costs in protracted wars of attrition—in which case civilian victimization is a coercive strategy meant to sap the morale of an adversary’s population or undermine the enemy’s ability to fight—and second, an appetite for territorial conquest that causes states to use force to subdue or eliminate an adversary’s population to gain control over the conquered area. States that are less tolerant of costs and in greater need of victory—such as democracies—are likely to be more suscep-tible to desperation. Desperation and Civilian Victimization Imagine two belligerents go to war over issue X. Each country wants to win a quick and decisive victory, achieving its aims at relatively low cost to itself. Imagine further that events do not unfold as planned, and the bel-ligerents’ strategies for prevailing quickly and cheaply are foiled. The war bogs down into siegelike operations, trench warfare, and costly battles of at-trition. Al
