rces would try to reduce the town with indiscriminate bombardment and starvation. A more recent example on a grander scale was the endgame of the Pacific War. Military planners forecast that the projected invasions of the Japanese home islands would exact a heavy toll in U.S. casualties. Confronted with this prediction, U.S. leaders tightened the naval blockade, firebombed Japanese cities, and ultimately used atomic weapons to avoid a costly invasion. A Tactic of Later Resort. Because states prefer to win quick and decisive victories, they typically seek to defeat an adversary’s military forces at the outset of wars. Unless states specifically intend to seize and annex territory populated by the enemy, therefore, civilian victimization tends to be a “tactic of later resort.” 90 When states face the prospect of a protracted war of attri- tion, they more often than not are deterred from initiating a conflict, or they postpone an attack until they devise a plan that promises to deliver a victory on the cheap.

States tend not to elect civilian victimization as a war-initiating strategy, therefore, because it possesses little utility for winning quick and decisive victories. 91 Robert Pape has elaborated a number of reasons why coercive strate- gies do not succeed quickly. It is important to remember that these reasons apply especially to civilian victimization, which Pape argues is unlikely to succeed in major wars because states are able to adapt and minimize their vulnerability, punishment cannot inflict sufficient pain on nationalistic so-cieties to compel them to sacrifice important interests, and hurting civilians more
