In the early months of World War I, British leaders worried that im-plementing a total blockade of Germany might provoke the neutral states of northern Europe to enter the conflict on Germany’s side and cost them much needed American support. Similarly, the Germans feared that unrestricted submarine warfare would trigger American intervention on the side of the Entente, and thus German political leaders refused to unleash the U-boats until after the tide of the war turned decisively against them in 1916. Furthermore, the desire to avoid international criticism of their conduct or damage to the state’s reputation could deter leaders from early resort to civilian victimization.

After Japan’s surprise attack on American bases in Hawaii and the Philippines in December 1941, for example, the United States had few means with which to inflict damage on the Japanese home islands. Only after a protracted island-hopping campaign did the United States acquire bases close enough to Japan to contemplate a serious cam-paign of civilian victimization. 96 Appetite for Conquest and Civilian Victimization
