xpanded their territory (or that of an ally) by targeting enemy civilians in wars of conquest. Just looking at interstate wars, for example, Russia assisted in the creation of a Bulgarian state by killing and expelling Muslim Turks in the Russo-Turkish war (1877–78); Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Montenegro each expanded at the expense of Ottoman Turkey in 1912–13, driving out much of the remaining Muslim population in Europe in the process; Israel consolidated and expanded its territory in the 1948 war, as most of the Palestinian Arabs fled the fighting or were expelled by force; and Turkey established a Turkish Cypriot enclave in northern Cyprus in 1974 by forcibly removing Greek Cypriots. Clearly, some ethnic cleansing campaigns also backfire: Germany’s quest to conquer much of the Soviet Union in World War II is the most spectacular example. Greece’s expulsion of Turks from western Anatolia also miscarried when Mustafa Kemal rallied the Turkish Army and ejected the invaders, ending the Greek presence in Anatolia. Further evidence regarding the effectiveness of civilian victimization can be derived from large-N data (see table 1.2). Returning to Arreguín-Toft’s data on asymmetric conflicts, for example, strong actors that used barbarism as a strategy won 78 percent of the time, compared to 69 percent for strong actors that employed conventional strategies. Furthermore, barbarism is much more effective than conventional approaches against insurgencies, winning in 77 percent of cases versus 50 percent in which this approach was not used. 113 An examination of the Correlates of War project’s “extrasystemic” war data yields similar results.
