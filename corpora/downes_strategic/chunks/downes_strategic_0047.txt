pay, leaders may take that chance rather than abandon their goals. Civilian victimization is thus a calculated risk, not an irrational gamble. Table 1.2.

The remainder of this book is devoted to testing these competing arguments and determining which provides the superior explanation for ci-vilian victimization in warfare. I employ both large-N statistical techniques as well as process tracing of historical cases to investigate the causes of civil-ian victimization. This combination of methodologies allows me to compile evidence on the incidence of civilian victimization in a large sample of cases and investigate its causes in particular instances. The comparative advantage of statistical methods lies in establishing cor- relations between independent and dependent variables in a wide v
