ation and annexation-ist war aims. 117 Second, although I placed a high priority on covering the four main forms of civilian victimization—bombing, blockade/siege, counterinsurgency, and cleansing—selecting only cases in which victimization occurred would bias my results because of the problems associated with selecting on the de-pendent variable. I thus examine not only cases where civilian victimization was present, but also several cases—such as the 1991 Persian Gulf War—in which the states concerned did not victimize noncombatants in order to ob-serve if the variables I assert cause civilian victimization are absent or take low values in these cases. Third, many of the cases of desperation I examine are characterized by within-case variation in both costs and expectations of victory, on the one hand, and civilian victimization on the other. This permits what George and Bennett label a “before-after design” in which the researcher can observe whether change in the independent variables resulted in corresponding change in the dependent variable. 118 Finally, I chose cases that—by spanning the twentieth century—allow for a longitudinal analysis to test for period effects, such as improvements in weapons technology that allow for greater precision, or stronger interna-tional ethical norms against harming innocent civilians.

In each case, a state—a democracy in the former and a dictatorship in the latter—faced a costly seaborne invasion of its enemy’s homeland and reacted in similar ways: by shifting the potential costs t
