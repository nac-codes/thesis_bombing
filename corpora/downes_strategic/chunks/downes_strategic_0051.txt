In each case, a state—a democracy in the former and a dictatorship in the latter—faced a costly seaborne invasion of its enemy’s homeland and reacted in similar ways: by shifting the potential costs to enemy civilians. Against Japan, American of-ficials understood from the start that the war would be a protracted affair. The bloody nature of the fighting in the Pacific then convinced top Ameri-can political and military officials that an invasion of the Japanese home islands would probably be necessary to subdue Japan, and that this inva-sion was likely to entail high American casualties. Moreover, the extraordi-nary weather conditions over Japan largely frustrated American attempts to bomb industrial targets with high explosives. The belief that destroying Japan’s major cities by fire would shorten the war and save American lives was ubiquitous among those responsible for the decision. By contrast, Germany expected a quick and decisive victory when it in- vaded France and the Low Countries in May 1940. Indeed, the German blitzkrieg crushed the combined forces of Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands in six weeks, resulting in the conquest and occupation of the latter three countries and the ejection of British troops from the continent. Britain, however, did not capitulate, forcing Hitler to consider an invasion. Such an attack could not proceed until the Luftwaffe destroyed the British fighter force. When this proved impossible, Hitler and his air commanders—in a last-gasp effort to persuade Winston Churchill’s government to come to terms—sent their bombers against British urban industrial areas an indis-criminate night bombing offensive known as “The Blitz” that killed tens of thousands of Britons.
