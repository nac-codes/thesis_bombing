The targeted sectors of the city were among the most densely popu-lated in the world, counting an average of 103,000 residents per square mile. Ninety-eight percent of the buildings were constructed of paper and wood, and the proportion of the targeted area covered by roofs (and thus highly inflammable) was also high, reaching 40 to 50 percent in Asakusa ward. The Tokyo Fire Department, moreover, was utterly inadequate for dealing with large or multiple fires, and the capacity of the city’s eighteen concrete bomb shelters was a paltry five thousand people. 2 In the event, Tokyo’s firefighters were quickly overwhelmed. High winds brought the many small conflagrations together and generated a firestorm. “Unlike the firestorm that sucks everything to its center,” such as the one that destroyed much of Hamburg in July 1943, Michael Sherry writes that “the conflagration that swept Tokyo was rapaciously expansive, a pillar of fire that was pushed over by the surface winds to touch the ground and gain new f
