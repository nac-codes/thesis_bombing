ith more than thirty-eight thousand people was bombed. The record of destruction is impressive: In all, sixty-six cities (including Hiroshima and Nagasaki)—home to 20.8 million people—were attacked. The airmen destroyed 178 square miles (about three times the area of the District of Columbia) and 43 percent of the built-up areas of these cities. Thirty-five of the cities lost 1 or more square miles of their central sections. . . . According to Japanese reports, the bombing killed 241,000, seriously injured 313,000, and destroyed 2.3 million homes. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) put the death toll at 330,000, number of injured at 476,000, and buildings destroyed at 2.5 million. The bombing forced 8.5 million people to flee their homes. 7 Why did the United States unleash this reign of fire on Japanese civilians? I argue that three factors explain the outcome. First, U.S. leaders from Presi- dent Roosevelt on down understood that a war against Japan could not be won quickly and was likely to involve significant human costs. The vast dis-tances involved and the oceanic nature of the theater meant that it would be impossible to land large armies and advance across land as in most wars.
