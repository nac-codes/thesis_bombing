Whole families died in full view of the invading Allied forces by killing themselves with hand grenades provided by the Japanese military or leaping from high cliffs into the sea or onto the rocks below.” 12 In addition to resulting in the wholesale annihilation of Japanese forces, the reluctance of the enemy to surrender in these Pacific battles exacted a deadly toll on American soldiers as well. Total U.S. combat fatalities in both theaters, which had totaled only 62,092 from the war’s outset in De- cember 1941 through the end of 1943, quickly doubled in the seven months from January to July 1944 to 125,274 as U.S. troops were fully engaged in Europe and the Pacific. 13 In the invasion and battle for Saipan (June 15–July 9, 1944), U.S. forces suffered 14,111 casualties, 20 percent of the invading force. The carnage was even worse on Iwo Jima, where nearly 30 percent of the 75,000 marines who landed in February 1945 were killed or wounded in five weeks of fighting. The marines captured only 1,083 Japanese troops out of the 21,000 on the island before the invasion.14 The battle for Okinawa, which began in April, truly demonstrated what an invasion of Japan might look like: American forces suffered more than 51,000 casualties in subduing 120,000 Japanese defenders. Tens of thousands of civilians also died in the midst of the furious fighting. This staggering death toll led President Truman to comment that invading Japan might be like “an Okinawa from one end of Japan to the other.” 15 In sum, two years of combat in the Pacific convinced U.S. civilian and mil- itary leaders of two things: Japan would not surrender without an invasion of its homeland, and assaulting the home islands was
