y 14: “As a re- sult of recent operations in the Pacific it was now clear to the United States Chiefs of Staff that, in order to finish the war with the Japanese quickly, it will be necessary to invade the industrial heart of Japan.” 16 The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) reached this conclusion before the firebombing began and well before the debate over the atomic bomb. The Saipan operation also had a major impact on estimates of how costly an invasion might be. The Joint Strategic Survey Committee of the JCS, working on a document entitled “Operations Against Japan Subsequent to Formosa,” used the results of the Saipan fighting to generate estimates of the potential price in U.S. lives of attacking the Japanese home islands. Assuming that the Japanese would have roughly 3.5 million troops avail- able, the planners applied what came to be known as the “Saipan ratio”—“one American killed and several wounded to exterminate seven Japanese  soldiers”—and concluded that “it might cost us a half million American lives and many times that number in wounded to exterminate the Japanese ground forces that conceivably could be employed against us in the home islands.” 17 Other army studies came to much lower estimates, and many an- alysts have argued for fatality figures in the twenty-five thousand to forty-six thousand range. 18 The Japanese buildup in southern Kyushu (the site of Operation Olympic, the first invasion) during the summer of 1945 casts doubt on these lower figures, but even if one accepts casualty figures in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 implied by the lower fatality estimates, this was still plenty high enough to trigger a search for alternatives to an invasion, including firebombing and the atomic bomb. 19 The Potential of Fire as a Weapon against Japan American civilian and military officials knew well that Japan was a much better target for incendiary attack than Germany. This awareness mani-fested itself in extensive prewar interest in the potential of fir
