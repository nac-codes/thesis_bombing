though the authors drastically underestimated the number of incendiaries needed to start uncontrollable fires, suggesting that only five bombers could burn Osaka, three Kyoto, and two Kobe, they maintained that “the fact remains that this [firebombing] is the cheapest possible way to cripple Japan. It will shorten the war by months or even years and reduce American and Allied losses by tens of thousands.” 23 On the whole, however, discussions inside the AAF before the war re- garding the possibility of bombing Japan followed the theory of precision bombing developed and taught in the interwar period at the Air Corps Tactical School.
