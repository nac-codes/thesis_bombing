bombing the population as inefficient rather than immoral. 26 United States air leaders, however, wanted to avoid giving the American public the impression that bombing strategy was based on targeting civilians because they believed most Americans disapproved of the practice. But AAF plan-ners did foresee circumstances in which noncombatants might be attacked. In fact, AWPD/1—the air corps blueprint for a potential war with Germany written in 1941—advocated outright attacks on civilians as potentially de- cisive when the enemy was on the ropes. 27 This eventuality aside, however, “American air strategy aimed not at killing large numbers of civilians di-rectly but at causing general social collapse through the precision bombing of key industrial nodes.” “Human beings,” wrote Generals Hap Arnold and Ira Eaker in their 1941 book Winged Warfare, “are not priority targets except in special situations.” 28 Against Japan, AAF officers before the war intended to carry out their precision doctrine, resisting suggestions made by Chen-nault, Marshall, and Roosevelt that they attack Japanese urban areas with incendiaries. As Arnold put it in a discussion with Marshall in 1941, any strategic bombing of Japan would be intended to destroy “Japanese facto-ries in order to cripple production of munitions and essential articles for maintenance of economic structure in Japan.” 29 In sum, U.S. government officials, civilian commentators, as well as some air officers manifested considerable interest in the possibility of urban in-cendiary attack on Japan before Pearl Harbor. The key underlying factor that explains this interest was the well-known vulnerability of Japanese cit-ies to fire. Some of the statements and policies made before the war began, however, are attributable to the hopes of members of the Roosevelt admin-istration that Japan could be deterred from launching a war by the threat of aerial retaliation against its cities.
