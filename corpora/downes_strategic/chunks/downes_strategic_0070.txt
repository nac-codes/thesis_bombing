late November that the AAF memorialize the fourth anniversary of Pearl Harbor by bombing the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, Arnold responded, “Not at this time. Our position—bombing facto-ries, docks, etc.—is sound—Later destroy the whole city.” 41 This comment indicates Arnold’s preference for husbanding the B-29s until large sections of Japanese cities could be incinerated. In short, in 1943 and 1944, U.S. air planners began to think about how to employ incendiary weapons to kill Japanese workers and disable Japanese industry and to plan for an eventual incendiary campaign against Japanese cities. As Searle puts it, “The orders for the 9 March 1945 raid [on Tokyo] re- flected the longstanding interest of the Air Staff and the JCS in using urban incendiary raids to cut Japanese industrial production by (among other things) killing Japanese civilians.” 42 The Bombing of Japan up to March 1945 Thus far I have established that the Pacific War quickly became a war of attrition, with Japanese resistance convincing U.S. leaders that a costly inva-sion of the home islands would be needed to obtain Japan’s surrender. With this realization came a renewed interest in reducing the costs of such an in-vasion by using airpower. Moreover, I have examined prewar interest in in-cendiary attack on Japan and wartime planning for such operations, show-ing that although many civilian leaders expressed interest in firebombing Japan before the war, AAF doctrine called for precision bombing and U.S. airmen seriously began to contemplate a fire campaign only in 1943.
