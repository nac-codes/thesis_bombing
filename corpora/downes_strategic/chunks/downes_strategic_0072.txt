attack sortie from China required seven trips over the Himalayas from India. 45 These lo- gistical limitations made it nearly impossible to mount substantial attacks. Second, only a small part of southern Japan was within striking distance of B-29s operating from China, drastically limiting the available targets. In fact, during Twentieth Bomber Command’s ten-month stint in China, the B-29s flew only nine missions against Japan (out of forty-nine total), deliv-ering a scant 961 tons of bombs (of 11,244 total) on targets in Kyushu, the southernmost of the Japanese main islands. 46 Operations from the Marianas. American conquest of the Marianas Islands (Saipan, Guam, and Tinian) in the summer of 1944 provided the AAF with bases from which B-29s could bomb almost all of Japan. This was by no means an easy trip, however: the round-trip flight to Japan from Saipan was thirty-one hundred miles, nearly the operational limit of the B-29. Gen-eral Haywood “Possum” Hansell was appointed commander of the newly constituted Twenty-first Bomber Command.

Hansell was also one of the authors of AWPD/1, the blueprint for U.S. bombing in Germany. Unsurprisingly, Hansell began a campaign against Japan intended to destroy the following targets (listed in descend-ing order of importance) with HE: aircraft industry, industry in cities, ship-ping, and coke, steel, and oil. In general, Hansell achieved poor results. In the first mission, flown on November 24, 1944, against the Nakajima Musashino aircraft engine fac- tory in Tokyo, only 24 of the 111 B- 29s that left Saipan bombed the primary target;
