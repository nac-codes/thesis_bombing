to the defeat of Japan. Strategic airpower in the Pacific so far was a flop. Why? Several factors com-plicated bomber operations in the Pacific theater and reduced bomber effec-tiveness. First, the weather over Japan presented difficulties similar to those over Germany but with an added twist. Cloud cover, which had so limited early operations over the Reich, also proved a problem over Japan, break-ing up formations on the way to the target and frequently rendering visual bombing impossible. 57 According to Hansell, “Weather over Japan was our most implacable and inscrutable enemy”; LeMay estimated that prevailing EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 10:05 AM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

These heavy winds played havoc with bombing accuracy. 59 Second, Japanese industry was heavily concentrated in a few cities, but was broadly dispersed within those cities. Japan’s twenty largest cities, for example, contained 22 percent of the total population, 53 percent of all pre- cision targets, and 74 percent of the highest priority targets.60 But destroy- ing factory complexes was not sufficient to stop Japanese war production, as cottage industries contained in nearby homes fed each plant. As LeMay recalled in his memoirs, “I’ll never forget Yokohama. That was what im-pressed me: drill presses. There they were, like a forest of scorched trees and stumps, growing up throughout that residential area. Flimsy construction all gone . . . everything burned down, or up, and drill presses standing like skeletons.” 61 Precision attacks on plants, therefore, could slow output, but were unable to bring prod
