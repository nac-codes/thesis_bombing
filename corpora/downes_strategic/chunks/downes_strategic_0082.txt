can bring Japan to her knees by B-29 bombing before the ground troops or the Navy ever land on the shores of the main island of Japan.” The next month Arnold told LeMay that “combined with mining the maximum [incendiary] efforts of the near future will perhaps do more to shorten the Pacific war than any other comparable military engagement.” 69 Clearly Arnold believed that airpower could defeat Japan by burning down cities, which would avert the costly invasion of the Japanese heart-land. Securing the early surrender of Japan, however, would also serve Arnold’s other major objective: independence for the air force. Michael Sherry, for example, downplays operational factors and the desire to pre-clude invasion as motivations for firebombing, arguing that the shift to fire was made because “incendiary bombing was easy and because doing it rescued the AAF’s flagging fortunes.” 70 The failure of precision bomb- ing endangered the AAF’s quest to become an independent service after the war, and even raised the possibility that Twenty-first Bomber Com-mand would be diverted to other missions subordinate to the army or navy in the Pacific. In short, “achieving victory and enhancing the air force’s reputation were inseparable objectives for the AAF”; incendiary bombing appeared to be the most promising way to inflict the maximum damage on Japan with airpower. Thus Arnold became a fervent supporter of firebombing. 71 Other voices in the AAF also expressed the view that incendiary bomb- ing could shorten the war and save American lives. Norstad, for example, told LeMay in April 1945, “We can only guess what the effect [of continued firebombing] will be on the Japanese. Certainly their warmaking ability will have been curtailed. Possibly they may lose their taste for more war.” An officer in the Fifth Air Force described U.S. air strategy in a July newsletter as follows: “We are making War and making it in the all-out fashion which saves American lives, shortens the agony whic
