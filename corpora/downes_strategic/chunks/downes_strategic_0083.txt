officer in the Fifth Air Force described U.S. air strategy in a July newsletter as follows: “We are making War and making it in the all-out fashion which saves American lives, shortens the agony which War is and seeks to bring about an enduring Peace.” Historian Ronald Schaffer summarizes these views: “The idea of shortening the war appears repeatedly in statements by air force officers. . . .

LeMay knew of the many studies performed inside the AAF on the efficacy of incendiary attack against Japan, and had received multi-ple sugge
