blic opinion in the United Kingdom as well as the United States de- manded, if not the extermination of the Japanese people, then most certainly the country’s ‘thoroughgoing defeat,’ ” even if this meant killing large num- bers of Japanese civilians. 89 To what extent did the American public’s punitive attitudes toward Japan influence the decisions of U.S. officials regarding the use of force against Japanese civilians? Public attitudes were probably not the primary reason for the decision to target civilians in the Pacific War. As I have shown, civil-ian officials were only part of the story; two of the crucial decision-makers (Arnold and LeMay) were military men not subject to electoral pressures. The central civilian decision-maker, FDR, did worry about public attitudes to U.S. casualties and “had a horror of American troops landing again on the continent and becoming involved in . . . trench warfare with all its ap-palling losses.” The president “also recognized the limits on American tol-erance of sacrifices in another world war” and hoped that Soviet manpower in the European theater would carry the casualty burden. “No similar op-portunity existed in the Pacific,” however, “which only made the incentive to employ air power there more intense.” 90 Still, although the president often expressed his hope that bombing could limit U.S. casualties, he was by no means the driving force behind firebombing. Despite punitive public attitudes toward Japan, firebomb-ing did not begin there until precision bombing failed, notwithstanding widespread knowledge of the probable effectiveness of fire attacks against Japan. Moreover, 1944 was an election year for Roosevelt: if public hatred of Japan was so widespread and demands to conserve on U.S. casualties were so important, why not initiate incendiary attacks on Japan in the midst of the campaign in autumn 1944 when it could have paid significant political dividends? It seems unlikely, therefore, that electoral politics were
