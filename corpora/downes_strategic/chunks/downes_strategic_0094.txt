, however, is that half of U.S. bombs were delivered by radar through clouds or bad weather, and accuracy for these was worse than that for British night bombing. The scholarly consensus on radar bombing is that it was the functional equivalent of British night area bombing. 106 American commanders acknowledged this fact by using incendiary-heavy bomb loads on radar-guided missions. American aircraft  also launched almost seventy out-and-out area attacks. The key events that caused this shift in tactics were the disastrous daylight raids of August and October 1943, which demonstrated that the balance had shifted “away EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 10:05 AM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

Indeed, if rac-ism was such a strong factor determining military operations, why did the AAF bother with a precision campaign at all in the Far East? Furthermore, the atomic bomb was initially developed to be used on Germany and would surely have been employed had it been ready in time. 109 Japan was the vic- tim of bad timing, not racial identity. The consensus among historians, moreover, is that racism did not cause the shift to firebombing in the Far East or the use of the atomic bombs.110 A distinguished scholar of the role of race in the Pacific War, John Dower, ar-gues that racism on both sides contributed to the brutality of the war by al-lowing soldiers to view their foes as less than human but does not contend that racism alone was the determining factor in targeting noncombatants: “Such
