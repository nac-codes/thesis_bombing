f power, namely his armaments production capability (strategic interdic-tion). 127 As R. J. Overy remarks, “The German air force became committed to limited strategic bombing” within the confines of the demands of the other armed services. 128 Conspicuously absent from this doctrine was the idea of bombing civilians to affect morale: “In fact,” writes James Corum, “the Luftwaffe did not have a policy of terror bombing civilians as part of its doctrine prior to World War II.” 129 The Early Campaigns Germany opened the set of conflicts we now call the Second World War with a series of victories stunning for their speed and audacity. First Poland, then Norway and Denmark, and finally France and the Low Countries fell before the Wehrmacht’s onslaught. In each of these campaigns, airpower played a substantial role in subduing Germany’s victims, but the impact of bombing on noncombatants corresponded to the ease or difficulty of the mil-itary situation. Against Poland, the Luftwaffe largely avoided civilians until the siege of Warsaw threatened to prolong the fighting and inflict heavy ca-sualties on the army. Hitler could ill-afford the costly and protracted urban fighting it would have taken to subdue the 100,000 Polish defenders in the city, especially with his western frontier denuded of troops and defense-less in the face of a possible French invasion. 130 As the commander-in-chief of the German Army, General Walther von Brauchitsch, commented to his staff, “Every day of calm in the West is for me a gift from God.” 131 In this atmosphere of strategic haste, and facing a costly, prolonged urban battle for Warsaw, the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe together unleashed an intense bombardment on Warsaw in order to cow its inhabitants and defenders to surrender. 132 In the wake of this pummeling, in which about ten thousand civilians died, Polish forces in the city surrendered on September 28.133 German operations in the West in 1940, on the other hand, succeeded quickly without
