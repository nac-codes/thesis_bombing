tack British fighters not only in the air, but also on the ground through the destruction of airfields, radar stations, and related infrastructure in a thirteen-day offensive south and southeast of London. 156 To carry out this plan the Luftwaffe deployed almost 2,300 serviceable aircraft facing England: 963 fighters and 1,314 bombers (316 single-engine “Stukas” and 998 twin-engine aircraft of various makes). In the crucial category of single-engine fighters in the southern sector of op-erations (Fighter Command’s 10 and 11 Groups), the Germans possessed a superiority of 702 Bf 109s to 312 British Hurricanes and Spitfires, more than a two to one advantage. 157 Table 4.4.

Adlerangriff opened disastrously for the Luftwaffe on August 13: the Germans lost 45 aircraft to Fighter Command’s 13. Over- all, the British emerged from the first week of Adlerangriff (August 13–18) with a significant edge over the Luftwaffe—131 British fighters lost to 247 German aircraft. Germany’s medium bombers, the Ju 88 and the He 111, its primary dive bomber, the Ju 87 “Stuka,” and its twin-engine fighter, the Bf 110, all turned out to be too slow and poorly maneuverable to escape from Britain’s single-engine fighters, leaving only the single-engine Bf 109 as the equal of the British Hurricanes and Spitfires. Two raids in particular devastated the German bomber force. First, on August 15 (k
