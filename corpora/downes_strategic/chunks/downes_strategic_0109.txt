s single-engine fighters, leaving only the single-engine Bf 109 as the equal of the British Hurricanes and Spitfires. Two raids in particular devastated the German bomber force. First, on August 15 (known as “Black Thursday” to the Luftwaffe), British fighters annihilated unescorted German bombers and Bf 110s attacking northern Britain from Norway, shooting down twenty-two aircraft at no cost to them-selves. 158 The results of this raid, according to Williamson Murray, “proved once and for all that unsupported daylight bomber operations against  Britain were nearly impossible.” 159 As a result, German Bf 109s had to escort the operations of every other type of aircraft (even the Bf 110, nominally a fighter) in addition to conducting their own attacks on Fighter Command. Second, on August 18, German dive-bombers attacking RAF airfields in southern England suffered appalling losses with twenty-eight shot down, forcing Göring to withdraw the remaining Stukas from action the follow-ing day. 160 The Stukas, which had performed so well in Poland and France, were no match for determined fighter resistance and could not be escorted properly because of their slow cruising speed. German losses, even more than those of Fighter Command, were un- sustainable. The Luftwaffe lost 284 aircraft in the first week of Adlerangriff, 12.5 percent of those engaged in the battle. 161 During the month of August, total losses amounted to 774, a full 18.5 percent of the combat aircraft in the Luftwaffe inventory on August 1.162 The Battle Equalizes. Despite these heavy losses, German bombers con- tinued to hammer RAF airfields and the battle began to equalize. In the second phase of Adlerangriff (August 24–September 6), the Germans nearly pulled even in the loss-exchange ratio, destroying 273 British fighters while losing 308 total aircraft (109 bombers). Overall, the British lost 657 fighters to all causes in the four weeks after August 8. Fighter Command’s frontline strength remained about
