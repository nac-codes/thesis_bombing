er. Although most historians give September 7 as the opening of the Blitz, this date actually marks the beginning of the final segment of Adlerangriff, when the goal was still the destruction of Fighter Command by large-scale attacks on London. 172 The failure of these raids to achieve their objective meant that Germany could not invade Britain in 1940. Hitler thus had only one weapon left in his arsenal, namely night bombardment of England’s cities to destroy civilian morale: “It was hoped that a heavy bombardment would destroy its citizens’ will to resist, and that this, together with the economic blockade, would induce the Government to sue for peace.” 173 This strategy offered the possibility, however remote, of defeating Britain without an invasion while also lowering Luftwaffe bomber losses to an acceptable level. Three factors were important in bringing about the gradual shift in Ger - man aerial operations from attrition and defeat of the RAF by day to destruc-tion of British war industry and civilian morale by night. Probably the most important was the crippling losses sustained by the German bomber force. Already in the first week of Adlerangriff, the magnitude of the damage was so severe that Göring ordered that flight crews should consist of no more than one officer. 174 Göring also drastically increased the size of fighter escorts for bomber missions and withdrew the dive-bomber force. The shift to night bombing radically curtailed bomber losses: in the two months from Septem-ber 7 to November 13, 1940, the Luftwaffe lost only 100 aircraft on night op- erations over Britain. 175 Fighter Command, so deadly in daylight, could do little by night, having few night fighters of indifferent quality. The Germans, notes Matthew Cooper, “soon realised that night attacks represented a safe EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 10:05 AM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.
