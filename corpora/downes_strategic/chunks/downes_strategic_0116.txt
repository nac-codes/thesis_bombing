was forced on the Luftwaffe because of the high combat attrition suffered through daylight raids. Thus gradually during the course of the Battle of Britain the German leadership began to move more towards the concept of a full strategic air offensive for the first time. This was not to be a limited strategic operation, but an offensive like that planned and prepared by the British: to bring the war to an end through the exercise of air power. 180 Alternative Explanations None of the alternative explanations for civilian victimization offer con- vincing accounts of the Blitz. I focus below on regime type and organiza- tional theory, since I have uncovered no evidence that key German leaders viewed the British as barbarians. Regime Type. The Blitz is superficially consistent with the norms version of the regime-type hypothesis: Nazi Germany was a dictatorship, and it victimized noncombatants. The details of the case, however, contradict both versions of the argument. Hitler repeatedly forbade his military com-manders from striking directly at urban neighborhoods, restraint that is not attributable to liberal norms. In general, Hitler’s directives and utterances portray him as viewing intentional attacks on civilians with airpower as a last resort, and his actions show that he used this instrument in a reprisal mode, attempting to punish and deter attacks on German cities. 181 Since Germany was not a liberal democracy, Hitler’s restrained application of air-power versus civilians undermines the norms argument. The case evidence also contradicts the institutions hypothesis. For a leader not subject to public recall, Hitler worried extensively about his popularity among the German people, suggesting that this concern is not peculiar to democratic leaders. In general, Hitler’s regime was remarkably cost-sensitive, possibly because of its reluctance to mobilize German society for modern war. The Führer and his Wehrmacht developed a strategy and force structure designed to
