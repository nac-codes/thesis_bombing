Moral and political considerations were secondary.”189 Finally, Barton  Bernstein argues that the war caused a redefinition of moral- ity that allowed Hiroshima and Nagasaki to occur, so that by 1945, “there were few moral restraints left in what had become virtually a total war. Even FDR’s prewar concern for sparing enemy civilians had fallen by the wayside. In that new moral climate, any nation that had the A-bomb would probably have used it against enemy peoples. . . . America was not morally unique—just technologically exceptional. Only it had the bomb, and so only it used it.” 190 This chapter demonstrates the causal underpinnings of this erosion of moral restraint. Most governments began to fight by targeting military forces. But when victory appeared imperiled, or the costs of fighting be-came unacceptable, even societies that found bombing of civilians morally abhorrent—and military organizations that preferred precision bombing of military targets—turned to civilian victimization as a means to manage costs and produce victory by eroding enemy morale or undermining the adversary’s ability to resist.
