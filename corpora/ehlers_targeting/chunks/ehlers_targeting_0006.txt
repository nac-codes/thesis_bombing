Although the 1914-1918 effort proved limited in its effects, it nonetheless put in place the first operations and intelligence capabilities related to the employment of bombing an enemy’s industrial and other war-making capabilities. It served, in a sense, as a dress rehearsal for the huge heavy-bomber campaigns against the Third Reich. These played a pivotal role in Allied victory by shortening both casualty lists and the war in Europe. Recently discovered primary sources from German, British, and American archives have prompted a reappraisal of the heavy-bomber campaigns’ effects on Germany’s war effort. Although previously seen as important, they were in fact absolutely central to the speed and decisiveness of the Grand Alliance’s victory. One of the most startling things about these developments was the degree to which bombing succeeded or failed in its stated aims based on the relative efficacy of air intelligence inputs. The Anglo-American bombing campaigns against Germany relied heavily on air intelligence for targeting information and bomb damage assessment reports. These gave airmen key in
