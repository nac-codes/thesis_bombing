Air intelligence had already emerged as a new specialty during the Great War, but by 1918, an intellectual infrastructure with organizational and technological components had developed in the British and American air arms. The organizational elements encompassed air staffs with intelligence specialists assigned and unit-level intelligence sections to assess the effects of individual bombing raids. Technologies included reconnaissance aircraft and cameras to collect photographs on the effects of bombing raids. Although these intelligence capabilities, much like bombers and ideas about their proper use, remained embryonic during the Great War, they set a precedent for World War II. Surprisingly, both the operations and intelligence halves of this crucial formative capability survived during the interwar period, despite organizational retrenchment. The emergence of a strategic bombing doctrine and a four-engine bomber, the Boeing B-17, in the United States heralded the arrival of a mature bombing capability, while the threat of war prompted British civilian and military leaders to grapple with the same issues and, to a much greater degree than their American allies, begin building a new air intelligence organization.  Although early British bombing operations were generally ineffective, they allowed intelligence specialists at the Central Interpretation Unit, Ministry of Economic Warfare, Research and Experi- ments Division, and other agencies to learn their trade. The combination of these organizations with new technologies, including reconnaissance Spitfire and Mosquito aircraft with advanced cameras, resulted in very effective, but by no means perfect, air intelligence capabilities.
