Once American air intelligence personnel and reconnaissance aircraft began arriving in 1942, a highly effective Anglo- American air intelligence organization emerged. Two of the most important aspects of this new air intelligence capability and its successes were its interagency nature—the machinery put in place to share insights quickly among every interested organization—and its distinctly combined flavor. As leaders in this field, the British worked brilliantly with their American pupils, and in the process helped give birth to America’s first air intelligence capability. Anglo-American analytical expertise, committee structures, and rapid means of intelligence dissemination and incorporation into oper- ational plans proved crucial to the larger war effort.
