l (Ret.) Thomas E. Griffith Jr. and Colonel (Ret.) Stephen D. Chiabotti at the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS). Professor Chiabotti’s insights on air intelligence as conceptualized and practiced by the air force played a vital role in my decision to take on this project. Colonel Griffith and Professor Chiabotti generously supported my research, funding visits to five major archives in the United States and Great Britain. They are true champions. Sebastian Cox and Professors Conrad Crane, Richard Muller, and Hal Winton also provided exceptionally valuable insights, all of which made this book a better work of scholarship than it otherwise would have been. Having said this, any errors of fact or judgment are entirely my responsibility.  Ahost of people at the USAF Academy Special Collections Branch, National Archives and Records Administration, Air Force Historical Research Agency, Library of Congress, and the National Archives (formerly the Public Record Office) in the United Kingdom also proved helpful. I am grateful for their insights and assistance.  Finally, and most of all, I want to thank my family for their patience and devotion as I spent many long days at the computer completing this work. Their love sustains me.  ne ne EN EE I OED ————  ABBREVIATIONS A-2 (G-2) Director of Intelligence A-3 (G-3) Director of Operations AAC (AC) Army Air Corps (Air Corps) AAFAIS Army Air Forces Air Intelligence School ACAS(I) Assistant Chief of Air Staff, Intelligence ACIU Allied Central Interpretation Unit ACTS Air Corps Tactical School ADI(Ph) Assistant Director of Intelligence, Photography AEAF Allied Expeditionary Air Force  Location 89 of 10349 1%  A-2 (G-2) A-3 (G-3) AAC (AC) AAFAIS ACAS(I) ACIU ACTS ADI(Ph) AEAF AEB  AEF AFHQ Al.
