ic Air Forces in Europe  TARGETING THE THIRD REICH  ONE  AIR INTELLIGENCE IN ITS HISTORICAL CONTEXT  In essence, air power is targeting, targeting is intelligence, and intelligence is analyzing the effects of air operations.  —Phillip S. Meilinger, Ten Propositions Regarding Airpower  The Anglo-American aerial bombardment of Germany formed one of the major strategic and operational chapters of the Second World War. The question of its effectiveness in supporting Allied military strategy was surrounded by controversy during the war and in the postwar period, although virtually all historians and other scholars of World War II now recognize Allied air forces played an important role, in conjunction with land and naval forces, in defeating the Axis powers.+ However, relatively few scholars have thoroughly investigated the full range of reasons for bombing’s effectiveness, including the associated and crucial air intelligence effort. Four broad developments have diverted much of the scholarly effort from a focused and detailed study about how and why bombing contributed so significantly to Allied victory.  The first has been a tendency in recent years to move away from a focus on bombing efficacy to an examination of its ethical dimensions. The bombing effort was at times brutal in its application, but it occurred within the context of a global war set into motion and carried on with incredible brutality by Hitler and his Japanese allies. Yet even though Allied leaders viewed bombing as a key component in their efforts to ensure the survival of the Western democracies, and therefore accepted prima facie its ethical implications, several recent works have strongly criticized its purported moral deficiencies.2  The second factor has its roots in a tendency—less prevalent in recent years—to evaluate bombing effectiveness strictly in isolation, rather than as part of a global war in which air, ground, and  Location 161 of 10349 1%  TARGETING THE THIRD REICH  ONE  AIR INTELL
