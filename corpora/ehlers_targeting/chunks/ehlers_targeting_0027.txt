works have strongly criticized its purported moral deficiencies.2  The second factor has its roots in a tendency—less prevalent in recent years—to evaluate bombing effectiveness strictly in isolation, rather than as part of a global war in which air, ground, and naval operations were intertwined and synergistic. Any evaluation of aerial bombardment’s efficacy must occur in this larger combined-arms and combined-operations context. Recent scholarship has made great strides in this direction, particularly with respect to the role of the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO) in destroying the Luftwaffe and giving Allied air forces air supremacy. In addition, a few books have addressed bombing’s disastrous effects on Germany’s war economy. Nonetheless, they represent only a start in the right direction and fall short in their examination of the role of air intelligence, particularly targeting and damage assessment, in the Reich's defeat.2  The third factor clouding bombing’s effects and effectiveness has been the tendency among scholars to lump it all together under the rubric of the CBO. However, as John Guilmartin notes, there were in fact several campaigns. These included Bomber Command’s efforts against German cities; the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) unescorted daylight campaign in 1943-1944; Operation ARGUMENT, the USAAF effort in February-April 1944 that ultimately resulted in the Luftwaffe’s defeat; the three transportation offensives from 1943 to 1945 against Axis railroads and inland water- ways, first in Italy, then in France and Belgium, and finally in Germany itself; and the oil offensive of 1944-1945. There were also several British campaigns early in the war, including the anti-invasion campaign of 1940-1941 against German-controlled ports and barges on the English Channel, an abortive oil offensive against synthetic oil plants and crude oil refineries in western Germany during roughly the same period, and early night-bombing efforts in 1941-19424  The
