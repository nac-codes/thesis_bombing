e English Channel, an abortive oil offensive against synthetic oil plants and crude oil refineries in western Germany during roughly the same period, and early night-bombing efforts in 1941-19424  The crucial link between these disparate campaigns, from an air intelligence standpoint, was the iterative learning process occurring as intelligence personnel recommended targets to their commanders and then assessed the effectiveness of bombing raids. In the process, they honed their analytical skills, giving commanders increasingly accurate damage assessments. They used these analyses to steer ever larger heavy-bomber forces against the most lucrative target sets. The process was gradual and involved many errors in target selection, damage assessment, and judgments about  Location 161 of 10349 1%  bombing contributed so significantly to Allied victory.  The first has been a tendency in recent years to move away from a focus on bombing efficacy to an examination of its ethical dimensions. The bombing effort was at times brutal in its application, but it occurred within the context of a global war set into motion and carried on with incredible brutality by Hitler and his Japanese allies. Yet even though Allied leaders viewed bombing as a key component in their efforts to ensure the survival of the Western democracies, and therefore accepted prima facie its ethical implications, several recent works have strongly criticized its purported moral deficiencies.2  The second factor has its roots in a tendency—less prevalent in recent years—to evaluate bombing effectiveness strictly in isolation, rather than as part of a global war in which air, ground, and naval operations were intertwined and synergistic. Any evaluation of aerial bombardment’s efficacy must occur in this larger combined-arms and combined-operations context. Recent scholarship has made great strides in this direction, particularly with respect to the role of the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO) in destroying the
