ly from these air campaigns, the results were impressive. The transportation and oil offensives starved the Germans of fuel and ammu- nition, making it impossible for them to concentrate and maneuver on a large scale.  By 1944, and even as early as 1942, the Allies had a highly capable and integrated network of intelligence organizations in place. With a few noteworthy exceptions, commanders put reeommenda- tions into practice in the guise of various campaigns under the larger umbrella of the CBO. It was no accident that a highly effective air intelligence function, based largely on superb reconnaissance and photointerpretation capabilities pioneered by the British between 1939 and 1942, allowed an expert damage-assessment capability to emerge more than two years before RAF Bomber Command and the United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF) had enough bombers to do serious damage to the German war effort. By the time they did, in the spring of 1944, a mature air intelligence organization was in place to help senior airmen steer heavy bombers to vital transportation and oil targets, in addition to a variety of other less significant, but nonetheless important, target sets. By one estimate, the destruction of these key assets shortened the war by at least three months and reduced Allied and Soviet casualty lists by at least a million men.£  The air intelligence organization supplying analyses at the root of these successes had a remarkable dualism.
