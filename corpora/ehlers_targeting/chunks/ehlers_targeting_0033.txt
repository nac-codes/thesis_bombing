Nonetheless, they represent only a start in the right direction and fall short in their examination of the role of air intelligence, particularly targeting and damage assessment, in the Reich’s defeat.2  The third factor clouding bombing’s effects and effectiveness has been the tendency among scholars to lump it all together under the rubric of the CBO. However, as John Guilmartin notes, there were in fact several campaigns. These included Bomber Command's efforts against German cities; the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) unescorted daylight campaign in 1943-1944; Operation ARGUMENT, the USAAF effort in February-—April 1944 that ultimately resulted in the Luftwaffe’s defeat; the three transportation offensives from 1943 to 1945 against Axis railroads and inland water- ways, first in Italy, then in France and Belgium, and finally in Germany itself; and the oil offensive of 1944-1945. There were also several British campaigns early in the war, including the anti-invasion campaign of 1940-1941 against German-controlled ports and barges on the English Channel, an abortive oil offensive against synthetic oil plants and crude oil refineries in western Germany during roughly the same period, and early night-bombing efforts in 1941-19424  The crucial link between these disparate campaigns, from an air intelligence standpoint, was the iterative learning process occurring as intelligence personnel recommended targets to their commanders and then assessed the effectiveness of bombing raids. In the process, they honed their analytical skills, giving commanders increasingly accurate damage assessments. They used these analyses to steer ever larger heavy-bomber forces against the most lucrative target sets. The process was gradual and involved many errors in target selection, damage assessm
