rofessionals and the world’s best signals intelligence and reconnaissance technologies. Intelligence personnel had the tools and analytical insights necessary to pick target sets most likely to cause maximum damage to Germany’s war effort. Even more important, this capability allowed them to monitor, with great precision, bombing’s progressively powerful effects on the course of the war and to recommend changes in targeting priorities based on meticulous damage reports. Deliberative bodies such as the Combined Strategic Targets Committee (CSTC) allowed commanders to wage the oil and transportation offensives against the Reich on a one-week cycle—with a capacity for the equivalent of time-sensitive targeting—that anyone familiar with the American-NATO Air Tasking Order (ATO) process would recognize immediately.  Several prominent scholars, including Richard Overy, have noted how effectively the Allied air effort leveraged human talent, organizational innovation, engineering prowess, and technological  Page 1 of 423 2%  systems, debriefings of refugees from the Continent, and several others, to advise commanders on optimum operational employment. Only a handful of other books discuss this effort in more than a cursory fashion.+  Air intelligence personnel orchestrated an effort that proved central to the Allied cause because it enabled commanders to direct their bombers against the most lucrative target sets. The two most important were German transportation assets in occupied Europe and the Reich itself—including railroads and inland waterways—and oil assets, which included crude oil refineries and the synthetic oil plants built during the 1930s and early 1940s. From the spring of 1944 to VE Day, air intelligence personnel helped convince commanders to stay focused on these target sets. When viewed in combination with the Allied ground effort, which profited greatly from these air campaigns, the results were impressive. The transportation and oil offensives starved t
