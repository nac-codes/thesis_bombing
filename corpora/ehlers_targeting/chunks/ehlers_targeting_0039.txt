ffort for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.  The Anglo-Saxon democracies were adept at organizing their war effort, and this was particularly true for air intelligence. Its effectiveness relied on an intellectual infrastructure including highly trained professionals and the world’s best signals intelligence and reconnaissance technologies. Intelligence personnel had the tools and analytical insights necessary to pick target sets most likely to cause maximum damage to Germany’s war effort. Even more important, this capability allowed them to monitor, with great precision, bombing’s progressively powerful effects on the course of the war and to recommend changes in targeting priorities based on meticulous damage reports. Deliberative bodies such as the Combined Strategic Targets Committee (CSTC) allowed commanders to wage the oil and transportation offensives against the Reich on a one-week cycle—with a capacity for the equivalent of time-sensitive targeting—that anyone familiar with the American-NATO Air Tasking Order (ATO) process would recognize immediately.  Several prominent scholars, including Richard Overy, have noted how effectively the Allied air effort leveraged human talent, organizational innovation, engineering prowess, and technological development, bringing airmen and their civilian counterparts together in what proved to be a highly efficient, effective, and relatively harmonious relationship.2  Along these lines, the Allies used their unique intelligence talents in ways that were vital and fundamental to Allied victory. Although Carl von Clausewitz warns us that war is neither science nor art, Allied air intelligence personnel brought an abundance of both to the war effort, melding them together in one of the great intelligence efforts, and one of the great intelligence successes, in the history of warfare.2 When combined with the unparalleled Allied ability to wage total and industrialized war on a global scale—to conduct “machine war,” as severa
