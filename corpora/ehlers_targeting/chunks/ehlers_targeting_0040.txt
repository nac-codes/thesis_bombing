great intelligence successes, in the history of warfare.2 When combined with the unparalleled Allied ability to wage total and industrialized war on a global scale—to conduct “machine war,” as several scholars have called it—the result was a series of bombing campaigns that were effective, focused, and above all relentless. In discussing the American air effort in the Second World War, John Keegan said:  There is an American mystery, the nature of which I can only begin to perceive. .. . If 1 were obliged to define it, I would say it is the ethos—masculine, pervasive, unrelenting—of work as an end in itself. War is a form of work, and Americans make war, however reluctantly, however unwillingly, in a particularly workmanlike way.2  Keegan’s comments apply with equal force to the British air intelligence effort. In this arena, the British were the teachers and the Americans their pupils. The work of British intelligence specialists in the Air Ministry, Central Interpretation Unit (renamed the Allied Central Interpretation Unit once large numbers of Americans began arriving in 1943), Research and Experiments Department Eight (initially under the Ministry of Home Security and later the Air Ministry), Ministry of Economic Warfare, Railway Research Service, and a host of other agencies made this clear, even if their products often became the catalyst for bitter disputes among senior political and military leaders about what all this intelligence meant and how they should use it to greatest effect. The brilliant work at Bletchley Park, where the Allies exploited the German Enigma cipher, was also central to their many successes, including assessments of bombing effects and effectiveness. However, although we already know a great deal about Ultra, which is the subject of dozens of books, we know much less about the other components of the Allied intelligence organization. Accordingly, although Ultra receives significant attention in this work, it gets less than photointer
