ns of books, we know much less about the other components of the Allied intelligence organization. Accordingly, although Ultra receives significant attention in this work, it gets less than photointerpretation (about which little scholarly works exists) and the ways in which the entire intelligence enterprise came together in sup- port of the bombing campaigns.  The vital attribute air intelligence brought to bear was an ability to make reasoned and accurate judgments about airpower’s effectiveness in hampering the German war effort. This ability increased as the war continued, driven by close cooperation between Anglo-American air intelligence specialists. The air intelligence community’s greatest strength was its ability to orchestrate all aspects of damage assessment within an effective organizational structure. By 1943, this organization could gauge, with precision, the accuracy of bombing, its effects on Germany’s war effort, and its effective- ness in helping the Allies achieve strategic objectives. This proved most true of attacks on specific target sets rather than British city bombing, which was much more difficult to assess in terms of its overall impact on Nazi Germany’s war effort but, as we will see, still very effective.12  Perhaps the thing damage assessments made most clear about the bombing campaigns known collectively as the CBO was the steadily increasing and ultimately pervasive friction they created in the German war effort. By the summer of 1944, this friction was ubiquitous. From increasingly severe fuel shortages in the Luftwaffe and German army; to the constant delays, equipment losses, and casualties German troops experienced in conducting tactical maneuvers as well as movements to or between the various fighting fronts; to the ammunition shortages of the war’s final months; anda myriad of other ways, Allied bombers were the creators of friction the Nazi war machine par excellence. This process began with Bomber Command attacks and accelera
