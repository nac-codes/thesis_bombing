ther and further behind in the hopeless race to counter disastrous bombing-induced friction in virtually every facet of their war effort. Tactical movements that took a few days while the Germans owned the skies over Europe took two weeks or more once the marshaling yards, inland waterways, and bridges of western and central Europe came under concerted attack. As they arrived at the fighting fronts, German troops often discovered that bombing had created serious fuel shortages, making the Kampfgruppe-level tactical maneuvers at which they excelled nearly impossible. Reichsbahn managers and their counterparts who ran synthetic oil plants worked under increasingly nightmarish conditions, trying to carry out basic functions—moving soldiers, fuel, ammunition, and coal by rail on the one hand, and producing aviation and motor fuel on the other—while devoting huge numbers of wetkers to repair bomb damage. After the war, Albert Speer said between 200,000 and 300,000 laborers were engaged in repairing synthetic oil plants, and even this huge effort proved inadequate.2 The Germans were resourceful adversaries, but they could not keep up with the increasing tempo of bombing and the friction it created, which overwhelmed their efforts at the fighting fronts, in the railway centers, at the oil plants, and virtually everywhere else.  This friction played an extremely significant role in the Allied victory, but it did not by any means do so alone. Bombing never became the warwinning instrument envisioned in the writings of Douhet, Trenchard, and Mitchell. It helped win the war in combination with soldiers, whose role was fundamental to Allied victory. The growing Allied expertise in planning and executing combined and in joint operations allowed heavy bombers to play an increasingly vital role not only at the military-strategic level, but also in operational and tactical engagements, by starving the Germans of fuel, transport, and ammunition and by providing direct support to gro
