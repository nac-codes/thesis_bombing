s apply with equal force to the British air intelligence effort. In this arena, the British were the teachers and the Americans their pupils. The work of British intelligence specialists in the Air Ministry, Central Interpretation Unit (renamed the Allied Central Interpretation Unit once large numbers of Americans began arriving in 1943), Research and Experiments Department Eight (initially under the Ministry of Home Security and later the Air Ministry), Ministry of Economic Warfare, Railway Research Service, and a host of other agencies made this clear, even if their products often became the catalyst for bitter disputes among senior political and military leaders about what all this intelligence meant and how they should use it to greatest effect. The brilliant work at Bletchley Park, where the Allies exploited the German Enigma cipher, was also central to their many successes, including assessments of bombing effects and effectiveness. However, although we already know a great deal about Ultra, which is the subject of dozens of books, we know much less about the other components of the Allied intelligence organization. Accordingly, although Ultra receives significant attention in this work, it gets less than photointerpretation (about which little scholarly works exists) and the ways in which the entire intelligence enterprise came together in sup- port of the bombing campaigns.  The vital attribute air intelligence brought to bear was an ability to make reasoned and accurate judgments about airpower’s effectiveness in hampering the German war effort. This ability increased as the war continued, driven by close cooperation between Anglo-American air intelligence specialists. The air intelligence community’s greatest strength was its ability to orchestrate all aspects of damage assessment within an effective organizational structure. By 1943, this organization could gauge, with precision, the accuracy of bombing, its effects on Germany’s war effort, and its effect
