and Mitchell. It helped win the war in combination with soldiers, whose role was fundamental to Allied victory. The growing Allied expertise in planning and executing combined and in joint operations allowed heavy bombers to play an increasingly vital role not only at the military-strategic level, but also in operational and tactical engagements, by starving the Germans of fuel, transport, and ammunition and by providing direct support to ground forces in the opening stages of major offensives.  Omer Bartov, Russell Hart, and Christopher Duffy have coined similar phrases to describe what happened to the German army on the Western and Eastern fronts as a result of the pervasive fuel shortages brought on by bombing: demodernization, demotorization, and demechanization.14 German commanders were forced to send their trucks, which were supposed to move soldiers quickly from one spot to the next, to forage for fuel and ammunition instead, often at night and over great distances, to provide armored and motorized vehicles and artillery with at least the bare minimum of tactical maneuver and firepower capabilities. The bare minimum was in most cases all they received, with predictable results: an inability to engage in maneuver warfare on any significant scale. This problem, disastrous as it was in the west, proved cataclysmic in the east, particularly once the Red Army perfected deep penetrations and encirclements of German units, which often lacked the fuel  Page 4 of 423 2%  E <  damage assessment within an effective organizational structure. By 1943, this organization could gauge, with precision, the accuracy of bombing, its effects on Germany's war effort, and its effective- ness in helping the Allies achieve strategic objectives. This proved most true of attacks on specific target sets rather than British city bombing, which was much more difficult to assess in terms of its overall impact on Nazi Germanyâ€™s war effort but, as we will see, still very effective.12  Perhap
