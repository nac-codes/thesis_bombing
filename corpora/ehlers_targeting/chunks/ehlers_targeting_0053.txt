in operational and tactical engagements, by starving the Germans of fuel, transport, and ammunition and by providing direct support to ground forces in the opening stages of major offensives.  Omer Bartov, Russell Hart, and Christopher Duffy have coined similar phrases to describe what happened to the German army on the Western and Eastern fronts as a result of the pervasive fuel shortages brought on by bombing: demodernization, demotorization, and demechanization.4 German commanders were forced to send their trucks, which were supposed to move soldiers quickly from one spot to the next, to forage for fuel and ammunition instead, often at night and over great distances, to provide armored and motorized vehicles and artillery with at least the bare minimum of tactical maneuver and firepower capabilities. The bare minimum was in most cases all they received, with predictable results: an inability to engage in maneuver warfare on any significant scale. This problem, disastrous as it was in the west, proved cataclysmic in the east, particularly once the Red Army perfected deep penetrations and encirclements of German units, which often lacked the fuel to counterattack vigorously or even to regroup. Air intelligence specialists played a vital role in these developments because they saw the major consequences for the Germans of the bombing effort against oil and fuel production and supplies, resulting in a high priority for oil targets—and increasingly severe German fuel shortages—from May 1944 to VE Day.1=  There is also evidence to indicate the German armed forces, unlike German civilians, proved unwilling and unable to adjust to the increasingly heavy bombing and the severe fuel and ammunition shortages it caused. While Reichsbahn officials and synthetic oil plant managers proved adept at repairing bomb damage, the German army held doggedly to its doctrinal and ideological assumptions about how the war should be fought at the tactical level. As a result, it failed to
