Soviet armored spearheads to overrun German fuel depots rapidly. It was further affected by the Allied oil offensive, which reduced fuel deliveries to major depots and the front to a trickle by fall 1944. Even in the relatively rare instances where German heavy divisions in the east (and to a slightly lesser degree in the west) were in a tactical position to replenish their fuel stocks, there was often no fuel available where and when they needed it.1®  In addition, as Alfred Mierzejewski has demonstrated, bombers assisted the ground and naval efforts by destroying German rail and canal networks, thus collapsing the German war economy, from  canes ance ome. a ae 1 cond aa cod 7 sate a re rs re! a  Page 4 of 423 2%  shortages Drought on Dy bombing: demModernization, demotorization, and demechanization.-~ German commanders were forced to send their trucks, which were supposed to Move soldiers quickly from one spot to the next, to forage for fuel and ammunition instead, often at night and over great distances, to provide armored and motorized vehicles and artillery with at least the bare minimum of tactical maneuver and firepower capabilities. The bare minimum was in most cases all they received, with predictable results: an inability to engage in maneuver warfare on any significant scale. This problem, disastrous as it was in the west, proved cataclysmic in the east, particularly once the Red Army perfected deep penetrations and encirclements of German units, which often lacked the fuel to counterattack vigorously or even to regroup. Air intelligence specialists played a vital role in these developments because they saw the major consequences for the Germans of the bombing effort against oil and fuel production and supplies, resulting in a high priority for oil targets—and increasingly severe German fuel shortages—from May 1944 to VE Day.=  There is also evidence to indicate the German armed forces, unlike German civilians, proved unwilling and unable to adjust to the
