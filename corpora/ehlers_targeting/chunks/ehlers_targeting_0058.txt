ffectiveness of air operations is so problematic. “A key problem,” he stated,  is that we approach strategic bombing with the implicit assumption that air campaigns and battles can be judged using the vocabulary, criteria for success or failure, and analytical framework used to evaluate warfare on land and at sea. I contend that the appropriate criteria for judging strategic air campaigns, at least, are quite different and that in consequence the results of the de- bate [over the value of strategic bombardment in World War II] so far are of dubious validity. As evidence of our incomplete understanding of the nature of aerial warfare, consider the general lack of consensus—or even awareness—of what constitutes an air campaign.12  Guilmartin’s insights apply with particular force to the issue of air intelligence, especially in view of its functions as a vehicle for determining enemy vulnerabilities—which included target sets such as the German aircraft industry, ball bearings, electric power, transportation networks, and oil—and for determining the results of attacks.  The trouble with air campaigns is that their effectiveness tends to be directly proportional to the efficacy of the target-selection and damage-assessment processes. Selection of targets that can realistically be destroyed and also hold clear promise for helping to achieve a larger military strategy is vital. In other words, the objective, scope, and duration of air campaigns must be clear, achievable, and bounded by realistic target selection and an intellectually honest conclusion that attacking selected targets will lead to achievement of stated objectives. To this problem we must add another: the inherent difficulty of gauging the usefulness of air operations. Unlike ground and naval campaigns, in which the parties involved generally know whether the battle was a victory, a draw, or a defeat, air campaigns are prone to uncertainty, and victory or defeat may become evident only gradually.
