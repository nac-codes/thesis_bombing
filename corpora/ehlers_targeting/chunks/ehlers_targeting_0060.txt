While Reichsbahn officials and synthetic oil plant managers proved adept at repairing bomb damage, the German army held doggedly to its doctrinal and ideological assumptions about how the war should be fought at the tactical level. As a result, it failed to decentralize fuel and ammunition depots until late in the war—and never to any appreciable degree in the east—and even then kept them far too distant from the front lines, a problem that proved particularly disastrous in Russia. This, in turn, forced the Germans to demotorize their divisions by sending the vast majority of their trucks to locate and bring back fuel, assuming they could find any at all, which had obvious and negative tactical implications for their armored and mechanized formations. The consequences, in innumerable tactical engagements, were severe fuel shortages resulting in inferior mobility and, once any kind of major retreat began, the loss of vehicles and guns on a massive scale as units ran out of gas and were forced to abandon or destroy their vehicles. Hitler’s noretreat orders made fuel shortages in the east even more serious because they forced armored units to fight much further forward than made sense. This proved disastrous given the Red Army’s tendency to effect deep and narrow penetrations into the German rear areas, making it difficult
