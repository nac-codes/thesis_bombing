armored units to fight much further forward than made sense. This proved disastrous given the Red Army’s tendency to effect deep and narrow penetrations into the German rear areas, making it difficult or impossible for German armored formations, still fighting on the front lines by order of the Fithrer and cut off from fuel depots, to replenish their fuel supplies. Assuming German units survived at all, they did so in most cases with very little heavy equipment, much of which was immobilized by lack of fuel.  This doctrinal, logistical, and command inflexibility interacted with the increasingly sophisticated maneuver warfare practiced by the Red Army during the last two years of the war, which often allowed Soviet armored spearheads to overrun German fuel depots rapidly. It was further affected by the Allied oil offensive, which reduced fuel deliveries to major depots and the front to a trickle by fall 1944. Even in the relatively rare instances where German heavy divisions in the east (and to a slightly lesser degree in the west) were in a tactical position to replenish their fuel stocks, there was often no fuel available where and when they needed it.1£  In addition, as Alfred Mierzejewski has demonstrated, bombers assisted the ground and naval efforts by destroying German rail and canal networks, thus collapsing the German war economy, from fall 1944 to spring 1945. This translated into fewer and fewer weapons—and, most serious of all, less and less fuel and ammunition at the front.” Finally, the CBO’s instrumental role in breaking the Luftwaffe’s back—by killing its best pilots, starving it of fuel, and forcing it to withdraw most of its fighters from the fighting fronts to the Reich—also paid huge dividends by reducing casualties among both air and ground forces and shortening the war.1%  Allied air intelligence played a crucial role in the success of the bombing campaigns of 1944-1945, but it did so under conditions uniquely difficult among the wartime intelli
