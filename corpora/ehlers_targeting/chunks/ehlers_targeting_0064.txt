ntelligence often became captive to opposing groups of senior commanders who sought to win over their bosses to a preferred course of action. As will become evident, these debates began even before the start of the war in Europe and grew in intensity as key players like Air Marshal Arthur Harris sought to gain maximum support and assets for city bombing and others, such as Air Marshal Arthur Tedder and General Carl Spaatz, quarreled not only with Harris about the efficacy of city bombing, but with one another and other senior officers about the relative merits of the transportation and oil plans. Fortunately, the Allies had sufficient aircraft to execute all these plans, and senior political leaders were for the most part willing to let their airmen have the reins. Nonetheless, this constant quarreling and infighting had real costs and created serious friction within the Allied war effort.  Having said this, it was in the effort to increase friction throughout the enemyâ€™s war effort that the air intelligence organizations built first by the British and later, with much British assistance, by the Americans paid their greatest dividends. Their skills increased rapidly as a result of improved analytical and cognitive tools in combination with rapid growth in the number of reconnaissance  Page 7 of 423 3%  ihis doctrinal, logistical, and command infiexibiity interacted with the increasingly sopnisticated Maneuver wartare practiced Dy the Ked Army during the last two years or the war, which often allowed Soviet armored spearheads to overrun German fuel depots rapidly. It was further affected by the Allied oil offensive, which reduced fuel deliveries to major depots and the front to a trickle by fall 1944. Even in the relatively rare instances where German heavy divisions in the east (and to a slightly lesser degree in the west) were in a tactical position to replenish their fuel stocks, there was often no fuel available where and when they needed it.1&  In addition, as A
