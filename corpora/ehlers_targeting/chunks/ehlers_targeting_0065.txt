the east (and to a slightly lesser degree in the west) were in a tactical position to replenish their fuel stocks, there was often no fuel available where and when they needed it.1&  In addition, as Alfred Mierzejewski has demonstrated, bombers assisted the ground and naval efforts by destroying German rail and canal networks, thus collapsing the German war economy, from fall 1944 to spring 1945. This translated into fewer and fewer weapons—and, most serious of all, less and less fuel and ammunition at the front.1Z Finally, the CBO’s instrumental role in breaking the Luftwaffe’s back—by killing its best pilots, starving it of fuel, and forcing it to withdraw most of its fighters from the fighting fronts to the Reich—also paid huge dividends by reducing casualties among both air and ground forces and shortening the war.1®  Allied air intelligence played a crucial role in the success of the bombing campaigns of 1944-1945, but it did so under conditions uniquely difficult among the wartime intelligence services. As John Guilmartin has noted, air intelligence is the most elusive and uncertain of the intelligence disciplines precisely because measuring the effects and effectiveness of air operations is so problematic. “A key problem,” he stated,  is that we approach strategic bombing with the implicit assumption that air campaigns and battles can be judged using the vocabulary, criteria for success or failure, and analytical framework used to evaluate warfare on land and at sea. I contend that the appropriate criteria for judging strategic air campaigns, at least, are quite different and that in consequence the results of the de- bate [over the value of strategic bombardment in World War II] so far are of dubious validity. As evidence of our incomplete understanding of the nature of aerial warfare, consider the general lack of consensus—or even awareness—of what constitutes an air campaign.12  Guilmartin’s insights apply with particular force to the issue of air intellig
