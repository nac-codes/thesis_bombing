ature of aerial warfare, consider the general lack of consensus—or even awareness—of what constitutes an air campaign.12  Guilmartin’s insights apply with particular force to the issue of air intelligence, especially in view of its functions as a vehicle for determining enemy vulnerabilities—which included target sets such as the German aircraft industry, ball bearings, electric power, transportation networks, and oil—and for determining the results of attacks.  The trouble with air campaigns is that their effectiveness tends to be directly proportional to the efficacy of the target-selection and damage-assessment processes. Selection of targets that can realistically be destroyed and also hold clear promise for helping to achieve a larger military strategy is vital. In other words, the objective, scope, and duration of air campaigns must be clear, achievable, and bounded by realistic target selection and an intellectually honest conclusion that attacking selected targets will lead to achievement of stated objectives. To this problem we must add another: the inherent difficulty of gauging the usefulness of air operations. Unlike ground and naval campaigns, in which the parties involved generally know whether the battle was a victory, a draw, or a defeat, air campaigns are prone to uncertainty, and victory or defeat may become evident only gradually. Ralph Bennett’s concept of “contact evidence” versus “non-contact evidence” is vital here.22 While the victors in ground and naval engagements could rely on the former (direct and sustained contact with the enemy), air commanders relied on the latter, particularly in the early years of the war, when they had access to few intelligence sources on the Continent. This reliance on noncontact intelligence persists because aircraft must return to base after their missions, leaving targets attacked in enemy control. Consequently, there is only one way to determine whether anything approaching victory has been achieved: by using
