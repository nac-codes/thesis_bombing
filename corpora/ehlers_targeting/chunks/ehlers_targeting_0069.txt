nomic warfare. They clearly believed the air weapon might also strike a heavy military blow while simultaneously creating profound German morale problems. The resulting faith that their air intelligence capability would someday have a matching operational capability paid off when American bombers began arriving in large numbers in 1943.

Nonetheless, this constant quarreling and infighting had real costs and created serious friction within the Allied war effort.  Having said this, it was in the effort to increase friction throughout the enemy’s war effort that the air intelligence organizations built first by the British and later, with much Brit
