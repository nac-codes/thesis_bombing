s and photoreconnaissance units. The resulting intellectual infrastructure gave airmen a deep understanding of the German war effort and the ways in which bombing could degrade it. The world’s best photoreconnaissance aircraft and cameras, as well as advanced films and techniques, provided superb aerial photos of virtually every German structure and activity of note; signals intelligence capabilities proved vitally important; and highly skilled and experienced photointerpreters and other air intelligence personnel made sense of the data collected. The fact that air intelligence person- nel had direct access to targets, and captured or liberated officials associated with them, proved of paramount importance in their successes.  This introduction has set forth the basic arguments and terms of reference relating to the practice and effects of air intelligence during the bombing campaigns against the Third Reich. The next chapters trace its development from the Great War, when the emergence of rudimentary air intelligence organizations allowed Anglo-American airmen to begin gauging bombing effects and effectiveness; through the interwar period, when a series of surprising doctrinal and technological developments laid the groundwork for the great strides made during the succeeding conflict; and during World War II in Europe, when a mature air intelligence organization facilitated increasingly effective heavy-bomber campaigns. These culminated in the transportation offensive to isolate the Normandy battle area from German reinforcements and supplies (in particular fuel), the oil offensive, and the transportation offensive against the Reich itself. These three campaigns proved crucial to the speed with which the Allies won the war in Europe because they undermined German battlefield mobility, all but grounded the Luftwaffe, and collapsed the German war economy—an economy already much weakened, as we will see, by earlier Bomber Command attacks.  Intelligence is clearly not
