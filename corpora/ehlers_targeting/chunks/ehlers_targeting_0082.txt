Intelligence is clearly not a war-winning capability in its own right. However, if used properly, it can hasten victory, or at least stave off abject defeat. Despite the political machinations and tugs-of- war often surrounding the Allied use of air intelligence, this vital commodity played a central role in both the speed and decisiveness of the Allied victory. In many ways, it provided the leading edge for bombing campaigns that proved instrumental in the defeat of Nazi Germany. Why this was so, and how it happened, will become clear in the course of this study.  TWO  THE GREAT WAR AND THE BEGINNINGS OF AIR INTELLIGENCE  Background  The air weapon evolved quickly during the First World War, demonstrating its value as a means of conducting reconnaissance, spotting and correcting fire for artillery, gaining air superiority over specific areas, and bombing. In the latter role, aircraft served tactical, operational, and strategic purposes. Belligerents on the Western Front viewed bombers as flying artillery platforms with substan- tial range and mobility, and later as independent bombing machines capable of influencing the enemy’s will and ability to continue the war by attacking his war industry, his morale, or both. However, with a few notable exceptions, there was relatively little effort during World War I to use bombers as strategic weapons independent of ground forces to destroy enemy war industry or undermine a civilian population’s morale.4 Even the use of large bomber formations during the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives, vital as it was for the development of aerial bombardment and air intelli- gence, represented tactical and operational employment in support of ground forces.  Consequently, air intelligence developments during the war relied heavily on tools and
