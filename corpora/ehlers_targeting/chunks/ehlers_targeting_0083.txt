ombardment and air intelli- gence, represented tactical and operational employment in support of ground forces.  Consequently, air intelligence developments during the war relied heavily on tools and techniques already in use to analyze artillery barrages. Only late in the war, as more capable bombers with larger bombs and longer ranges emerged, did air intelligence become a distinct field focused on bombing results, with the intellectual, organizational, technological, and training innovations this involved.2 The essence of damage assessment—a key element of the air intelligence effort—was arriving at an accurate understanding of a raid’s effects and effectiveness. The former involved deter- mining physical and morale impacts, while the latter required an assessment of how a particular attack contributed to achieving larger military and policy objectives at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. To determine effects and effectiveness, intelligence officers had to learn specific skills. This capability was evolving rapidly by the end of World War I but was nowhere near maturity.  However, to say air intelligence was not a mature capability by late 1918 is not to say it received no attention. Airmen were heavily involved in developing technologies, training, organizations, and the intellectual infrastructure, or overall organizational framework, characterizing the mature process during World War II. Anglo-American intelligence specialists came to understand that both halves of the damage-assessment equation—bomb damage assessment (BDA) and munitions effectiveness assessment (MEA)—were vital. Although both evolved rapidly in 1917-1918, they fell into obscurity again during the interwar period, only to reemerge with astonishing speed and vigor during World War II.4  Of the crucial elements comprising a mature air intelligence organization—technology, technicians, training, organizations, and intellectual infrastructure—the latter is the most difficult to deve
