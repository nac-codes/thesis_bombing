hains and competition between offices in the ministry, which impeded the evolution and the effectiveness of intelligence organizations at all echelons.  Key to the development of air intelligence organizations, however, was the emergence of a unique combination of technology, technicians, training, and organizational structures, but also two other  Page 11 of 423 4%  TWO  THE GREAT WAR AND THE BEGINNINGS OF AIR INTELLIGENCE  Background  The air weapon evolved quickly during the First World War, demonstrating its value as a means of conducting reconnaissance, spotting and correcting fire for artillery, gaining air superiority over specific areas, and bombing. In the latter role, aircraft served tactical, operational, and strategic purposes. Belligerents on the Western Front viewed bombers as flying artillery platforms with substan- tial range and mobility, and later as independent bombing machines capable of influencing the enemy’s will and ability to continue the war by attacking his war industry, his morale, or both. However, with a few notable exceptions, there was relatively little effort during World War I to use bombers as strategic weapons independent of ground forces to destroy enemy war industry or undermine a civilian population’s morale.4 Even the use of large bomber formations during the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives, vital as it was for the development of aerial bombardment and air intelli- gence, represented tactical and operational employment in support of ground forces.  Consequently, air intelligence developments during the war relied heavily on tools and techniques already in use to analyze artillery barrages. Only late in the war, as more capable bombers with larger bombs and longer ranges emerged, did air intelligence become a distinct field focused on bombing results, with the intellectual, organizational, technological, and training innovations this involved.2 The essence of damage assessment—a key element of the air intelligence effor
