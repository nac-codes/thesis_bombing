With one exception—Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) raids against U-boat bases along the Belgian coast and zeppelin factories in western Germany—little experience existed until 1917-1918. Bombing was too new, the technologies involved too rudimentary, and nobody had practiced anything recognizable as air intelligence. Artillery damage assess- ments provided a start, but nothing more.  During the war’s first year, bombing consisted largely of uncoordinated, opportunistic attacks by aircrews flying reconnaissance missions. These consisted of lobbing a grenade or modified artillery projectile over the side of the aircraft in an effort to hit something. By November, reconnaissance aircraft carried one or more small bombs to attack targets of opportunity. However, the absence of purpose-built bombers, aircrew navigational skills, effective bombsights, and reliable munitions meant bombing evolved through a series of ad hoc expedients, without any damage-assessment capability beyond what the pilot or observer managed to see over his shoulder. Only in November 1917 did British bomb squadrons begin receiving cameras, photographic sections, and intelligence sections to interpret strike and poststrike photographs.*  Although no true intellectual infrastructure existed before 1917, rudimentary capabilities began emerging almost immediately.

The emergence of technicians, including photographic and intelligence officers, and training programs for them, also accelerated as the war continued. Improvements here were twofold. First, photographic personnel learned to mount cameras on aircraft, maintain them between missions, remove plates or film without causing damage
