part, available sources were sketchy and inaccurate; but there were exceptions, such as the destruction of a zeppelin and its shed at Diisseldorf on 8 October 1914. In this case, reliable agents’ reports corroborated the pilot’s statement that flames 300 feet high shot up the entire length of the shed. Nonetheless, such cases were rare. For the most part, the sources RNAS officers relied on for intelligence provided limited and unreliable insights.2  The battle of Loos in September 1915 marked the first time purpose-built British bombers with bombsights and aerial munitions, under centralized control, attacked targets beyond artillery range. The first formal Royal Flying Corps (RFC) damage report on record, composed entirely of pilots’ reports, recorded the results of seven sorties flown in May 1915. Despite poor bombing, the RFC was in the damage-assessment business and developed increasingly sophisticated reports from 1915 to 1918.2  Effects of Artillery Damage Assessment  Targets in British (and later American) directives were mostly beyond the range of artillery but directly related to the ground war, as at the battle of Loos, providing a further reminder that senior officers viewed bombers as extensions of artillery. This had major ramifications for bombing and damage assessment, which evolved from damage-assessment tools developed by and for artillerymen. Consequently, to understand the evolution of air intelligence during World War I, we must look first at the role of artillery and its interaction with observation and spotting aircraft.  There is abundant evidence that senior officers viewed bombers as extensions of field artillery rather than independent bombing platforms. By mid-1915, despite publication of the first bombing directives, the British Army’s official position on bombers was that “aerial attack has not proved to be a serious operation of war.”2 Consequently, Allied commanders, “disenchanted with bombing attacks far from the front line, gave pr
