ps is crucial because it indicates a direct tie between artillery and BDA, and indeed a fusion of such reporting into common intelligence products. Battle maps, produced at corps and army headquarters, were thus compilations of the effects of artillery and air attacks on enemy units and emplacements. To use aterm that came into use during World War II, the destruction maps were the artillery version of “bomb plots” used by photointerpreters to locate bomb strikes while assessing damage.12  The development of bombing doctrine and practice in 1914-1918 therefore represented a nonlinear evolution. Initially, bombers evolved as longrange, highly mobile artillery, a function they have retained in the roles of close air support and battle-area interdiction. However, this changed in 1917-1918 as the Germans and British bombed each other’s cities, and as the British and Americans began sending bombers against deep targets such as marshaling yards, airfields, supply depots, and factories. These new forms of bombing presaged what became known as strategic bombing during World War II. They required new technicians, tools, and techniques. One key result of these developments was the birth of damage assessment as a distinct intelligence discipline.  Air Intelligence Developments, 1916  The first bombing campaign with military-strategic aims occurred in 1916, when the RNAS and French Army bomber squadrons attempted to impede the German war effort by destroying industrial targets, in the process drawing German fighters from the front to protect these targets. This offensive was hampered by a severe shortage of pilots and machines, and by the continued absence of onboard cameras for strike photos.12 The only bright spot was the French air staff’s attention to target selection and damage assessment. French planners and their British counterparts developed a target list, including steel furnaces and arms plants, and ranked them by their importance to the German war effort. They then
