as a report provided by an escaped French POW working at the plant during the raid, which said damage was “much more considerable than first reported, [with] the new Works which prisoners were building suffering severely.”22 On a less positive note, he said several bombers dropped their bombs on factories in adjacent towns. Aircrews also claimed “direct hits on the blast furnaces” during a raid on the Thyssen steelworks at Hagendingen the same month, a claim corroborated by French intelligence sources. Three of five blast furnaces were destroyed in this unusually effective raid.24 On 10 and 11 November, bombers attacked the ironworks at Volkingen, again claiming direct hits. Once again, French human intelligence sources claimed serious damage, but the absence of poststrike photography and trained photointerpreters to determine the extent of the damage made these efforts inspired guesswork.22 This tendency to overstate results had its genesis in three problems: a lack of cameras on bombers to collect strike photos, a lack of  manne ainannnn sienen Lt fae wantatetlen nL aban 2nd nen 2d 1 nant Lahn AM shenn Lanne n Alans in n5- ide swerved: ewa'e cnt wsine  Page 16 of 423 5%  LTE USVELOPITIETIL OF DUTTLUITIE GQOCLIIME allt PIACLICE Ih AFLG LALO LIELELOLIS LEVIS red 24 MOTI CVOLULIONL.

However, this changed in 1917-1918 as the Germans and British bombed each other’s cities, and as the British and Americans began sending bombers against deep targets such as marshaling yards, airfields, supply depots, and factories. These new forms of bombing presaged what became known as strategic bombing during World War II. They required new technicians, tools, and techniques. One key result of these developments was the birth of damage assessment as a distinct intelligence discipline.  Air Intelligence Developments, 1916  The fir
