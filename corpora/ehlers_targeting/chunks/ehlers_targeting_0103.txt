ground commanders, who had tasking authority over observation squadrons, rarely allocated scarce reconnaissance assets to assess the effects of bombing missions, which most of them considered wasted effort. Intelligence officers therefore had to rely on aircrew reports until November 1917, when one British bomber per squadron began carrying a camera to record results.22  A British raid by No. 3 Wing of the RNAS on the Mauser arms factory at Oberndorf on 12 October 1916 was typical. Aircrews briefed “unreported results,” British and German communiqués and press reports were naturally at odds with one another regarding damage, and there was no poststrike reconnaissance. The only bright spot was a report provided by an escaped French POW working at the plant during the raid, which said damage was “much more considerable than first reported, [with] the new Works which prisoners were building suffering severely.”23 On a less positive note, he said several bombers dropped their bombs on factories in adjacent towns. Aircrews also claimed “direct hits on the blast furnaces” during a raid on the Thyssen steelworks at Hagendingen the same month, a claim corroborated by French intelligence sources. Three of five blast furnaces were destroyed in this unusually effective raid.24 On 10 and 11 November, bombers attacked the ironworks at Volkingen, again claiming direct hits. Once again, French human intelligence sources claimed serious damage, but the absence of poststrike photography and trained photointerpreters to determine the extent of the damage made these efforts inspired guesswork.2* This tendency to overstate results had its genesis in three problems: a lack of cameras on bombers to collect strike photos, a lack of reconnaissance aircraft for poststrike photos, and small and ineffective bombs. All three became clear in postwar surveys.  For instance, although these surveys indicate British bombing caused a 1,714-ton steel production shortfall at V6lkingen in November 1916
