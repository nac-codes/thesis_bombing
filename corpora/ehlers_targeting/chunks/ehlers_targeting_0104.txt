ineffective bombs. All three became clear in postwar surveys.  For instance, although these surveys indicate British bombing caused a 1,714-ton steel production shortfall at V6lkingen in November 1916, and damages totaling 42,000 marks, the effect on production was minor, and the impact on the German war economy negligible.?® As one scholar has noted,  the means for estimating material damage and morale effect during hostilities were necessarily fragmentary and often contradictory. The indicators needed to evaluate the campaign’s effect- iveness were largely unavailable to the Allied air staffs. Without the required indicators, such as post-strike photographs and access to enemy industrial records, British and French planners had to rely upon available indicators (aircrew observations, captured letters, agents’ reports, and articles/editorials in German periodicals) to judge the results of bombing.22  Consequently, this first strategic bombing effort did not appreciably reduce German production or force the Germans to redeploy large numbers of fighters, nor would anyone have been able to make an educated assessment either way.28 These poor results, combined with the arrival of new German fighters and the British loss of air superiority, led senior leaders to call off the offensive in March 1917. This state of affairs might have persisted had the Germans not bombed England, creating popular demand for reprisal bombing.  Bombing: A Renewed Emphasis  The British bombing effort received a new lease on life with German Gotha and Giant bomber raids on London. As one author notes, “the raids had an impact disproportionate to the bomb load they carried,” which totaled 7.5 tons.22 There was little panic, and then only after the opening raids, but there was anger, and Parliament had to address public grievances. The raids sparked a renewed interest in bombing as a retaliatory and strategic weapon. Lord George Curzon, head of the British Air Board, told the War Cabinet that “w
