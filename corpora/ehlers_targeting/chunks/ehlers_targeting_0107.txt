ners were building suffering severely.”22 On a less positive note, he said several bombers dropped their bombs on factories in adjacent towns. Aircrews also claimed “direct hits on the blast furnaces” during a raid on the Thyssen steelworks at Hagendingen the same month, a claim corroborated by French intelligence sources. Three of five blast furnaces were destroyed in this unusually effective raid.24 On 10 and 11 November, bombers attacked the ironworks at Volkingen, again claiming direct hits. Once again, French human intelligence sources claimed serious damage, but the absence of poststrike photography and trained photointerpreters to determine the extent of the damage made these efforts inspired guesswork.2* This tendency to overstate results had its genesis in three problems: a lack of cameras on bombers to collect strike photos, a lack of reconnaissance aircraft for poststrike photos, and small and ineffective bombs. All three became clear in postwar surveys.  For instance, although these surveys indicate British bombing caused a 1,714-ton steel production shortfall at Volkingen in November 1916, and damages totaling 42,000 marks, the effect on production was minor, and the impact on the German war economy negligible.? As one scholar has noted,  the means for estimating material damage and morale effect during hostilities were necessarily fragmentary and often contradictory. The indicators needed to evaluate the campaign’s effect- iveness were largely unavailable to the Allied air staffs. Without the required indicators, such as post-strike photographs and access to enemy industrial records, British and French planners had to rely upon available indicators (aircrew observations, captured letters, agents’ reports, and articles/editorials in German periodicals) to judge the results of bombing.22  Consequently, this first strategic bombing effort did not appreciably reduce German production or force the Germans to redeploy large numbers of fighters, nor would any
