in 1916-1917, strategic bombing as a concept and an operational reality rose like a phoenix from its own ashes to play a modest role in the war’s final campaigns. Despite its billing as a strategic campaign, the effort was largely operational because Major General Trenchard, general officer commanding, IF, focused on airdromes and forward marshaling yards, which he saw as more valuable targets than industry. Given the limited capabilities of bombers at the time and the German Michael Offensive, he may have been right. Unfortunately, he also showed a disregard for damage  Page 19 of 423 6%  Nee ee ee ee eee ee en ee ee ee ee eee eee a eee ee ee ened ee eR AC EE A RE SA ARE RAEI EPR E ESET RY CRS ree Re AR Ee ee Se Volkingen, again claiming direct hits. Once again, French human intelligence sources claimed serious damage, but the absence of poststrike photography and trained photointerpreters to determine the extent of the damage made these efforts inspired guesswork.2° This tendency to overstate results had its genesis in three problems: a lack of cameras on bombers to collect strike photos, a lack of reconnaissance aircraft for poststrike photos, and small and ineffective bombs. All three became clear in postwar surveys.  For instance, although these surveys indicate British bombing caused a 1,714-ton steel production shortfall at Volkingen in November 1916, and damages totaling 42,000 marks, the effect on production was minor, and the impact on the German war economy negligible.2® As one scholar has noted,  the means for estimating material damage and morale effect during hostilities were necessarily fragmentary and often contradictory. The indicators needed to evaluate the campaign’s effect- iveness were largely unavailable to the Allied air staffs. Without the required indicators, such as post-strike photographs and access to enemy industrial records, British and French planners had to rely upon available indicators (aircrew observations, captured letters, agent
