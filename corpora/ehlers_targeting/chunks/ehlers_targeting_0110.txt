red indicators, such as post-strike photographs and access to enemy industrial records, British and French planners had to rely upon available indicators (aircrew observations, captured letters, agents’ reports, and articles/editorials in German periodicals) to judge the results of bombing.22  Consequently, this first strategic bombing effort did not appreciably reduce German production or force the Germans to redeploy large numbers of fighters, nor would anyone have been able to make an educated assessment either way.28 These poor results, combined with the arrival of new German fighters and the British loss of air superiority, led senior leaders to call off the offensive in March 1917. This state of affairs might have persisted had the Germans not bombed England, creating popular demand for reprisal bombing.  Bombing: A Renewed Emphasis  The British bombing effort received a new lease on life with German Gotha and Giant bomber raids on London. As one author notes, “the raids had an impact disproportionate to the bomb load they carried,” which totaled 7.5 tons.22 There was little panic, and then only after the opening raids, but there was anger, and Parliament had to address public grievances. The raids sparked a renewed interest in bombing as a retaliatory and strategic weapon. Lord George Curzon, head of the British Air Board, told the War Cabinet that “we do not recede from the view that a long-range offensive is in itself a most desirable thing and should be systematically pursued when the force is available for the purpose.”22 The key outcome, based on recommendations in the Smuts report, was the birth of the RAF on 1 April 1918.24  The new service soon created a bombing wing, under independent command, to conduct reprisal and strategic attacks. Although strategic attacks proved to be the exception, the Independent Force (IF) and its predecessors, the 41st Wing and 8th Brigade, began bombing industrial and urban targets in October 1917.
