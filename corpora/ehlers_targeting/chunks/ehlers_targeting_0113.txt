Despite its billing as a strategic campaign, the effort was largely operational because Major General Trenchard, general officer commanding, IF, focused on airdromes and forward marshaling yards, which he saw as more valuable targets than industry. Given the limited capabilities of bombers at the time and the German Michael Offensive, he may have been right. Unfortunately, he also showed a disregard for damage assessments, choosing to focus on morale effects. His assertion that “the moral effect of bombing stands undoubtedly to the material in proportion of 20 to 1” had no basis in fact.22 It was a myth the Air Ministry perpetuated after the war, with serious consequences for the development of bombing doctrine, operational capabilities, and damage assessments.  The purpose of the IF’s campaign, which began in June 1918, was twofold: reprisals for German raids and a vaguely defined “strategic” air campaign to undermine workers’ morale and collapse the German war effort. Brigadier General Cyril Newall, 41st Wing commander, proposed attacking vital industries systematically as more bombers became available, and the Air Ministry agreed.22 As will become clear, Trenchard had other ideas, but the reemergence of British bombing drove the development of a rudimentary air intelligence organization.  The most important result of the so-called Gotha Summer for air intelligence was the realization that a sustained bombing campaign, regardless of focus, required a capability to assess effects and effectiveness.
