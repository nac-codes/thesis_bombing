lt of the so-called Gotha Summer for air intelligence was the realization that a sustained bombing campaign, regardless of focus, required a capability to assess effects and effectiveness. Consequently, the British and Americans established intelligence and photographic sections in their bomber units in late 1917. These, combined with the formation of air staffs, training for intelligence and photographic officers, and new technologies, resulted in a nascent air intelligence organization by 1918. The technologies were already evolving.  Photoreconnaissance and Photointerpretation  They included reconnaissance aircraft, cameras, facilities for rapid photo developing, and optical devices for viewing photos. Photographic and branch intelligence officers used them to develop and interpret photos, fuse the insights gleaned with intelligence from other sources, and produce raid reports for aircrews and senior officers who required them to plan, execute, and assess the results of bombing raids. By fall 1917, belligerents on the Western Front were taking over 8,000 pictures daily. As better pursuit aircraft drove reconnaissance aircraft to higher altitudes, a reciprocal process developed, forcing the development of improved cameras, better film, and bromide photographic paper with superior granularity for higher-resolution photographs. Frigid temperatures also drove de- velopment of electric and engine-exhaust heating systems to keep cameras, plates, and film from freezing.4  The fact that bombers lacked cameras to record results of missions in progress also indicated the minor emphasis on damage assessments until the British began equipping one bomber per squadron with a camera in November 1917.32 As late as September 1918, an AEF telegram reminded the army’s assistant chief of supply that all observation aircraft should be equipped with cameras for vertical and oblique photography and radios for tactical communications.?® Days later, another telegram said, “it is absolute
