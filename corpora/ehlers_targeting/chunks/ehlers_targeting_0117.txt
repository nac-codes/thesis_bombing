Brigadier General Cyril Newall, 41st Wing commander, proposed attacking vital industries systematically as more bombers became available, and the Air Ministry agreed.?# As will become clear, Trenchard had other ideas, but the reemergence of British bombing drove the development of a rudimentary air intelligence organization.  The most important result of the so-called Gotha Summer for air intelligence was the realization that a sustained bombing campaign, regardless of focus, required a capability to assess effects and effectiveness. Consequently, the British and Americans established intelligence and photographic sections in their bomber units in late 1917. These, combined with the formation of air staffs, training for intelligence and photographic officers, and new technologies, resulted in a nascent air intelligence organization by 1918. The technologies were already evolving.  Photoreconnaissance and Photointerpretation  They included reconnaissance aircraft, cameras, facilities for rapid photo developing, and optical devices for viewing photos. Photographic and branch intelligence officers used them to develop and interpret photos, fuse the insights gleaned with intelligence from other sources, and produce raid reports for aircrews and senior officers who r
