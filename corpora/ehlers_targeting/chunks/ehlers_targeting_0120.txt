nd.22  By fall 1917, Anglo-American airmen were calling for larger bombs. In response, the Bombing Committee, responsible for developing improved munitions, sought a doubling in the production of 230-pound bombs. The committee also called for an increase in the production of 112-pound bombs from 10,000 to 12,000 per week. A few weeks later, the committee asked the Air Board to purchase 1,000 each of the experimental 1,650-pound and 700-pound bombs, both designed to knock out hardened structures such as factories and U-boat berths. Complementing this interest in larger bombs was an initiative to arm them with long-delay fuses to impede debris clearance and repairs.4°  The increasing size of American munitions in 1917 paralleled the British trend and signaled a basic change in the kinds of targets bomber crews were attacking by 1917, including marshaling yards, bridges, and industrial facilities. In December 1917, the Department of Aircraft Production sent the Ordnance Department a request for three new bombs based on British designs. These became the Mark IV, V, and VI, weighing, respectively, 250, 550, and 1,000 pounds. Two AEF telegrams reiterated these requirements in February 1918.44  Insights from British experiences also led American designers to produce thin-walled versions of large bombs to maximize cratering effects against marshaling yards, and thick-walled variants with delay fuses to penetrate deep into industrial facilities and destroy machinery. Tests demonstrated the huge difference in cratering effects between the first generation of small bombs and the second  aanaratinn af laraar nnac Tha Mark 11 96 _naind hamh urith 11 naunde af avninciva nradiucad 4 cratar 8 faat in diamatar and A faat daan urhila tha Mark VT 1 ANA_naund hamh urith & 8A naunde af av_  Page 21 of 423 T%  a ee ee SS Se ee, eee eee ee a NS eS EEE ——————E—E———E————_—————— eee ee EE  —E—————EeEeee a ee ee ek ee ee ee eee  for intelligence and photographic officers, and new technologies
