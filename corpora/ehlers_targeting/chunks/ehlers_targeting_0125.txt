, which spurred intelligence and ordnance officers to analyze the effects of German bombs in order to improve their own munitions. The largest German bomb, weighing 300 kilograms (660 pounds), did severe damage to buildings and produced craters 30 feet in diameter and 15 feet deep, but 100-kilogram (220-pound) bombs were largely ineffective. For attacks on industrial or urban targets, large bombs were clearly much more effective pound for pound.2  By fall 1917, Anglo-American airmen were calling for larger bombs. In response, the Bombing Committee, responsible for developing improved munitions, sought a doubling in the production of 230-pound bombs. The committee also called for an increase in the production of 112-pound bombs from 10,000 to 12,000 per week. A few weeks later, the committee asked the Air Board to purchase 1,000 each of the experimental 1,650-pound and 700-pound bombs, both designed to knock out hardened structures such as factories and U-boat berths. Complementing this interest in larger bombs was an initiative to arm them with long-delay fuses to impede debris clearance and repairs.42  The increasing size of American munitions in 1917 paralleled the British trend and signaled a basic change in the kinds of targets bomber crews were attacking by 1917, including marshaling yards, bridges, and industrial facilities. In December 1917, the Department of Aircraft Production sent the Ordnance Department a request for three new bombs based on British designs. These became the Mark IV, V, and VI, weighing, respectively, 250, 550, and 1,000 pounds. Two AEF telegrams reiterated these requirements in February 1918.44  Insights from British experiences also led American designers to produce thin-walled versions of large bombs to maximize cratering effects against marshaling yards, and thick-walled variants with delay fuses to penetrate deep into industrial facilities and destroy machinery. Tests demonstrated the huge difference in cratering effects between the
