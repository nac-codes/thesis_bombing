.m. the following morning.*2 While the photographic officer had cameras and photographic plates removed from aircraft and postraid photographs developed, the intelligence officer and the group operations officer debriefed returning aircrews, collected their observations, and composed, edited, and signed the squadron’s raid reports. These included information from aircrew debriefings, strike photos taken during raids and annotated by the branch intelligence officer, and occasionally post- strike photos taken by aircraft from neighboring observation squadrons.4%  The Air Ministry Directorate of Air Intelligence (DAI), Section Alla, received five copies of each raid report, which stayed in Air Ministry channels for analytical and reference purposes. This directorate was responsible for “compilation of Daily Air Intelligence Summaries” and fused intelligence products using raid reports, prisoner interrogations, agent reports, technical intelligence from downed enemy aircraft, and other sources. This division of labor between flying squadrons and Air Ministry DAI marked the first point at which damage assessments became part of what was called third-phase (detailed) interpretation and analysis during World War II.  The American Air Service component of the AEF copied British procedure and organizations, an initiative endorsed by General John J. Pershing, the commander in chief of the AEF, in summer 1917.42 Pershing approved formation of an independent air staff, subordinate in name only to Signal Corps Headquarters. From the outset, this intelligence capability involved collection, interpretation, and dissemination of photointelligence to provide accurate artillery and BDA. The report emphasized the importance of aerial reconnaissance at the corps and army levels and within bombardment squad- rons, calling it “the principal new element” in the intelligence equation.*2  ML.
