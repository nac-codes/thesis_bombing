Each observation group kept one copy of every photo in the Intelligence Office and two in the Operations Room. “The Intelligence Officer,” it continued,  will keep a card index of photographs taken, showing the size of camera used, coordinates of the center, index number of the photograph, altitude and date on which taken, together with a  dona 1 . ca 7. 1 e- 1 oa sade a wa eae 185  Page 22 of 423 7%  depots, industrial facilities, aerodromes, and other targets beyond artillery range. This demanded new skills as the number of bombing missions increased dramatically in the war’s final months. New tools such as stereoscopic viewing devices and workstations with bright lighting revealed the contrasts and shadowing in aerial photographs.  By fall 1917, the British Intelligence School was open. The Americans followed suit in July 1918, with the creation of a school in Langres.*2 Before these training centers opened, intelligence officers received no formal instruction in tools and techniques. Whatever training they received was on the job. Photointerpretation skills learned at the schools helped officers assess bombing results and work effectively with photographic officers.  Emerging Air Intelligence Organizations  In 1918, the French Army General Headquarters of the Armies of the North and Northeast published Study and Exploitation of Aerial Photographs, illustrating advances in photointerpretation and, by extension, damage assessment. This foundational document, translated into English, influenced British and American BDA development. One of its crucial conclusions said, “the study of aerial photographs must be entrusted to specialists, who should be provided with all possible means of verification.”“* This reference was not just to photointerpreters in general, but rather a recognition that specific subspecialties of photointerpreters had emerged by 1918, several of which focused entirely, in conjunction with air intelligence officers, on assessing bombing effects
