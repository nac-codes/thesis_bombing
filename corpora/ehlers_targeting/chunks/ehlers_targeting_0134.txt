her a recognition that specific subspecialties of photointerpreters had emerged by 1918, several of which focused entirely, in conjunction with air intelligence officers, on assessing bombing effects and effectiveness.4*  An essential element of instruction was change detection, which involved examining each photo in conjunction with previous ones showing the same area or facility (known as comparative coverage) to determine what the enemy had done there recently. This became enormously important during bombing campaigns in World War II, as photointerpreters and intelligence officers looked for signs of rebuilding and reconstitution at industrial facilities, rail centers, and oil plants.4®  The British were the first to assign both intelligence and photographic officers to bomb squadrons and higher headquarters. No. 55 Squadron had them by November 1917. The branch intelligence officer was responsible for providing postraid results and assessments to higher echelons by 7:00 a.M. the following morning.*2 While the photographic officer had cameras and photographic plates removed from aircraft and postraid photographs developed, the intelligence officer and the group operations officer debriefed returning aircrews, collected their observations, and composed, edited, and signed the squadron’s raid reports. These included information from aircrew debriefings, strike photos taken during raids and annotated by the branch intelligence officer, and occasionally post- strike photos taken by aircraft from neighboring observation squadrons.‘  The Air Ministry Directorate of Air Intelligence (DAI), Section Alla, received five copies of each raid report, which stayed in Air Ministry channels for analytical and reference purposes. This directorate was responsible for “compilation of Daily Air Intelligence Summaries” and fused intelligence products using raid reports, prisoner interrogations, agent reports, technical intelligence from downed enemy aircraft, and other sources.
