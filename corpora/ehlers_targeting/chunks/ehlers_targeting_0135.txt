Pershing, the commander in chief of the AEF, in summer 1917.42 Pershing approved formation of an independent air staff, subordinate in name only to Signal Corps Headquarters. From the outset, this intelligence capability involved collection, interpretation, and dissemination of photointelligence to provide accurate artillery and BDA.
