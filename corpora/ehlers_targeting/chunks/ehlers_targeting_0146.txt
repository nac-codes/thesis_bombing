re remarkable not just because they seized, correctly, on the single greatest vulnerability in the German war machine, but also because they represented the first effort to view bombing in terms of target sets that could, if damaged sufficiently, collapse the enemy’s war effort. Tiverton’s related initiative to establish realistic bombardment training against white-chalk outlines with the same dimensions as the most im- portant nitrogen-fixation plants, in which crews would practice navigating to the target in day and night conditions, was another forward-looking idea.*2  Tiverton said the German chemical industry must be the focus of IF raids. “The general policy which led to the formation of the Independent Force,” he said,  . Or le  is the demobilization of the German Armies-in-the-Field, by attacking the root industries which supply them with munitions. ... The object being to dislocate and finally to obliterate the important key industry which supplies the necessary material for explosives, propellants and poison gas, every effort should be made to concentrate upon this one industry to the exclusion of everything else .. . therefore until these targets are completely crippled no others should be attacked.*8  In a subsequent note Tiverton reemphasized that  The modern Army-in-the-field is absolutely dependent upon munitions. ... There are... certain key industries which can be destroyed and the destruction of which will produce a bottle-neck and consequently put an end indirectly to the whole output of munitions. Some 80% of the whole chemical industry of Germany is concentrated in 12 works within raiding distance from the Nancy [Ochey Airfield] area. The contents are undoubtedly vulnerable and the works would be practically impossible to duplicate out of reach. The effect, therefore, of destroying these works would be to cut off the supply of high explosives, of mustard gas, and propellant powder. Germany is almost completely relying upon synthetic nitric acid
