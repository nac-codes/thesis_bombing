effect, therefore, of destroying these works would be to cut off the supply of high explosives, of mustard gas, and propellant powder. Germany is almost completely relying upon synthetic nitric acid for all high explosives.*2  Tiverton had grasped the greatest underlying weakness in the German war economy. He also knew that nearly all the plants were within range of British bombers based at Ochey, and that they were almost all along the Rhine River, making them relatively easy for bomber crews to locate. Finally, Tiverton hit upon a vital fact regarding chemical plants, which Allied intelligence specialists recog- nized over two decades later in synthetic oil plants: they were large, vulnerable to bombing, and not capable of dispersing their operations or moving to locations out of bomber range.  The only thing Tiverton did not address directly was damage assessment. Nonetheless, there is clear evidence that Tiverton implicitly considered it in his plans. His preoccupation with bomb weight required to destroy a given target or all those within a larger target set, for instance, indicates he foresaw a concerted bombing effort, and, by extension, a means for determining its effects and effectiveness. However, he never explicitly discussed damage assessments, indicating that despite early efforts to establish air intelligence capabilities, they had not yet become an integral part of the targeting-operations—assessment feedback loop, as they would during World War II.  Sykes, who concurred with Tiverton, pushed Trenchard to attack nitrogenfixation plants. Trenchard, however, ignored Sykes and attacked operational targets in support of ground forces. These included marshaling yards to slow the German advance during their spring and summer 1918 offensives, and aerodromes to destroy German fighters or keep them occupied in air defense duties— reasonable targets, given the German Michael Offensive.® Brigadier General Percy Groves, chief of DFO, highlighted in a memo to Syk
