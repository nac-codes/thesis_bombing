destroy German fighters or keep them occupied in air defense duties— reasonable targets, given the German Michael Offensive.® Brigadier General Percy Groves, chief of DFO, highlighted in a memo to Sykes the degree to which Trenchard was diverging from the IF’s stated policy of attacking German war industries. From 1 June to 31 August, IF attacks on the chemical industry declined from 14 percent to 9.5 percent, while attacks on enemy airfields rose from 13.3 per- cent to 49.5 percent. Groves also said raids on marshaling yards, making up most of the other missions, were “far too high,” given the bombing directive. This haranguing did no good.*  By September 1918, Trenchard commanded 9 bombing squadrons totaling 110 aircraft with an aggregate bomb load of 142,000 pounds.® This figure pales when we consider that the British planned to field 60 squadrons of Handley-Page V/1500 bombers (840 aircraft) in 1919, each of which carried 7,500 pounds of bombs, for an aggregate bomb load of 6,300,000 pounds, or over 44 times what Trenchard’s bombers carried—a huge increase in capability that could have driven bombing and air intelligence forward.  Limitations  Despite the bombing campaign’s tactical focus and Trenchard’s view that it was bound to be ineffective given limitations at the time, air intelligence and photographic officers produced a steady stream of raid reports. Most included inputs from aircrew debriefings and strike or poststrike photographs. Nonetheless, postwar British and American bombing surveys demonstrated a tendency to overesti- mate damage, particularly for industrial facilities and airdromes, the former because bomb damage was difficult to gauge, the latter because hangars and runways were easy to repair.®4  Similar problems occurred during the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives, over which Mitchell exercised centralized control of 323 bombers, including five American bomb squadrons, a French night bomb group, and British IF squadrons.
