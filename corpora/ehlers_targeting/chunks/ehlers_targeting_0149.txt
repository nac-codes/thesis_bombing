Meuse-Argonne offensives, over which Mitchell exercised centralized control of 323 bombers, including five American bomb squadrons, a French night bomb group, and British IF squadrons. This force, although small by World War II standards, was an unprecedented concentration of bomber strength. For the St. Mihiel offensive, bombers were “to destroy and harass the rear areas of the battlefield, and to attack military and industrial objectives beyond the range of artillery” and “to cause a dispersion of enemy anti-aircraft defense (anti-air-  Page 27 of 423 8%  ie ee ee ee nee eee on nee nee nae ie ee ne ee renee ee ee a ee eee ee eee ee ee ee eee ee nn Ne NN NO NN I Ne RIND ND NNN ON ODA LIND AD DDR BD DN Nee DDD.

Sykes, who concurred with Tiverton, pushed Trenchard to attack nitrogenfixation plants. Trenchard, however, ignored Sykes and attacked operational targets in support of ground forces. These included marshaling yards to slow the German advance during their spring and summer 1918 offensives, and aerodromes to destroy German fighters or keep them occupied in air defense duties— reasonable targets, given the German Michael Offensive.©° Brigadier General Percy Groves, chief of DFO, highlighted in a memo to Sykes the degree to which Trenchard was diverging from the IF’s stated policy of attacking German war industries. From 1 June to 31 August, IF attacks on the chemical industry declined from 14 percent to 9.5 percent, while attacks on enemy airfields rose from 13.3 per- cent to 49.5 percent. Groves also said raids on marshaling yards, making up most of the other missions, were “far too high,” given the bombing directive. This haranguing did no good.&  By September 1918, Trenchard commanded 9 bombing squadrons totaling 110 aircraft with an aggregate bomb load of 142,000 pounds.® This figure pales wh
