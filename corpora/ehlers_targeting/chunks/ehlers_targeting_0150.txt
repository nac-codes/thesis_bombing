bombing directive. This haranguing did no good.&  By September 1918, Trenchard commanded 9 bombing squadrons totaling 110 aircraft with an aggregate bomb load of 142,000 pounds.® This figure pales when we consider that the British planned to field 60 squadrons of Handley-Page V/1500 bombers (840 aircraft) in 1919, each of which carried 7,500 pounds of bombs, for an aggregate bomb load of 6,300,000 pounds, or over 44 times what Trenchard’s bombers carried—a huge increase in capability that could have driven bombing and air intelligence forward.  Limitations  Despite the bombing campaign’s tactical focus and Trenchard’s view that it was bound to be ineffective given limitations at the time, air intelligence and photographic officers produced a steady stream of raid reports. Most included inputs from aircrew debriefings and strike or poststrike photographs. Nonetheless, postwar British and American bombing surveys demonstrated a tendency to overesti- mate damage, particularly for industrial facilities and airdromes, the former because bomb damage was difficult to gauge, the latter because hangars and runways were easy to repair.*4  Similar problems occurred during the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives, over which Mitchell exercised centralized control of 323 bombers, including five American bomb squadrons, a French night bomb group, and British IF squadrons. This force, although small by World War II standards, was an unprecedented concentration of bomber strength. For the St. Mihiel offensive, bombers were “to destroy and harass the rear areas of the battlefield, and to attack military and industrial objectives beyond the range of artillery” and “to cause a dispersion of enemy anti-aircraft defense (anti-air- craft guns, pursuit patrols, etc.)”®5  Attacks on high-value targets, including the rail center at Conflans, were often effective in slowing the movement of German troops and supplies.
