ture emerged at all, and that it was able to provide effective damage assessments at least some of the time, was significant and would have a substantial impact on the creation of its more capable successor during World War II. Third, air intelligence officers’ inability to collect sufficient intelligence about the physical effects of bombing led a number of officers to make outlandish assertions about its morale effects. Finally, as the next chapter illustrates, British and American postwar bombing surveys assessing effectiveness were different in character and arrived at divergent conclusions about the best employment of bombers, and therefore of air intelligence.

Limitations  Despite the bombing campaign’s tactical focus and Trenchard’s view that it was bound to be ineffective given limitations at the time, air intelligence and photographic officers produced a steady stream of raid reports. Most included inputs from aircrew debriefings and strike or poststrike photographs. Nonetheless, postwar British and American bombing surveys demonstrated a tendency to overesti- mate damage, particularly for industrial facilities and airdromes, the former because bomb damage was difficult to gauge, the latter because hangars and runways were easy to repair.®4  Similar problems occurred during the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offen
