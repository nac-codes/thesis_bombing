a successful conclusion of hostilities.©®  This after-action report, based on numerous raid reports containing assessments based on hard evidence such as aerial photos, soft evidence such as aircrew reports, and even softer evidence such as railroad workers’ comments after the Armistice, made clear the serious limitations still inherent in damage assessment. On balance, the air intelligence organization was simply not yet capable of pro- viding detailed analyses.  Results of the final bombing offensives, as they related to the development of damage assessments, were fourfold. First, they reemphasized how rudimentary damage-assessment capabilities still were, despite the emergence of a fledgling intellectual infrastructure. Second, the fact that an intellectual infrastructure emerged at all, and that it was able to provide effective damage assessments at least some of the time, was significant and would have a substantial impact on the creation of its more capable successor during World War II. Third, air intelligence officers’ inability to collect sufficient intelligence about the physical effects of bombing led a number of officers to make outlandish assertions about its morale effects. Finally, as the next chapter illustrates, British and American postwar bombing surveys assessing effectiveness were different in character and arrived at divergent conclusions about the best employment of bombers, and therefore of air intelligence.

Most included inputs from aircrew debriefings and strike or poststrike photographs. Nonetheless, postwar British and American bomb
