rwar period, greatly affected the development of theory, doctrine, and capabilities.1 The bombing survey had enormous influence because a summary version made it to the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS), HQ Air Service, and several other locations. ACTS strategic bombing advocates relied on it as a foundational document in developing precision daylight bombardment doctrine. Implications for air intelligence were implicit but nonetheless dramatic. A detailed examination of the effect of these postwar reports, and their key wartime proponents, will shed light on the close relationship between bombing doctrine and air intelligence during World War II.  This examination must begin by assessing the influence of three key players. The first two, Tiverton and Trenchard, had very different ideas about the efficacy and optimum employment of bombers, a divergence that had a major influence on the development of British and American damage-assessment capabilities before and during the Second World War. The third, Lieutenant Colonel Edgar S. Gorrell, an American airman, adopted Tiverton’s ideas nearly verbatim. His writings during and after World War I had a profound influence on the development of American strategic bombing doc- trine and by extension the intelligence capabilities required to support it.  The development of British damage-assessment capabilities in the war’s final year and throughout the interwar period revolved around the acrimonious debate between Tiverton and Trenchard, who became RAF chief of air staff in the immediate postwar period. These officers had profound disagreements about bombing, and both used available intelligence reports, such as they were, to advance their opposing views. As we will see, Allied commanders did this several times during the Second World War, with some profound effects on the course of both the heavy-bomber effort and larger strategic debates. In the case of the opening debate, although neither Tiverton nor Trenchard appears to
