grasp of industrialized warfare and the potential vulnerabilities of an enemy’s war industry. His study of German industry as a collection of target sets, based on functional specialization, made him the first theoretician of aerial warfare to do so. Tiverton said the first thing to consider was the overriding objective, which in this case was to cripple Germany’s war effort. He identified vulnerable industries and within them “bottleneck targets,” individual sites that, if destroyed, would cause the German war effort to collapse. Of these, he placed the chemical industry, in particular nitrogen-fixation plants, at the top of his prioritized target lists. He also produced a number of papers emphasizing the importance of concentra- tion, logistics, navigation, and proper armaments for effective bombing.?  Tiverton was also convinced that to identify the best targets, Air Ministry officers should consult with engineers, industrialists, and technicians. This recommendation prefigured the emergence during World War II of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and on the American side the Committee of Operations Analysts and the Enemy Objectives Unit, which gathered detailed information on Ger- man industry and made it available to intelligence specialists. Tiverton’s proposals confirm that he understood the feedback loop between targeting, bombing, and damage assessment.  Finally, Tiverton advocated a shift from amorphous target lists and morale bombing to systematic target selection according to their effects on key industries, and the use of specific bomb types for each target. However, nothing came of this or Tiverton’s other efforts to push Independent Force (IF) bombing from a morale to a target-system focus.4  Trenchard rejected Tiverton’s recommendations; indeed, it is doubtful whether he even seriously considered them. As the general officer commanding the IF, he exercised operational control independent of the Air Ministry. This allowed Trenchard to run the bombing
