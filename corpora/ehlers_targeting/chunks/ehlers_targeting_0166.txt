e IF, he exercised operational control independent of the Air Ministry. This allowed Trenchard to run the bombing campaign as he saw fit.  Trenchard  Perhaps the greatest irony is the fact that Trenchard, called the Father of the Royal Air Force, had no enthusiasm for strategic bombing under any circumstances until long after Armistice Day. Trenchard ignored Air Staff directives to attack industries and instead employed IF bombers against tactical targets, mostly airfields and marshaling yards. He also preferred attacking cities rather than specific industrial targets, saying such an approach would have the maximum morale effect on the German people. As one scholar notes,  Trenchard made this concept of air warfare the basis of his policy in the years following the war, and this led the peacetime air staffs to believe that the dropping of large tonnages on urban areas would present few difficulties. This in turn bred a complacency among the planners, and caused them to underestimate the problems concerned with finding the way to the target area and dropping bombs accurately on a specific objective.>  This is a telling insight. Indeed, Trenchard’s approach to bombing, which assumed that every bomb dropped successfully on cities had a morale effect on German civilians and was therefore automatically effective in lowering German morale, resulted in the overstated premise that each bomb dropped on German cities would bring the enemy a few steps closer to the negotiating table. Ironically, Trenchard and his staff relied on a definition of morale bombing developed by Tiverton in one of his staff papers characterizing it as anything “which hinders the German output of munitions, apart from actual material damage done to works.”® Trenchard’s view, however, took Tiverton’s definition to an illogical extreme and made damage assessments a functional irrelevancy by advancing a tautology.  Trenchard nonetheless required submission of detailed raid reports immediately after each
