ition to an illogical extreme and made damage assessments a functional irrelevancy by advancing a tautology.  Trenchard nonetheless required submission of detailed raid reports immediately after each mission and reviewed them personally, often appending comments, most of which emphasized morale effects. In this sense, Trenchard used damage reports as political documents. He was determined to show the Air Ministry and the War Department that every bomb dropped on German cities degraded morale. Trenchard argued tirelessly that morale effects were great even when physical damage was minor.? Among his most notable claims during the IF air offensive was the statement that “it would be no exaggeration to say that every unit of the Independent Force immobilizes at least 50 times its fighting value from the ranks of the enemy.” When combined with his assertion that “at present the moral effect of bombing stands undoubtedly to the material effect in a proportion of 20 to 1, and therefore it was necessary to create the greatest moral effect possible,” it becomes clear that Trenchard  tira Barntad an mnvnla APants 9 Ula Alainnn elbinataler nenernd Lallacs Davhanan mach earnalina dannita Tran chaeda nhlin annactians that tha mavens aPant nf L am hin had Laan laennt veneer eennt Min bin  Page 32 of 423 9%  Perhaps the greatest irony is the fact that Trenchard, called the Father of the Royal Air Force, had no enthusiasm for strategic bombing under any circumstances until long after Armistice Day.

He also preferred attacking cities rather than specific industrial targets, saying such an approach would have the maximum morale effect on the German people. As one scholar notes,  Trenchard made this concept of air warfare the basis of his policy in the years following the war, and this led the peacetime air staffs to believe that
