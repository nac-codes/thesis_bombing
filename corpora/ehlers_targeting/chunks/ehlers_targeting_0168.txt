t on the German people. As one scholar notes,  Trenchard made this concept of air warfare the basis of his policy in the years following the war, and this led the peacetime air staffs to believe that the dropping of large tonnages on urban areas would present few difficulties. This in turn bred a complacency among the planners, and caused them to underestimate the problems concerned with finding the way to the target area and dropping bombs accurately on a specific objective.4  This is a telling insight. Indeed, Trenchard’s approach to bombing, which assumed that every bomb dropped successfully on cities had a morale effect on German civilians and was therefore automatically effective in lowering German morale, resulted in the overstated premise that each bomb dropped on German cities would bring the enemy a few steps closer to the negotiating table. Ironically, Trenchard and his staff relied on a definition of morale bombing developed by Tiverton in one of his staff papers characterizing it as anything “which hinders the German output of munitions, apart from actual material damage done to works.”* Trenchard’s view, however, took Tiverton’s definition to an illogical extreme and made damage assessments a functional irrelevancy by advancing a tautology.  Trenchard nonetheless required submission of detailed raid reports immediately after each mission and reviewed them personally, often appending comments, most of which emphasized morale effects. Inthis sense, Trenchard used damage reports as political documents. He was determined to show the Air Ministry and the War Department that every bomb dropped on German cities degraded morale. Trenchard argued tirelessly that morale effects were great even when physical damage was minor.2 Among his most notable claims during the IF air offensive was the statement that “it would be no exaggeration to say that every unit of the Independent Force immobilizes at least 50 times its fighting value from the ranks of the enemy.” When
