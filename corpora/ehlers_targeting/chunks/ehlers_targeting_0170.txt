deas about morale effects and Gorrell’s own views that bombing should be a day-and-night, around-the-clock effort to destroy key target sets, and especially the bottleneck targets within them. A letter from Gorrell to Tiverton thanking him for the loan of his notes on strategic bombing is particularly revealing, as is a review of the two men’s bombing plans, which are nearly identical. Gorrell’s plan was a synthesis of Tiverton’s emphasis on analytical planning and systematic implementation, Trenchard’s ideas about morale effects, and his own views that bombing could be decisive by depriving the German army of certain key items through the destruction of certain industries, thus breaking the trench stalemate. The Gorrell Plan became a foundational planning and educational document at ACTS and thus represents one of the first glimmers of the industrial web theory and its outcome, Air War Plans Division Plan 1 (AWPD-1), produced in summer 1941.12  The fact that Gorrell’s—read Tiverton’s—plan had such a great influence on American doctrine, despite Gorrell’s failure to sell the plan to his bosses during the war, is crucial. Careful study of his plan at ACTS in the 1920s and 1930s had clear implications for targeting and damage-assessment requirements during World War II. Tiverton’s focus on industrial target sets and bottleneck targets, ad- equate bomber concentrations, effective navigation, and quality bombs and bombsights all became key components of American bombing doctrine and practice.  The Tiverton-Gorrell connection is important for three reasons. First, it demonstrates Tiverton’s influence on American strategic bombing, particularly since the Gorrell Plan was required reading for faculty and students at ACTS.2 Second, it helps us understand why British and American bombing doctrine diverged, gradually during the interwar period, and then sharply during World War II. Finally, it suggests how important bombing doctrine, objectives, and campaign planning would be
