effects.® His claims ultimately proved hollow. Perhaps most revealing, despite Trenchard’s public assertions that the morale effect of bombing had been “great—very great,” is his private diary entry on the day of the Armistice: “Thus the Independent Force comes to an end. A more gigantic waste of effort and personnel there has never been in any war.”12  Despite the fact that Trenchard’s views on bombing prevailed in Great Britain, Tiverton exerted tremendous influence on American strategic bombing advocates during and after World War I. His advocacy of precision bombing, by definition, required damage assessments to determine bombing’s effects and effectiveness, a fact not lost on American airmen. Ironically, Tiverton had far more in- fluence on American bombing theory, doctrine, and practice than he did on his countrymen, who filed his records away.  Gorrell  Then-Major Edgar S. Gorrell became head of the Strategical [Bombing] Section, Zone of Advance, American Expeditionary Force, in September 1917. While serving in Paris, he met Lord Tiverton, whose writings on strategic bombing he read avidly. In fact, it is now clear that the “Gorrell Plan” for the strategic bombing of Germany, long attributed to the American, was in fact a copy of Tiverton’s draft strategic bombing plan combined with Trenchard’s ideas about morale effects and Gorrell’s own views that bombing should be a day-and-night, around-the-clock effort to destroy key target sets, and especially the bottleneck targets within them. A letter from Gorrell to Tiverton thanking him for the loan of his notes on strategic bombing is particularly revealing, as is a review of the two men’s bombing plans, which are nearly identical.14 Gorrell’s plan was a synthesis of Tiverton’s emphasis on analytical planning and systematic implementation, Trenchard’s ideas about morale effects, and his own views that bombing could be decisive by depriving the German army of certain key items through the destruction of certain in
