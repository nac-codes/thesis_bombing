tematic implementation, Trenchard’s ideas about morale effects, and his own views that bombing could be decisive by depriving the German army of certain key items through the destruction of certain industries, thus breaking the trench stalemate. The Gorrell Plan became a foundational planning and educational document at ACTS and thus represents one of the first glimmers of the industrial web theory and its outcome, Air War Plans Division Plan 1 (AWPD-1), produced in summer 1941.12  The fact that Gorrell’s—read Tiverton’s—plan had such a great influence on American doctrine, despite Gorrell’s failure to sell the plan to his bosses during the war, is crucial. Careful study of his plan at ACTS in the 1920s and 1930s had clear implications for targeting and damage-assessment requirements during World War II. Tiverton’s focus on industrial target sets and bottleneck targets, ad- equate bomber concentrations, effective navigation, and quality bombs and bombsights all became key components of American bombing doctrine and practice.  The Tiverton-Gorrell connection is important for three reasons. First, it demonstrates Tiverton’s influence on American strategic bombing, particularly since the Gorrell Plan was required reading for faculty and students at ACTS.42 Second, it helps us understand why British and American bombing doctrine diverged, gradually during the interwar period, and then sharply during World War II. Finally, it suggests how important bombing doctrine, objectives, and campaign planning would be in the development of an Allied air intelligence organization. Also central to Anglo-American bomb- ing developments—and divergence—were the postwar bombing surveys.  Postwar Bombing Surveys  Immediately after the Great War, ground survey teams traveled to western Germany to assess bombing’s effects and effectiveness. Their reports, which corroborated wartime damage reports with German reports of damage to the same targets, provide a superb means for checking the acc
