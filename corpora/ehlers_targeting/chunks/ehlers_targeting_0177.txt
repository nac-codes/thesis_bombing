reporting noted bombing’s limited morale effects. Unfortunately, the heavily edited final version of the British survey contained none of the original concerns about morale bombing’s likely ineffectiveness. Instead, it made outlandish claims, referring to “the immense moral effect of our air raids into Germany” and the “indisputable proof of the efficacy of air raids during the period under review.”!£ The final report also said of German workers: “Constant alarms and raids ruined their nerves, in some cases for life... . Had the war continued a few months longer, a more or less total breakdown of labour at several of the Works might have been confidently expected.”!2 These reports made civilian morale an alluring target for British airmen, particularly once daylight bombing failed in 1939-1940.  The American survey arrived at different conclusions, and although the full report was misfiled and lost until 1974, the executive summary made it to several locations, including ACTS, where it exerted a key influence on the development of strategic bombing doctrine.2° The report noted the indirect effects of bombing, including loss of production due to time in air raid shelters, lower morale, and too little sleep; the cost of defenses such as air raid shelters, antiaircraft artillery, and fighters; and the diversion of resources from offensive to defensive purposes.*! It also arrived at some of the same questionable assertions as the British version: “It is certain that air raids had a tremendous effect on the morale of the entire people.”22 In every other respect, however, the survey arrived at startlingly different conclusions. To begin with, it criticized the IF’s “lack of a predetermined program carefully calculated to destroy by successive raids those industries most vital in maintaining Germany’s fighting forces.”2? It concluded that “the enemy’s morale was not sufficiently affected to handicap the enemy’s fighting forces in the field. ... Bombing for morale effect a
