, France, Belgium, and western Germany, intelligence officers could determine with great accuracy the degree of damage heavy bombers did to German industry. This use of the enemy’s damage reports during the course of the war to determine bombing effects and effectiveness marks one of many stark differences between damage assessments in the two world wars. In fact, this allowed the Allies to improve their bomb- ing effectiveness from one campaign to the next, and even during the same campaign.  Divergent Ideas about Bombing, Not About Damage Assessment  British and American experiences with bombing during World War I, and the different conclusions they drew from them, drove the development of divergent ideas in the final months of the war. These ideas, most of which faded from public discourse during the interwar period, reemerged rapidly at the end of the interwar years and in the ne early stages of World War II.

The fact that the survey’s authors were intelligence officers who understood the damage-assessment process as it had developed in 1917-1918 is significant.  American advocacy of systematic and heavy bombing target by target, and the belief that morale bombing was largely ineffective, were the two most important consequences of the survey’s dissemination. In fact, ACTS training courses, the development of AWPD-1 and its successor, AWPD-42, and World War II bombing campaigns all underscore the degree to which American airmen came to support the ideas reflected in the survey.2®  The implications of the postwar bombing surveys are clear. Whatever incentive the British had to retain a substantive air intelligence capability largely disappeared in the wake of the
