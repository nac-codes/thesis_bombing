lthough the British and Americans did not have access to them until after the war in this instance, the story was different in World War II. Capitalizing on Ultra decrypts of German messages containing damage reports and on captured damage records compiled by the Germans and other officials in Italy, France, Belgium, and western Germany, intelligence officers could determine with great accuracy the degree of damage heavy bombers did to German industry. This use of the enemy’s damage reports during the course of the war to determine bombing effects and effectiveness marks one of many stark differences between damage assessments in the two world wars. In fact, this allowed the Allies to improve their bomb- ing effectiveness from one campaign to the next, and even during the same campaign.  Divergent Ideas about Bombing, Not About Damage Assessment  British and American experiences with bombing during World War I, and the different conclusions they drew from them, drove the development of divergent ideas in the final months of the war. These ideas, most of which faded from public discourse during the interwar period, reemerged rapidly at the end of the interwar years and in the early stages of World War II. Airmen from both countries shared the same underlying belief about the potential efficacy of bombing: “A fundamental assertion that became central to Anglo-American thinking about long-range bombing was that modern, complex, urban-based societies are fragile, interdependent, and therefore particularly vulnerable to disruption through aerial bombing.”2° However, after a brief and unsuccessful daylight bombing effort in 1939 and 1940, the British turned to night city bombing to destroy German urban areas and undermine German morale. In contrast, the Americans opted for high-altitude precision daylight bombardment.  Consequently, it is here that we would logically assume a divergence in bomb damage assessment emphasis and procedures during the interwar period and World
