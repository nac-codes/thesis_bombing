after a brief and unsuccessful daylight bombing effort in 1939 and 1940, the British turned to night city bombing to destroy German urban areas and undermine German morale. In contrast, the Americans opted for high-altitude precision daylight bombardment.  Consequently, it is here that we would logically assume a divergence in bomb damage assessment emphasis and procedures during the interwar period and World War II. Yet there was none. Neither side continued developing any kind of serious air intelligence capability after 1918. And the British, once they again began paying serious attention to strategic bombing after 1936, actually adopted Tivertonian rather than Trenchardian ideas and tried to conduct precision daylight bombardment in 1939-1940. The British shift from daylight precision to night area bombing produced no significant changes in their highly developed Tivertonian capabilities. What this meant was that a superb British damage-assessment capability came to be paired with American daylight precision bombing, which it was supremely well fitted to support. This serendipitous relationship had dramatic implications for the conduct, assessment, and effectiveness of the Alliesâ€™ heavy-bomber cam- paigns during the Second World War.  FOUR  RETRENCHMENT AND ADVANCE  Air Intelligence Developments in the Early Interwar Period, 1919-1933  Continuity amid Crisis  The legacy of the Great War, with its many associated issues, largely undermined the Anglo-American air intelligence organizations created in 1917-1918. Foremost among these issues were a profound exhaustion and a deep revulsion toward war that accompanied the Armistice. Hard on their heels came pacifism, low military budgets, isolationism in the United States, and quasiisolation- ism in the United Kingdom. They were accompanied by an economic fragility in Great Britain and a turning inward in both countries, resulting in their partial absence from European affairs for the next two decades.
