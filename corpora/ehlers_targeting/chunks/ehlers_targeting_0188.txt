ey were accompanied by an economic fragility in Great Britain and a turning inward in both countries, resulting in their partial absence from European affairs for the next two decades. In the United States, a focus on hemispheric security and the belief that the country faced no major threats in the 1920s and early 1930s resulted in a military austerity that only deepened once the country plunged into the Great Depression. In Great Britain, particularly after 1930, the extreme fiscal austerity of the world economic crisis had a similar effect on military expend- itures, although the British dedicated more resources to aircraft development and production than these contextual factors might otherwise lead one to believe.+  Yet there was persistence in the idea of bombing in the Anglo-American camp. “Perhaps,” noted Richard Overy, “it isno coincidence that strategic bombardment was embraced wholeheartedly before the Second World War by the two states in which industrial society was most fully developed and in which the planning and preparation for war relied much more on civilian initiative and a close col- laboration of the politicians and industrialists.”2  The same thing might be said of the development of intelligence-related capabilities. Indeed, given the overarching contextual factors just described, the surprise is not that the nascent air intelli- gence organization withered away, but rather that several of its component parts remained and that there were impressive advances.  In assessing this retrenchment and subsequent advance, two distinct periods present themselves. The first, from the Armistice until the accession of Adolf Hitler to power in Germany in January 1933, saw the dissolution of the infrastructure into a collection of surviving component parts that developed for the most part in isolation from one another. After Hitler came to rule, a second and much more intense period of military developments began. The British responded by expanding and begi
