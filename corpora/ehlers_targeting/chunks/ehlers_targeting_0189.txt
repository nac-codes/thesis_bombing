developed for the most part in isolation from one another. After Hitler came to rule, a second and much more intense period of military developments began. The British responded by expanding and beginning to amalgamate several economic and air intelligence organizations established in the 1920s and early 1930s. Most important were the Committee of Imperial Defenceâ€™s Advisory Committee on Trade Questions in Time of War (ATB), founded in December 1923, and its Industrial Intelligence Centre (IIC), established in 1931. The British built on these during the late interwar period by establishing the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Intelligence Subcommittee in June 1936 and by subsuming the ATB and IIC within the Ministry of Economic Warfare in September 1939. This ministry would play a key role in the air intelligence process during the Second World War. There was, in addition, a major expansion of the Air Ministry, including the reemergence of a dedicated Directorate of Intelligence, which worked increasingly closely with the Ministry of Economic Warfare.

Consequently, it is here that we would logically assume a divergence in bomb damage assessment emphasis and procedures during the interwar period and World War II. Yet there was none. Neither side continued developing any kind of serious air intelligence capability after 1918. And the British, once they again began paying serious attention to strategic bombing after 1936, actually adopted Tivertonian rather than Trenchardian ideas and tried to conduct precision daylight bombardment in 1939-1940. The British shift from daylight precision to night area bombing produced no significant changes in their highly developed Tivertonian capabilities. What this meant was that a superb British damage-assessment capability came to be paired with American daylight precision bombing, which it was supremely well fitted to support. This serendipitous relationship had dramatic implications for the
