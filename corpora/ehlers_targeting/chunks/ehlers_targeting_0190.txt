mage-assessment capability came to be paired with American daylight precision bombing, which it was supremely well fitted to support. This serendipitous relationship had dramatic implications for the conduct, assessment, and effectiveness of the Allies’ heavy-bomber cam- paigns during the Second World War.  FOUR  RETRENCHMENT AND ADVANCE  Air Intelligence Developments in the Early Interwar Period, 1919-1933  Continuity amid Crisis  The legacy of the Great War, with its many associated issues, largely undermined the Anglo-American air intelligence organizations created in 1917-1918. Foremost among these issues were a profound exhaustion and a deep revulsion toward war that accompanied the Armistice. Hard on their heels came pacifism, low military budgets, isolationism in the United States, and quasiisolation- ism in the United Kingdom. They were accompanied by an economic fragility in Great Britain and a turning inward in both countries, resulting in their partial absence from European affairs for the next two decades. In the United States, a focus on hemispheric security and the belief that the country faced no major threats in the 1920s and early 1930s resulted in a military austerity that only deepened once the country plunged into the Great Depression. In Great Britain, particularly after 1930, the extreme fiscal austerity of the world economic crisis had a similar effect on military expend- itures, although the British dedicated more resources to aircraft development and production than these contextual factors might otherwise lead one to believe.t  Yet there was persistence in the idea of bombing in the Anglo-American camp. “Perhaps,” noted Richard Overy, “it is no coincidence that strategic bombardment was embraced wholeheartedly before the Second World War by the two states in which industrial society was most fully developed and in which the planning and preparation for war relied much more on civilian initiative and a close col- laboration of the politician
