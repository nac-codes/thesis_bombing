two states in which industrial society was most fully developed and in which the planning and preparation for war relied much more on civilian initiative and a close col- laboration of the politicians and industrialists.”2  The same thing might be said of the development of intelligence-related capabilities. Indeed, given the overarching contextual factors just described, the surprise is not that the nascent air intelli- gence organization withered away, but rather that several of its component parts remained and that there were impressive advances.  In assessing this retrenchment and subsequent advance, two distinct periods present themselves. The first, from the Armistice until the accession of Adolf Hitler to power in Germany in January 1933, saw the dissolution of the infrastructure into a collection of surviving component parts that developed for the most part in isolation from one another. After Hitler came to rule, a second and much more intense period of military developments began. The British responded by expanding and beginning to amalgamate several economic and air intelligence organizations established in the 1920s and early 1930s. Most important were the Committee of Imperial Defence’s Advisory Committee on Trade Questions in Time of War (ATB), founded in December 1923, and its Industrial Intelligence Centre (IIC), established in 1931. The British built on these during the late interwar period by establishing the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Intelligence Subcommittee in June 1936 and by subsuming the ATB and IIC within the Ministry of Economic Warfare in September 1939. This ministry would play a key role in the air intelligence process during the Second World War. There was, in addition, a major expansion of the Air Ministry, including the reemergence of a dedicated Directorate of Intelligence, which worked increasingly closely with the Ministry of Economic Warfare. One of its new offices, R.D.Arm.4 (Analysis of Bombing Results), was dedicated to an
