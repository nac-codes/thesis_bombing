h more intense period of military developments began. The British responded by expanding and beginning to amalgamate several economic and air intelligence organizations established in the 1920s and early 1930s. Most important were the Committee of Imperial Defence’s Advisory Committee on Trade Questions in Time of War (ATB), founded in December 1923, and its Industrial Intelligence Centre (IIC), established in 1931. The British built on these during the late interwar period by establishing the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Intelligence Subcommittee in June 1936 and by subsuming the ATB and IIC within the Ministry of Economic Warfare in September 1939. This ministry would play a key role in the air intelligence process during the Second World War. There was, in addition, a major expansion of the Air Ministry, including the reemergence of a dedicated Directorate of Intelligence, which worked increasingly closely with the Ministry of Economic Warfare. One of its new offices, R.D.Arm.4 (Analysis of Bombing Results), was dedicated to analyzing the results of British practice bombing, thus becoming involved in developing effective procedures for determining bombing effects and effectiveness. During the same period, the Air Ministry established several functional boards, including the Bombing Committee, active from January 1934, which began setting forth requirements for creating a heavy-bomber force capable of inflicting serious damage on Germany’s war economy. These developments during the late interwar period, as we shall see in the next chapter, marked the emergence of perhaps the most vital element of the air intelligence organization: civilian and military agencies dedicated to targeting and damageassessment functions, working with one another and sharing information within a reemerging intellectual infrastructure. This process was initially turbulent, given the uncertain extent of each organization’s responsibilities and the consequent turf wars, but as it gathered
