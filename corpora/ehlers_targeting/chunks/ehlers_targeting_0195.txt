hin a reemerging intellectual infrastructure. This process was initially turbulent, given the uncertain extent of each organization’s responsibilities and the consequent turf wars, but as it gathered momentum, an impressive set of capabilities emerged.2  Organizational Retrenchment When the Great War ended, the component parts of the nascent Anglo-American air intelligence organizations went their separate ways, surviving on a sparse diet of interwar tasks and funds.

After Hitler came to rule, a second and much more intense period of military developments began.
