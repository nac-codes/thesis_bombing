air intelligence process during the Second World War. There was, in addition, a major expansion of the Air Ministry, including the reemergence of a dedicated Directorate of Intelligence, which worked increasingly closely with the Ministry of Economic Warfare. One of its new offices, R.D.Arm.4 (Analysis of Bombing Results), was dedicated to analyzing the results of British practice bombing, thus becoming involved in developing effective procedures for determining bombing effects and effectiveness. During the same period, the Air Ministry established several functional boards, including the Bombing Committee, active from January 1934, which began setting forth requirements for creating a heavy-bomber force capable of inflicting serious damage on Germany’s war economy. These developments during the late interwar period, as we shall see in the next chapter, marked the emergence of perhaps the most vital element of the air intelligence organization: civilian and military agencies dedicated to targeting and damageassessment functions, working with one another and sharing information within a reemerging intellectual infrastructure. This process was initially turbulent, given the uncertain extent of each organization’s responsibilities and the consequent turf wars, but as it gathered momentum, an impressive set of capabilities emerged.4  Organizational Retrenchment  When the Great War ended, the component parts of the nascent Anglo-American air intelligence organizations went their separate ways, surviving on a sparse diet of interwar tasks and funds. In most cases, they did so by performing functions that appeared to have little or nothing to do with air intelligence, a process linked in the public’s mind to bombing, which was widely viewed during the interwar period as an instrument of aggressive war. As a means of gauging the degree to which these interwar currents affected manpower, consider the case of the Air Ministry Directorate of Intelligence. In June 1918, the chi
