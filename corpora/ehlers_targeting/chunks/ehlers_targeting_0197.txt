trument of aggressive war. As a means of gauging the degree to which these interwar currents affected manpower, consider the case of the Air Ministry Directorate of Intelligence. In June 1918, the chief of air staff had nine people in his front office, the Directorate of Flying Operations (DFO) thirteen (including Tiverton), and the Directorate of Air Intelligence (DAI) thirty-three, including eleven in A.I.1, the Bomb Raids and Targets Section. By November 1919, these directorates had shrunk to four people in the front office of the chief of air staff and a total of fifteen in DOI—an amalgamated office combining the duties of the wartime DFO and DAI—with seven officers on the operations side and eight on the intelligence side. Nonetheless, the more significant side of this development was that DAI, although amalgamated within DFO and reduced in terms of manpower billets, survived to provide a nucleus for growth during World War II.  On a less sanguine note, with the dissolution of General Headquarters (GHQ) American Expeditionary Force and its air staffin 1919, the only American air intelligence organization then in existence disappeared, not to be glimpsed again until the Army Air Corps Act of 1926 made provision for a G-2 air branch (which later became a larger and more capable G-2 air section), and the creation of a small intelligence section within GHQ Air Force when it was created in March 1935. This latter development occurred, in spite of War Department G-2 objections, because the GHQ Air Force leadership insisted that their mission to deploy airpower immediately upon the outbreak of war required air intelligence relating to potential adversaries.4  Gorrell’s Doctrinal Influences  Despite huge manpower cuts in the Anglo-American air arms during the immediate postwar period, doctrinal developments were anything but retrograde, especially in the American air arm. In fact, American doctrine became vibrant in the early 1920s. Emerging American ideas about high-a
