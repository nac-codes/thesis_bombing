twar period, doctrinal developments were anything but retrograde, especially in the American air arm. In fact, American doctrine became vibrant in the early 1920s. Emerging American ideas about high-altitude precision daylight bombardment represented “a doctrine in search of an airplane”—a search end- ing with the fortuitous arrival of the B-17.  Not surprisingly, the first American airman to advocate strategic bombing, and air intelligence as its vital adjunct, was Lieutenant Colonel Gorrell, the officer who adopted Tiverton’s theories and advanced them as the template for future air warfare. In an instructional guide for airmen he wrote just after the war, Gorrell compared bombing and artillery, noting that “the conceptions spoken of in this paper are not new, since they represent for the Air Service the same phase of development along well defined lines, and with approximately the same proportionate increase, as has been true of artillery,” the lessons from which, he continued, “apply exactly to the aviation situation when we consider the questions of the aerial bombardments to be effected in the future.”® In a particularly pres- cient passage, Gorrell rhetorically asked,  What would happen if the artillery [in this case aircraft] were able to prolong and intensify its fire on the important objectives in that zone where occurs the ebb and tide of the extensive main- tenance and replenishment which now goes on in all security from our attack? What would happen if bases of communication were destroyed, supplies of rations and materiel cut off for several days, if reserve troops were subjected to the demoralizing effect of fire without defense or repartee being possible? The bombardment airplane should be looked upon as a long-range gun capable of doing what the fixed artillery cannot manage.2  From there, he turned to a more detailed discussion of bombardment aviation’s role in what we today would call battle area (or deep) interdiction, emphasizing the future valu
