In most cases, they did so by performing functions that appeared to have little or nothing to do with air intelligence, a process linked in the public’s mind to bombing, which was widely viewed during the interwar period as an instrument of aggressive war.

By November 1919, these directorates had shrunk to four people in the front office of the chief of air staff and a total of fifteen in DOI—an amalgamated office combining the duties of the wartime DFO and DAI—with seven officers on the operations side and eight on the intelligence side. Nonetheless, the more significant side of this development was that DAI, although amalgamated within DFO and reduced in terms of manpower billets, survived to provide a nucleus for growth during World War II.  On a less sanguine note, with the dissolution of General Headquarters (GHQ) American Expeditionary Force and its air staff in 1919, the only American air intelligence organi
