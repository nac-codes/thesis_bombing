owth during World War II.  On a less sanguine note, with the dissolution of General Headquarters (GHQ) American Expeditionary Force and its air staff in 1919, the only American air intelligence organization then in existence disappeared, not to be glimpsed again until the Army Air Corps Act of 1926 made provision for a G-2 air branch (which later became a larger and more capable G-2 air section), and the creation of a small intelligence section within GHQ Air Force when it was created in March 1935. This latter development occurred, in spite of War Department G-2 objections, because the GHQ Air Force leadership insisted that their mission to deploy airpower immediately upon the outbreak of war required air intelligence relating to potential adversaries.2  Gorrell’s Doctrinal Influences  Despite huge manpower cuts in the Anglo-American air arms during the immediate postwar period, doctrinal developments were anything but retrograde, especially in the American air arm. In fact, American doctrine became vibrant in the early 1920s. Emerging American ideas about high-altitude precision daylight bombardment represented “a doctrine in search of an airplane”—a search end- ing with the fortuitous arrival of the B-17.  Not surprisingly, the first American airman to advocate strategic bombing, and air intelligence as its vital adjunct, was Lieutenant Colonel Gorrell, the officer who adopted Tiverton’s theories and advanced them as the template for future air warfare. In an instructional guide for airmen he wrote just after the war, Gorrell compared bombing and artillery, noting that “the conceptions spoken of in this paper are not new, since they represent for the Air Service the same phase of development along well defined lines, and with approximately the same proportionate increase, as has been true of artillery,” the lessons from which, he continued, “apply exactly to the aviation situation when we consider the questions of the aerial bombardments to be effected in the fut
