s intelligence included the following categories:  (1) Location and military importance of bombardment objectives.  (2) The effects of bombardment raids on targets.  (3) The strength, disposition, and location of enemy artillery forces and airdromes. (4) The strength and disposition of enemy ground defenses against aircraft.  (5) The ground organization for aids to navigation, such as lighthouses, bombs, etc. (6) All additional information concerning activities or locations of the enemy.  The requirements for air intelligence were explicit and marked the first point during the interwar period at which a doctrine document placed such emphasis on them.  A closely related training regulation codified these doctrinal principles. It began with a mission statement for bombardment aviation: “The mission of bombardment aviation is, like all other offensive forces of a nation, to utilize its power within its utmost capabilities toward the defeat of the enemy.” The emphasis was clearly on offensive action.  Principles for employment of bombers, also detailed in this document, included a number of admonitions straight from Tiverton:  (1) Only employ a bombing force in accordance with and furtherance of the definite tactical or strategical plans. Aimless or haphazard bombing is to be avoided.  (2) To carefully select targets (considering the importance and vulnerability) and attack only those that offer a reasonable degree of success.

(4) Bombing attacks must be thorough and carried to their completion. Complete destruction of targets must be accomplished and day and night bombing must be continuous until definitely terminated. Only by such means can the maximum amount of demoralization which bombing is capable of
