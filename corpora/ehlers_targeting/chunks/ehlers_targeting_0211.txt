of bombs selected should be used in each case, to insure complete destruction and to create the fear that leads to demoralization.  (6) Detachments, constituting as they do, a detriment to all arms, are particularly so, owing to the high degree of technicality, to bombing units and must be avoided.  (7) A practical and accurate knowledge of the capabilities of a bombing force is most essential, as a failure to apply it at the proper time and in the correct manner may be the determining factor between success and defeat.1>  The document continued with the statement:  In battle a bombing force presents a means whereby a commander may extend his theater of operations to practically any desired depth into the enemy territory, where without a bombing force his interference with enemy activity ceases with the range of his heavy artillery. ... The role of a bombing force in battle would be to destroy means of communication and transportation, thus preventing evacuation and renewal of forces and supplies, also to destroy all materials, depots and airdromes, continuing this destruction into the strategical areas during this period.1©  In other words, the focus was on an effective integration of airpower into an overall military campaign—one in which bombers attacked targets likely to produce the greatest effects in conjunction with ground forces, and therefore one calculated to make bombing an effective instrument in combined-arms operations.  These principles had significant implications for the development of air intelligence. Bombers were to be used only in accordance with a clear strategy in which they struck vital objectives with maximum synergy between ground and air units. Target selection and other aspects of air-campaign planning were to be engaged in judiciously and carefully, with an eye toward choosing target sets likely to cause the enemy the most grievous harm. Bombing would be concerted and intensive, and it would not be stopped until key target sets were dest
