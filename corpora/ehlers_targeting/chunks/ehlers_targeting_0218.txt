telligence, were designed to get Allied armies to the Reich as quickly as possible, at the lowest possible cost in blood and treasure, and with the greatest possible maneuver and firepower advantages. Indeed, this was the essence of bombing doctrine during the early interwar period and of bombing operations in World War II, a crucial point too often obscured by the inflammatory, counterproductive, and pointless conceptions of armies and air forces as adversarial rather than intertwined and coequal.  There is, however, a key caution in order here. Obviously, the army leadership was unlikely to allow publication of official doctrine advocating anything other than direct or indirect support of the ground effort, and any airman who disagreed had to be very careful about how he approached the problem, especially after Mitchell's court-martial. The preceding discussion should not lull us into believing all airmen embraced the early interwar focus on combined-arms doctrine with open arms, either then or later. In fact, during the Second World War, a number of senior airmen remained airpower zealots, hoping and trying for victory from the air. Harris is perhaps the best known of these, but Spaatz is also prominent among them. Of course, none of the most senior army leaders, including Marshall, would seriously entertain this course of action, so the actual employment of heavy bombers from 1943 to 1945 held more closely to early interwar doctrine than to the more ex- treme views developed at the Air Corps Tactical School later in the interwar period.2° This had important implications for the development of air intelligence capabilities after 1935.  Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) Influences  The crucial exception to the idea that bombers and armies were complementary developed at ACTS between 1927 and 1934, when a group of zealous bomber advocates on the faculty argued that “proper selection of vital targets in the industrial/economic/social structure of a modern industriali
