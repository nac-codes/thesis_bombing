By destroying marshaling yards and thus pushing back railheads further and further from the front, heavy bombers could precipitate major enemy supply crises. Sherman therefore related bombing directly to effects on enemy ground forces and to the greater effectiveness it would give friendly armies, emphasizing “the vital importance of lines of communications, and the disaster that may follow upon their destruction.”1£ These views on the future role of bombardment aviation were remarkably accurate and presaged the disaster that befell German armies in the field as a result of the transportation and oil offensives in 1944-1945.  Sherman’s ideas conformed to Gorrell’s, namely, that bombing was “a vital factor in the success of any army.”!* Unfortunately, incendiary claims by interwar airpower theorists such as Douhet, Trenchard, and Mitchell that airpower would be a decisive instrument in its own right obscured the more sensible idea that bombers (and all aircraft) should, both directly and indirectly, support the advance of ground forces. Attacks on munitions factories, transportation infrastructure, and oil plants were not to be made for their own sake. Rather, they were to be made in support of a combined- arms strategy. To paraphrase Clausewitz, they should have their own grammar but not their own logic. This is perhaps the most important lesson to draw from these early interwar documents: most bombing campaigns during World War II, and their supporting air intelligence, were designed to get Allied armies to the Reich as quickly as possible, at the lowest possible cost in blood and treasure, and with the greatest possible maneuver and firepower advantages. Indeed, this was the essence of bombing doctrine during the early interwar period and of bombing op
