nology itself—the B-17 and the Norden bombsight—as a panacea that would make bombing a “frictionless” activity sure to succeed. It is therefore not surprising that air intelligence received so little attention at the time. This was the greatest weakness in the American approach to aerial bombardment.2*  British Doctrine Developments  As the Americans wrestled with doctrine, so did the British, producing two important documents, CD 22 and Air Publication (AP) 1300, as well as a host of minor ones, to guide the employment of air assets. Although the documents are somewhat Douhetian and Trenchardian in nature, they demonstrate awareness of several key requirements, including air superiority, proper concentration of bombers, and the equal importance of material destruction and morale effects. Given the concentration of industry and workers in urban areas, cities became key targets. In a prescient passage, Air Ministry Operations Manual 58 foresaw the use of night raids as a means of keeping losses within acceptable limits. British doctrine also emphasized joint warfare, providing details on the ways in which aircraft should support navies and armies. Finally, there were references to “precision” bombing. Consequently, and despite the fact that Trenchardian thinking dominated early interwar doctrine, air staff officers had already planted the seeds of more sophisticated operational employment, all of which would grow and blossom during the course of World War II, albeit somewhat be- latedly and in a contested environment.2®  But Bomber Command operations did not fully approach Tiverton’s vision until 1941, two years into the war, and even then technological and operational limitations forced a move away from precision to area bombing. Despite this recurring divergence between doctrine and operational realities, the emerging RAF air intelligence organization had already largely developed the means to engage in precision attacks by 1941. Indeed, the tension that developed
