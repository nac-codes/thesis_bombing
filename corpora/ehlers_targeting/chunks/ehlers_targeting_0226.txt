f these, but Spaatz is also prominent among them. Of course, none of the most senior army leaders, including Marshall, would seriously entertain this course of action, so the actual employment of heavy bombers from 1943 to 1945 held more closely to early interwar doctrine than to the more ex- treme views developed at the Air Corps Tactical School later in the interwar period.2° This had important implications for the development of air intelligence capabilities after 1935.  Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) Influences  The crucial exception to the idea that bombers and armies were complementary developed at ACTS between 1927 and 1934, when a group of zealous bomber advocates on the faculty argued that “proper selection of vital targets in the industrial/economic/social structure of a modern industrialized nation, and their subsequent destruction by air attack, can lead to fatal weakening of an industrialized nation and victory through air power.”2! The ultimate manifestation of this idea was Air War Plans Division Plan 1, which brought the bomber zealots’ ideas about precision bombing and its potential into the open. Their approach, while appealing to many senior airmen, including Arnold, Spaatz, Eaker, Harris, and (early in the war) Portal, was absolutely unconvincing to the most senior officers leading the Allied war effort from 1941 to 1945, including Marshall, Ismay, Brooke, Eisenhower, Tedder, and (later) Portal. They recognized the significant role airpower could play, in conjunction with ground forces, but they never allowed airpower zealotry to determine the nature and course of bombing. The Combined Chiefs of Staff proved particularly key players here.22  During the development of bombing doctrine at ACTS, the focus turned to specific target sets. The top three included electrical power, transportation, and fuel.22 However, as Peter Faber noted, “Unfortunately—and despite the genuine belief by bomber enthusiasts that the Air Corps had the minimum skills and
