viding details on the ways in which aircraft should support navies and armies. Finally, there were references to “precision” bombing. Consequently, and despite the fact that Trenchardian thinking dominated early interwar doctrine, air staff officers had already planted the seeds of more sophisticated operational employment, all of which would grow and blossom during the course of World War II, albeit somewhat be- latedly and in a contested environment.2®  But Bomber Command operations did not fully approach Tiverton’s vision until 1941, two years into the war, and even then technological and operational limitations forced a move away from precision to area bombing. Despite this recurring divergence between doctrine and operational realities, the emerging RAF air intelligence organization had already largely developed the means to engage in precision attacks by 1941. Indeed, the tension that developed between proponents of precision and area bombing in the operations arena did not extend to the air intelligence organization, which proved able and willing to support both concepts.  From 1923 to 1934, despite these nascent developments, airmen did little to turn doctrine into operational reality. Complacency about the bombing mission, the absence of long-range bombers, and above all a strategic environment without any immediate threats to Great Britain made Trenchard’s ideas—and any others, for that matter—just that: ideas rather than capabilities.22 This was trouble- some because by the time Trenchard retired in 1929, “the gap between theoretical planning and operational capability, which was already wide, was steadily widening.”28 The ensuing overconfidence —and fatalism—about bombing, despite the absence of substantive operational or intelligence capabilities, reached its apogee when Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, in a speech to the House of Com- mons on 10 November 1932, said, “The bomber will always get through.”22  It would be wrong, however, to say that Trencha
