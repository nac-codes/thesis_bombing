umption that aerial photos were essentially “paper targets” on which photointer- preters could count bomb hits and determine their effects.22  Page 48 of 423 13%  From 1923 to 1934, despite these nascent developments, airmen did little to turn doctrine into operational reality. Complacency about the bombing mission, the absence of long-range bombers, and above all a strategic environment without any immediate threats to Great Britain made Trenchard’s ideas—and any others, for that matter—just that: ideas rather than capabilities.22 This was trouble- some because by the time Trenchard retired in 1929, “the gap between theoretical planning and operational capability, which was already wide, was steadily widening.”28 The ensuing overconfidence —and fatalism—about bombing, despite the absence of substantive operational or intelligence capabilities, reached its apogee when Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, in a speech to the House of Com- mons on 10 November 1932, said, “The bomber will always get through.”22  It would be wrong, however, to say that Trenchard preferred city bombing as nothing more than a vehicle for undermining morale. He also believed any air strategy should cause systematic disruption of the enemy’s war economy and said such a strategy must be based on a precise knowledge of war industries to be attacked. And here was the rub. No such air intelligence yet existed, and it was not until 1929 that the Committee of Imperial Defence created the machinery for gathering and evaluating information on the German war economy, and not until 1931 that it established the IIC to do this work. Still, Trenchard’s preference for morale bombing was always clear: one of many memoranda asserted, for instance, that “the morale of an enemy nation” was “the true object of all war.”2°2 The air staff held to its twin tenets of bombing doctrine: that the bomber would always get through and that the success of aerial bombardment would be ensured by the selection of targets located
