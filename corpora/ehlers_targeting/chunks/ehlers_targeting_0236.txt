These involved recognition that artillery fire was not likely to destroy targets with a single barrage, that reattack and photoreconnaissance to assess the effects and progress of attacks were indispensable, and that stereophotographs were vital given their ability to provide visual depth. There was even a three-tiered damage categorization in which photointerpreters noted changes around the object being bombed and reported any key insights derived from this analysis:  (1) A work is completely destroyed when its defensive value is reduced to a line of shell holes that is completely leveled.  (2) A work is badly damaged when it can no longer perform the function for which it was designed and has thus lost nearly all its defensive value.  (3) A work which has received several good hits is in no sense demolished, if it continues to perform substantially its defensive or offensive functions. The object of a photographic study is to make a complete and accurate map of the trenches and obstacles totally demolished, those partially demolished and those remaining intact.2*  These criteria were similar to those employed by Allied organizations, including the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe, Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces, and the Railway Targets Committee (RTC), two decades later in their efforts to describe bomb damage to various targets. For comparative purposes, here are abbreviated versions of the RTC criteria:  (A) Damaged to such an extent that no future strategic attacks required. (B) Severe damage, but some vital installations intact. (C) Attacked, but little or no material damage.22  Page 48 of 423 13%  “AAETLAL FNOLOSTAPNY ANA Frnolvolinlerpretarion AAVANCesS  If doctrinal development was less than impressive, advances in aerial photography—an absolutely vital technology associated with the damage-assessment process—were much more pronounced. The same dynamics as those present in the development of American bombing doctrine in the early inter
