solutely vital technology associated with the damage-assessment process—were much more pronounced. The same dynamics as those present in the development of American bombing doctrine in the early interwar period—creativity and deep intellectual engagement in a time of low budgets and civilian disinterest—were at work. On the surface, developments in this arena bore little resemblance to key elements of the air intelligence organization during World War II. For starters, nearly all emphasis was on mapping and aerial mosaics. The employment of large and slow aircraft for this work, and of cameras optimized for taking pictures of large areas with little detail, was utterly unlike that emer- ging later to collect aerial photos.  Air intelligence analysts also fell on hard times as the organizational components of their business nearly disappeared. However, a core of intelligence staff officers, analysts, and photointerpreters stayed, providing vital continuity and expertise. Several key veterans of the Great War stayed in the air intelligence business. Photographic officers, photointerpreters, and combat intelligence officers continued their work at the squadron, group, and wing levels, and they had the additional advantage of working within a governmental and military structure that continued to place a modest priority on aerial photography and air intelligence. The most impressive of these individuals were George Goddard and his British counterpart, F. C. V. Laws, who played vital roles in developing aerial photography.  American efforts were significant and sustained. Just how serious they were is evident in a 1924 document detailing proper uses of aerial photography. It said, “The aerial camera is the vigilant and searching eye of the command.”22 By extension, airmen clearly recognized aerial photography’s importance as a tool for damage assessment. “When cities in the rear are to be bombed,” the document continued, “a photograph of them aids in picking out the more
