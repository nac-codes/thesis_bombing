arly recognized aerial photography’s importance as a tool for damage assessment. “When cities in the rear are to be bombed,” the document continued, “a photograph of them aids in picking out the more vulnerable points without the loss of time necessitated by searching for them from the air.”22 This statement was accompanied by a brief reference to Training Regulation 440-190, which described procedures for making aerial photographs, and Training Regulation 210-10, which explained in detail how photointerpreters were to annotate photos for the G-2 (director of intelligence) and G-3 (director of operations).24 These ideas rested on the assumption that aerial photos were essentially “paper targets” on which photointer- preters could count bomb hits and determine their effects.2=  Although the work also focused on artillery damage assessment, the principles involved translated directly to bombing assessments. These involved recognition that artillery fire was not likely to destroy targets with a single barrage, that reattack and photoreconnaissance to assess the effects and progress of attacks were indispensable, and that stereophotographs were vital given their ability to provide visual depth. There was even a three-tiered damage categorization in which photointerpreters noted changes around the object being bombed and reported any key insights derived from this analysis:  (1) A work is completely destroyed when its defensive value is reduced to a line of shell holes that is completely leveled.  (2) A work is badly damaged when it can no longer perform the function for which it was designed and has thus lost nearly all its defensive value.  (3) A work which has received several good hits is in no sense demolished, if it continues to perform substantially its defensive or offensive functions. The object of a photographic study is to make a complete and accurate map of the trenches and obstacles totally demolished, those partially demolished and those remaining intact.2®
