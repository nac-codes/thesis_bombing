f excellent quality. In addition, it was possible to deliver finished pictures in ten minutes after exposure since the film could be developed onboard the aircraft, in a miniature darkroom, and the pictures dropped in message tubes.42 More impressive was a statement that once films and lenses reached a point where they allowed for high-altitude coverage and were paired with a high-performance reconnaissance aircraft,  to protect an area or point from aerial photography will require the exclusion of aircraft from areas one hundred to one hundred and fifty miles in width. These points or areas are usually estab- lished in the vicinity of some large civil activity, such as a harbor or large industrial area. The exclusion of aircraft from such civil activities will be impracticable. We say that in the future, very few areas can be fully protected from photographic reconnaissance, and it is to be expected that files of all well organized intelligence divisions of major nations will contain photographs of all important points and areas within all possible theaters of operations and lines of communications thereto.4+  This prescient statement was followed by a list of targets to photograph, including industrial centers containing plants and factories engaged in the manufacture and production of war supplies; key natural racaureac euch ac enal and iran mines and ail fielde: and tranenartatinn facilities including harhare dacke marchaling warde wrarahaicac and the mact vital nainte in land and wrater lines of  Page 51 of 423 14%  (A) Damaged to such an extent that no future strategic attacks required. (B) Severe damage, but some vital installations intact. (C) Attacked, but little or no material damage.22  Despite some differences, the methodologies were similar and the processes for making judgments about target status heavily reliant on photointerpretation. In fact, the document emphasized, â€œThe value of aerial photographs depends directly on the... . training and experien
