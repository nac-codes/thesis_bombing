ew areas can be fully protected from photographic reconnaissance, and it is to be expected that files of all well organized intelligence divisions of major nations will contain photographs of all important points and areas within all possible theaters of operations and lines of communications thereto.4+  This prescient statement was followed by a list of targets to photograph, including industrial centers containing plants and factories engaged in the manufacture and production of war supplies; key natural resources such as coal and iron mines and oil fields; and transportation facilities, including harbors, docks, marshaling yards, warehouses, and the most vital points in land and water lines of communication, such as bridges, tunnels, dams, and canal locks. Detailed knowledge of these targets would allow ground commanders and airmen to determine which of these high-value assets would likely provide the greatest vulnerabilities in a potential enemy’s strategy, resources, and power to resist.4%  The ACTS faculty built on this lesson plan four years later with the addition of vertical and oblique aerial photographs of major American aircraft factories used for instructional purposes to drive home their value in targeting and damage assessment. The most noteworthy thing about these photographs is the process by which the Air Corps obtained them. The ACTS commandant, Lieutenant Colonel John F. Curry, sent a memo, requesting oblique photos of several factories taken from altitudes between 2,000 and 10,000 feet, and vertical shots showing entire factories, to Brigadier General Oscar Westover, chief of the Army Air Corps. Westover succeeded in convincing several chief executive officers to let the Air Corps photograph their factories. Aerial photographs meeting ACTS specifications arrived on Lieutenant Colonel Curry’s desk, along with a memo signed by the general, on 8 August 1932. They included shots of the Martin, Vought, Keystone, Bellanca, Pratt and Whit- ney, and Wri
