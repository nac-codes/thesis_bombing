n facilities, including harbors, docks, marshaling yards, warehouses, and the most vital points in land and water lines of communication, such as bridges, tunnels, dams, and canal locks. Detailed knowledge of these targets would allow ground commanders and airmen to determine which of these high-value assets would likely provide the greatest vulnerabilities in a potential enemy’s strategy, resources, and power to resist.42  The ACTS faculty built on this lesson plan four years later with the addition of vertical and oblique aerial photographs of major American aircraft factories used for instructional purposes to drive home their value in targeting and damage assessment. The most noteworthy thing about these photographs is the process by which the Air Corps obtained them. The ACTS commandant, Lieutenant Colonel John F. Curry, sent a memo, requesting oblique photos of several factories taken from altitudes between 2,000 and 10,000 feet, and vertical shots showing entire factories, to Brigadier General Oscar Westover, chief of the Army Air Corps. Westover succeeded in convincing several chief executive officers to let the Air Corps photograph their factories. Aerial photographs meeting ACTS specifications arrived on Lieutenant Colonel Curry’s desk, along with a memo signed by the general, on 8 August 1932. They included shots of the Martin, Vought, Keystone, Bellanca, Pratt and Whit- ney, and Wright Aeronautical Corporation factories.42  The fact that a clearly offensive conception of bombing, backed by intelligence products, made it into an approved ACTS lesson plan and was taught to several classes beginning in 1928, when all references to offensive air warfare were strictly forbidden in war plans and other high-level planning documents, is striking. It indicates the seriousness with which American airmen took these topics, and the professional risks they took to teach them within the framework of an evolving high-altitude, precision, daylight bombardment doctrine.
