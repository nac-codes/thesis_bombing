otograph their factories. Aerial photographs meeting ACTS specifications arrived on Lieutenant Colonel Curry’s desk, along with a memo signed by the general, on 8 August 1932. They included shots of the Martin, Vought, Keystone, Bellanca, Pratt and Whit- ney, and Wright Aeronautical Corporation factories.42  The fact that a clearly offensive conception of bombing, backed by intelligence products, made it into an approved ACTS lesson plan and was taught to several classes beginning in 1928, when all references to offensive air warfare were strictly forbidden in war plans and other high-level planning documents, is striking. It indicates the seriousness with which American airmen took these topics, and the professional risks they took to teach them within the framework of an evolving high-altitude, precision, daylight bombardment doctrine. Equally interesting was Westover’s willingness to ask the chief executive officers for permission to take these photographs given the prevailing climate in Congress, the White House, and among the American public. Whatever professional risks Curry and Westover ran, they were rewarded with excellent aerial photographs to enhance their course.  According to the lesson plan, after commencement of hostilities, bombers flying “strategical missions” against an enemy’s war economy would require aerial photographs giving detailed target intelligence. Photographs showing the results of attacks on key lines of communication to delay hostile concentration, the destruction of plants and factories engaged in the supply of war materials, the destruction of supply depots, and the attack of areas where enemy ground units were mobilized and concentrated before moving to the front, would be particularly important. The conceptual framework within which American bombing operated during World War II, and within which its air intelligence functions would mature, was clearly well advanced during the early interwar period, not only in doctrine documents an
