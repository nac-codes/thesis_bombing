? It is about as sensible an idea as to send out a bomber with a hat full of hand grenades. The K-10... was never intended for routine war missions.”=2 Wilson’s letter reached a high pitch of exasperation as he lamented, “In this day and age holes can’t be bored here and there in Monocoque fuselages and space can’t be found for large cameras if the original construction has failed to provide it.”=4 Having seen the photographic equipment of the world’s other major air forces, he believed American cameras and film were by far the best. “And yet,” Wilson concluded, “—through some oversight—we are now faced with the possibility of having to scrap some of this superb equipment by adopting airplanes unable to carry it.”=2  Wilson's concerns, and Goddard’s, were well founded. In an inexplicable oversight, America’s senior airmen failed to grasp the importance of highperformance reconnaissance aircraft until confronted with the vital role of the RAF’s Spitfire and Mosquito, and by then, it was too late. Consequently, they used converted P-38 fighters (renamed the F-5). These lacked the combat ceilings of the Spitfire and Mosquito and were therefore vulnerable, resulting in more lost aircraft and pilots.*4 Fortunately, the same was not true of the British effort to develop photoreconnaissance aircraft and cameras. Much of the credit for these, which proved vital to the development of air intelligence during World War II, belonged to F. C. V. Laws.
