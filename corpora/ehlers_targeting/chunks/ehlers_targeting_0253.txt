esigned especially for aerial photographic work but because of the money problems I had known it was out of the question.”“2 Goddard might also have mentioned that it was more than a matter of money. There simply was not any evident interest among senior airmen in developing a dedicated, high-performance reconnaissance aircraft 4%  While Goddard advanced the aerial photography business, Major Donald Wilson, assigned to the air staff and charged with procuring the best available photographic equipment, wrote to his colleagues on the Air Corps Photographic Board about this lack of a dedicated reconnaissance aircraft, complaining the new K-9 camera, which could take 9” x 9” photographs and was fully automatic, was also much larger than older cameras and required a larger aircraft for an acceptable fit permitting vertical and oblique photos. He bristled at an Observation Board recommendation to the chief of Air Corps for development of a high-speed, low-altitude aircraft, saying antiaircraft artillery and fighters would pose a grave threat.42  In addition, he attacked the Air Corps decision to make the K-10, a much smaller hand-operated camera, standard issue in observation squadrons. Wilson quite properly criticized the K-10’s very limited capabilities as adequate only “for emergency or visual observation missions when it is not practicable to carry anything better... but since we must risk life and property over hostile areas, why use inefficient equipment when the best is available? It is about as sensible an idea as to send out a bomber with a hat full of hand grenades. The K-10... was never intended for routine war missions.”=2 Wilson’s letter reached a high pitch of exasperation as he lamented, “In this day and age holes can’t be bored here and there in Monocoque fuselages and space can’t be found for large cameras if the original construction has failed to provide it.”=4 Having seen the photographic equipment of the world’s other major air forces, he believed Ame
