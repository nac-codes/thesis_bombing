tails. Despite the F8’s superior qualities, the Air Ministry bought only a handful, a fact the RAF would regret.22  Similarly, Laws pushed development of the Fz, camera, introduced in 1925, which became the RAF’s primary general-purpose camera during the early years of World War II. However, he was disappointed with its limitation to 5” x 5” photographs—a fact he brought up with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which had developed the camera, but to no avail.*8  Despite his accomplishments, Laws became frustrated with the lack of concern RAF officers showed for aerial photography and with their rejection of the F8. Tired of fighting the system, Laws retired in September 1933 to lead a photographic survey in Western Australia but returned in 1939 as the Air Ministry’s deputy director of photography.*2  In the meantime, British photointelligence suffered from the vagaries brought on by an impoverished government, public disinterest, and inadequate doctrine and force structure. Ironically, an Air Ministry report produced in 1923 said that “timely information about the enemy is the foundation upon which all operations of war are planned.” But the RAF made little effort to develop reconnais- sance aircraft and cameras, despite the same report’s recommendation that a single aircraft capable of flying at very high altitude should play the long-range reconnaissance role.®° As Edward Leaf has noted, “It was only after the Royal Air Force had been tasked to carry out photographic reconnaissance of Italian possessions in the Mediterranean following the latter’s invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 that the Air Ministry recognized that aerial photography in peacetime was one thing and that the system was totally inadequate to cope with the exigencies of war.”© In fact, it took six weeks for Brit- ish policy makers to receive aerial photographs of Italian military installations in those areas.
