r period, despite the RAF’s limited interest in aerial photography. In command of the School of Photography at Farnborough three times between the end of the Great War and 1933, Laws continued pushing the technologies and techniques of aerial photography. One of the most serious problems here was the odd fact that the photointerpretation trade, an army specialty even after the creation of the RAF, stayed in army hands until 1940. Consequently, these specialists, who used photointerpretation to plan and assess ground actions, and who thus lacked the skills needed to work in the air intelligence business, were the only ones available to the RAF. The lack of a training facility for RAF photointerpreters remained a major problem until Laws and several other RAF officers forced changes in 1939-1940.2©  After the end of the Great War, Laws worked in the newly created Directorate of Scientific Research at the Air Ministry, where he worked on several development projects, one of the most important of which was the F8 camera. Introduced in 1919, it provided automatic overlapping of the ground area covered by successive photographs and 7” x 7” prints. These were indispensable prerequisites for “stereo pairs,” which provided three-dimensional depth and thus an ability to discover small details. Despite the F8’s superior qualities, the Air Ministry bought only a handful, a fact the RAF would regret.22  Similarly, Laws pushed development of the F,, camera, introduced in 1925, which became the RAF’s primary general-purpose camera during the early years of World War II. However, he was disappointed with its limitation to 5” x 5” photographs—a fact he brought up with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which had developed the camera, but to no avail.*8  Despite his accomplishments, Laws became frustrated with the lack of concern RAF officers showed for aerial photography and with their rejection of the F8. Tired of fighting the system, Laws retired in September 1933 to lead a photogr
