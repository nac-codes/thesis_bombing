became frustrated with the lack of concern RAF officers showed for aerial photography and with their rejection of the F8. Tired of fighting the system, Laws retired in September 1933 to lead a photographic survey in Western Australia but returned in 1939 as the Air Ministry’s deputy director of photography.*2  In the meantime, British photointelligence suffered from the vagaries brought on by an impoverished government, public disinterest, and inadequate doctrine and force structure. Ironically, an Air Ministry report produced in 1923 said that “timely information about the enemy is the foundation upon which all operations of war are planned.” But the RAF made little effort to develop reconnais- sance aircraft and cameras, despite the same report’s recommendation that a single aircraft capable of flying at very high altitude should play the long-range reconnaissance role.®° As Edward Leaf has noted, “It was only after the Royal Air Force had been tasked to carry out photographic reconnaissance of Italian possessions in the Mediterranean following the latter’s invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 that the Air Ministry recognized that aerial photography in peacetime was one thing and that the system was totally inadequate to cope with the exigencies of war.”* In fact, it took six weeks for Brit- ish policy makers to receive aerial photographs of Italian military installations in those areas.  First Signs of an Intelligence “Interagency” Process  The bitter experience of this failure in the Mediterranean convinced senior officials that they needed a standing intelligence agency to assess German and Italian economic vulnerabilities. This resulted, in December 1923, in the formation of the ATB, which was subordinate to the Committee of Imperial Defense and answered its questions regarding the ways in which other countries’ economic vulnerabilities might be translated into military ones. This organization soon began an increasingly frequent correspondence with another coordinati
