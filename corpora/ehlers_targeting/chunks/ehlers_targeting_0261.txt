In fact, it took six weeks for Brit- ish policy makers to receive aerial photographs of Italian military installations in those areas.  First Signs of an Intelligence “Interagency” Process  The bitter experience of this failure in the Mediterranean convinced senior officials that they needed a standing intelligence agency to assess German and Italian economic vulnerabilities. This resulted, in December 1923, in the formation of the ATB, which was subordinate to the Committee of Imperial Defense and answered its questions regarding the ways in which other countries’ economic vulnerabilities might be translated into military ones. This organization soon began an increasingly frequent correspondence with another coordinating body, the Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries Subcommittee (FCI), also founded by the Committee of Imperial Defence six years later, in 1929, but this time at the specific behest of the secretaries of state for war and air, who sought detailed insights on industrial mobilization in Germany and Italy.
