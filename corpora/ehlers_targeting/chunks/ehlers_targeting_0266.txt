reflected in the fact that they recognized by 1939, as they had not recognized before 1918, the need to strike the right balance between the impracticability of cen- tralization and the dangers and drawbacks of independence and sub-division.  The process by which British intelligence agencies achieved this crucial goal proceeded rapidly after 1933 and was vital to the development of effective air intelligence capabilities.  Bombing Developments  As British intelligence agencies developed during this period, so did American bombing accuracy—an indication of the different focus in each country’s air arm. A technique known as camera obscura, which included a camera mounted vertically in a bomber, a signaling mechanism on the bomber, and ground observers, provided important training for aircrews. When pilots thought they were over the target, their observers or bombardiers signaled the ground. At the same time, an onboard camera took photographs to be compared with ground observer reports and photos taken earlier establishing the true position of aircraft over the target. By comparing photographs, the timing of aircraft signaling, and ground observer reports, airmen could determine drift and range errors. The key was to train the aircrew to recognize such errors and correct for them—and, more importantly, find a bombsight that could assist by performing these functions. The Norden bombsight was the answer to the latter problem, but camera obscura played its role by forcing aircrews to plan their approach to the target, look for visual cues in the form of landmarks and terrain features along the line of flight, and make the best use of existing bombsights, all of which led to improved navigation and bombing accuracy.©*  The British effort to train bomber crews, though less effective, did make some progress. Beyond the question of training to drop bombs, which occurred infrequently at the RAF bombing range at Orfordness, two key studies based on bombing accuracy during t
