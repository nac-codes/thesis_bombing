g, and ground observer reports, airmen could determine drift and range errors. The key was to train the aircrew to recognize such errors and correct for them—and, more importantly, find a bombsight that could assist by performing these functions. The Norden bombsight was the answer to the latter problem, but camera obscura played its role by forcing aircrews to plan their approach to the target, look for visual cues in the form of landmarks and terrain features along the line of flight, and make the best use of existing bombsights, all of which led to improved navigation and bombing accuracy.  The British effort to train bomber crews, though less effective, did make some progress. Beyond the question of training to drop bombs, which occurred infrequently at the RAF bombing range at Orfordness, two key studies based on bombing accuracy during training flights should have gotten the Air Ministry’s attention. The first, from 1924, said high-altitude bombing would be impossible on most days over the skies of Europe, while on others it could be carried through effectively by waiting for clouds to clear directly over the target. Similarly, the second study, completed in 1927, said high-altitude bombing under ideal conditions would score hits with no more than 10 percent of bombs dropped on targets less than 200 yards in diameter, with “very much worse results” in poor visibility. It also concluded that high-altitude bombing of rail centers (very large targets) was “practically useless” given these problems.© These studies fell on deaf ears. The British would have to learn about the difficulties of high-altitude precision daylight bombing, and for that matter night area and precision bombing, quite literally on the fly.  This lack of attention to bombing began to change once the Nazis came to power, and it is to the period after January 1933 that we must now turn to see how this influenced the development of air intelligence-related technologies, techniques, technicians, a
