ruit fairly late. The bombsight in service with the RAF since 1918 was not replaced by an improved version until 1941, the same year in which large numbers of the first heavy bomber, the Short Stirling Mark I, be- came operational.2  As the Nazi threat became clear in 1936-1937, the tempo of RAF rearmament increased. In December 1937, the Air Ministry published a document ordering Bomber Command to begin detailed planning for a bombing campaign.1° Consequently, the question of bombing finally received serious attention at the Bombing Committee’s fourteenth meeting on 5 April 1937, during which represen- tatives discussed problems associated with night bombing, including the idea that target-marking flares dropped by lead aircraft could allow the entire formation to bomb an area target with relatively good accuracy.4  Perhans the only filly successfiil Ramhings Cammittee effort discussed at the nineteenth meeting an 4 Octoher 1938 had to do with the reanirement for a Ramher Develanment TInit (RNTI) to  Page 59 of 423 16%  britisn and American airmen, taking their cue from political leaders, accelerated efforts to develop effective bombing Capabilities. 1 Nis was less allficult for the Americans given the firm doctrinal foundations laid during the early interwar period and the two superb technologies—the B-17 heavy bomber and Norden bombsight—emerging at this point. The war nonetheless caught both the Brit- ish and the Americans unprepared to engage in bombing operations.  In response to the growing German threat, British air rearmament began in earnest in 1934, but even then, twenty-two of the forty-one bomber squadrons called for in the expansion were to be composed of light bombers incapable of reaching German targets.+ Part of the rearmament effort was an Air Ministry decision in January 1934 to establish the Bombing and Air Fighting committees. The former’s purpose was to “achieve a better measure of coordination between the development of bombing methods and tac
