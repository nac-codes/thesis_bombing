decision in January 1934 to establish the Bombing and Air Fighting committees. The former’s purpose was to “achieve a better measure of coordination between the development of bombing methods and tactics, and the development of equipment required for their efficient application.”2 The presence of a representative from Air Ministry R.D.Arm.4 (Analysis of Bombing Results) was noteworthy. So, too, was the absence of an air intelligence officer until the committee’s eighteenth meeting on 26 July 1938.3 This oversight ensured that few discussions relating to air intelligence occurred before then. Nonetheless, committee decisions had implications for the develop- ment of damage-assessment capabilities.  At the second meeting on 30 May 1934, representatives agreed on a need for an automatic bombsight and formed a bomb subcommittee to develop proper ordnance for a future war. They reached agreement on the need for six bomb types: 18-pound antipersonnel, 30-pound and 50-pound generalpurpose, 250-pound and 500-pound high-explosive and incendiary, and 2,000-pound antiship bombs.  Despite the utility of large bombs in the Great War, the Air Ministry continued to dismiss their importance. Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham recommended the 250-pound bomb be standard RAF ordnance and all smaller munitions be discarded, and he pushed for development of bombs up to 2,000 pounds and aircraft with bomb racks capable of carrying them, but Air Ministry officers demurred.‘ Instead, they asserted, “the result of air action is, to some extent, dependent upon the number of bombs dropped rather than on their size. Furthermore, the chances of hitting a given target are greatly increased by dropping four distributed bombs instead of two. ... It is thought that the majority of factories, for instance, would be affected to a greater extent by four 120-lb. bombs than by two 250-Ib. bombs.”* The Air Ministry also dismissed recommendations for 1,000-pound and 1,500-pound bombs, saying they
