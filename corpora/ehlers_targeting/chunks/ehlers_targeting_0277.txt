significant expansion scheme because it marked the beginning of Britain’s preparations to create a credible bomber force. This included plans for the Stirling, Halifax, and Manchester, which were drawn up in 1936-1937. The Manchester, although an operational failure with its under- powered engines, was later modified with four Merlins and transformed into the highly effective Lancaster.2  In fact, the “J Scheme” of October 1937 made heavy bombers a top RAF priority for the first time. However, as late as the seventeenth meeting of the Bombing Committee on 4 May 1938, discussions about the ideal bomber were still clouded by uncertainty about the aircraft’s capabilities and proper employment. Consequently, these vital initiatives—bombsight and bomber—bore fruit fairly late. The bombsight in service with the RAF since 1918 was not replaced by an improved version until 1941, the same year in which large numbers of the first heavy bomber, the Short Stirling Mark I, be- came operational.2  As the Nazi threat became clear in 1936-1937, the tempo of RAF rearmament increased. In December 1937, the Air Ministry published a document ordering Bomber Command to begin detailed planning for a bombing campaign.12 Consequently, the question of bombing finally received serious attention at the Bombing Committee’s fourteenth meeting on 5 April 1937, during which represen- tatives discussed problems associated with night bombing, including the idea that target-marking flares dropped by lead aircraft could allow the entire formation to bomb an area target with relatively good accuracy.+4  Perhaps the only fully successful Bombing Committee effort, discussed at the nineteenth meeting on 4 October 1938, had to do with the requirement for a Bomber Development Unit (BDU) to centralize technical and training initiatives. These had become increasingly disjointed over the previous two decades, with bomb squadrons, training schools, and other facilities engaged in isolated local initiatives. T
