l and training initiatives. These had become increasingly disjointed over the previous two decades, with bomb squadrons, training schools, and other facilities engaged in isolated local initiatives. The BDU became a center for doctrine development. It was also under Bomber Command operational control and had a dedicated bombing range for determination of optimum bomb- ing techniques. Night bombing and formation flying also received emphasis. Operational tests of new equipment and ordnance figured prominently. Even more important from an air intelligence perspective was the decision to place an intelligence officer on the staff to work with bomber crews on target identification and damage assessment during and after practice bombing raids. The BDU proved pivotal in the British bombing and air intelligence efforts.12  Air Intelligence and RAF Rearmament  Equally significant was the formation of a transportation targets subcommittee to discuss delaying and disorganizing German mobilization, concentration, and advance by bombing railroad viaducts, marshaling yards, embankments, and tracks in open country. This small body of ad hoc targeteers, including technical advisors such as War Office transportation officers and the superintendent  Page 62 of 423 16%  In fact, the “J Scheme” of October 1937 made heavy bombers a top RAF priority for the first time. However, as late as the seventeenth meeting of the Bombing Committee on 4 May 1938, discussions about the ideal bomber were still clouded by uncertainty about the aircraft’s capabilities and proper employment. Consequently, these vital initiatives—bombsight and bomber—bore fruit fairly late. The bombsight in service with the RAF since 1918 was not replaced by an improved version until 1941, the same year in which large numbers of the first heavy bomber, the Short Stirling Mark I, be- came operational.2  As the Nazi threat became clear in 1936-1937, the tempo of RAF rearmament increased. In December 1937, the Air Ministry
