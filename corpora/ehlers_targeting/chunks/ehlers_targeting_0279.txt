s of the first heavy bomber, the Short Stirling Mark I, be- came operational.2  As the Nazi threat became clear in 1936-1937, the tempo of RAF rearmament increased. In December 1937, the Air Ministry published a document ordering Bomber Command to begin detailed planning for a bombing campaign.1° Consequently, the question of bombing finally received serious attention at the Bombing Committee’s fourteenth meeting on 5 April 1937, during which represen- tatives discussed problems associated with night bombing, including the idea that target-marking flares dropped by lead aircraft could allow the entire formation to bomb an area target with relatively good accuracy.4  Perhaps the only fully successful Bombing Committee effort, discussed at the nineteenth meeting on 4 October 1938, had to do with the requirement for a Bomber Development Unit (BDU) to centralize technical and training initiatives. These had become increasingly disjointed over the previous two decades, with bomb squadrons, training schools, and other facilities engaged in isolated local initiatives. The BDU became a center for doctrine development. It was.also under Bomber Command operational control and had a dedicated bombing range for determination of optimum bomb- ing techniques. Night bombing and formation flying also received emphasis. Operational tests of new equipment and ordnance figured prominently. Even more important from an air intelligence perspective was the decision to place an intelligence officer on the staff to work with bomber crews on target identification and damage assessment during and after practice bombing raids. The BDU proved pivotal in the British bombing and air intelligence efforts.14  Air Intelligence and RAF Rearmament  Equally significant was the formation of a transportation targets subcommittee to discuss delaying and disorganizing German mobilization, concentration, and advance by bombing railroad viaducts, marshaling yards, embankments, and tracks in open country.
