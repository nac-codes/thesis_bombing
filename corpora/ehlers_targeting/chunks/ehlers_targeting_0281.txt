ring the Second World War. They decided to train 25 percent of Bomber Command’s crews to high standards for attacks on precise targets, while other crews received training adequate for area bombing. Unfortunately, they decided to train elite crews to bomb precise targets from low altitudes on the basis of the flawed assumption that the crews could underfly most antiaircraft artillery and fighter aircraft. Ironically, a month later, the RAF’s deputy director of operations proposed the opposite course: “Ideal bombing tactics,” he said, “are to bomb from the highest possible height in order to keep out of range of anti-aircraft defences.”14 He then proposed bombing tests from 25,000 and 40,000 feet. Bureaucratic inertia and the lack of a bomber capable of flying at those altitudes doomed this initiative to failure.  Despite the Bombing Committee's efforts, development of larger bombs, better navigation equipment, installation of cameras on bombers for strike photos, and other intelligence-related capabilities received relatively little emphasis until 1939. Nor did crews receive training to navigate to and hit targets at night or in poor weather conditions, a stunning oversight considering Bomber Command’s raison d’étre. In short, there was.a lack of imagination and judgment about what a heavy-bomber campaign would entail. The result was a disastrous series of daylight bombing raids in 1939-1940, a period of urgency in 1940-1941 during which Bomber Command developed new capabilities and tactics, and ultimately a move toward night city bombing as the only survivable and potentially effect- ive means of taking the war directly to the Reich.15  However, it is important to note that air intelligence developments during the late interwar period, which accelerated dramatically during World War II, were from the outset focused on building “precision” bombing capabilities and assessing effects and effectiveness. Too often, we forget the British intended all along to engage in p
