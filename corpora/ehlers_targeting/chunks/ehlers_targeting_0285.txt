these new skills facilitated day and night precision strikes. This became abundantly clear during the 1944-1945 transportation and oil offensives. Viewed in this light, the RAF’s development of bombing and intelligence capabilities, while outwardly chaotic in the press of wartime events, in fact had internal cohesion and fol- lowed a planned and relatively straightforward pattern.1®  Air Intelligence and the Evolving Interagency Process  The previous chapter touched briefly on three economic intelligence organizations—the Advisory Committee on Trade Questions in Time of War, Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries Subcom- mittee (FCI), and Industrial Intelligence Centre (IIC)—charged with gathering data on German industries. During the late interwar period, they matured and were joined by several air and military intelligence organizations charged with air intelligence functions. The increasingly close working relationships between these intelligence providers resulted, by summer 1939, in the first clear indi- cations that a new, much larger, interagency air intelligence organization was emerging.  This process got into high gear on New Year’s Day 1936, when the deputy chiefs of staff (DCOS), who had been appointed by the chiefs of staff (COS) in 1932 to ensure adequate preparations for war in the event of a conflict with Germany, issued a report favoring the creation of a centralized intelligence structure to facilitate coordination of intelligence between various military and civilian intelligence organizations. The report said the intelligence business had become immensely complex under the strains imposed by modern warfare. The problem was even more complex because air forces could now extend battle zones by hundreds of miles and perhaps to the heart of an adversary’s country, including its civilian population and war industries. All of this pointed to the need for closer cooperation between economic and air intelligence agencies.12  The FCI, composed of re
