end of the road for the subcom- mittee, which was subsumed by the Bombing Committee. Fortunately, its functions—picking and prioritizing targets—continued in coordination with the Air Ministry Air Targets Section.13  Ina related development, the air staff worked on bombing doctrine, a function it later performed in coordination with the BDU, and determined two types of targets presented themselves for attack: precise targets and target groups. Attacking the former required highly skilled crews capable of precision bombardment, while the latter could be struck en masse with area attacks. The air staff hit upon an interesting solution to this problem that would have significant ramifications for bombing operations during the Second World War. They decided to train 25 percent of Bomber Command's crews to high standards for attacks on precise targets, while other crews received training adequate for area bombing. Unfortunately, they decided to train elite crews to bomb precise targets from low altitudes on the basis of the flawed assumption that the crews could underfly most antiaircraft artillery and fighter aircraft. Ironically, a month later, the RAF’s deputy director of operations proposed the opposite course: “Ideal bombing tactics,” he said, “are to bomb from the highest possible height in order to keep out of range of anti-aircraft defences.”14 He then proposed bombing tests from 25,000 and 40,000 feet. Bureaucratic inertia and the lack of a bomber capable of flying at those altitudes doomed this initiative to failure.  Despite the Bombing Committee’s efforts, development of larger bombs, better navigation equipment, installation of cameras on bombers for strike photos, and other intelligence-related capabilities received relatively little emphasis until 1939. Nor did crews receive training to navigate to and hit targets at night or in poor weather conditions, a stunning oversight considering Bomber Command’s raison d’étre. In short, there was a lack of imaginat
