port the FCI, the IIC, established in 1931, provided industrial intelligence assessments. By 1934, the FCI had become the focal point for the collection and interpretation of air intelligence. This organization developed a close working relation- ship with the Air Ministry’s director of intelligence.18  In their New Year’s Day paper, the DCOS said an organization should be established to “obtain the maximum effect on an enemy nation, by means of air attack against those objectives the destruction or dislocation of which the government considers would contribute towards the attainment of the national aim.”!2 Accordingly, the COS told the FCI to develop target intelligence to support this larger effort. The Committee of Imperial Defence approved these recommendations on 30 January 1936 and increased funding for service intelligence directorates. The “national aim” referred to here was not specified, but given recent British experience in the Great War, it was clearly related to the question of bringing enemies to the negotiating table by means of concerted attacks on the economic foundations of their national power rather than by grappling with their armies. In short, airpower was viewed during the late interwar period, at least by some, as a complement to naval blockade, a substitute for committing another army to the Continent, and a weapon to hinder a German advance into the Low Countries.
