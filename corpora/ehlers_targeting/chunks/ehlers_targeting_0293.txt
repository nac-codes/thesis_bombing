nal plans for the COS. The Ministry of Economic Warfare (MEW), which during World War II would become the focal point for collection, analysis, and dissemination of all economic intelligence, including damage reports assessing bombing effects and effectiveness, had not quite arrived, but this flurry of activity in 1936 heralded its emergence.22  The Air Ministry opposed the deputy chiefs’ idea to establish several targeting subcommittees under the FCI, instead recommending that a single subcommittee be established to study key targets in and vulnerabilities of the German oil industry—an obvious choice given Germany’s well-known weakness in this arena. The Air Ministry followed with a second memo suggesting the FCI act only as an initial point for selection of the most promising targets and, through a subcommittee, assign target priorities. Further, the Air Ministry suggested this FCI Air Targets Subcommittee should give the Air Ministry all available intelligence on German and Italian target sets it thought most important and vulnerable to air attack. Existing IIC reports appeared the logical starting point for this process but provided few details. The memo closed with a warning: “Much more detailed information is required before any decision by the defence services could be taken regarding the right targets to attack in any given set of circumstances... . It is this detailed information which is so vital and without which it will be impossible for right decisions to be taken.”24  The Air Ministry’s guidance was crucial for the development of an air intelligence organization because it resulted in detailed target materials for individual targets within key target sets. This focus on target intelligence had its basis in RAF officers’ expectations to wage a daylight precision bombing campaign against Germany. When the war began, RAF planners recognized that they had forgotten to address the other, equally important, half of the problem, namely, effective damage asses
