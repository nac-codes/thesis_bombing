ision bombing campaign against Germany. When the war began, RAF planners recognized that they had forgotten to address the other, equally important, half of the problem, namely, effective damage assessments. This belated awareness gave photoreconnaissance and photographic interpretation a huge boost in the war’s opening months.  The DCOS, COS, and FCI responded favorably to these Air Ministry concerns with the formation on 26 June 1936 of an FCI Air Targets Subcommittee (FCIAT) to determine how and where to find target intelligence required to build target folders. The FCIAT supervised the exchange of information and reports between the services and other departments concerned with target intelligence. This meant engaging with all sources for target materials, including the IIC, government departments, businessmen and industrial concerns, industrial research departments, specialists with detailed information on the German economy, British and foreign trade journals, the Special Intelligence Service (SIS, or MI6), and the Bank of England, which had loaned money to German industrialists for construction of new factories and held copies of the blueprints. This concerted effort to collect targeting information from all sources marked the point at which air and economic intelligence began a close and fruitful interaction.22  Inevitably, a dispute arose between the Air Ministry, which had a de facto leading role in the FCIAT and pushed its own target-selection agenda, and the DCOS, who believed that too much Air Ministry influence was not good. The head of the IIC suggested that while the Air Ministry should have authority to determine numbers of aircraft, weight of bombs, and other technical matters, only the Subcommittee on Economic Pressure (MEW’s predecessor) should have authority to determine bombing effects. This was, unbelievably, the first direct reference anyone concerned with target selec- tion had yet made to damage assessment.22  In an effort to mollify both s
