to the Continent, and a weapon to hinder a German advance into the Low Countries.  Beyond simply recommending the FCI be charged with developing target intelligence, the DCOS also enlarged the functions and manpower of their Joint Intelligence Subcommittee (JIC), which provided the COS, members of Parliament, and the prime minister with actionable military intelligence. They further directed the JIC, made up of the army, navy, and air force chiefs of intelligence, to work with the Joint Planning Subcommittee, which prepared interservice operational plans for the COS. The Ministry of Economic Warfare (MEW), which during World War II would become the focal point for collection, analysis, and dissemination of all economic intelligence, including damage reports assessing bombing effects and effectiveness, had not quite arrived, but this flurry of activity in 1936 heralded its emergence.22  The Air Ministry opposed the deputy chiefs’ idea to establish several targeting subcommittees under the FCI, instead recommending that a single subcommittee be established to study key targets in and vulnerabilities of the German oil industry—an obvious choice given Germany’s well-known weakness in this arena. The Air Ministry followed with a second memo suggesting the FCI act only as an initial point for selection of the most promising targets and, through a subcommittee, assign target priorities. Further, the Air Ministry suggested this FCI Air Targets Subcommittee should give the Air Ministry all available intelligence on German and Italian target sets it thought most important and vulnerable to air attack. Existing IIC reports appeared the logical starting point for this process but provided few details. The memo closed with a warning: “Much more detailed information is required before any decision by the defence services could be taken regarding the right targets to attack in any given set of circumstances... . It is this detailed information which is so vital and without which i
