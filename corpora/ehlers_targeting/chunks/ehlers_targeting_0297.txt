e any decision by the defence services could be taken regarding the right targets to attack in any given set of circumstances... . It is this detailed information which is so vital and without which it will be impossible for right decisions to be taken.”24  The Air Ministry’s guidance was crucial for the development of an air intelligence organization because it resulted in detailed target materials for individual targets within key target sets. This focus on target intelligence had its basis in RAF officers’ expectations to wage a daylight precision bombing campaign against Germany. When the war began, RAF planners recognized that they had forgotten to address the other, equally important, half of the problem, namely, effective damage assessments. This belated awareness gave photoreconnaissance and photographic interpretation a huge boost in the war’s opening months.  The DCOS, COS, and FCI responded favorably to these Air Ministry concerns with the formation on 26 June 1936 of an FCI Air Targets Subcommittee (FCIAT) to determine how and where to find target intelligence required to build target folders. The FCIAT supervised the exchange of information and reports between the services and other departments concerned with target intelligence. This meant engaging with all sources for target materials, including the IIC, government departments, businessmen and industrial concerns, industrial research departments, specialists with detailed information on the German economy, British and foreign trade journals, the Special Intelligence Service (SIS, or MI6), and the Bank of England, which had loaned money to German industrialists for construction of new factories and held copies of the blueprints. This concerted effort to collect targeting information from all sources marked the point at which air and economic intelligence began a close and fruitful interaction.24  Inevitably, a dispute arose between the Air Ministry, which had a de facto leading role in the FCIAT and pu
