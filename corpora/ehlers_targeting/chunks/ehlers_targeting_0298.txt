the point at which air and economic intelligence began a close and fruitful interaction.24  Inevitably, a dispute arose between the Air Ministry, which had a de facto leading role in the FCIAT and pushed its own target-selection agenda, and the DCOS, who believed that too much Air Ministry influence was not good. The head of the IIC suggested that while the Air Ministry should have authority to determine numbers of aircraft, weight of bombs, and other technical matters, only the Subcommittee on Economic Pressure (MEWâ€™s predecessor) should have authority to determine bombing effects. This was, unbelievably, the first direct reference anyone concerned with target selec- tion had yet made to damage assessment.22  In an effort to mollify both sides, the FCIAT proposed their reports contain only information on target sets and individual targets, which the Air Ministry would review to determine how practical the recommendations were and what their effects on German industry were likely to be. From there, the report would go to the Joint Planning Subcommittee, which would put it in final form and incorporate it into larger operations plans. Once again, the Air Ministry demurred, countering with a suggestion that the Subcommittee on Economic Pressure choose vital target systems to be attacked, with an Air Ministry official choosing the actual targets in conjunction with the IIC and the other service departments. This effectively placed the FCIAT outside the decision loop and made it irrelevant. In July 1939, as the result of an exchange of memos between FCIAT and the Air Ministry, the former was disbanded and the Air Ministry Directorate of Intelligence assumed responsibility for drawing up all industrial intelligence reports and target materials in conjunction with the IIC. For reasons not clear, the COS acquiesced and watched the FCIAT, their creation, disappear from the evolving air intelligence scene.24  The Air Ministry, having won this bureaucratic turf war, quickly
