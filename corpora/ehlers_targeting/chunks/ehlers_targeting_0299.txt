The head of the Air Targets Section, which had replaced the FCIAT, complained to the deputy director of intelligence that the treasury provided too few funds, and the Air Ministry too few trained air intelligence specialists, to deal with the job requirements, especially the careful target study it demanded. It was, he said, “a scientific investigation and study in every sense of the word and the basis of war planning.”2* If the FCIAT had proven unable to deal effectively as an interface between military and economic intelligence agencies, the Air Ministry’s struggle to cope with the task made it clear that an effective economic intelligence organization designed specifically to engage with the service departments, providing them economic intelligence for the preparation of target materials and assessments of the economic effects of bombing, was still very much needed. MEW would play this role during the war, somewhat tentatively at first, and despite a good bit of friction with service intelligence directorates, but ultimately in a highly effective fashion.
