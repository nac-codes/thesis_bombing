Air Ministry proved able to do the things it volunteered to do, including the provision of target materials and detailed damage reports. It provided target materials directly to Bomber Command and later to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), while detailed damage assessments came from one of the Air Ministry’s most important subordinate organizations, the  Page 65 of 423 17%  AAIT MINISCLY all avaliable intelligence Of) Gerinan and italian target sets it tnougint most linportant and vuinerable Co alr attack.

This focus on target intelligence had its basis in RAF officers’ expectations to wage a daylight precision bombing campaign against Germany. When the war began, RAF planners recognized that they had forgotten to address the other, equally important, half of the problem, namely, effective damage assessments. This belated awareness gave photoreconnaissance and photographic interpretation a huge boost in the war’s opening months.  The DCOS, COS, and FCI responded favorably to these Air Ministry concerns with the formation on 26 June 1936 of an FCI Air Targets Subcommittee (FCIAT) to determine how and where to find target intelligence required to build target folders. The FCIAT supervised the exchange of information and reports between the services and other departments concerned with target intelligence. This meant engaging with all source
