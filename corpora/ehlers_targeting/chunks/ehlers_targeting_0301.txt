to build target folders. The FCIAT supervised the exchange of information and reports between the services and other departments concerned with target intelligence. This meant engaging with all sources for target materials, including the IIC, government departments, businessmen and industrial concerns, industrial research departments, specialists with detailed information on the German economy, British and foreign trade journals, the Special Intelligence Service (SIS, or MI6), and the Bank of England, which had loaned money to German industrialists for construction of new factories and held copies of the blueprints. This concerted effort to collect targeting information from all sources marked the point at which air and economic intelligence began a close and fruitful interaction.22  Inevitably, a dispute arose between the Air Ministry, which had a de facto leading role in the FCIAT and pushed its own target-selection agenda, and the DCOS, who believed that too much Air Ministry influence was not good. The head of the IIC suggested that while the Air Ministry should have authority to determine numbers of aircraft, weight of bombs, and other technical matters, only the Subcommittee on Economic Pressure (MEWâ€™s predecessor) should have authority to determine bombing effects. This was, unbelievably, the first direct reference anyone concerned with target selec- tion had yet made to damage assessment.22  In an effort to mollify both sides, the FCIAT proposed their reports contain only information on target sets and individual targets, which the Air Ministry would review to determine how practical the recommendations were and what their effects on German industry were likely to be. From there, the report would go to the Joint Planning Subcommittee, which would put it in final form and incorporate it into larger operations plans. Once again, the Air Ministry demurred, countering with a suggestion that the Subcommittee on Economic Pressure choose vital target systems to be
