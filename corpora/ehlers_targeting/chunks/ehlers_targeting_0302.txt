form and incorporate it into larger operations plans. Once again, the Air Ministry demurred, countering with a suggestion that the Subcommittee on Economic Pressure choose vital target systems to be attacked, with an Air Ministry official choosing the actual targets in conjunction with the IIC and the other service departments. This effectively placed the FCIAT outside the decision loop and made it irrelevant. In July 1939, as the result of an exchange of memos between FCIAT and the Air Ministry, the former was disbanded and the Air Ministry Directorate of Intelligence assumed responsibility for drawing up all industrial intelligence reports and target materials in conjunction with the IIC. For reasons not clear, the COS acquiesced and watched the FCIAT, their creation, disappear from the evolving air intelligence scene.24  The Air Ministry, having won this bureaucratic turf war, quickly found itself short of manpower, money, and experience to take on the task. The head of the Air Targets Section, which had replaced the FCIAT, complained to the deputy director of intelligence that the treasury provided too few funds, and the Air Ministry too few trained air intelligence specialists, to deal with the job requirements, especially the careful target study it demanded. It was, he said, “a scientific investigation and study in every sense of the word and the basis of war planning.”2* If the FCIAT had proven unable to deal effectively as an interface between military and economic intelligence agencies, the Air Ministry’s struggle to cope with the task made it clear that an effective economic intelligence organization designed specifically to engage with the service departments, providing them economic intelligence for the preparation of target materials and assessments of the economic effects of bombing, was still very much needed. MEW would play this role during the war, somewhat tentatively at first, and despite a good bit of friction with service intelligence director
