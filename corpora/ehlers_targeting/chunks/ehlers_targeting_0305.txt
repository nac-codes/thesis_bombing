phasize that they felt capable of developing detailed target materials based on guidance from MEW as to the most effective target sets to attack, and upon the provision by MEW of detailed economic intelligence. They also said Air Ministry specialists could probably assess the physical effects of individual bombing raids but not their ag- gregate effects on Germany’s war economy.  As it turned out, the Air Ministry proved able to do the things it volunteered to do, including the provision of target materials and detailed damage reports. It provided target materials directly to Bomber Command and later to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), while detailed damage assessments came from one of the Air Ministry’s most important subordinate organizations, the Central Interpretation Unit (CIU). The CIU, established in early 1940, ultimately employed hundreds of photointerpreters who turned out superb damage reports and a wide array of other products, in- cluding target materials, in conjunction with the Air Ministry.  Although the IIC, the first economic intelligence organization to collect information on the German economy, had by all accounts been working well since its formation in 1931, the rapid growth of the intelligence community, and the huge increases in materials required, drove an expansion of its duties. By summer 1937, the Committee on Imperial Defence recognized the need for an expanded body to make assessments on the basis of economic intelligence provided by the IIC. On 2 July 1937, it formed the Subcommittee on Economic Pressure, the forerunner of MEW, “to consider the problem of exerting economic pressure on Germany in the event of war with that country in 1939 and to draw up definite plans.” By 30 June 1938, this subcommittee was drafting plans for economic warfare against Germany. Its small staff surveyed the scope of economic intelligence still required and realized a larger and permanent body, with its director a member of the cabinet, would be
