all accounts been working well since its formation in 1931, the rapid growth of the intelligence community, and the huge increases in materials required, drove an expansion of its duties. By summer 1937, the Committee on Imperial Defence recognized the need for an expanded body to make assessments on the basis of economic intelligence provided by the IIC. On 2 July 1937, it formed the Subcommittee on Economic Pressure, the forerunner of MEW, “to consider the problem of exerting economic pressure on Germany in the event of war with that country in 1939 and to draw up definite plans.” By 30 June 1938, this subcommittee was drafting plans for economic warfare against Germany. Its small staff surveyed the scope of economic intelligence still required and realized a larger and permanent body, with its director a member of the cabinet, would be required to provide economic intelligence to service ministries for war planning. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed, resulting in the formation of MEW, initially composed of 78 analysts, in September 1939.26  The practical effects of these decisions from an air intelligence perspective were a requirement for the Air Ministry to collect most of its air targets intelligence solo, with only occasional support from MEW once it became active in September 1939, and a consequent delay in collecting the economic intelligence Bomber Command required for campaign and mission planning. Official historian F. H. Hinsley said, “In the field of economic intelligence inter-departmental cooperation declined, rather than improved, on the outbreak of war.”22 It took another six months before the COS, MEW, the Air Ministry, and Bomber Command recognized that bombing had to have a more prominent place in grand strategy and that closer cooperation and additional manpower were needed to make this happen.
