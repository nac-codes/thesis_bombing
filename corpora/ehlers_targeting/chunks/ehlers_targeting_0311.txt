so problematic was the Air Ministry’s failure to consult bomb damage assessment and munitions effectiveness assessment records from the Great War and subsequent bombing surveys. In September 1938, Air Chief Marshal Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt, commander in chief of Bomber Command, stated that without exhaustive bombing trials, “we cannot hope to devise our bombing tactics on sound and practical lines unless we have the facilities to explore every branch of the subject [in other words, munitions effectiveness assessment] by means of practical trials.”2° His plea went largely unheeded, and the bombing trials remained largely unfunded.  The final category of information the Air Ministry sought on potential effects and effectiveness came from studying German industrial target sets and selecting the most promising for targeting purposes. This was intended to build on the Air Ministry’s 1 October 1937 document containing thirteen western air plans, including three for Bomber Command: WA 1 (attacks on German Air Striking Force, its maintenance, and the aircraft industry); WA 2 (attacks on German rail, canal, and road communications during concentration of German armies in the west and to delay their invasion of France and the Low Countries); and WA 5 (attacks on German manufacturing centers inside and outside of the Ruhr and on inland waterways).21 These were developed in response to a May 1937 Com- mittee of Imperial Defence directive.  On 24 July 1939, the Air Ministry Directorate of Intelligence put forth a study, based on available intelligence, approaching the problem from three directions. The first was an attack on vital industries, including chemicals and explosives, synthetic oil plants, metallurgical industries, and foodstuffs.“ Intelligence specialists believed attacks on these target sets would inflict maximum economic, military, and morale effects. This was a problem given that even targets closest to Great Britain, including those in the Ruhr, lay at the extreme
