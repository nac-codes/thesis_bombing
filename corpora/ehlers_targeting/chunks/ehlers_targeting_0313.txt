of 423 18%  assessment] by means of practical trials.”2° His plea went largely unheeded, and the bombing trials remained largely unfunded.  The final category of information the Air Ministry sought on potential effects and effectiveness came from studying German industrial target sets and selecting the most promising for targeting purposes. This was intended to build on the Air Ministry’s 1 October 1937 document containing thirteen western air plans, including three for Bomber Command: WA 1 (attacks on German Air Striking Force, its maintenance, and the aircraft industry); WA 2 (attacks on German rail, canal, and road communications during concentration of German armies in the west and to delay their invasion of France and the Low Countries); and WA 5 (attacks on German manufacturing centers inside and outside of the Ruhr and on inland waterways).21 These were developed in response to a May 1937 Com- mittee of Imperial Defence directive.  On 24 July 1939, the Air Ministry Directorate of Intelligence put forth a study, based on available intelligence, approaching the problem from three directions. The first was an attack on vital industries, including chemicals and explosives, synthetic oil plants, metallurgical industries, and foodstufts.22 Intelligence specialists believed attacks on these target sets would inflict maximum economic, military, and morale effects. This was a problem given that even targets closest to Great Britain, including those in the Ruhr, lay at the extreme limits of medium bomber range and beyond fighter escort range.22  The second approach focused exclusively on fuel and power as the two motive forces behind the German war economy and military. Intelligence personnel agreed Germany’s greatest weakness was its tenuous oil situation. The study focused first on liquid fuels (aviation fuel and gasoline), then on solid fuels (coal), and finally on coal-fired and hydroelectric power plants. In the latter case, it included major dams facilitating hig
