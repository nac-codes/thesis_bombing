ed first on liquid fuels (aviation fuel and gasoline), then on solid fuels (coal), and finally on coal-fired and hydroelectric power plants. In the latter case, it included major dams facilitating high use of hydroelectric power. The study then made the case for simultaneous attacks on electric power plants and the transportation infrastructure required for coal deliveries, including marshaling yards, rail bridges, and inland waterways.34  The third option was to attack one area—the Ruhr—intensively to inflict enough economic pain to bring German leaders to their senses or to force the Luftwaffe to defend its own territory rather than attempting a knockout blow against London. Ludlow-Hewitt favored this plan with an emphasis on electric power.2* The Air Ministry thus planned daylight precision attacks to destroy key in- dustries, with constant night attacks to lower morale and productivity.  There was, however, one crucial shortcoming. In summer 1939, when these plans appeared, the British had a few hundred two-engine bombers, and little of their air intelligence organization was in place. Nonetheless, the plan, viewed in combination with the other two options—attacks on key industrial target sets, and attacks on vital energy sources and transportation networks—presaged in large part Allied bombing strategy during the war’s last two years. At the time, planners chose the Ruhr as the most vulnerable target.2® Ludlow-Hewitt and other senior officers realized, however, that even if the British developed heavy bombers capable of striking these targets, they would need photoreconnaissance machines capable of collecting air intelligence data to guide bombing campaigns.  Unit-Level Air Intelligence Developments  In September 1937, the Air Ministry sent memos to all air officers commanding in charge of bomber units regarding the importance of aerial photography. Ludlow-Hewitt replied in two memos, dated 23 November 1937 and 7 January 1938, saying it was “most evident” that
