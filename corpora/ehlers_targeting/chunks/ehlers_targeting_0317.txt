able of striking these targets, they would need photoreconnaissance machines capable of collecting air intelligence data to guide bombing campaigns.  Unit-Level Air Intelligence Developments  In September 1937, the Air Ministry sent memos to all air officers commanding in charge of bomber units regarding the importance of aerial photography. Ludlow-Hewitt replied in two memos, dated 23 November 1937 and 7 January 1938, saying it was “most evident” that photoreconnaissance would prove “exceedingly valuable” in obtaining “the required information of the results of raids, and of enemy activities, so as to enable Bomber Command to direct operations.”2” He also expressed the opinion that capable reconnaissance aircraft should be part of Bomber Command’s equipment: “So long ...as we have to depend only upon the heavy bombing missions to obtain our information and photographs we cannot expect the best results, which will only be obtainable when we have aircraft suited for special reconnaissance missions.”22 These memos represented the first clear effort to grapple with the technical and operational issues surrounding the development of a real photorecon- naissance capability.  Ludlow-Hewitt also advocated pretakeoff briefings to provide detailed target information, recommending the addition of intelligence officers to every bomb squadron. He also emphasized that the results of every mission be checked by photoreconnaissance aircraft or strike cameras. He also pressed the Air Ministry to give his intelligence officers target materials to assist with mission planning and damage assessment, train photointerpreters to provide damage reports based on aerial photos, and station those officers at the Air Ministry, HQ Bomber Command, and bomber units to provide reports without delay.#2  Ludlow-Hewitt’s comments lit a fire under the Air Ministry, which issued a memo entitled “Photographic tasks for which the Squadrons of the Royal Air Force are to be trained.” It levied a require-
