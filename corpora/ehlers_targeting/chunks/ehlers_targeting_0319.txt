neur, agreed in fall 1938 to set up a front company, the Aeronautical Research and Sales Corporation. Winterbotham and Cotton, working with the French Deuxiéme Bureau de lArmée de l’Air, purchased four Lockheed 12A aircraft, which provided superb service from April to September 1939.  Cotton then set up shop as a respectable aircraft salesman in an office in France, and in March 1939, he began flying clandestine photoreconnaissance missions over Germany as he traveled to and from meetings with aircraft executives. Cotton’s choice of the Lockheed 12A, and the high-quality cameras and lenses he placed in both the fuselage and wings, were based on his realization that photoreconnaissance, whether clandestine or overt, required high-altitude, high-speed, long-range, and low-observable aircraft with fully automated cameras. He painted his aircraft a pale green to make them virtually invisible to the naked eye and installed extra fuel tanks, extending their range from 700 to 1,600 nautical miles. During spring and summer 1939, Cotton and his copilots made seven flights across Germany, returning each time with a huge number of excellent photographs of industrial facilities, oil plants and refineries, airfields, ports, and other key targets. Cotton had installed three cameras in the fuselage of his Lockheed 124A, one set vertically and the other two at a 40-degree angle, which allowed him to photograph a strip of ground 11 miles wide and dozens of miles long, from a flying altitude of 22,000 feet. The quantity and quality of photographs dwarfed anything the RAF had ever done.4#  In August 1939, one of Cotton’s copilots, Flying Officer Maurice “Shorty” Longbottom, sent a crucial memorandum to the Air Ministry. Longbottom, short in stature but long on courage and insight, made the case for improving RAF reconnaissance capabilities with the addition of a dedicated high-performance aircraft. “The best method” for doing this, he said,  appears to be the use of a single small mac
