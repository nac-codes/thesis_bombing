e case for improving RAF reconnaissance capabilities with the addition of a dedicated high-performance aircraft. “The best method” for doing this, he said,  appears to be the use of a single small machine, relying on its speed, climb, and ceiling to avoid destruction. A machine such as a singleseater fighter could fly high enough to be well above Ack- Ack fire and could rely upon sheer speed and height to get away from the enemy fighters. It would have no use for armament or radio and these could be removed to provide room for extra fuel, in order to get the necessary range. It would be a very small machine painted so as to reduce its visibility against the sky.4#  Longbottom had worked through this problem with Cotton and Flying Officer Robert Niven, Cotton’s other copilot, during the preceding year, and the memo, though signed by Longbottom, was clearly a product of this collaborative effort. The adoption three months later of a specially modified Supermarine Spitfire as the RAF’s primary photoreconnaissance platform, within a flying unit soon to be known as the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU). revolutionized RAF capabilities and paid huge dividends for the Allied war effort. The PRU had its genesis in an Air Ministrv decision to take Cot-  Page 70 of 423 19%  By March 1938, the Air Ministry had responded to Ludlow-Hewitt’s calls for specialized reconnaissance aircraft, cameras to be mounted in bombers for strike photographs, and the training of photoin- terpreters to study aerial photos. The first step in this process would be to obtain photographic coverage of German targets.4+  Photointelligence: Special Intelligence Service Flight and the Cotton Organization  This effort ran into two problems: signed agreements between Great Britain and Germany preventing aerial reconnaissance of one another's territory, and the lack of an aircraft capable of flying covert, long-distance missions over Germany. The Air Ministry’s answer was to defer to SIS (MI6), which a
