turning each time with a huge number of excellent photographs of industrial facilities, oil plants and refineries, airfields, ports, and other key targets. Cotton had installed three cameras in the fuselage of his Lockheed 12A, one set vertically and the other two at a 40-degree angle, which allowed him to photograph a strip of ground 11 miles wide and dozens of miles long, from a flying altitude of 22,000 feet. The quantity and quality of photographs dwarfed anything the RAF had ever done.42  In August 1939, one of Cotton’s copilots, Flying Officer Maurice “Shorty” Longbottom, sent a crucial memorandum to the Air Ministry. Longbottom, short in stature but long on courage and insight, made the case for improving RAF reconnaissance capabilities with the addition of a dedicated high-performance aircraft. “The best method” for doing this, he said,  appears to be the use of a single small machine, relying on its speed, climb, and ceiling to avoid destruction. A machine such as a singleseater fighter could fly high enough to be well above Ack- Ack fire and could rely upon sheer speed and height to get away from the enemy fighters. It would have no use for armament or radio and these could be removed to provide room for extra fuel, in order to get the necessary range. It would be a very small machine painted so as to reduce its visibility against the sky.4#  Longbottom had worked through this problem with Cotton and Flying Officer Robert Niven, Cotton's other copilot, during the preceding year, and the memo, though signed by Longbottom, was clearly a product of this collaborative effort. The adoption three months later of a specially modified Supermarine Spitfire as the RAF’s primary photoreconnaissance platform, within a flying unit soon to be known as the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU), revolutionized RAF capabilities and paid huge dividends for the Allied war effort. The PRU had its genesis in an Air Ministry decision to take Cot- ton’s SIS Flight into the RAF
