naissance Unit (PRU), revolutionized RAF capabilities and paid huge dividends for the Allied war effort. The PRU had its genesis in an Air Ministry decision to take Cot- ton’s SIS Flight into the RAF once the war began.  Centralizing Photoreconnaissance and Photointerpretation  Just as important as Cotton’s and Longbottom’s ideas about photoreconnaissance was Cotton’s recognition that the RAF needed a new kind of photointerpretation capability to maximize the value of the high-resolution aerial photographs beginning to pour into British intelligence agencies. Cotton argued for an organization with a centralized photo processing and readout capability, specialized photo interpretation by target categories, and a centralized reconnaissance collection management function to satisfy all requests from military and civilian intelligence organizations. These all be- came hallmarks of the Photographic Intelligence Unit (PIU), later renamed the CIU.  These two intertwined assets—PRU and PIU—emerged in early 1940. In combination with the maturation of air and economic intelligence organizations, they marked the reemergence of an air intelligence organization much more capable than its predecessor in the Great War.  In the meantime, however, there was much work to do. RAF Blenheim and Lysander reconnaissance aircraft were woefully inadequate and vulnerable to fighters, and the Air Ministry had a grand total of one trained photointerpreter. Equally problematic was the practice of requiring intelligence officers at bomber units to interpret strike photos without formal training—a serious problem as the RAF equipped increasing numbers of bombers with cameras. This shortage of trained photointerpreters stemmed from the interwar practice of training only army officers and attaching them to RAF units. Thus, although the RAF School of Interpretation at Farnborough opened in 1922, the army provided all its instructors and pupils until 1938. When the Air Ministry saw the need for more
