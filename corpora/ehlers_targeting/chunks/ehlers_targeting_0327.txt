, that “relatively too much work has been put into what you do when you find the target and too little on the actual finding of the target.”4© Group Captain J. C. Slessor noted in October 1938 that the RAF was “neglecting practical research and experiments bearing on the relative vulnerability to air bombardment of various kinds of targets and on the types of bombs and tactics, which will bring about the destruction with the least expenditure of effort of each type of target.”42  Despite these shortcomings, British air intelligence capabilities grew from infancy to adolescence between January 1936 and September 1939. New organizations, reconnaissance aircraft, and the first cadre of RAF photointerpreters joined photographic specialists and cameras, both of which had already reached a relatively mature state, to provide the first clear indication that a new air intelli- gence organization was emerging. The picture was less positive for the development of American capabilities.  The American Experience: Good Bombing, Poor Air Intelligence  While the British had done relatively poorly developing operational bombing capabilities but well with the formation of air and economic intelligence organizations, the case was reversed for the Americans, who developed a clear doctrine, an excellent heavy bomber and bombsight, good bombs, and good navigational equipment and skills, but lagged far behind in developing air intelligence organizations. As it turned out, this worked out for both parties, with the Americans benefiting from British air intelligence and the British from the addition of hundreds, and then thousands, of  Page 73 of 423 19%  Centralizing Photoreconnaissance and Photointerpretation  Just as important as Cotton’s and Longbottom’s ideas about photoreconnaissance was Cotton’s recognition that the RAF needed a new kind of photointerpretation capability to maximize the value of the high-resolution aerial photographs beginning to pour into British intelligence agenc
