or both parties, with the Americans benefiting from British air intelligence and the British from the addition of hundreds, and then thousands, of American heavy bombers for operations against Germany. In this sense, if high-altitude precision daylight bombardment doctrine was a doctrine in search of an airplane, it was also a doctrine in search of a serious air intelligence capability. Although Arnold and his lieutenants were forward thinkers in the realm of air warfare, their vision did not extend to air intelligence. This was nowhere more evident than in their almost complete lack of emphasis on it until 1941.  By 1934, the Air Corps was well on the way to developing a heavybomber capability. Five things had begun to come together: clear doctrine; the B-17, an aircraft ideally suited to the new doctrine;  Be AD ee De ced oe De et be eh ee Cn oe i A Fae le ete nne ete lan A Tink Wea kd A A ee me at od Samay ©. a 8 ee a 2 ee ed tin  Page 75 of 423 20%  Fee eel Lal - - — consider how far recent advances in scientific and technical knowledge can be used to strengthen present methods of offence in the Royal Air Force,” was concerned by the RAF’s lack of interest in navigation. He observed, in November 1938, that “relatively too much work has been put into what you do when you find the target and too little on the actual finding of the target.”4° Group Captain J. C. Slessor noted in October 1938 that the RAF was “neglecting practical research and experiments bearing on the relative vulnerability to air bombardment of various kinds of targets and on the types of bombs and tactics, which will bring about the destruction with the least expenditure of effort of each type of target.”42  Despite these shortcomings, British air intelligence capabilities grew from infancy to adolescence between January 1936 and September 1939. New organizations, reconnaissance aircraft, and the first cadre of RAF photointerpreters joined photographic specialists and cameras, both of which had
