ircrew training. As Peter Faber noted, the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) was “the incubator of bombardment theory and doctrine” for a generation of airmen—the same generation called on to put doctrine into practice in the skies over Europe. ACTS doctrinal development progressed in three stages. From 1920 to 1926, the ACTS faculty established the primacy of the bomber as an instrument of air warfare. During the middle period, 1927 to 1934, they developed a uniquely American doctrine: high-altitude precision daylight bombing. The doctrine’s key hallmarks included concerted, systematic, and heavy attacks against enemy industrial infrastructure, focused on target sets most likely to bring about military collapse. During the third phase, 1935 to 1940, ACTS instructors formalized their doctrine by trying to determine which target sets constituted key vulnerabilities in Germany’s war economy.48  Faber also notes that the best and brightest officers attended ACTS and were thus inculcated with the new doctrine. From 1921 to 1940, ACTS graduated 1,091 officers. Of these, 261 became generals, comprising 80 percent of USAAF senior leadership during World War II, including 11 of its 13 three-star generals and all 3 of the four-star generals. These men believed in the new doctrine, and when they took command of the USAAF bombing effort, their faith in the heavy bomber’s ability to produce decisive effects was unflinching.*® This clarity of purpose was one of the great strengths of Ameri- can bombing.  Training standards were also high because crews flew often and under varied conditions. Standards were particularly high for bombardiers. To qualify as a bombardier third class, officers had to drop practice and live bombs from 20,000 feet with a maximum circular error probable of 500 feet for day missions and 600 for night missions.*2 This accuracy derived in part from high training standards, in part from the Norden bombsight and the B-17 bomber, and in part from the fact that
