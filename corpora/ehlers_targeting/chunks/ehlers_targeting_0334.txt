0 feet for day missions and 600 for night missions.*2 This accuracy derived in part from high training standards, in part from the Norden bombsight and the B-17 bomber, and in part from the fact that most—but not all—bombing practice was conducted in clear weather. Of course, there were no fighters and flak to contend with, which also made things easier. Nonetheless, their bombing proficiency was the highest in the world by 1941 and remained so, with the exception of the best British bomber crews, until the war's end.  Despite these strengths, there were some serious flaws. Not the least of these was the zealotry of the ACTS bomber advocates in asserting that airpower alone could defeat an industrialized enemy. Equally problematic was the almost utter lack of attention to air intelligence. This was one of the greatest ironies in the development of bombardment aviation during the late interwar period. Given the doctrinal emphasis on precision bombing, air intelligence should have been at the center of airmen’s concerns. Instead, with the partial exception of targeting, it existed at the margins until 1942. This lack of interest, which extended to key technologies such as high-performance reconnaissance aircraft, would have been disastrous had the British not shared air intelligence expertise so freely with their allies.  Sadly, nobody, including the chief of the Air Corps, General Hap Arnold, thought seriously about air intelligence before 1940. In fact, Arnold did not establish an Office of the Chief of Air Corps Intelligence Division until November 1940. When the Air Corps became the USAAF on 20 June 1941, Arnold did insist on having his own assistant chief of air staff, intelligence (ACAS A-2), and General George C. Marshall, the army chief of staff, agreed. Arnold’s first ACAS A-2, Brigadier General Martin Scanlon, convinced Arnold and Marshall that air intelligence must include target intelligence, but there was no discussion of damage assessments. So it was at
