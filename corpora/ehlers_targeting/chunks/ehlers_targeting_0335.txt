first ACAS A-2, Brigadier General Martin Scanlon, convinced Arnold and Marshall that air intelligence must include target intelligence, but there was no discussion of damage assessments. So it was at this point, five months before the United States entered the war, when recognition of the importance of air intelligence at the highest levels finally emerged. But recognizing a problem and addressing it are different, and the USAAF proved unable to do the latter for many months.*+  Cabell’s Mission: First Steps toward an Air Intelligence Capability  Air intelligence received its first real push from Major C. P. Cabell, whom Arnold sent to Great Britain in February 1941 to learn about aerial photography and photointerpretation. His May 1941  Page 76 of 423 20%  for a generation of airmen—the same generation called on to put doctrine into practice in the skies over Europe. ACTS doctrinal development progressed in three stages. From 1920 to 1926, the ACTS faculty established the primacy of the bomber as an instrument of air warfare. During the middle period, 1927 to 1934, they developed a uniquely American doctrine: high-altitude precision daylight bombing. The doctrine’s key hallmarks included concerted, systematic, and heavy attacks against enemy industrial infrastructure, focused on target sets most likely to bring about military collapse. During the third phase, 1935 to 1940, ACTS instructors formalized their doctrine by trying to determine which target sets constituted key vulnerabilities in Germany’s war economy.4®  Faber also notes that the best and brightest officers attended ACTS and were thus inculcated with the new doctrine. From 1921 to 1940, ACTS graduated 1,091 officers. Of these, 261 became generals, comprising 80 percent of USAAF senior leadership during World War II, including 11 of its 13 three-star generals and all 3 of the four-star generals. These men believed in the new doctrine, and when they took command of the USAAF bombing effort, their faith in
