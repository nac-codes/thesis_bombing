War II, including 11 of its 13 three-star generals and all 3 of the four-star generals. These men believed in the new doctrine, and when they took command of the USAAF bombing effort, their faith in the heavy bomber’s ability to produce decisive effects was unflinching.*? This clarity of purpose was one of the great strengths of Ameri- can bombing.  Training standards were also high because crews flew often and under varied conditions. Standards were particularly high for bombardiers. To qualify as a bombardier third class, officers had to drop practice and live bombs from 20,000 feet with a maximum circular error probable of 500 feet for day missions and 600 for night missions.°2 This accuracy derived in part from high training standards, in part from the Norden bombsight and the B-17 bomber, and in part from the fact that most—but not all—bombing practice was conducted in clear weather. Of course, there were no fighters and flak to contend with, which also made things easier. Nonetheless, their bombing proficiency was the highest in the world by 1941 and remained so, with the exception of the best British bomber crews, until the war's end.  Despite these strengths, there were some serious flaws. Not the least of these was the zealotry of the ACTS bomber advocates in asserting that airpower alone could defeat an industrialized enemy. Equally problematic was the almost utter lack of attention to air intelligence. This was one of the greatest ironies in the development of bombardment aviation during the late interwar period. Given the doctrinal emphasis on precision bombing, air intelligence should have been at the center of airmen’s concerns. Instead, with the partial exception of targeting, it existed at the margins until 1942. This lack of interest, which extended to key technologies such as high-performance reconnaissance aircraft, would have been disastrous had the British not shared air intelligence expertise so freely with their allies.  Sadly, nobody, includ
