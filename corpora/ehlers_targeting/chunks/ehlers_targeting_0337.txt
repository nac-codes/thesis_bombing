key technologies such as high-performance reconnaissance aircraft, would have been disastrous had the British not shared air intelligence expertise so freely with their allies.  Sadly, nobody, including the chief of the Air Corps, General Hap Arnold, thought seriously about air intelligence before 1940. In fact, Arnold did not establish an Office of the Chief of Air Corps Intelligence Division until November 1940. When the Air Corps became the USAAF on 20 June 1941, Arnold did insist on having his own assistant chief of air staff, intelligence (ACAS A-2), and General George C. Marshall, the army chief of staff, agreed. Arnold’s first ACAS A-2, Brigadier General Martin Scanlon, convinced Arnold and Marshall that air intelligence must include target intelligence, but there was no discussion of damage assessments. So it was at this point, five months before the United States entered the war, when recognition of the importance of air intelligence at the highest levels finally emerged. But recognizing a problem and addressing it are different, and the USAAF proved unable to do the latter for many months.*+  Cabell’s Mission: First Steps toward an Air Intelligence Capability  Air intelligence received its first real push from Major C. P. Cabell, whom Arnold sent to Great Britain in February 1941 to learn about aerial photography and photointerpretation. His May 1941 report played a crucial role in the development of American air intelligence. Cabell’s mission was “to study aerial photography in Great Britain,” a job he did very well. His recommendations, all of which the USAAF adopted, paid huge dividends. These included formation of a USAAF agency to formulate photographic policies and coordinate research, development, testing, and evaluation of new methods for aerial photography; immediate formation of one or more photographic groups, including a photoreconnaissance group equipped with the latest pursuit aircraft; establishment of an Air Intelligence School to train ph
