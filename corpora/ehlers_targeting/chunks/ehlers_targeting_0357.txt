operate in a significant fashion until after the fall of France. The period between September 1939 and December 1941 was thus crucial in these new organizations’ evolution and the air intelligence expertise they ultimately brought to bear later in the war.  Bomber Command was incapable of flying effective combat missions against the Reich and was prohibited from doing so by a nervous British government that feared reprisal raids.1 The first bombing campaign therefore consisted largely of dropping propaganda leaflets over western Germany at night and conducting maritime patrols in the North Sea. Nonetheless, two raids by Wellington bombers on 14 and 18 December 1939 sought to attack the German fleet at the Heligoland Bight. Flying unescorted in daylight, they were attacked by fighters and lost over half their numbers. With this disaster, whatever plans Ludlow-Hewitt might have had for a daytime air offensive against the Ruhr were dashed by government and Air Ministry directives as well as a gradually increasing real- ization that medium bombers could not survive in the daylight skies over or near the Reich.2  The next raid on Germany was consequently a night attack in retaliation for a German raid on Scapa Flow. Flown the night of 19-20 March 1940, it targeted the Hérnum seaplane base on Sylt Island.

Most significant, on the British side, was the emergence in the late interwar period of air and economic intelligence agencies capable of gauging bombing effects and effectiveness. As the war progressed, these agencies developed an increasingly close and productive working relationship, one that grew stronger once the Americans arrived. This process resulted by 1944 in a mature Allied air intelligence organization. Of course, the British had a great deal
