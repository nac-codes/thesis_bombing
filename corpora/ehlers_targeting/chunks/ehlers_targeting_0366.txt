9, sixteen were shot down, and half of the others failed to produce useful photographs as a result of evasive action and equipment malfunctions. The other available aircraft was the Lysander, a highly vulnerable tactical reconnaissance platform. From September 1939 to 15 January 1940, the RAF relied on the Blenheim and Lysander to photograph 2,500 square miles of German territory with the loss of forty aircraft, while the French photographed 6,000 square miles at a cost of sixty aircraft. In contrast, Cotton’s new detachment, now at RAF Heston, photographed 5,000 square miles without the loss of a single aircraft—and in fact with only a single aircraft assigned. “Shorty” Longbottom had helped Cotton modify this first Spitfire by removing its guns, radio, and other unnecessary equipment and fitting it with extra gas tanks. This yielded a range of 1,500 miles, enough to get to Berlin and back.4  The Cotton Organization Goes to War  Cotton argued ceaselessly for improved reconnaissance aircraft, as well as for centralized photoreconnaissance and photointerpretation capabilities with all such assets under Air Ministry control and part of a unified and coordinated tasking process. He was responding to the haphazard method of tasking reconnaissance assets then in place, in which the Air Ministry, Bomber Command, the War Office, the Admiralty, and the British Expeditionary Force in France tasked, collected, interpreted, and stored their photographs using their own procedures and following their own imperatives, “stovepiping” the photoreconnaissance and photointerpretation functions. These arrangements, far from being frowned on by senior officers, were in fact codified in a standing directive, War Instruc- tion No. 5, which assigned each service and subordinate units to provide various kinds of aerial photos and conduct photointerpretation. Cotton set out to fix this ineffective process.*  The Cotton Organization, as the capabilities comprising the PRUs and CIU were initia
