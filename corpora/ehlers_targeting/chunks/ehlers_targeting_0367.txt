e various kinds of aerial photos and conduct photointerpretation. Cotton set out to fix this ineffective process.*  The Cotton Organization, as the capabilities comprising the PRUs and CIU were initially known, included Special Intelligence Service (SIS) Flight, which conducted photoreconnaissance of factories and other high-value targets until the war began. Cotton's aircraft also photographed industrial facilities in the British Isles for comparative purposes and to fill in blank portions of the photointer- preters’ recognition guides, allowing them to discern vital details. The Cotton Organization also included the Aircraft Operating Company, an amalgamation of air survey companies and Aerofilm Ltd., a specialized company producing cameras, film, and other photographic supplies. The Aircraft Operating Company was originally intended to provide an empirewide air survey capability and had among its equipment two Wild A.5 Stereo Plotters. These two organizations—SIS Flight and the Aircraft Operating Company—were located adjacent to one another at RAF Heston and RAF Wembley for rapid development, interpretation, annotation, and dissemination of aerial photos and associated assessments.£  When war arrived, the Air Ministry requisitioned the Aircraft Operating Company’s assets along with those of SIS Flight, including the first two reconnaissance Spitfires, to form No. 1 Camouflage Unit. Here, Cotton, now a wing commander and in charge of the new unit, led several technological and procedural innovations giving him the world’s most capable reconnaissance aircraft and photointerpretation capabilities operating under the principle of centralized control. Key initiatives included successive versions of his unit’s Spitfires with increasingly capable cameras and the im- plementation of twenty-four-hour operations, with analysts and other technicians working twelve-hour shifts.2  When the Aircraft Operating Company came under Air Ministry control on 1 April 1940, its thirty-
