in developing a new PIU process, “which appears to give satisfaction to all those Service Departments making use of P.1.U.”2 Riddell’s brilliant work, now and throughout the war, was of vital importance to the Allied air intelligence effort.  Riddell began his paper with a reminder that centralized control of the reconnaissance and photointerpretation processes was indispensable given the scarcity of high-performance aircraft and skilled interpreters. “It is the agreed intention of all concerned,” he continued, “with the present exception of Bomber Command, that all photographic interpretation shall be done at a central unit.”12 To bring Bomber Command into the fold, he proposed the Air Ministry direct the amalgamation of Bomber Command’s Photointerpretation Section with the PIU, a move that occurred, after a hard- fought battle, in March 1941.14 Riddell also pushed for continuation of the twenty-four-hour system of operations, and for the first-, second-, and third-phase interpretation processes that came to define CIU operations. He proposed establishment of PIU liaison officer positions at HQ Bomber and Coastal Commands, the Admiralty, and the War Office. In addition, Riddell spearheaded a new  Page 87 of 423 22%  eae ee ee ee ee eee ee ee eee eS eee eee ee ee EE ——— eee eee velopment to do these things. Nonetheless, they were evolving rapidly, and as the bombing effort intensified, these capabilities approached maturity.  One of the most glaring deficiencies was the initial contingent of reconnaissance aircraft. The only one with the combat radius to reach Germany—and only its western territories—was the Blenheim bomber, flying at between 10,000 and 20,000 feet and unable to survive fighter attacks. Of the first eighty-nine Blenheim missions over Germany in 1939, sixteen were shot down, and half of the others failed to produce useful photographs as a result of evasive action and equipment malfunctions. The other available aircraft was the Lysander, a highly vuln
