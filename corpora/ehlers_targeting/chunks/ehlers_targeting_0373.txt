veloping a new PIU process, “which appears to give satisfaction to all those Service Departments making use of P.1.U.”2 Riddell’s brilliant work, now and throughout the war, was of vital importance to the Allied air intelligence effort.  Riddell began his paper with a reminder that centralized control of the reconnaissance and photointerpretation processes was indispensable given the scarcity of high-performance aircraft and skilled interpreters. “It is the agreed intention of all concerned,” he continued, “with the present exception of Bomber Comman4d, that all photographic interpretation shall be done at a central unit.”12 To bring Bomber Command into the fold, he proposed the Air Ministry direct the amalgamation of Bomber Command's Photointerpretation Section with the PIU, a move that occurred, after a hard- fought battle, in March 1941.14 Riddell also pushed for continuation of the twenty-four-hour system of operations, and for the first-, second-, and third-phase interpretation processes that came to define CIU operations. He proposed establishment of PIU liaison officer positions at HQ Bomber and Coastal Commands, the Admiralty, and the War Office. In addition, Riddell spearheaded a new procedure whereby photographic developers at PIU printed enough copies of each photograph for plotting, interpretation, and other activities to occur simultaneously in the various PIU sections, rather than sequentially, resulting in a huge increase in the unit’s efficiency. To increase efficiency even further, he introduced a standardized system he had perfected at HQ Bomber Command for annotating and labeling prints before dissemination and filing. Finally, he received permission to engage in a major public relations effort in which he and other PIU officers traveled to other commands and organizations and made them familiar with the broad and growing range of PIU services. This campaign proved highly successful, with Riddell reminding his audiences that the PIU maximized  Pag
