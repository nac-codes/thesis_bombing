This campaign proved highly successful, with Riddell reminding his audiences that the PIU maximized  Page 87 of 423 22%  =  =e ee eee ee  When the Aircraft Operating Company came under Air Ministry control on 1 April 1940, its thirty-seven staff members were drafted into the RAF and amalgamated with A.I.1.(h), the small Air Ministry unit formed in March 1938 for detailed photointerpretation work. This new unit, the Photographic Interpretation Unit (PIU; later CIU), had an authorized strength of 189 and an actual strength of 133. It was briefly under the direct operational control of Air Ministry A.1.8, but when France fell and the threat of invasion became real, control was vested in RAF Coastal Command on 11 July 1940, a decision that made sense at the time but occasioned a bitter feud over operational control between Coastal and Bomber Commands as the latter’s operations eclipsed those of the former by mid-1941.

This was the first, but by no means the last, instance in which vested interests and agendas pulled air intelligence personnel and products in different directions, often to the detriment of the larger war effort.  Just before this realignment occurred, Squadron Leader P. J. A.
