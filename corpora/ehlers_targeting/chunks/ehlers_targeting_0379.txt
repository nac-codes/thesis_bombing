No report represents the opinion of one individual.”24 It concluded with a reminder that the PIU served many customers, providing interpretation reports for targeting and damage assessment, and gaining detailed knowledge of virtually every enemy installation, “in order that a watch may be kept over activity on the enemy’s coastline, in his ports and also on his aerodromes and back areas, including his manufacturing centres. This means that personnel having either a broad knowledge of the economic life of Ger- many and German occupied territories are required, as well as specialists having a particular knowledge of oil refineries, factories, radio stations, etc.”14  In the meantime, PIU personnel continued developing procedures to maximize the unit’s efficiency and effectiveness.
