is the function of this Unit to provide information from Air photographs received from all sources, with the minimum of delay. Reports are to be teleprinted, and followed up by Interpretation Reports by 1st and 2nd Phase Section, and Detailed Reports by 3rd Phase Sections. . . . It is, therefore, the intention of this organisation to provide ALL information from photographs obtained by any one Sortie within 12 hours of the aircraft landing or of the prints arriving at Heston from Detached Flights.14  The practice of sending key results of first-phase interpretation by teleprinter, within two hours of receipt of photographs, to interested parties increased throughout the war. This gave senior airmen intelligence that they could then use to task additional sorties against a given target within hours, or at most a day.  The purpose of second-phase interpretation, completed within twelve hours of receipt of photographs, was to conduct a more detailed study and provide additional insights in supplementary reports. The use of teleprinter and truck to deliver this actionable intelligence rapidly was an air intelligence trademark.1Â®  Once second-phase reports were on their way, specialized interpretation shops, including D (Industrial) and K (Damage Assessment) Sections, as well as those specializing in railroads, inland waterways, supply dumps, and several other categories, went to work on third-phase reports. These often took two weeks or more to produce and were increasingly the result of collaborative efforts with other economic and military intelligence organizations.12 These interagency efforts yielded an increasingly comprehensive understanding of every major target system in the Reich and German- controlled Europe, including the French and German transportation systems and the German oil industry. The astonishing thing about this development is that the British carried it through before they had any kind of credible bomber force. Clearly, there was agreement among
