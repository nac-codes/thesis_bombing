and the German oil industry. The astonishing thing about this development is that the British carried it through before they had any kind of credible bomber force. Clearly, there was agreement among British civilian and military leaders that they would eventually have the bombers to attack these targets effectively, and this faith in future capabilities as yet barely glimpsed proved one of the few positive developments in an otherwise bleak landscape.

A new and vital asset, then unique in the annals of warfare—a centralized photointelligence capability—had emerged. It would be tested and found worthy during five more years of war.18  Cotton Out, Air Ministry In  As these developments unfolded at the PIU, Sidney Cotton, who had deployed to the Continent to lead RAF photoreconnaissance efforts in support of the British Expeditionary Force in France, ran afoul of Air Ministry senior leadership and was fired on his return to Great Britain on 17 June 1940.12 The reasons for this dismissal are not entirely clear but were likely threefold.
