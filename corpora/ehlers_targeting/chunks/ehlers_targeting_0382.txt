ut were likely threefold. First was Cotton’s reputation as a maverick who went around the chain of command whenever it suited him. Air Vice Marshal Fred Inglis, the Air Ministry’s assistant chief of air staff intelligence, had stated ina memo to Sir Archibald Sinclair, the secretary of state for air, that “Cotton’s methods will never work in with R.A.F. procedure, and a blow-up is bound to occur sooner or later.”2° Inglis followed this with a proposal for making the PDU and PIU regular RAF units in every sense of the word. “Under my proposals,” he said, “I think he [Cotton] could be kept to the point and would not upset or try to control the rest of the Air Force.”24 A second and related problem was the constant irritation Cotton’s freelancing caused the air staff and Admiralty. Inglis sought to bring the PIU under Air Ministry control, which occurred for a brief period, leaving Cotton in control of flying operations at the PDU.22 Third—and this appears to have been the final straw—was Cotton’s loss of nearly all his unit’s ground equipment during the retreat from France, which appears to have been a result of Cotton’s once again ignoring Air Ministry orders.22 The end result was Cotton’s replacement by Wing Commander G. W. Tuttle, Cotton’s deputy and a regular RAF officer. As Inglis recommended, command of the two halves of the reconnaissance and interpretation effort was given to two officers to allow for effective span of control, with Tuttle commanding only the PDU (later PRU) and Hemming in charge of photointerpretation efforts at the PIU (later CIU).  Consequently, while Hemming and Riddell pushed forward the concept and operational capabilities of the PIU, Tuttle worked to meet the requirements levied by the Air Ministry and Admiralty.
