and would not upset or try to control the rest of the Air Force.”24 A second and related problem was the constant irritation Cotton’s freelancing caused the air staff and Admiralty. Inglis sought to bring the PIU under Air Ministry control, which occurred for a brief period, leaving Cotton in control of flying operations at the PDU.22 Third—and this appears to have been the final straw—was Cotton’s loss of nearly all his unit’s ground equipment during the retreat from France, which appears to have been a result of Cotton’s once again ignoring Air Ministry orders.22 The end result was Cotton’s replacement by Wing Commander G. W. Tuttle, Cotton’s deputy and a regular RAF officer. As Inglis recommended, command of the two halves of the reconnaissance and interpretation effort was given to two officers to allow for effective span of control, with Tuttle commanding only the PDU (later PRU) and Hemming in charge of photointerpretation efforts at the PIU (later CIU).  Consequently, while Hemming and Riddell pushed forward the concept and operational capabilities of the PIU, Tuttle worked to meet the requirements levied by the Air Ministry and Admiralty. His few aircraft (at first only four, but increasing to sixteen by spring 1941) and their pilots thus had to fly missions to produce aerial photographs for targeting purposes as the Air Ministry and Bomber Command intelligence organizations, along with MEW, called for regular reconnaissance of large cities in Germany as often as once a week to develop comprehensive target folders. This took on added urgency once Bomber Command began sustained bombing of the Reich during fall 1940. Among the most important of these was the first coverage of the entire Ruhr, obtained by a single Spitfire sortie on 2 March 1940 and still in use for target materials in 1944.24 In addition, Bomber Command expected PDU pilots to fly an increasing number of poststrike sorties as the number of bomber missions increased in late 1940.
