r target materials in 1944.24 In addition, Bomber Command expected PDU pilots to fly an increasing number of poststrike sorties as the number of bomber missions increased in late 1940. Tuttle’s pilots also flew constant collection missions for their most important customers at this time, Coastal Command and the Admiralty, who were responsible for keeping track of German invasion preparations. This involved conducting photoreconnaissance of all German-controlled ports twice a week, and, during the high point of the invasion threat, of key French and Belgian port cities on the English Channel three times a day.2%  A meeting at the Air Ministry on 2 October 1940 confirmed the proper role of the PDU was to provide centralized tasking for photoreconnaissance missions, replacing the previous system in which each service and—in the case of the RAF—each command had its own photoreconnaissance aircraft. The plan agreed on was to continue the centralization process. The PDU would fly reconnaissance missions as required for the various services and commands, while at the same time evolving from squadron to group size, conducting all of its flying training in house, and designing specialized air- craft equipment and cameras. Bomber Command disagreed on the need for only one photoreconnaissance group, likely because Coastal Command received the lion’s share of the PDU’s missions to track German preinvasion activity, while Bomber Command often had to go without aerial photos. However, there was agreement on the need for a centralized photointerpretation and photointelligence capability at the PIU. To oversee this process, the Air Ministry soon created a new position, the assistant director of intelligence for photography, who exercised policy and operational authority over the entire tasking and production process from 1941 until his unit’s replacement by the Joint Photographic Reconnaissance Committee in May 1944. This proved crucial in making the damage-assess- ment process as
