tasking and production process from 1941 until his unit’s replacement by the Joint Photographic Reconnaissance Committee in May 1944. This proved crucial in making the damage-assess- ment process as effective and efficient as possible.2®  These efforts to iron out details of photographic reconnaissance operations continued at a meeting in February 1941 chaired by Air Vice Marshal Peck, the assistant chief of air staff (general), and attended by a number of key flying and intelligence officers, including Group Captain Laws, Squadron Leader Riddell, and Mr. Lawrence, a senior intelligence officer from MEW. All agreed that photore- connaissance aircraft would have to operate at 30,000 to 40,000 feet of altitude to avoid fighters and flak. However, they also recognized the short (6”) lenses on F24 cameras carried aboard Spitfire reconnaissance aircraft were incapable of providing 1:12,000-scale coverage at those altitudes. Riddell emphasized that 1:12,000 was the smallest scale at which photointerpreters could conduct in-  Page 90 of 423 23%  control, with Tuttle commanding only the PDU (later PRU) and Hemming in charge of photointerpretation efforts at the PIU (later CIU).  Consequently, while Hemming and Riddell pushed forward the concept and operational capabilities of the PIU, Tuttle worked to meet the requirements levied by the Air Ministry and Admiralty. His few aircraft (at first only four, but increasing to sixteen by spring 1941) and their pilots thus had to fly missions to produce aerial photographs for targeting purposes as the Air Ministry and Bomber Command intelligence organizations, along with MEW, called for regular reconnaissance of large cities in Germany as often as once a week to develop comprehensive target folders. This took on added urgency once Bomber Command began sustained bombing of the Reich during fall 1940. Among the most important of these was the first coverage of the entire Ruhr, obtained by a single Spitfire sortie on 2 March 1940 and
