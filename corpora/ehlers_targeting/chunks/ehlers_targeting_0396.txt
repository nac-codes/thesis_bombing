ember, bombers made nine heavy attacks against Boulogne, dropping 143 tons of bombs. Poststrike cover showed the number of barges visible at the port had decreased from 220 to approximately 190. There was no increase in barges at neighboring ports, indicating the thirty missing barges had been sunk. A number of others were also damaged and in dry dock, or simply beached. An even more effective series of raids on Calais, between 17 September and 10 October, which delivered 196 tons of bombs, sank nearly 100 barges and damaged many more. Photographs showed barges there packed gunwale to gunwale, making easy work for bomber crews. Strike photos taken as raids were ongoing also and proved very useful in determining bombing effects.22 Together with poststrike photographs taken by PDU Spitfires, they confirmed that by 21 September, British bombers had already sunk over 10 percent of barges assembled for the invasion.22 Attacks continued in force until April 1941, by which time nearly all remaining barges had moved to ports in Belgium and the Netherlands. By February 1941, there were 650 barges in Antwerp and another 650 in Rotterdam. Further raids, though not as frequent, forced a further dispersal up the canals and rivers of the Low Countries, where the Germans moored  Page 92 of 423 24%  attended by a number of key flying and intelligence officers, including Group Captain Laws, Squadron Leader Riddell, and Mr. Lawrence, a senior intelligence officer from MEW. All agreed that photore- connaissance aircraft would have to operate at 30,000 to 40,000 feet of altitude to avoid fighters and flak. However, they also recognized the short (6‚Äù) lenses on F24 cameras carried aboard Spitfire reconnaissance aircraft were incapable of providing 1:12,000-scale coverage at those altitudes. Riddell emphasized that 1:12,000 was the smallest scale at which photointerpreters could conduct in- depth assessments. Two key problems presented themselves here. The first was an as-yet-unmet requi
