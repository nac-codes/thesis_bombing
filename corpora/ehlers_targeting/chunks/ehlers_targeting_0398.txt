rs at Farnborough, Decem- ber 1939 to January 1940, featured ten officers in their forties or older, all with photointelligence experience in the Great War and the interwar period.2®  First Campaigns: Barges and Oil  These veterans and their younger comrades did not have long to wait before they put their skills to use during Bomber Command’s first two campaigns, the first against barges and port facilities along the Channel coast after the fall of France and the second a small-scale and unsuccessful effort against oil targets in the Ruhr. In the case of oil attacks, all were at night; and as the few available PIU and Bomber Command damage assessments confirmed, most missed their targets. Only a few such raids occurred, however, because the disaster in France forced Bomber Command into a ground-support role, which failed to stem the German advance and led to very high bomber losses, often over half on each mission. The upshot was a bomber force even less capable of achieving the objectives set for it, and by this time, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal, now in charge of Bomber Command, had three directives: attack German oil production; go after airfields and aircraft production; and, once the threat of invasion became serious, attack port facilities and barges. The latter proved to be the one bright ray of success in an otherwise lackluster operational performance.22  British bombers attacking barges in the Channel ports usually did so at night, although there were a few daytime raids with fighter escort. Both night and daylight accuracy proved reasonably good, in large measure because the ports, given their locations along the Channel coast, were easy to locate. Bombing did serious damage to barges, a fact substantiated by PIU damage assessments. Barge traffic began building up in August and September 1940, with as many as 250 barges in each of the larger ports.22 By 18 September, photointerpreters counted 1,004 barges at the five major Channel ports between Fl
