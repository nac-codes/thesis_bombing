n building up in August and September 1940, with as many as 250 barges in each of the larger ports.22 By 18 September, photointerpreters counted 1,004 barges at the five major Channel ports between Flushing and Boulogne. Bomber Command began going after the barges on the night of 7-8 September, flying over 2,900 sorties from the first attacks by 92 bombers to the last by 93 bombers on the night of 12-13 October.2! Between 18 and 27 September, bombers made nine heavy attacks against Boulogne, dropping 143 tons of bombs. Poststrike cover showed the number of barges visible at the port had decreased from 220 to approximately 190. There was no increase in barges at neighboring ports, indicating the thirty missing barges had been sunk. A number of others were also damaged and in dry dock, or simply beached. An even more effective series of raids on Calais, between 17 September and 10 October, which delivered 196 tons of bombs, sank nearly 100 barges and damaged many more. Photographs showed barges there packed gunwale to gunwale, making easy work for bomber crews. Strike photos taken as raids were ongoing also and proved very useful in determining bombing effects.22 Together with poststrike photographs taken by PDU Spitfires, they confirmed that by 21 September, British bombers had already sunk over 10 percent of barges assembled for the invasion.*3 Attacks continued in force until April 1941, by which time nearly all remaining barges had moved to ports in Belgium and the Netherlands. By February 1941, there were 650 barges in Antwerp and another 650 in Rotterdam. Further raids, though not as frequent, forced a further dispersal up the canals and rivers of the Low Countries, where the Germans moored and camouflaged small groups of barges. During the campaign, PIU interpreters also located several shipyards in Holland where the Germans were modifying barges to serve as tank landing craft and other heavy-equipment carriers. These also received attention from British bomber
