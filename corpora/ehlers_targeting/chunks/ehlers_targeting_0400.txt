s also located several shipyards in Holland where the Germans were modifying barges to serve as tank landing craft and other heavy-equipment carriers. These also received attention from British bombers.24  The campaign against invasion barges was one of the few operational bright spots during fall 1940. Accurate bombing and poor German security measures, such as packing barges together, led to serious losses of landing craft and forced the Germans to disperse the remainder. The PIU interpretation report covering these developments was thus accurate and also forwardlooking in its recogni- tion that, should the German drive in the east succeed, Bomber Command might have to wage a second barge campaign in 1942.  The PRUs and CIU: Rapid Evolution  As the effort against barges continued, so did bombing of aircraft and oil targets. As the former received progressively less effort with the Battle of Britain winding down, the latter again took center stage.2Â° Although this first oil offensive will receive attention shortly, we must first return to improvements at the PDU and PIU, which continued their rapid development.  During January 1941, as the first oil offensive began, the PDU and PIU continued evolving. They also received their new titles: Photographic Reconnaissance Units (PRUs) and the Central Interpret- ation Unit (CIU). First-phase interpretation, previously completed at Wembley, was now moved to the three photoreconnaissance flights at Benson, Wick, and St. Eval to keep damage reports moving to  tha CMT aasialeler Fav annand nhaanintaenentatinn Davina thie naciand tha dvaurinag and mndaling aantinne hacan sine anvial whatas ta nenduian nenantianalle annuenta nlans deaurinas and enala mandala  Page 93 of 423 24%  were also damaged and in dry dock, or simply beached. An even more effective series of raids on Calais, between 17 September and 10 October, which delivered 196 tons of bombs, sank nearly 100 barges and damaged many more. Photographs showed barges there
