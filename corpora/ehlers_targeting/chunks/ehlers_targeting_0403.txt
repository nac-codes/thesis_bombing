Several photointerpreters were killed or wounded. At the same time, PRU1 was moving to RAF Benson. To keep the two units adjacent, the CIU began its move to RAF Medmenham on 13 January 1941 and stayed there, with satellite bases at RAF Pinetree and Nuneham Common, for the duration. Fortunately, Medmenham was a large facility and could house the rapidly growing CIU, which soon had over 400 personnel assigned.2” This increase was a response to the insatiable demand for annotated photos and associated interpretation reports at all major military headquarters and civilian economic intelligence agencies. By this time, the PRUs were flying at least seventeen sorties per day, each of which carried F,, cameras capable of taking 125 photographs, meaning interpreters assessed no fewer than 2,125 prints per day.28 Although most of them provided baseline targeting knowledge of economic facilities, an increasing number were damage-assessment photographs.22  In March 1941, to maximize the effectiveness of collection and analysis, Tuttle and Riddell called for the immediate formation of a Controlling Section, composed of a field-grade officer from each service, to ensure a rapid turnaround for all reconnaissance requirements. The Air Ministry approved, and the resulting incorporation of army and navy officers into the Duty Section improved the CIU’s efficiency tremendously and prefigured the formation of the Joint Photographic Reconnaissance Center, a joint requirements and collection management unit that directed photoreconnaissance and photointerpretation operations from May 1944 to VE Day. Finally, Tuttle and Riddell pushed hard for Air Ministry operational control of the CIU and PRUs, rather than their continued subord
