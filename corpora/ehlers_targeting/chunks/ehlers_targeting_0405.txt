Accurate bombing and poor German security measures, such as packing barges together, led to serious losses of landing craft and forced the Germans to disperse the remainder. The PIU interpretation report covering these developments was thus accurate and also forwardlooking in its recogni-  tion that, should the German drive in the east succeed, Bomber Command might have to wage a second barge campaign in 1942.  The PRUs and CIU: Rapid Evolution  As the effort against barges continued, so did bombing of aircraft and oil targets. As the former received progressively less effort with the Battle of Britain winding down, the latter again took center stage.2> Although this first oil offensive will receive attention shortly, we must first return to improvements at the PDU and PIU, which continued their rapid development.  During January 1941, as the first oil offensive began, the PDU and PIU continued evolving. They also received their new titles: Photographic Reconnaissance Units (PRUs) and the Central Interpret- ation Unit (CIU). First-phase interpretation, previously completed at Wembley, was now moved to the three photoreconnaissance flights at Benson, Wick, and St. Eval to keep damage reports moving to the CIU quickly for second-phase interpretation. During this period, the drawing and modeling sections began using aerial photos to produce exceptionally accurate plans, drawings, and scale models of industrial and military installations. These allowed aircrews to improve recognition skills and photointerpreters to track cumulative damage on the diagrams. The CIU also fielded an Intelligence Liaison Section made up of veteran intelligence personnel from all three services, who gave their counterparts in the var
