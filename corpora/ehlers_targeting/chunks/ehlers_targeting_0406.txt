track cumulative damage on the diagrams. The CIU also fielded an Intelligence Liaison Section made up of veteran intelligence personnel from all three services, who gave their counterparts in the various work sections a variety of intelligence reports to help them analyze aerial photos and produce accurate damage assessments.  Perhaps most important, however, was the Instructional Section set up to train new photointerpreters in advanced interpretation before their assignment to CIU duty sections. Every new photointerpreter had to complete a rigorous three-month course, become thoroughly familiar with a CIU-developed photointerpretation handbook, and pass a demanding final exam. Instructors were seasoned photointerpreters, which meant students received training from experts in each area of interest, whether railroads and inland waterways or oil plants and refineries.2Â©  During this period, the CIU changed locations after a German bomb struck the facilities at Wembley, destroying a large quantity of equipment and photos. Several photointerpreters were killed or wounded. At the same time, PRU1 was moving to RAF Benson. To keep the two units adjacent, the CIU began its move to RAF Medmenham on 13 January 1941 and stayed there, with satellite bases at RAF Pinetree and Nuneham Common, for the duration. Fortunately, Medmenham was a large facility and could house the rapidly growing CIU, which soon had over 400 personnel assigned.22 This increase was a response to the insatiable demand for annotated photos and associated interpretation reports at all major military headquarters and civilian economic intelligence agencies. By this time, the PRUs were flying at least seventeen sorties per day, each of which carried F,, cameras capable of taking 125 photographs, meaning interpreters assessed no fewer than 2,125 prints per day.28 Although most of them provided baseline targeting knowledge of economic facilities, an increasing number were damage-assessment photographs.22  In M
