The Air Ministry approved, and the resulting incorporation of army and navy officers into the Duty Section improved the CIU’s efficiency tremendously and prefigured the formation of the Joint Photographic Reconnaissance Center, a joint requirements and collection management unit that directed photoreconnaissance and photointerpretation operations from May 1944 to VE Day. Finally, Tuttle and Riddell pushed hard for Air Ministry operational control of the CIU and PRUs, rather than their continued subordin- ation to Coastal Command. With the invasion threat less severe and the bombing offensive against Germany picking up steam, they believed only the Air Ministry Directorate of Intelligence could be an impartial master. “It is proposed,” they said,  that Interpretation shall become a part of intelligence, and shall take its place as the hand-maiden of the latter.
