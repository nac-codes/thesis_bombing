general statement on the distribution and severity of damage, followed by details on the condition of significant elements of the target, including photographs showing principal points of damage. The printed report followed a teleprinter version highlighting damage done ina raid, which was sent to interested organizations. A supplemental report might also go out within the next few days if new reconnaissance cover or other intelligence brought to light new details.4®  Detailed interpretation reports were based on more thorough analysis. Assessments of urban areas, which by summer 1941 were becoming frequent, included colored graphics depicting previously destroyed areas of cities (shown in blue) and areas destroyed in the most recent raids (shown in red). They also listed individual industrial facilities damaged and details on the extent and nature of the damage. This required photointerpreters to conduct a building-by-building analysis. Detailed interpretation reports also acted as a basis for K Section special reports, often issued in conjunction with MEW and RES, on postraid reconstruction, cumulative damage, and munitions effectiveness assessment.42  Because these reports said much about bombing efficacy, they also had a significant influence on the evolution of bombing policy, doctrine, and strategy. Although the small-scale and sporadic raids, small bombs, and poor accuracy early in the war made K Section’s job appear thankless, interpreters gained valuable experience and were ready, when the bombing effort expanded dramatically in 1942, to meet challenges brought on by city bombing. The addition of American photointerpreters in 1942 also helped ease the personnel tempo associated with this expanded offensive. The most important development, however, was K Section’s increasingly close interaction with MEW and other civilian intelligence agencies. As these relationships strengthened in 1940-1941, they resulted in an increasingly capable air intelligence organi
