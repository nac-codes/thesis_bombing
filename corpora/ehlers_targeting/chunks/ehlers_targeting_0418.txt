ave to work more closely with one another and with plant managers, engineers, and other experts to produce third-phase reports. The CIU provided damage assessments for raids, and MEW studied these reports, over extended periods and in the aggregate, to determine longer-term bombing effects and effectiveness on the Germansâ€™ war economy and morale. Although Research and Experiments Department Eight (RE8) did not come into existence until 1942, it too soon played a key role by providing detailed analyses of damage and poststrike repairs.*4  The CIU office responsible for this interagency coordination was K (Damage Assessment) Section, part of the original PIU in 1940 and augmented in late summer 1941 with the arrival of eight photointerpreters from HQ Bomber Command.

Once mature in 1942, K Section was subdivided into four watches of six to eight people, each of whom produced all immediate interpretation reports, plus a supervision and specialist group of senior interpreters who prepared all Detailed Interpretation Reports and Special Reports.

They consisted of a general statement on the distribution and severity of damage, followed by details on the condition of significant elements of the target, including photographs showing principal points of damage. The printed report followed a teleprinter version highlighting damage done ina raid, which wa
