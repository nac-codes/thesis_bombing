to a framework in which each party knew its “lanes in the road.” This proved vital for the production of target materials and damage assessments.*+  During the first year after their agency’s creation in September 1939, MEW analysts had their hands full determining what exactly the nowdefunct Industrial Intelligence Centre had left them. At the same time, they began building an impressive repertoire of sources, which involved an intensive interaction with businessmen, trade associations, and technicians who had knowledge of German industries. The relative stability of Germany’s war economy early in the war allowed MEW analysts to develop a detailed understanding of each industry and track changes as the war progressed and German industries decentralized. These insights increasingly came from reconnaissance coverage, which corroborated other sources while laying open to MEW analysts virtually every installation of note.  As refugees arrived in Great Britain in the wake of German conquests and shared their expertise, MEW analysts built a deep knowledge of economic assets in occupied countries. Initially, these in- sights proved useful for developing an understanding of the Reich’s aggregate economic assets, but they soon became detailed enough to contribute to target folders and corroborate damage reports.*2  Colonel Vickers, deputy director of MEW, believed that the insights MEW received, and the intelligence produced from them, required a very specialized organization. Accordingly, he structured MEW into several sections in which analysts developed a deep knowledge of specific industries over a period of years. They were thus able to assess the value of new information and update their as- sessments for specific industries. Most analysts had worked, before 1939, in the industries they studied for MEW.**  MEW analysts also proved adept at teasing intelligence from mundane sources. German press articles, for instance, provided detailed information on raw materials sh
