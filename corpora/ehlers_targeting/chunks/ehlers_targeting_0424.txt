industries they studied for MEW.**  MEW analysts also proved adept at teasing intelligence from mundane sources. German press articles, for instance, provided detailed information on raw materials shortages, advertisements for jobs at new plants, and products from various factories. Government representatives of occupied countries provided many insights on their countries’ industries, building on data provided by refugees. MEW’s leadership had an agreement with the Ministry of Home Security allowing their analysts to question all refugees. A similar agreement existed for interrogation of German POWs, who often had economic insights, especially later in the war, as large numbers of skilled workers and technicians were drafted and subsequently captured. MEW representatives in neutral countries also provided intelligence gleaned from businessmen and officials who had dealings with the Reich.*4  Postal, radio, and message intercepts by cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park also proved very useful. The latter were primarily intercepts of shortwave radio communications between industrial firms on the Continent, which provided insights on the flow of components and finished goods, interruptions of deliveries by bombing, progress of repairs at damaged facilities, and the status of construction at new facilities. Of these intercepts, about 5 percent proved useful and 1 percent vital. One such message, received every week from 1940 until summer 1944 through intercepts of unencrypted Ruma- nian cables, provided exact figures on total oil deliveries up the Danube to Germany. It proved very useful as a damage-assessment tool when RAF bombers began mining the river in April 1944.22  To obtain the latest photoreconnaissance coverage, and to build what became a gargantuan set of files including every significant economic concern, MEW analysts developed a close liaison with the assistant director of intelligence for photography and the CIU. This started in late 1940, when MEW began produ
