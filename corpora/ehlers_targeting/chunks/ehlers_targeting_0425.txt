ding every significant economic concern, MEW analysts developed a close liaison with the assistant director of intelligence for photography and the CIU. This started in late 1940, when MEW began producing all economic intelligence for third-phase reports in cooperation with CIU’s D and K Sections. Aerial photos provided crucial details, including the number of hydrogenation stalls at synthetic oil plants, reduction houses at aluminum plants, and assembly sheds at aircraft factories. Photoreconnaissance also worked well in conjunction with agent reports, which provided intelligence such as numbers of employees at a plant, the number working in a particular section, and num- ber of shifts. These sources allowed MEW analysts to assess output at industrial concerns throughout German-controlled Europe.*®  By working closely with their counterparts at the Ministry of Home Security, MEW analysts also gleaned much information from production levels at British factories before and after German attacks, including time required to repair damage. In one of the war’s richer ironies, the British turned bomb damage inflicted on their industries into actionable intelligence, allowing them to esti- mate bomb damage to the Reich.*2  The real payoff came when MEW experts fused intelligence sources to arrive at estimates of aggregate production, the vulnerability of various industries to air attack, and bomb damage. These studies, which relied on CIU damage assessments and other analyses, also resulted in extremely accurate estimates of German oil, locomotive, and tank production. In most cases, they were within 3 to 5 percent of ground truth, a fact made clear in the immediate postwar period as survey teams gained access to German records. The upshot by 1944 was the provision of accurate intelligence to airmen, giving them deep insights on bombing effects and effectiveness.*® The earliest indications of this harmonious relationship were already emerging when Bomber Command began its f
