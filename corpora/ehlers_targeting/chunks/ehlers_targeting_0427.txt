etween industrial firms on the Continent, which provided insights on the flow of components and finished goods, interruptions of deliveries by bombing, progress of repairs at damaged facilities, and the status of construction at new facilities. Of these intercepts, about 5 percent proved useful and 1 percent vital. One such message, received every week from 1940 until summer 1944 through intercepts of unencrypted Ruma- nian cables, provided exact figures on total oil deliveries up the Danube to Germany. It proved very useful as a damage-assessment tool when RAF bombers began mining the river in April 1944.55  To obtain the latest photoreconnaissance coverage, and to build what became a gargantuan set of files including every significant economic concern, MEW analysts developed a close liaison with the assistant director of intelligence for photography and the CIU. This started in late 1940, when MEW began producing all economic intelligence for third-phase reports in cooperation with CIU’s D and K Sections. Aerial photos provided crucial details, including the number of hydrogenation stalls at synthetic oil plants, reduction houses at aluminum plants, and assembly sheds at aircraft factories. Photoreconnaissance also worked well in conjunction with agent reports, which provided intelligence such as numbers of employees at a plant, the number working in a particular section, and num- ber of shifts. These sources allowed MEW analysts to assess output at industrial concerns throughout German-controlled Europe.*®  By working closely with their counterparts at the Ministry of Home Security, MEW analysts also gleaned much information from production levels at British factories before and after German attacks, including time required to repair damage. In one of the war’s richer ironies, the British turned bomb damage inflicted on their industries into actionable intelligence, allowing them to esti- mate bomb damage to the Reich.*2  The real payoff came when MEW experts fus
