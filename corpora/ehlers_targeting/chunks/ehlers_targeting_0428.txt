r ironies, the British turned bomb damage inflicted on their industries into actionable intelligence, allowing them to esti- mate bomb damage to the Reich.*2  The real payoff came when MEW experts fused intelligence sources to arrive at estimates of aggregate production, the vulnerability of various industries to air attack, and bomb damage. These studies, which relied on CIU damage assessments and other analyses, also resulted in extremely accurate estimates of German oil, locomotive, and tank production. In most cases, they were within 3 to 5 percent of ground truth, a fact made clear in the immediate postwar period as survey teams gained access to German records. The upshot by 1944 was the provision of accurate intelligence to airmen, giving them deep insights on bombing effects and effectiveness.*® The earliest indications of this harmonious relationship were already emerging when Bomber Command began its first oil offensive in late 1940.  Planning the First Oil Offensive  The British had long known Germany’s greatest weakness was its shortage of oil. The Germans controlled perhaps 3 percent of world oil production at the start of the war and were never far from serious shortages.*2 As an MEW report emphasized, “No subject in the field of Germany’s economic war effort has received greater attention than her oil industry.”©° Intelligence agencies brought the full range of technical, industrial, and service expertise to bear in determining Germany’s oil position every three months from 1939 to 1945. They benefited from the fact that British and American companies designed, built, and owned many of Germany’s crude oil refineries and synthetic oil plants before the war. Anglo-American technical experts visited these facilities frequently before 1939, and many plants were insured by British or American companies. Consequently, a wealth of knowledge was available, including plans, diagrams, photographs, key statistics, and the processes used at synthetic oil plants us
