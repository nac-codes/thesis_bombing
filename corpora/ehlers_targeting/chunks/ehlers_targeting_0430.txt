The Lloyd committee reported to a cabinet body known as the Hankey Committee on Preventing Oil from Reaching Germany, chaired by Lord Hankey. Its job was “to keep under review the action being taken to prevent oil supplies from reaching enemy powers and the organization required for this purpose,” a thankless task given Britain’s inability to stop Rumanian and (before 22 June 1941) Russian supplies from reaching Germany. In March 1942, the Hankey and Lloyd committees were disbanded. Sir Harold Hartley’s technical experts and analysts were placed under the Joint Intelligence Subcommittee and renamed the Technical Subcommittee on Axis Oil.®  Tha Tachninral Gaiheammittaa an Avice Oil nradiucod autetandina accacemante a fant eanfirmoad hu Titra intarrante (Carman ail nlant manacare 100d Titra ta eammuiunicata acnacially anca hamhinag  Page 99 of 423 25%  at new facilities. Of these intercepts, about 5 percent proved useful and 1 percent vital. One such message, received every week from 1940 until summer 1944 through intercepts of unencrypted Ruma- nian cables, provided exact figures on total oil deliveries up the Danube to Germany. It proved very useful as a damage-assessment tool when RAF bombers began mining the river in April 1944.22  To obtain the latest photoreconnaissance coverage, and to build what became a gargantuan set of files including every significant economic concern, MEW analysts developed a close liaison with the assistant director of intelligence for photography and the CIU. This started in late 1940, when MEW began producing all economic intelligence for third-phase reports in cooperation with CIU’s D and K Sections. Aerial photos provided crucial details, including the number of hydrogenation stalls at synthetic oil plants, reduction houses at aluminum plants, and assembly sheds at aircraft factories. Photoreconnaissance also worked well in conjunction with agent reports, which provided intelligence such as numbers of employees at a plant, the number
