lants, and assembly sheds at aircraft factories. Photoreconnaissance also worked well in conjunction with agent reports, which provided intelligence such as numbers of employees at a plant, the number working in a particular section, and num- ber of shifts. These sources allowed MEW analysts to assess output at industrial concerns throughout German-controlled Europe.*®  By working closely with their counterparts at the Ministry of Home Security, MEW analysts also gleaned much information from production levels at British factories before and after German attacks, including time required to repair damage. In one of the war’s richer ironies, the British turned bomb damage inflicted on their industries into actionable intelligence, allowing them to esti- mate bomb damage to the Reich.*2  The real payoff came when MEW experts fused intelligence sources to arrive at estimates of aggregate production, the vulnerability of various industries to air attack, and bomb damage. These studies, which relied on CIU damage assessments and other analyses, also resulted in extremely accurate estimates of German oil, locomotive, and tank production. In most cases, they were within 3 to 5 percent of ground truth, a fact made clear in the immediate postwar period as survey teams gained access to German records. The upshot by 1944 was the provision of accurate intelligence to airmen, giving them deep insights on bombing effects and effectiveness.*® The earliest indications of this harmonious relationship were already emerging when Bomber Command began its first oil offensive in late 1940.  Planning the First Oil Offensive  The British had long known Germany’s greatest weakness was its shortage of oil. The Germans controlled perhaps 3 percent of world oil production at the start of the war and were never far from serious shortages.*2 As an MEW report emphasized, “No subject in the field of Germany’s economic war effort has received greater attention than her oil industry.”© Intelligence a
