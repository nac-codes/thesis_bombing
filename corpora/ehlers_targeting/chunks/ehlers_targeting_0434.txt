among the most useful of which were cables between oil plants and Reich offices concerned with oil matters.  As it became available in increasing quantities, photoreconnaissance provided vital insights by corroborating other sources and providing imagery of every new oil plant and refinery in German- occupied Europe. This allowed intelligence analysts to determine each plant’s dimensions and layout. CIU photointerpreters then worked with MEW analysts to determine product output and, once the major oil offensive began in April 1944, reductions in output and likely duration of repairs. Aerial photos also allowed interpreters to determine German procedures for shipping oil and fuel to depots. Beginning in spring 1940, interpretation reports provided precise information on depots, including the number and capacity of storage tanks, and the amount of oil stored there. Given the size of major synthetic oil plants, they were even easier to locate than depots and impossible to hide, move, or disperse. The same was true of drilling operations for crude oil and construction of refineries, which gave analysts a clear idea of production at each location.  mie 7 a, a a 2 SS ce oe ccc eannee eee  Page 101 of 423 26%  aiso KneW Now iiimMited Gerinafl Ou reserves were ill iyo7, NOW much ou they acquired witi each hew annexation or conquest, and thererore what tie entire Oli position i00Ked ike, Taking 1tO account all production sources, including Ploesti-©  Interagency oil reports averaged 500 to 600 per week. Several agencies produced them, including MEW and the Lloyd committee. This committee, formed at the request of Chiefs of Staff in October 1939 under the chairmanship of Geoffrey Lloyd, secretary of mines, kept the German oil position under continuous review. Members included the directors of intelligence from all three services; representatives from the foreign office, MEW, the prime minister’s office, and the Petroleum Department; and civilian oil experts.
