seven days, when damaged plants would resume production.®®  From the earliest days of the war, oil experts tracked oil production, the capture of additional stocks, and fuel used in major operations. MEW analysts correctly assessed that heavy fuel consumption on the Eastern Front in 1942-1943, when combined with a large number of new economy measures in the Reich picked up by Ultra and other sources, signaled the impending depletion of oil reserves.S2  One of the crucial ironies of the oil offensives, the first (1940-1941) small and unsuccessful, and the second (1944-1945) vitally important, was that the earlier campaign made the Germans complacent, leading them to forego dispersal and hardening efforts until the great storm was upon them. Also, they had no incentive to erect new refineries because until May 1944, refinery capacity was greatly in excess of available crude. Another vulnerability was the German practice of augmenting fuel supplies heavily with benzol, alcohol, producer gas, and bottled butane as vehicle fuel. Benzol is a by-product of the carbonizing of coal by coke ovens and gasworks. Because intelligence personnel had located every benzol plant in German-occupied Europe, they knew the maximum output and recommended the twenty largest plants for attack by January 1945. Intelligence specialists also pinpointed production sources for alcohol and blending agents by 1942. Most were pro- duced at Bergius plants, making them vital targets.  This effort, augmented by industry expertise and confirmed by photo reconnaissance cover, Ultra intercepts, and other sources, led to a good understanding of Germany’s oil industry by 1941, anda deep one by 1943. It provided the underpinnings for a sound targeting effort in 1940-1941 and a superb one in 1944. The key difference was a lack of capable bombers, bombsights, navigational tech- niques, bombing tactics, and effective munitions in 1940-1941.S2  Discussions regarding oil attacks began in 1939, when Bomber Comma
