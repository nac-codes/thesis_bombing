tutes mixed with fuel. They also published information on producer-gas vehicles. This provided key information on the importance of benzol, which led to concerted bombing of Ruhr benzol plants.©  Thousands of oil assessments focused on production, consumption, reserves, and damage. Technical experts thus knew where each plant’s vital components were, whether they had been hit, and whether, given the presence or absence of steam emissions, a plant was out of commission or operating at reduced or full capacity. The quantity and location of steam emissions also told photointer- preters, within plus or minus seven days, when damaged plants would resume production.®©  From the earliest days of the war, oil experts tracked oil production, the capture of additional stocks, and fuel used in major operations. MEW analysts correctly assessed that heavy fuel consumption on the Eastern Front in 1942-1943, when combined with a large number of new economy measures in the Reich picked up by Ultra and other sources, signaled the impending depletion of oil reserves.S2  One of the crucial ironies of the oil offensives, the first (1940-1941) small and unsuccessful, and the second (1944-1945) vitally important, was that the earlier campaign made the Germans complacent, leading them to forego dispersal and hardening efforts until the great storm was upon them. Also, they had no incentive to erect new refineries because until May 1944, refinery capacity was greatly in excess of available crude. Another vulnerability was the German practice of augmenting fuel supplies heavily with benzol, alcohol, producer gas, and bottled butane as vehicle fuel. Benzol is a by-product of the carbonizing of coal by coke ovens and gasworks. Because intelligence personnel had located every benzol plant in German-occupied Europe, they knew the maximum output and recommended the twenty largest plants for attack by January 1945. Intelligence specialists also pinpointed production sources for alcohol and blend
