an-occupied Europe, they knew the maximum output and recommended the twenty largest plants for attack by January 1945. Intelligence specialists also pinpointed production sources for alcohol and blending agents by 1942. Most were pro- duced at Bergius plants, making them vital targets.®  This effort, augmented by industry expertise and confirmed by photo reconnaissance cover, Ultra intercepts, and other sources, led to a good understanding of Germany’s oil industry by 1941, anda deep one by 1943. It provided the underpinnings for a sound targeting effort in 1940-1941 and a superb one in 1944. The key difference was a lack of capable bombers, bombsights, navigational tech- niques, bombing tactics, and effective munitions in 1940-1941.  Discussions regarding oil attacks began in 1939, when Bomber Command officers discussed the feasibility of raiding depots, synthetic oil plants, and oil refineries in range of medium bombers. Discussions were based on Bomber Command Operation Order No. 11, which posited an oil offensive and provided target types, vulnerabilities, and optimum attack methods. Gordon Bell, a petroleum expert with the Anglo-American Oil Company, augmented this intelligence with data on Hamburg’s refineries and photographs of oil plants and depots in the United Kingdom in an effort to assist with oil raids.22  By October 1939, the Air Ministry joined these discussions, providing insights on key components of Bergius plants, including hydrogenation stalls, water-gas units, carbon monoxide conversion plants, and sulfur purification works, which together presented a target about 40 acres in size. Vital components at Fischer-Tropsch plants included their water-gas units, carbon monoxide conversion plant, sulfur purification works, contact oven house, and condensers. The distillation and cracking plants at both types of facilities were also vital, but for production of fuel rather than of oil from coal. Equally vulnerable were overhead pipes for conveying steam
