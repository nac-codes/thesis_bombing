pse oil tanks and the second to ignite spilled oil. By No- vember 1939, Bottomley was referring to “our oil plan” in an internal Bomber Command minute. The first oil raids were not long in coming.  Executing and Assessing the First Oil Offensive  The focus of this first oil offensive, which ran intermittently from May 1940 to March 1941, was ostensibly on oil, but the excessive dispersion of effort on many target sets, including aircraft, aluminum, chemicals and explosives, electric power, iron and steel, and shipbuilding, ensured that Bomber Command’s limited assets produced meager results. The profound discouragement caused by these results and the requirement to attack barges in the Channel ports led to the gradual abandonment of this first effort. However, in the process, the British learned much about the value and use of intelligence sources.  The effort against oil and the many other targets during this period was in essence an attempt at “night precision” bombing. Heavy losses in daylight raids during 1939-1940 accelerated the shift to night bombing begun with the disaster at Heligoland Bight in December 1939. The problems with this approach, from an air intelligence perspective, were significant. Strike photographs produced nothing but a series of bright dots, blobs, and lines representing flares, bomb hits, fires, tracers, and the flight paths of damaged bombers. Learning to decipher this information took time, and it was not until late 1941 that such a capability developed in the new Night Sections at CIU and HQ Bomber Command. In addition, pilots’ reports proved to be wildly optimistic.  Unfortunately, the PDU and PIU were not yet mature enough to provide regular poststrike reconnaissance because the handful of PDU Spitfires stayed fully employed in the reconnaissance of Channel ports. Consequently, intelligence available for early oil raids included that used in World War I: pilots’ debriefings, agent reports, and inputs from neutral parties. An overly
