Dewdney’s work.  Equally important was Dewdney’s analysis of damage required to destroy oil targets. He estimated weight of attack required for 75 percent destruction of an average crude refinery at 70 tons of bombs, and 120 tons for a synthetic oil plant. He used existing reports, with their meager complement of aerial photographs, to infer loss of output at synthetic oil plants to date at 100,000 tons, and concluded that plants thus far attacked were between 58 and 80 percent undamaged. He also assumed a 300-yard average bomb aiming error and a repair rate of 6.7 percent per month. Although his figures were unduly optimistic, Dewdney’s methodology was sound. These tentative efforts provided the first clear indication that damage assessments would improve over time with the use of quantitative analysis based on increasingly detailed data.7® Also crucial to later bombing campaigns was Dewdney’s conclusion that “for a given number of bombs, loss of output is caused most effectively by putting on the heaviest possible attack in the shortest time, rather than by nibbling at short intervals at the target ... it is clear that one heavy attack causes a considerably greater loss of output due to loss of cavacitv than a number of smaller ones with the same total of bombs over the same period of time.”  Page 104 of 423 27%  Unfortunately, the PDU and PIU were not yet mature enough to provide regular poststrike reconnaissance because the handful of PDU Spitfires stayed fully employed in the reconnaissance of Channel ports. Consequently, intelligence available for early oil raids included that used in World War I: pilots’ debriefings, agent reports, and inputs from neutral parties. An overly optimistic view thus prevailed, with MEW reports often listing virtually every target as having been hit. In one such report, of the twenty-two oil targets attacked by at least one bomber during the period 29 July to 11 August, including fourteen crude oil refineries and eight oil plants,
