itish industries as a comparative baseline for providing detailed assessments for bombing raids and studies tracking the status of repairs. This development, of fundamental importance to the creation of a mature air intelligence organization, is attributable almost entirely to Dewdney’s work.  Equally important was Dewdney’s analysis of damage required to destroy oil targets. He estimated weight of attack required for 75 percent destruction of an average crude refinery at 70 tons of bombs, and 120 tons for a synthetic oil plant. He used existing reports, with their meager complement of aerial photographs, to infer loss of output at synthetic oil plants to date at 100,000 tons, and concluded that plants thus far attacked were between 58 and 80 percent undamaged. He also assumed a 300-yard average bomb aiming error and a repair rate of 6.7 percent per month. Although his figures were unduly optimistic, Dewdney’s methodology was sound. These tentative efforts provided the first clear indication that damage assessments would improve over time with the use of quantitative analysis based on increasingly detailed data.2 Also crucial to later bombing campaigns was Dewdney’s conclusion that “for a given number of bombs, loss of output is caused most effectively by putting on the heaviest possible attack in the shortest time, rather than by nibbling at short intervals at the target . . . it is clear that one heavy attack causes a considerably greater loss of output due to loss of capacity than a number of smaller ones with the same total of bombs over the same period of time.”  This also lent credence to Dewdney’s argument for using larger bombs. He later optimistically posited that between 5,000 and 6,800 500-pound bombs would shut down all of Germany’s synthetic oil plants. A more fundamental observation—and a correct one—was that taking out any of an oil plant’s key elements would shut it down for weeks or months. This result would be feasible only if bombers concentrated
