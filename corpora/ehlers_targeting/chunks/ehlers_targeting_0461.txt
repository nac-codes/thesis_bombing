and fall 1940 revealed so little damage. Small wonder Dewdney called for larger-scale attacks, concentrated on a few high-value oil targets, using larger bombs.&+  Dispersion also caused damage-assessment problems. Although by the late 1940 the establishment for night-capable strike cameras was 4 per squadron (and hence 168 for the forty-two squadrons then in service), there were only 22 cameras available.®2 Given the dispersion of bombing effort and small numbers of cameras, bomber crews collected few strike photos. Even when they were available, analytical techniques were still in their infancy. Flying night missions also made visual observation difficult. Consequently, the effort devolved largely to guesswork, unless reconnaissance  Page 107 of 423 28%  ee ee ~  This also lent credence to Dewdney’ 'S argument for using larger bombs. He later optimistically posited that between 5,000 and 6,800 500-pound bombs would shut down all of Germany’s synthetic oil plants. A more fundamental observation—and a correct one—was that taking out any of an oil plant’s key elements would shut it down for weeks or months. This result would be feasible only if bombers concentrated on one plant until it was destroyed, then moved to the next one. Persistence was vital. Dewdney closed with three observations. First, he said, synthetic oil plants were the most vulnerable of all industrial targets and the most important to Germany’s war effort. Second, dispersion of German bombers into small formations during attacks on British targets showed the ineffectiveness of such an approach, meaning dispersion of British bombers into small packets (which, as we shall see, reached absurd levels during fall 1940) should stop immediately. Third, concerted attacks were crucial for bombing effectiveness. If Bomber Command followed his program, Dewdney said, it would deprive the Germans of 1 million tons of oil in the next six months.£2  Dewdney’s efforts, although insightful, suffered from errors in
