If Bomber Command followed his program, Dewdney said, it would deprive the Germans of 1 million tons of oil in the next six months.£2  Dewdney’s efforts, although insightful, suffered from errors in analysis, largely as a result of the absence of photoreconnaissance cover and other sources. He labored under much less propitious conditions for producing damage assessments than he and his successors did later. Dewdney also fell into the trap of assuming that bombers were navigating effectively to their targets and dropping bombs with an average error of 300 yards—a fantasy figure dramatically better than even the best aircrews achieved, on average, during the war’s final year. Dewdney’s estimates for bomb tonnage were also a fraction of what was ultimately required. Still, he had many useful insights, and he would bring them up again, later in the war, to much greater effect.  In the meantime, Bomber Command’s leaders made their aircraft as ineffective as possible by spreading them across multiple target sets in tiny numbers—often one or two bombers—even though their operational directive still made oil the number one priority. During the seventeen-day period between 23 August and 8 September 1940, for instance, British bombers carried out thirty-one attacks against twenty different oil targets, including seven synthetic oil plants, four crude oil refineries, and nine oil storage depots. However, they also made fifty-seven attacks on thirty-five other targets, including eight aircraft factories, one aluminum plant, five chemical and explosives plants, five natural gas and coke-oven targets, seven electric plants and transformer stations, two iron and steel plants, three shipbuilding targets, and four engineering firms. Of these raids, thirty-five were made by one bomber, ten by two bombers, and another nine by three bombers. Most of the rest were made by four to six aircraft. Only seven raids involved ten or more bombers, the largest with twenty. Because each medium
