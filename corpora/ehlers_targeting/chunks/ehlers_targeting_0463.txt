ten by two bombers, and another nine by three bombers. Most of the rest were made by four to six aircraft. Only seven raids involved ten or more bombers, the largest with twenty. Because each medium bomber carried only 2,500 pounds of bombs, attacked at night, and had rudimentary navigation systems and bombsights, it becomes clear why the first effective poststrike photos taken in summer and fall 1940 revealed so little damage. Small wonder Dewdney called for larger-scale attacks, concentrated on a few high-value oil targets, using larger bombs.&+  Dispersion also caused damage-assessment problems. Although by the late 1940 the establishment for night-capable strike cameras was 4 per squadron (and hence 168 for the forty-two squadrons then in service), there were only 22 cameras available.®* Given the dispersion of bombing effort and small numbers of cameras, bomber crews collected few strike photos. Even when they were available, analytical techniques were still in their infancy. Flying night missions also made visual observation difficult. Consequently, the effort devolved largely to guesswork, unless reconnaissance Spitfires, still few in number, obtained poststrike cover. Here again, dissipation of bombing effort proved problematic because the sixteen Spitfires then in service could not possibly cover all targets struck.  Still, it gradually became obvious that most aircrews were not putting bombs anywhere near their targets. On New Year’s Day, 1941, Dewdney sent Air Chief Marshal Peirse a discouraging note about the effects of raids on oil targets. “Both P.I.U. and ourselves,” Dewdney said, “therefore agree that only minor damage is visible at Scholven and Gelsenkirchen. ... These disappointing results are unexpected since Scholven and Gelsenkirchen are the two synthetic oil plants most heavily attacked to date.”®4 Dewdney had previously assessed Scholven at 40 percent damaged and Gelsenkirchen at 10 percent. Both these figures were too optimistic, the one for
