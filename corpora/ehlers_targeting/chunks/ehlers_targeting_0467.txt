his was standard practice even if it was thought that no damage had occurred. British photointerpreters, who took plant shutdowns as a sign of serious damage, did not dis- cover their error until 1942.82  On the other hand, Dewdney and photointerpreters at the PIU did get some important things right early on, such as recognition of the “exceptional efficiency” of German salvage and reconstruction crews, which “are extremely well organized and plentifully supplied with equipment and material. This will clearly have to be taken into account in estimating the probable duration of partial damage to industrial plants.”®2 Ironically, if the British knew just how efficient repair crews were, how poor their bombing was, how far off the mark their early damage assessments were, and how badly their dispersion of effort undermined effectiveness, they might have given up altogether. Fortunately, they did not. And through this first phase of the bombing effort, air intelligence skills improved rap- idly, as did the ability to make reasoned judgments about bombing’s effects and effectiveness.®2  What the British needed in their arsenal was an adequate number of highaltitude, long-range reconnaissance aircraft, improved aerial cameras, and an organization devoted entirely to interpreting aerial photos. Only this would provide an accurate picture of the German war economy and the damage bombing did to it. These capabilities were well on the way to maturity at the PDU and PIU. Ironically, the much more accurate and voluminous poststrike photos and reports delivered during 1941—once there were three Spitfire photoreconnaissance squadrons in action—provided a severe jolt to senior leaders, leading them away from “precision” bombing and decisively toward nighttime city bombing.
