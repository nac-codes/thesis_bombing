SHIFT TO NIGHT AREA BOMBING  Air Intelligence, Doctrinal Evolution, and Operational Change, 1941-1942  The First Oil Offensive Fails  The end of the invasion threat in October 1940, combined with worsening weather, marked the beginning of Bomber Command’s gradual move toward city bombing. Air Ministry directives continued to give oil top priority, but the dispersion of effort persisted. In January 1941, as additional reconnaissance Spitfires provided poststrike photos and as photointerpreters at the Photographic Inter- pretation Unit improved their damage-assessment skills, their reports painted a bleak picture of bombing accuracy. The vast majority of crews dropped bombs thousands of feet from the target. Early 1941 also produced an operational crisis as aircrews struggled to learn better navigation techniques and waited for the promised “heavies”: four-engine bombers, the first of which, the Short Stirling  T arrived in crrmmar 1041 Tactical nrahlame shaundad Althaiuch dacrtrina otill eallod far davlicht hambhina daw raide had all hist eancad hiv 1041 Aireraure flaur mara nicht raide at firet haninea vainly  Page 107 of 423 28%  struck.8  Still, it gradually became obvious that most aircrews were not putting bombs anywhere near their targets. On New Year’s Day, 1941, Dewdney sent Air Chief Marshal Peirse a discouraging note about the effects of raids on oil targets. “Both P.I.U. and ourselves,” Dewdney said, “therefore agree that only minor damage is visible at Scholven and Gelsenkirchen. ... These disappointing results are unexpected since Scholven and Gelsenkirchen are the two synthetic oil plants most heavily attacked to date.”®4 Dewdney had previously assessed Scholven at 40 percent damaged and Gelsenkirchen at 10 percent. Both these figures were too optimistic, the one for Scholven wildly so. Dewdney concluded somberly that “from the photographs it is evident that a large proportion of the bombs reported as having been dropped over the targets were in fact d
