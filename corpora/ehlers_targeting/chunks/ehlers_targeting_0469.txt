the one for Scholven wildly so. Dewdney concluded somberly that “from the photographs it is evident that a large proportion of the bombs reported as having been dropped over the targets were in fact dropped elsewhere.”®= Dewdney did not quantify what “elsewhere” meant, but as the Butt report showed eight months later, it meant 1 to 8 miles from the target, with 80 percent of all aircrews dropping bombs over 5 miles away. The point here is not that the raids did nothing—in several cases they did moderate damage—but that they were made by small numbers of aircraft, not repeated with any regularity, and in most cases missed, with bombs landing on decoys or in the countryside.®6  Photointerpreters also missed some basic things at this stage. For instance, the Germans routinely shut down their oil and other industrial plants after air raids to assess damage and clean up flammable-liquid spills. This was standard practice even if it was thought that no damage had occurred. British photointerpreters, who took plant shutdowns as a sign of serious damage, did not dis- cover their error until 1942.82  On the other hand, Dewdney and photointerpreters at the PIU did get some important things right early on, such as recognition of the “exceptional efficiency” of German salvage and reconstruction crews, which “are extremely well organized and plentifully supplied with equipment and material. This will clearly have to be taken into account in estimating the probable duration of partial damage to industrial plants.”®2 Ironically, if the British knew just how efficient repair crews were, how poor their bombing was, how far off the mark their early damage assessments were, and how badly their dispersion of effort undermined effectiveness, they might have given up altogether. Fortunately, they did not. And through this first phase of the bombing effort, air intelligence skills improved rap- idly, as did the ability to make reasoned judgments about bombing’s effects and effectiveness.®
