they did not. And through this first phase of the bombing effort, air intelligence skills improved rap- idly, as did the ability to make reasoned judgments about bombing’s effects and effectiveness.®2  What the British needed in their arsenal was an adequate number of highaltitude, long-range reconnaissance aircraft, improved aerial cameras, and an organization devoted entirely to interpreting aerial photos. Only this would provide an accurate picture of the German war economy and the damage bombing did to it. These capabilities were well on the way to maturity at the PDU and PIU. Ironically, the much more accurate and voluminous poststrike photos and reports delivered during 1941—once there were three Spitfire photoreconnaissance squadrons in action—provided a severe jolt to senior leaders, leading them away from “precision” bombing and decisively toward nighttime city bombing.  SEVEN  THE SHIFT TO NIGHT AREA BOMBING  Air Intelligence, Doctrinal Evolution, and Operational Change, 1941-1942  The First Oil Offensive Fails  The end of the invasion threat in October 1940, combined with worsening weather, marked the beginning of Bomber Command's gradual move toward city bombing. Air Ministry directives continued to give oil top priority, but the dispersion of effort persisted. In January 1941, as additional reconnaissance Spitfires provided poststrike photos and as photointerpreters at the Photographic Inter- pretation Unit improved their damage-assessment skills, their reports painted a bleak picture of bombing accuracy. The vast majority of crews dropped bombs thousands of feet from the target. Early 1941 also produced an operational crisis as aircrews struggled to learn better navigation techniques and waited for the promised “heavies”: four-engine bombers, the first of which, the Short Stirling I, arrived in summer 1941. Tactical problems abounded. Although doctrine still called for daylight bombing, day raids had all but ceased by 1941. Aircrews flew more night ra
