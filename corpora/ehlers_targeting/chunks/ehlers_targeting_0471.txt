which, the Short Stirling I, arrived in summer 1941. Tactical problems abounded. Although doctrine still called for daylight bombing, day raids had all but ceased by 1941. Aircrews flew more night raids, at first hoping vainly to conduct “precision” attacks, and then turned to city raids. All the while, intelligence capabilities evolved to assess the effects of these new tactics, but with city bombing, their efficacy ran into ser- ious and often insurmountable obstacles.+  By January 1941, the Chiefs of Staff (COS) were alarmed at a dissipation of effort in Bomber Command. On the basis of recommendations in the 5th Report of the Lloyd committee, the COS argued in favor of an air offensive against oil, or, alternatively, city bombing. Emphasizing a need for the “greatest possible economy of force” given the scarcity of bombers, they supported concerted oil raids. On the basis of Lloyd committee and Joint Intelligence Subcommittee analyses pointing to oil as the critical target set, the COS believed attacks on the seventeen largest oil plants would pay the great-  Page 110 of 423 28%  THE SHIFT TO NIGHT AREA BOMBING  Air Intelligence, Doctrinal Evolution, and Operational Change, 1941-1942  The First Oil Offensive Fails  The end of the invasion threat in October 1940, combined with worsening weather, marked the beginning of Bomber Command’s gradual move toward city bombing. Air Ministry directives continued to give oil top priority, but the dispersion of effort persisted. In January 1941, as additional reconnaissance Spitfires provided poststrike photos and as photointerpreters at the Photographic Inter- pretation Unit improved their damage-assessment skills, their reports painted a bleak picture of bombing accuracy. The vast majority of crews dropped bombs thousands of feet from the target. Early 1941 also produced an operational crisis as aircrews struggled to learn better navigation techniques and waited for the promised “heavies”: four-engine bombers, the first of
