On the basis of recommendations in the 5th Report of the Lloyd committee, the COS argued in favor of an air offensive against oil, or, alternatively, city bombing. Emphasizing a need for the “greatest possible economy of force” given the scarcity of bombers, they supported concerted oil raids. On the basis of Lloyd committee and Joint Intelligence Subcommittee analyses pointing to oil as the critical target set, the COS believed attacks on the seventeen largest oil plants would pay the great- est dividends and might reduce German oil production by 83 percent after four months.?  The chiefs called for immediate oil raids to take advantage of the long winter nights but hedged their bets by proposing a secondary target: morale. They said oil attacks would have some effect on morale simply because some plants were in or near urban areas, which meant stray bombs could strike residential areas. Further, they said all bombers were to have alternate targets in urban areas, in- cluding industries and marshaling yards. Given the still-rudimentary state of navigation instruments and bombsights, these were de facto area targets.  The COS also mentioned another means of getting at German oil supplies: an attack on the eleven crude oil refineries around the Rumanian town of Ploesti, which by this time supplied over a third of Germany’s oil. They recognized the importance of Rumanian oil but concluded that “although the stoppage of Roumanian supplies would be the biggest single blow to the German oil position the destruction of his synthetic oil plants in Germany alone would bring about a crisis... . The interruption of Roumanian supplies, in addition to the destruction of the synthetic oil plants might render Germany impotent before the end of 1941.”4 Aside from the fact that the British lacked the bombers to
