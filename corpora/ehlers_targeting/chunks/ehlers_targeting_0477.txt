n Hannover the night of 10-11 February was the largest attack to date.£ The first development was driven by a directive to Air Chief Marshal Peirse, head of Bomber Command, to get after oil targets. The second—larger-scale raids—was significant because it indicated Peirse was listening to Dewdney, Photographic Interpretation Unit photointerpreters, and Ministry of Economic Warfare (MEW) oil analysts, all of whom agreed that poststrike photographs and damage assessments made clear the importance of massing large numbers of bombers over each target.  Emerging Realities, Changing Priorities  After March 1941, attacks on oil diminished. One of the biggest contributing factors was the German conquest of Greece in April, which negated the Ploesti option. Another was the continuing habit of spreading bombers too thin, this time by adding transportation attacks in the Ruhr to oil and naval targets. A third, and vital, factor was the success of city bombing, which increased dramatically as a result of a new directive to assist with the Battle of the Atlantic. This included large raids on port cities such as Hamburg, Bremen, Wilhelmshaven, and Kiel and major U-boat bases such as Brest and Lorient. Two such raids on Kiel (7-8 and 8-9 April 1941) caused the greatest damage to date, all clearly visible on photographs of excellent quality. This convinced Portal, already sour on the oil cam- paign, that city bombing was Bomber Command’s only near-term operational hope.?  When Lord Hankey, whose committees were in charge of tracking the German oil position, pressed for continuing oil attacks, Portal demurred, saying “any diversion on to oil targets would result in a complete waste of bombing effort and would, from the strategic aspect, be quite unjustifiable.”/° Increasing numbers of good damage assessments played a key role here. Portal continued with an observation that “it was useless to attack pin-point targets such as the synthetic oil plants except on clear moonlight nights.
