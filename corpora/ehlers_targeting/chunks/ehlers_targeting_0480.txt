assist with the Battle of the Atlantic. This included large raids on port cities such as Hamburg, Bremen, Wilhelmshaven, and Kiel and major U-boat bases such as Brest and Lorient. Two such raids on Kiel (7-8 and 8-9 April 1941) caused the greatest damage to date, all clearly visible on photographs of excellent quality. This convinced Portal, already sour on the oil cam- paign, that city bombing was Bomber Command’s only near-term operational hope.?  When Lord Hankey, whose committees were in charge of tracking the German oil position, pressed for continuing oil attacks, Portal demurred, saying “any diversion on to oil targets would result in a complete waste of bombing effort and would, from the strategic aspect, be quite unjustifiable.”° Increasing numbers of good damage assessments played a key role here. Portal continued with an observation that “it was useless to attack pin-point targets such as the synthetic oil plants except on clear moonlight nights. There was an average of only four per month.” Finally, Portal was discouraged by the estimate—too high, as it turned out—that oil attacks had reduced output by perhaps 5 percent. He ended with this thought: “Although the destruction of synthetic oil plants was strategically desirable, they were not objectives which were tactically vulnerable.”14 The following week, he firmly and finally rejected Hankey’s plea to continue the oil campaign.12  At the same time, Peirse was struggling with another serious concern: his inability to obtain sufficient poststrike photographs and damage assessments. Peirse pleaded with the secretary of state for air for an expert to help his intelligence officers with damage assessments.42 Air Vice Marshal Norman Bottomley, recently made deputy chief of the air staff, released E. D. Brant of the Railroad Re- search Service on a part-time basis, but only when it did not interfere with his interagency efforts in London.4  Peirse was resolved to improve Bomber Command’s Intelligence Directo
