the Railroad Re- search Service on a part-time basis, but only when it did not interfere with his interagency efforts in London.4  Peirse was resolved to improve Bomber Command’s Intelligence Directorate and enlarge it to the point where it could provide all required analyses. This forceful if unrealistic attitude was a result of Peirse’s frustrations with the Air Ministry, which he felt produced rudimentary target dossiers lacking detailed insights, and with the Central Interpretation Unit (CIU), which he thought provided too few damage reports—a problem soon resolved but at the time a major source of frustration. These concerns led Peirse to establish a large Bomber Command air intelligence capability, at first in competition with the CIU but later working in coordination with it. The division of labor brought on by this evolving relationship included Bomber Command responsibility for building detailed tar- get dossiers with all available CIU damage assessments and other materials. The CIU continued producing damage assessments, sharing the process for night raids with Bomber Command.*  By mid-1941 the photographic development units (PRUs) and CIU were maturing. The arrival of eight photointerpreters from Bomber Command to augment K (Damage) Section provided a major boost in experience, especially for interpretation of night photographs. Bomber Command’s Directorate of Intelligence had advanced this process since the first night strike photos, produced in May 1940, provided clues but also mysteries about bombing accuracy and effects. During the succeeding year, photointerpreters at Bomber Command and the CIU worked hard to solve these mysteries. By summer 1941, they could tell where bombs were falling, how decoy fires affected accuracy, and the degree to which the position of each aircraft in the bomber stream affected its accuracy. The latter revealed a tendency for bombs to creep back from aim points. As fires spread, aircrews toward the back of the bomber stre
