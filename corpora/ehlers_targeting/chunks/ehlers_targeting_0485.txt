a target-marking capability embodied in what came to be known as Pathfinder Force. These elite crews, brought together in August 1942, received special training to drop target-marking flares of various colors, guiding the main force to target. Cherwell also advocated rapid fielding of Gee, a radio aid to bombing and navigation that allowed aircrews to drop ordnance at the intersection of radio beams coming from transmitting stations in Great Britain. Although by no means a precision capability in its own right, Gee (and later Oboe) allowed Pathfinder Force to find cities and drop flares for the main body of bombers. Gee therefore allowed an unprecedented concentration of bombs around aim points. Cherwell also played a role in another development arising from Butt’s work: the creation of Bomber Command’s Operational Research Section in September 1941 to study bombing accuracy and to devise material and procedural innovations to improve it.12  Churchill directed his ire at Portal, sending him a minute on the Butt report, saying: “This is a very serious paper, and seems to require your most urgent attention. I await your proposals for action.’ When Portal responded that it would take a force of 4,000 heavy bombers six months to destroy the German war economy, Churchill lashed out, saying, “It is very disputable whether bombing by itself will be a decisive factor in the present war. On the contrary, all that we have learnt since the war began shows that its effects, both physical and moral, are greatly exaggerated. The most we can say is that it will be a heavy and I trust a seriously increasing annoyance.”2! The COS weighed in with an argument that the weakest point in the German war machine was morale.2? Portal also reminded Churchill of the COS statement that  »20  it is in bombing, ona scale undreamed of in the last war, that we find the new weapon on which we must principally depend for the destruction of economic life and morale. ...
