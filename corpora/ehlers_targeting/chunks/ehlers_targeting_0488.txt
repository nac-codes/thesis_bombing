l haze, and moon state. The worst accuracy was against the Ruhr, which was often covered in haze, where only one in ten sorties bombed within 5 miles of the target. During full-moon periods, the figure was two in five, but during the new moon, only one in fifteen.12  The report produced a firm resolve to fix the problem. Lord Cherwell, in a memo to Churchill, said, “It makes depressing reading.”12 He emphasized the “supreme importance of improving our navigational methods,” pushing for development of a target-marking capability embodied in what came to be known as Pathfinder Force. These elite crews, brought together in August 1942, received special training to drop target-marking flares of various colors, guiding the main force to target. Cherwell also advocated rapid fielding of Gee, a radio aid to bombing and navigation that allowed aircrews to drop ordnance at the intersection of radio beams coming from transmitting stations in Great Britain. Although by no means a precision capability in its own right, Gee (and later Oboe) allowed Pathfinder Force to find cities and drop flares for the main body of bombers. Gee therefore allowed an unprecedented concentration of bombs around aim points. Cherwell also played a role in another development arising from Butt’s work: the creation of Bomber Command’s Operational Research Section in September 1941 to study bombing accuracy and to devise material and procedural innovations to improve it.12  Churchill directed his ire at Portal, sending him a minute on the Butt report, saying: “This is a very serious paper, and seems to require your most urgent attention. I await your proposals for action.”22 When Portal responded that it would take a force of 4,000 heavy bombers six months to destroy the German war economy, Churchill lashed out, saying, “It is very disputable whether bombing by itself will be a decisive factor in the present war. On the contrary, all that we have learnt since the war began shows that its effects, both
