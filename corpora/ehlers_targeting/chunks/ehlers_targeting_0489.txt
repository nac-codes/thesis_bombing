d out, saying, “It is very disputable whether bombing by itself will be a decisive factor in the present war. On the contrary, all that we have learnt since the war began shows that its effects, both physical and moral, are greatly exaggerated. The most we can say is that it will be a heavy and I trust a seriously increasing annoyance.”24 The COS weighed in with an argument that the weakest point in the German war machine was morale.2? Portal also reminded Churchill of the COS statement that  it is in bombing, on a scale undreamed of in the last war, that we find the new weapon on which we must principally depend for the destruction of economic life and morale. ... After meeting the needs of our own security, therefore, we give to the heavy bomber fleet first priority in production, for only the heavy bomber can produce the conditions under which other offensive forces can be employed.22  His next statement was revealing. Making the case for a major offensive against cities, Portal said, “The worst plan of all would be to continue our present preparations after we had ceased to believe in the efficacy of the bomber as a war-winning weapon.”24 Portal won Churchill over and sent Bomber Command forth to destroy Germany’s cities, wreck its war industries, and undermine its civilians’ morale.  Two weeks after these exchanges, Peirse sent Portal a note emphasizing the difficulties of concentrating raids in time and space, despite the vital importance of doing so for accuracy and defense against flak and night fighters.2* Portal then sent Churchill a minute in which he noted Bomber Command was “fully alive to the need for concentrating the maximum effective number of aircraft over a target in the shortest time so as to saturate the defenses.”26 Portal’s focus was on using bombers for incendiary raids, on a massive scale, against cities, which he saw as the engines driving the Reich’s war economy.  To give aircrews the tools required to make this vision an operational reali
