the needs of our own security, therefore, we give to the heavy bomber fleet first priority in production, for only the heavy bomber can produce the conditions under which other offensive forces can be employed.22  His next statement was revealing. Making the case for a major offensive against cities, Portal said, “The worst plan of all would be to continue our present preparations after we had ceased to believe in the efficacy of the bomber as a war-winning weapon.”24 Portal won Churchill over and sent Bomber Command forth to destroy Germany’s cities, wreck its war industries, and undermine its civilians’ morale.  Two weeks after these exchanges, Peirse sent Portal a note emphasizing the difficulties of concentrating raids in time and space, despite the vital importance of doing so for accuracy and defense against flak and night fighters.2* Portal then sent Churchill a minute in which he noted Bomber Command was “fully alive to the need for concentrating the maximum effective number of aircraft over a target in the shortest time so as to saturate the defenses.”2° Portal’s focus was on using bombers for incendiary raids, on a massive scale, against cities, which he saw as the engines driving the Reich’s war economy.  To give aircrews the tools required to make this vision an operational reality, Portal set RAF officers and scientists to devising new tactics and technologies. The development of Pathfinder Force was vital. So, too, were marker beacons. By October, the air staff had initiated development of radio and pyrotechnic marker beacons. Concerns about countermeasures forestalled the first option, but development of colored flares with increased burn times proceeded rapidly. By 1942, burn times were up from three to seven minutes, giving Pathfinders the tool they needed to light the way for the main body.22  Air Intelligence Supports the Shift to City Bombing  Intelligence supporting the new bombing doctrine was also evolving by 1942.
