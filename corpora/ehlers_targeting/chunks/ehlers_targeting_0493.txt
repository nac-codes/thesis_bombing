to- graph on file to locate decoys. In the process, they determined that the Germans were also using rocket-launched and ground-based decoy marker flares to draw bombers away from flares dropped by Pathfinder Force. These discoveries resulted in better tactics, amore complex mix of colors for target-marking flares, and the ability to brief aircrews before each mission on decoy locations.22  As the quality of daytime photography increased in 1942, so did night strike photos, which drove a steady improvement in accuracy by allowing better placement of target markers and permitting photointerpreters to plot the location of individual aircraft over target by silhouettes against fires and clouds. This unconventional form of damage assessment proved vital because it not only facilitated correction of creep-back but also provided the foundation for Bomber Commandâ€™s parallel development of night area and precision bombing. The latter technique, little remembered now, ultimately resulted in a level of accuracy allowing aircrews to destroy synthetic oil plants in 1944-1945. This remarkable ability to bomb point targets at night had its origins in the formation of CIU N Section, which maintained a close association with its counterpart office in Bomber Command. The British never abandoned their efforts to develop a precision bombing capability, by day and night, which proved crucial with the start of the pre-OVERLORD transportation campaign in spring 1944. Their equally impressive improvements in the damage-assessment arena, along with the new Path- finder Force, made this so.24  Formation of Pathfinder Force in August 1942, and subsequent improvements in bombing accuracy, imposed additional responsibilities on N Section. The larger numbers of aircraft involved in night attacks after August 1942 produced more strike photos, many of which lacked ground detail. In other words, they recorded only fires and explosions on the ground, along with distinctive light patterns made by fl
