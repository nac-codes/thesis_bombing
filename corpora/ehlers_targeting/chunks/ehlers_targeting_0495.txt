ics proved exceptionally valuable once these targets came under sustained attack and allowed the Air Min- istry and Bomber Command to build good target folders by early 1942.22  Photographs from the F52 camera and 36” lens also revealed the many fire and building decoys the Germans had constructed since mid-1941. Fire decoys imitated burning buildings to draw bombers off their targets, which worked well until photointerpreters in CIU’s Q (Enemy Decoys) Section began pinpointing them in July-August 1941. These eight interpreters reviewed every photo- graph on file to locate decoys. In the process, they determined that the Germans were also using rocket-launched and ground-based decoy marker flares to draw bombers away from flares dropped by Pathfinder Force. These discoveries resulted in better tactics, a more complex mix of colors for target-marking flares, and the ability to brief aircrews before each mission on decoy locations.22  As the quality of daytime photography increased in 1942, so did night strike photos, which drove a steady improvement in accuracy by allowing better placement of target markers and permitting photointerpreters to plot the location of individual aircraft over target by silhouettes against fires and clouds. This unconventional form of damage assessment proved vital because it not only facilitated correction of creep-back but also provided the foundation for Bomber Command’s parallel development of night area and precision bombing. The latter technique, little remembered now, ultimately resulted in a level of accuracy allowing aircrews to destroy synthetic oil plants in 1944-1945. This remarkable ability to bomb point targets at night had its origins in the formation of CIUN Section, which maintained a close association with its counterpart office in Bomber Command. The British never abandoned their efforts to develop a precision bombing capability, by day and night, which proved crucial with the start of the pre-oVERLORD transportation cam
