uction types, and vulnerability to fire damage. They also noted damage to high-value industrial facilities and likely repair times.24  City Raids Accelerate  Liibeck, built largely of wood, was bombed the night of 28-29 March 1942. It gave Harris a perfect first test case for the new bombing methods, and by extension for the new damage-assessment tools. The raid involved 234 bombers, including 26 of the new Short Stirling I four-engine bombers, each carrying 14,000 pounds of bombs, and 21 Avro Manchesters, each with nearly 11,000 pounds of bombs. Aircrews dropped more than 400 tons of bombs. Good visibility, light defenses, and much-improved navigation skills resulted in accurate bombing, with nearly 50 percent of bomb tonnage hitting the city, which was made largely of wooden timbers and was highly flammable. Night strike and poststrike photographs showed immense damage, with approximately 190 acres, or 30 percent of the city’s built-up area, destroyed. German sources captured after the war confirmed that over 2,400 buildings were destroyed or severely damaged and another 8,411 lightly damaged—62 percent of all structures. Of these, 256 were industrial concerns, including the destroyed Dragerwerke, which made oxygen equipment for U-boats. It was a deadly and dramatic raid. **  This success was like a tonic to Churchill, Cherwell, and the long-suffering Air Ministry leadership. The earlier atmosphere of gloom and pessimism turned to optimism, in which all things again seemed possible. Cherwell sent an upbeat note to Churchill on 30 March estimating that projected annual heavy bomber production by mid-1943 (10,000 aircraft) would provide the weight of attack needed to destroy Germany’s fifty-eight largest cities, which housed 22 million people. He believed such attacks “would break the spirit of the people.”2® The prime minister, moved again to optimism, asked what needed to be done to expand the scale and destructiveness of city raids even further by 1943.
