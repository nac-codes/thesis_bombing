ly stretched, ultimately proved beyond Bomber Command's means. Intelligence personnel also initially missed, then underestimated, the German capacity for dispersing industries, with the notable exception of oil plants and refineries, and railroads, which remained quite vulnerable. These issues would have serious consequences for bombing, despite—and also because of—Harris’s untiring efforts and utter determination to carry through his city-bombing program.  In addition, Sir Henry Tizard, Britain’s chief scientist, thought Cherwell’s assumptions far too optimistic. Aside from the bomber production figure, which he thought high, Tizard questioned Cherwell’s assertion that the fiftyeight cities would be easy to find and destroy. He also believed the estimate that each bomber produced would fly an average of fourteen sorties during its service life overly optimistic based on recorded loss rates. Tizard concluded it would be impossible for Bomber Command to achieve decisive results by mid-1943 and that such results would not be possible until a much larger armada took to the air. His concerns sounded a cautionary note ignored in the now-heady atmosphere.42  Despite the upbeat mood among senior leaders, Churchill, even in his enthusiasm for city bombing, never lost sight of the fact that everyone involved must  regard the Bomber offensive against Germany at least as a feature in breaking her war-will second only to the largest military operations which can be conducted on the Continent until that war- will is broken. Renewed, intense efforts should be made by the Allies to develop during the winter and onwards ever-growing, ever more accurate and ever more far-ranging Bomber attacks on Germany In this wav alone can we nrenare the canditians which will he favaurahle ta the mainr military aneratians an which we are recalved 41  Page 118 of 423 30%  asked what needed to be done to expand the scale and destructiveness of city raids even further by 1943. Cherwell told him navi
