He also brought huge improvements to Bomber Command, turning it from a largely ineffectual force of two-engine bombers into a huge tactically and technically sophisticated force of fourengine heavies.*2 Eisenhower praised him repeatedly, as did many se- nior leaders. On 25 September 1944, the supreme commander noted:  In view of earlier expressed fears that Harris would not willingly devote his Command to the support of ground operations, he actually proved to be one of the most effective and co-operative members of this team. Not only did he meet every request I ever made upon him, but he actually took the lead in discovering new ways and means for his particular types of planes to be of use in the battlefield.44  During the Ardennes offensive, when Harris, on his own initiative, ordered exceptionally effective Bomber Command strikes on marshaling yards at Trier, Cologne, and other key cities between 19 and 31 December 1944, Eisenhower congratulated him on his aircrews’ “magnificent performance” despite poor weather conditions at home and over the targets.

It was a hope at first nurtured by damage assessments and, ironically, later dashed by them. They also hoped, mistakenly, that the Americans would join the city-bombing effort. Finally, their belief that the German war economy wa
