n doctrine and air strategy. Finally, Harris was the most prone among airmen to use intelligence for his own purposes and the least willing to accept what it had to tell him. Despite the increasing analytical rigor of Bomber Command's Intelligence Directorate, Harris sometimes manipulated its assessments to make his case in discussions and arguments, an issue we will examine in detail later.42  However, the aspects of Harris’s character we rarely see in most histories, and that made him an effective commander despite his flaws, were his loyalty and his efforts (although not always all- out efforts) to obey orders once he lost a policy battle. His command's efforts during the transportation and oil offensives make this clear. He also brought huge improvements to Bomber Command, turning it from a largely ineffectual force of two-engine bombers into a huge tactically and technically sophisticated force of fourengine heavies.*2 Eisenhower praised him repeatedly, as did many se- nior leaders. On 25 September 1944, the supreme commander noted:  In view of earlier expressed fears that Harris would not willingly devote his Command to the support of ground operations, he actually proved to be one of the most effective and co-operative members of this team. Not only did he meet every request I ever made upon him, but he actually took the lead in discovering new ways and means for his particular types of planes to be of use in the battlefield *  During the Ardennes offensive, when Harris, on his own initiative, ordered exceptionally effective Bomber Command strikes on marshaling yards at Trier, Cologne, and other key cities between 19 and 31 December 1944, Eisenhower congratulated him on his aircrews’ “magnificent performance” despite poor weather conditions at home and over the targets. Harris promptly replied, “You can count on us in any weather short of the impossible.”45 Eisenhower simply said, “They have already achieved the impossible.”4¢ Portal also noted that Harris di
