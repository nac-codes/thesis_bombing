ding assessments of American daylight precision attacks when they began in August 1942. The creation of RE8 was a watershed event in the development of Anglo-American air intelligence capabilities.  The Ministry of Home Security formed RE8 at the request of the Air Ministry, which recognized the requirement for a new organization to conduct scientific analysis of enemy vulnerabilities and bombing effects. With RE8’s expansion in July 1942, Squadron Leader Dewdney assumed the leadership position. Dewdney was the intelligence analyst who had pioneered the use of Ministry of Home Defense damage assessments of German raids on British industrial facilities. He had also spearheaded the use of operational research techniques to determine the weight of attack, bombing tactics, and munitions required to maximize damage to oil targets. At RE8, Dewdney continued to advance the development of these skills as the executive officer of a committee formed to refine RAF operational research. He also created an advisory group consisting of RE8’s scientific advisors and officers to provide advice on bombing techniques and expected results. The air staff, Bomber Command, and 8th Air Force valued RE8 products and used them extensively.2®  Under Dewdney’s leadership, analysts at RE8 began producing four key assessments: town reports, which included a comparison of reported and actual bombs on target, bomb distribution, and estimated damage to industrial and nonindustrial zones; installation reports, which looked at a single high-value factory or other facility, noting bomb count and distribution, structural damage, and impact on production; weapon reports, which provided detailed munitions effectiveness assessment of various bombs and fuses used against all target types; and repair and reconstruction reports, which tracked the rate at which the Germans brought installations back on line. These reports were built on a foundation provided by the vast quantity of CIU K and N Section damage
