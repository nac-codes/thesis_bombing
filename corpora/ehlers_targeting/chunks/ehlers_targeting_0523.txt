struction reports, which tracked the rate at which the Germans brought installations back on line. These reports were built on a foundation provided by the vast quantity of CIU K and N Section damage assessments, as well as the tens of thousands of photographs upon which these reports depended. Consequently, RE8 products took several weeks to compile and soon became the sine qua non of damage assessments. When they completed reports, authors met with their MEW counterparts to assess the aggregate impact of raids on the German war economy. MEW then released quarterly, semiannual, and annual reports on the economic impacts of bombing, in the aggregate and by specific industry.“  Page 123 of 423 32%  concentrated, a fact illustrated by a large number of excellent night-strike and poststrike photographs as well as detailed CIU K Section reports and city damage mosaics and maps. First, Harris used his concept of a “bomber stream,” in which all bombers flew by a common route and at the same speed to and from the target. In addition, Gee and Pathfinder Force made it much easier for the bomber stream to locate and concentrate on the target. Where the previous year’s 100-plane raids had taken four hours and the 234 aircraft that attacked Litbeck two hours, the 1,000 bombers on the Cologne raid took only ninety minutes. Ultimately, this figure dropped to less than twenty minutes. Interpreters assessed over 5,400 buildings destroyed or severely damaged, including 36 large factories with a complete loss of production, 70 suffering a 50 to 80 percent loss for up to three months, and another 222 suffering up to a 50 percent loss. There was an important cautionary note as well: an MEW report noted that repairs proceeded much more quickly than expected.*2  Also troubling was the fact that these impressive damage figures masked several serious damage-assessment deficiencies. First was incomplete knowledge of what exactly British bombs were destroying. For instance, although reports
