igh-value factory or other facility, noting bomb count and distribution, structural damage, and impact on production; weapon reports, which provided detailed munitions effectiveness assessment of various bombs and fuses used against all target types; and repair and reconstruction reports, which tracked the rate at which the Germans brought installations back on line. These reports were built on a foundation provided by the vast quantity of CIU K and N Section damage assessments, as well as the tens of thousands of photographs upon which these reports depended. Consequently, RE8 products took several weeks to compile and soon became the sine qua non of damage assessments. When they completed reports, authors met with their MEW counterparts to assess the aggregate impact of raids on the German war economy. MEW then released quarterly, semiannual, and annual reports on the economic impacts of bombing, in the aggregate and by specific industry.*2  One of the reasons for the accuracy of RE8 reports was their authorsâ€™ comparison of precisely measured damage to British towns from German air raids with damage-assessment data from Allied raids. This comparative approach provided a means for determining damage to structures and associated loss of production. It included insights on damage caused by German bombs; comparisons of the characteristics of those bombs with British bombs of similar size; susceptibility of various industries to blast, fragmentation, and fire damage; comparisons of British and German building construction to optimize bomb choice; and assessments of railroad damage and delays in traffic. RE8 reports became the gold standard of assessments, particularly after ground-survey teams in France and Germany during 1944-1945 determined they were always within a few percentage points of figures quoted in captured German damage records.*%  RE8 analysts soon used damage assessments in cooperation with their CIU counterparts to drive major changes in bombing focus d
