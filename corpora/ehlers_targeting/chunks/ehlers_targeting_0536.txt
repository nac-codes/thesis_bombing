ach city’s expected recovery time.  After attendees agreed on division of labor, they ironed out the details of the process for producing and updating Bomber Command’s damage dossiers. They settled on a ten-step process designed to be completed fourteen days after a given raid. It began with CIU’s K (Damage Assessment) Section. Each step took one or two days:  1. CIU K Section prepared the 1:5,000 scale prints with grid overlay.  2. CIU K Section noted building types damaged (residential, commercial, and industrial) and the cause of damage (blast, fire, or both) on the 1:5,000 maps.  3. CIU K Section prepared a detailed bomb plot showing all known bomb impacts in built-up areas of the city.  4. CIU K Section traced and measured areas of damage and noted the zone boundaries (dividing lines between residential, commercial, and industrial areas of the city) on the 1:5,000 scale photographs.  . RE8 confirmed damage by building categories and type, placing all damage data on punch cards for future reference (an indication they were using early computers to do some of their dataprocessing and statistical work).  6. RE8 estimated damage to utilities.  7. RE8 made adjustments in damage estimates for cloud cover and incomplete photographic coverage of the target area.  8. RE8 measured damage level in terms of lost man-hours.  9. MEW estimated the effect of the raid on the enemy’s overall war effort.  wu  Page 126 of 423 32%  _— eee ee  ——_—  managers, engineers, and architects who advised them on various aspects of damage assessments and munitions effectiveness, drawing on their own expertise and experiences with the German bombing of British plant and equipment. This close-knit network of subject-matter experts facilitated the production of RE8 reports.*2 In fact, the two organizations established a formal liaison function between Squadron Leader Dewdney of RE8 and Squadron Leader Tilling of the CIU. Together, they developed procedures for effective coordination and worked
