8 250-pound bombs.® Even Churchill took an interest, pushing for development of larger munitions. Churchill's private secretary, R. S. Crawford, told Portal that “there has been considerable discussion on a high level with the Prime Minister regarding the use of large bombs including the 1000-Ib. bomb.”® The chief re- plied that there were 190 of the new 1,000-pound bombs filled and ready to drop.  However, because of the slow start in manufacturing 1,000-pound bombs, the British had to turn to the United States as production ramped up. Tests of American bombs revealed that the addition of British nose and tail fuses made them effective against hardened structures. Nonetheless, several officers noted that the move toward the 1,000-pound variety by no means meant that the 500- pound bomb was of diminished value. It was large enough to do serious damage, and in certain instances, including attacks on oil refineries, it proved superior.

The end results were a comprehensive damage assessment and a new or updated damage dossier that brought this effort to a very high level of precision, notwithstanding the intelligence gaps and imponderables associated with city raids.**  The problem with this approach, of course, was its inability to adjust for these gaps and imponderables. One of the greatest unknowns, despite efforts to quantify it with the man-hours-lost process, was the degree to which city attacks disrupted industrial production and drew manpower away from productive work to debris clearance, repair, and reconstruction. RE8 formulas for determining this were intricate but also inaccurate for five reasons. The first was the Germans’ lavish use of forced laborers for rubble clearance and
