no difference; the raids continued with varying intensity until well after the Normandy invasion.  This fiasco was a clear case of bombing to influence Allied morale, in this case positively, even though intelligence made clear the futility of these raids. We are thus left with the impression that some things were so politically important as to make any insights gleaned from air intelligence, cautionary or otherwise, impossible to heed. Yet the picture is somewhat more complex. Political leaders, including Churchill and Roosevelt, drove the effort forward, but they did so with decidedly bad advice from their intelligence chiefs—not the last time this would happen. From the start of the German building effort, intelligence sources had kept close track of the progress of construction. Yet Bomber Command launched only a few small and ineffectual raids on the U-boat bases during these periods of critical vulnerability, which the air intelligence organization was in a position to point out. Admiral Le Puth, a French officer living in the area during these events, lamented that “some well-placed bombs would have stopped work dead.”78 If there was any hope of slowing or mitigating the U-boat menace, this was it, but the intelligence and operations personnel involved collectively failed to do the job.  American Air Intelligence Specialists Arrive  Operational and ethical failures aside, American participation in these raids on U-boat pens marked the first significant United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) effort and signaled the first serious involvement of U.S. intelligence personnel in the targeting and damage-assessment processes, a key initial step in the development of a mature Allied air intelligence organization.  The first American air intelligence officers to arrive in Great Britain during the spring of 1942 were woefully undertrained by British standards, but they also proved to be quick studies capable of integrating into British air intelligence organizations.
