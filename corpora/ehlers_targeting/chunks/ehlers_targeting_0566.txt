here went to work for Colonel Robert Bacon, the 8th Air Force director of intelligence (A-2). In August 1942, Bacon established the Provisional Photographic Interpretation Unit (PPIU). This USAAF unit worked at the CIU under British tutelage in duty sections the Americans and British agreed would maximize the professional development of USAAF interpreters and provide important operational assistance to the CIU. By 30 September, the PPIU had sixteen officers assigned and another nine attached. At the same time, another fourteen officers attended the British photointerpretersâ€™ school at Nuneham Common. By the end of the year, the first sixteen Americans assigned to the PPIU had gained basic proficiency and were ready for operational assignments. The routine for getting U.S. photointerpreters proficient was to place them in the fourweek Nuneham Common course, then attach them to the CIU for a period of several weeks to build operational proficiency, and then send them to their operational units.22  These early arrivals were soon joined by a much larger group when the 1st Photographic Intelligence Detachment (1st PID) arrived in Great Britain on 13 January 1943. It consisted of thirty-three officers and thirty-four enlisted men. The officers, all AAFAIS graduates, nonetheless lacked the photointerpretation skills required to go directly into operational work. Consequently, Colonel Ordway, recently made 8th Air Force A-2, opened an American school for advanced photointerpretation work at RAF Pinetree and picked the most capable and experienced interpreters from the PPIU to teach the course.84  One of the most important results of this process was an agreement that 1st PID and its interpreters, after graduating from the new school, should stay at RAF Pinetree. There, they were joined just before D-day by the members of K (Damage Assessment) Section, henceforth made up of British and American photointerpreters. The rationale for this move was threefold. First, it placed K
