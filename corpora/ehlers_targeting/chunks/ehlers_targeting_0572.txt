RE8 damage reports highly. They proved quite valuable in the Americans’ efforts to determine the effects and effectiveness of their bombing, proper timing for reattack of various targets, and the effectiveness of their bombs and fuses. Of course the Americans did not ask their British comrades to do all this work alone. By August 1943, fifteen Americans were working in RE8.®2  The Americans also took their cue from the RAF’s Operational Research Section. By July 1942, the Americans had established their version, the Operations Analysis Section, at 8th Bomber Command. In fact, Eaker had been focused on this problem since his arrival in Great Britain in March 1942.88  Page 132 of 423 34%  the course.  One of the most important results of this process was an agreement that 1st PID and its interpreters, after graduating from the new school, should stay at RAF Pinetree. There, they were joined just before D-day by the members of K (Damage Assessment) Section, henceforth made up of British and American photointerpreters. The rationale for this move was threefold. First, it placed K Section adjacent to the British PRUs at RAF Benson and their American counterparts at RAF Mount Farm. Second, it allowed 1st PID to provide the best possible support to USAAF bombing operations and HQ 8th Air Force, which was also nearby. Third, it kept the Americans within the CIU orbit and under British tutelage.  Lieutenant General Carl A. Spaatz, commander, 8th Air Force, proved wise enough to let the British lead the photointerpretation effort, with Americans working alongside. This line of thinking matched the British view. The result was the formation of the Allied Central Interpretation Unit, built on the foundation of the CIU, in 1943. As for American PRUs, Spaatz insisted that they were necessary, but he also put in place liaison officers to ensure they coordinated their coverage with that flown by British PRUs. This coordination took place at ADI(Ph) until summer 1944 and then tran-
