ecessary, but he also put in place liaison officers to ensure they coordinated their coverage with that flown by British PRUs. This coordination took place at ADI(Ph) until summer 1944 and then tran- sitioned to the newly formed Joint Photo Reconnaissance Committee.Â®  USAAF Photoreconnaissance Joins the Fight  As American photointerpreters arrived in Great Britain during 1942, airmen were already figuring out the most effective means for basing and using the USAAF photoreconnaissance squadrons now beginning to arrive. Major General Ira C. Eaker, commander of 8th Bomber Command, recommended to Spaatz that all USAAF photoreconnaissance squadrons initially operate out of RAF Benson (where the British PRUs were stationed) for a short period to receive training from experienced British pilots. He also recommended that all requests for photographic cover go to ADI(Ph), and that a USAAF liaison officer be stationed there to enhance efficiency. Spaatz and the British agreed, and both recommendations were put into operation immediately.82  At the same time, 8th Bomber Command staff officers recommended that USAAF reconnaissance squadrons be based at RAF Mount Farm to be close to the British PRUs at RAF Benson. The British had recommended this earlier for ease of operational coordination, more effective and rapid receipt of photographs and production of immediate interpretation reports at RAF Pinetree, and more rapid courier service to Allied headquarters and intelligence organizations. These actions maximized the efficiency of photoreconnaissance and photointerpretation. This vision for combined operations and centralized control of assets came to fruition with the arrival of the first American unit, the 13th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, at Mount Farm in February 1943.84  Building a Combined and Interagency Air Intelligence Effort  As the Allies worked out these details, American air intelligence officers also began working in other British intelligence organization
