ointed assistant chief of air staff (policy), said of the Americans: “Their bombing has been extremely accurate as a rule. And I think we have seen enough of their performance in this and other theatres to be sure that their aircrews are fine material and will not be deterred by casualties.”2° Indeed, as we have already seen, both Slessor and Portal made a strong case to Churchill that he support the Americans’ daylight bombardment rather than try to push them into joining Bomber Command’s night offensive. Portal believed that with time, the American bombing effort would prove formidable and act as a perfect complement to Bomber Command's efforts. Eaker made a very strong case at the Casablanca conference, but Portal and Slessor played important roles behind the scenes.  A month later, the COS published a paper envisioning an Allied heavybomber force of 4,000 to 6,000 aircraft, dropping 90,000 tons of bombs per month on Germany, by December 1944. They also foresaw an increasing diversion of Luftwaffe assets to the defense of the Reich, which they felt would “heavily handicap all German operations by land, sea and air in other theatres.”24 The COS closed with a particularly important reminder: “It is concluded,” they said, “that an Anglo-American bomber force of the size proposed could reduce the German economic and military strength to a point well below that at which an Anglo-American invasion of the Continent would become possible. This result might well be achieved before the combined force had built up to peak strength.”22 Here was a clear reminder that an important aim was to reduce German economic and military strength in order to facilitate an invasion of the Continent. Also present, if implicitly, was the idea that heavy bombers would soon provide vital assistance to Allied ground forces on all the fighting fronts, whether in western Europe, Italy, or Russia. The COS proved prescient, but a prolonged and costly battle for air supremacy over the Reich stood b
