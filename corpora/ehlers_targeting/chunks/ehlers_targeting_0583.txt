d make a good match came with the first USAAF bombing raid, to the Sotteville marshaling yard in Rouen, on 17 August 1942. A small force of twelve B-17s of the 97th Bomb Group, escorted by Spitfires, put their bombs squarely on the target. The CIU K Section dam- age report for this raid summarized it as follows:  This sortie shows that, as a result of very accurate bombing, the main marshaling yards, two Transshipment Sheds between the Up and Down Sorting Sidings, and two factories, which most probably form part of the Repair Shops, have been severely damaged. Numerous wagons are seen to be damaged and derailed and there is little doubt that very considerable dislocation of work- ing will have been caused on both the Up and Down Sorting Sidings.  The report then listed thirteen individual buildings or other items damaged during the raid, providing additional details on the degree of damage caused by the 16 tons of bombs (forty-five 500-pound and nine 1,000-pound weapons) used. Photographs of excellent quality, taken by PRU1, made the photointerpreters’ jobs easy.  This report, just one of thousands to come, made clear several things of great significance for future bombing. First, it confirmed that American daylight precision bombing could be quite accurate under the right conditions. British photointerpreters had seldom used the phrase “very accurate bombing” before this raid. They were clearly impressed. Second, it convinced a number of British and American intelligence experts that if twelve B-17s could do this kind of harm to a major marshaling yard, several dozen could render the installation unusable for weeks. Third, it no doubt helped confirm for several RAF officers, including Portal and his deputy director of bomber operations, Group Captain Sidney Bufton, what Bomber Command “night precision bombing,” as yet only an emerging capability, might accomplish against such targets.24 Whether guided by Gee, Oboe, H2S Mark III, or some other blind-bombing aid, or
