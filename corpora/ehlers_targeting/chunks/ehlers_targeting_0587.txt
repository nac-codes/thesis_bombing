ard, several dozen could render the installation unusable for weeks. Third, it no doubt helped confirm for several RAF officers, including Portal and his deputy director of bomber operations, Group Captain Sidney Bufton, what Bomber Command “night precision bombing,” as yet only an emerging capability, might accomplish against such targets.24 Whether guided by Gee, Oboe, H2S Mark III, or some other blind-bombing aid, or simply conducted using the Pathfinder Force and elite bomb groups, such raids, they reasoned, might be every bit as destructive as American raids, and perhaps even more so. British heavies, including the Stirling, Halifax, and Lancaster, carried 14,000 pounds of bombs to the B-17’s 6,000 to 9,000 pounds. This combination of British and American capabilities was already changing the ways in which senior airmen thought about how they should bomb, about what they could and should bomb, and about what was possible once heavy bombers began going after high-value targets in both day and night precision attacks.  First, however, the British were committed to city bombing. They would continue it, despite steadily mounting losses, with the expectation that at some point it would undermine the German war economy and break German morale. Although city bombing did severe damage, it failed in its stated aim of knocking Germany out of the war. And it was the Allied air intelligence organization that highlighted this failure even while it underscored the many important things Bomber Command did to hamper the German war effort and lay the groundwork for the much more serious damage to come once the Americans joined their British comrades in force.
