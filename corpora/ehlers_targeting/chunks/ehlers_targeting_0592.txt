This support among senior RAF airmen helped pave the way for the comple- mentary American effort.2  In fact, when Eaker made his famous presentation for the combined bomber offensive (CBO) to Churchill and Roosevelt at the Casablanca conference in January 1943, Churchill joined Roosevelt in approving the plan. After heavy losses at Schweinfurt and Regensburg threatened to undermine the American day bombing effort, there had been discussions about potential American night bombing in late 1943. Even then, however, American airmen, with unstinting support from Portal, and to a slightly more modest but no less real degree from Harris, stayed true to the doctrine they developed during the interwar period; and the arrival of drop tanks for P-47 and P-51 fighters brought their effort back from the brink. As a result of Portal’s support for the Americans, Ismay summed up some- thing everyone was already noticing: that he “was held in particularly high regard by the Americans, and was instrumental in smoothing over many difficulties.”2  The Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) directive after the Casablanca conference generally allowed Bomber Command and 8th Air Force to do what they wanted but attempted to bring their efforts together in a meaningful way. The CCS told Harris and Eaker, “Your primary objective will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic system, and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.”4 They further directed the bombing effort to focus on five objectives: U- boat construction, the aircraft industry, transportation targets, oil plants, and other industrial targets. Finally, they told Harris and Eaker to attack U-boat bases on the Bay of Biscay and go after Berlin with enough freque
