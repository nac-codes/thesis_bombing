craft industry, transportation targets, oil plants, and other industrial targets. Finally, they told Harris and Eaker to attack U-boat bases on the Bay of Biscay and go after Berlin with enough frequency to affect German morale in the Reich’s capital city. The CCS emphasized to United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) airmen in particular that “you should take every opportunity to attack Germany by day, to destroy objectives that are unsuitable for night attack, to sustain continuous pressure on German morale, to impose heavy losses on the German day fighter force and to contain German fighter strength away from the Russian and Mediterranean theatres of war.’”= Equally important was their reminder about the role of airpower in a combined-arms effort: “When the Allied Armies reenter the Continent, you will afford them all the possible support in the manner most effective.”  Page 141 of 423 36%  capabilities, began dispersing large numbers of factories, and put forced laborers to work in them. Nonetheless, British bombing had a significant effect on German war production, not least because it forced largescale industrial dispersal efforts. These dispersals impeded efficiency and reduced the quality of finished weapons because component parts had to be produced in separate locations without adequate quality control, which in turn eroded German combat power and increased the effectiveness of transportation attacks. As will become clear, British night bombing imposed many other serious costs on the German war effort.+  In the meantime, the city-bombing campaign escalated while the Americans, with their own ideas about how best to use heavy bombers, began to arrive in force. Their advocacy of high-altitude daylight precision bombardment, combined with the good results they obtained in early raids, prompted British leaders to pay heed to their ally’s preferred doctrine.
