ned in early raids, prompted British leaders to pay heed to their ally’s preferred doctrine. In September 1942, Air Vice Marshal Slessor, assistant chief of air staff for policy, reminded Portal that it was not a good time to press the Americans to join in the citybombing effort. “I suggest,” Slessor said, “that it might have unfortunate results if we cast official doubts on the day bombing policy just now when the new Air War Plan [Air War Plans Division Plan 42, or AWPD-42] is before the U.S. Chiefs of Staff.” Portal agreed with Slessor’s observation and with his favorable view of the broader concept of American daylight precision bombing. This support among senior RAF airmen helped pave the way for the comple- mentary American effort.2  In fact, when Eaker made his famous presentation for the combined bomber offensive (CBO) to Churchill and Roosevelt at the Casablanca conference in January 1943, Churchill joined Roosevelt in approving the plan. After heavy losses at Schweinfurt and Regensburg threatened to undermine the American day bombing effort, there had been discussions about potential American night bombing in late 1943. Even then, however, American airmen, with unstinting support from Portal, and to a slightly more modest but no less real degree from Harris, stayed true to the doctrine they developed during the interwar period; and the arrival of drop tanks for P-47 and P-51 fighters brought their effort back from the brink. As a result of Portal’s support for the Americans, Ismay summed up some- thing everyone was already noticing: that he “was held in particularly high regard by the Americans, and was instrumental in smoothing over many difficulties.”2  The Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) directive after the Casablanca conference generally allowed Bomber Command and 8th Air Force to do what they wanted but attempted to bring their efforts together in a meaningful way. The CCS told Harris and Eaker, “Your primary objective will be the progressive destructi
