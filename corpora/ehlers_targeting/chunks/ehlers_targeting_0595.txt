The CCS told Harris and Eaker, “Your primary objective will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic system, and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.”4 They further directed the bombing effort to focus on five objectives: U- boat construction, the aircraft industry, transportation targets, oil plants, and other industrial targets. Finally, they told Harris and Eaker to attack U-boat bases on the Bay of Biscay and go after Berlin with enough frequency to affect German morale in the Reich’s capital city. The CCS emphasized to United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) airmen in particular that “you should take every opportunity to attack Germany by day, to destroy objectives that are unsuitable for night attack, to sustain continuous pressure on German morale, to impose heavy losses on the German day fighter force and to contain German fighter strength away from the Russian and Mediterranean theatres of war.”= Equally important was their reminder about the role of airpower in a combined-arms effort: “When the Allied Armies reenter the Continent, you will afford them all the possible support in the manner most effective.”®  “The Harris Issue” Continued  Harris nonetheless took full advantage of the CCS directive, which gave the USAAF responsibility for attacking Germany’s aircraft industry and other “precision” target sets, to continue Bomber Command's city-bombing effort. His disdain for attacks on specific target sets, which he referred to as “panacea” targets, together with the broad nature of the CCS guidance, all but ensured the Americans would do most of the work in attacking precision target sets and destroying the Luftwaffe. The British did engage targets within the high-priority target sets during 1943, but for the
