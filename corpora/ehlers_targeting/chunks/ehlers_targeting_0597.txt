on German night air defenses, “Bomber Command [was] not entitled to ULTRA, so reports could not be distributed to the only authority that really needed them.” In fact, Harris’s disdain for “the clever boys whose ideas never worked” extended beyond the Ministry of Economic Warfare (MEW) to Bletchley Park and the entire intelligence structure, in part, no doubt, because he never had an opportunity to see the full range of Ultra material, and because by 1944 he was utterly jaded by his earlier dealings with what he saw as a collection of incompetent intelligence agencies. One can only wonder, given Portal’s later attempts to convince Harris (unsuccessfully) that oil was much more than just another panacea target, whether better access to and use of Ultra might have moved even this most skeptical of men to change his position, as he in fact did after the war.  Wing Commander John Stubbington placed the blame squarely at Portal’s feet: “On the face of the inadequate dissemination of ULTRA material to Bomber Command, the criticism addressed to Sir Arthur Harris should be better addressed to the chief of air staff for failing to ensure that his major command was in timely possession of all relevant intelligence.”2 Although Harris does not deserve  a ee ie |e ee. | Te en ce ce Se.

His disdain for attacks on specific target sets, which he referred to as “panacea” targets, together with the broad nature of the CCS guidance, all but ensured the Americans would do most of the work in attacking precision target sets and destroying the Luftwaffe. The British did engage targets within the high-priority target sets during 1943, but for the most part incidentally as they went after cities.  T
