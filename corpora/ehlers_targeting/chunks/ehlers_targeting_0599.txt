not entitled to ULTRA, so reports could not be distributed to the only authority that really needed them.” In fact, Harris’s disdain for “the clever boys whose ideas never worked” extended beyond the Ministry of Economic Warfare (MEW) to Bletchley Park and the entire intelligence structure, in part, no doubt, because he never had an opportunity to see the full range of Ultra material, and because by 1944 he was utterly jaded by his earlier dealings with what he saw as a collection of incompetent intelligence agencies. One can only wonder, given Portal’s later attempts to convince Harris (unsuccessfully) that oil was much more than just another panacea target, whether better access to and use of Ultra might have moved even this most skeptical of men to change his position, as he in fact did after the war.®  Wing Commander John Stubbington placed the blame squarely at Portal’s feet: “On the face of the inadequate dissemination of ULTRA material to Bomber Command, the criticism addressed to Sir Arthur Harris should be better addressed to the chief of air staff for failing to ensure that his major command was in timely possession of all relevant intelligence.”2 Although Harris does not deserve a free pass for his command’s intelligence problems, neither does he deserve all the blame.  Harris, in any case, turned the full fury of an increasingly capable Bomber Command against Germany’s cities. Its crews were now equipped almost entirely with four-engine heavies carrying 14,000 pounds of bombs each, including high-explosive Blockbuster and incendiary munitions; navigation aids such as Gee; blind-bombing devices such as Oboe and the H2S Mark III radar; an improving Pathfinder Force equipped with an excellent target-marking bomb; and the tactical acumen necessary to put a thousandbomber attack over a city in twenty to thirty minutes. This formidable force bore no resemblance to the weak instrument of 1939-19412  The Battle of the Ruhr  By March 1943, Harris felt ready to g
