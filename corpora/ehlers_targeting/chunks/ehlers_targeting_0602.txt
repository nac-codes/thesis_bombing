to convince Harris (unsuccessfully) that oil was much more than just another panacea target, whether better access to and use of Ultra might have moved even this most skeptical of men to change his position, as he in fact did after the war®  Wing Commander John Stubbington placed the blame squarely at Portal’s feet: “On the face of the inadequate dissemination of ULTRA material to Bomber Command, the criticism addressed to Sir Arthur Harris should be better addressed to the chief of air staff for failing to ensure that his major command was in timely possession of all relevant intelligence.”2 Although Harris does not deserve a free pass for his command’s intelligence problems, neither does he deserve all the blame.  Harris, in any case, turned the full fury of an increasingly capable Bomber Command against Germany’s cities. Its crews were now equipped almost entirely with four-engine heavies carrying 14,000 pounds of bombs each, including high-explosive Blockbuster and incendiary munitions; navigation aids such as Gee; blind-bombing devices such as Oboe and the H2S Mark III radar; an improving Pathfinder Force equipped with an excellent target-marking bomb; and the tactical acumen necessary to put a thousandbomber attack over a city in twenty to thirty minutes. This formidable force bore no resemblance to the weak instrument of 1939-19412  The Battle of the Ruhr  By March 1943, Harris felt ready to go after the Ruhr’s industrial cities, which came under heavy attack from 5 March to 24 July 1943. These attacks, which benefited from Gee and Oboe, did severe damage. Bombers often carried both Gee and Oboe, the former as a navigation device, the latter as a blind-bombing aid. Oboe was similar to Gee but more advanced in that it kept bombers on course by allowing them to fly along a radio beam and, when over the target, to drop their weapons within 300 yards of the aim point. Another advantage was the ability to mark targets accurately during no-moon and bad-weather per
