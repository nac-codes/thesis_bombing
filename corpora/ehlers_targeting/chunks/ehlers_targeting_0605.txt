ncompassed the opening attacks in Harris’s grandest scheme: the battle of Berlin, which he expected to result in German capitulation but instead nearly destroyed Bomber Command. In fact, as the Germans adjusted to British night tactics and devised countermeasures, the British loss rate climbed to 7 percent or more per raid, a price Bomber Command simply could not pay if it was to continue as an effective fighting force.*  By the time the battle of the Ruhr ended and the battle of Berlin began, Bomber Command had done grievous damage to many cities. An RE8 bomb damage assessment report assessed the effects of fifteen raids on nine cities between 4 July and 30 September 1943. The report concluded that about 9.5 percent of nonindustrial and 5 percent of industrial buildings in these cities were destroyed or seriously damaged. In total, the nine towns lost about three weeks’ production and approximately 4.1 million man-months of labor, which equaled twenty-five days for every worker in each of those towns. This focus on man-months and man-hours of labor lost was joined by an equally heavy emphasis on dwelling units and factories destroyed or damaged, the former to gauge morale effects and the costs of resettling the homeless, the latter to gauge the effects on Germany’s war economy. These figures, though in most cases fairly precise, posed as many questions as they answered.1®  Page 143 of 423 36%  E <  production. They also observed that repairs were much slower than anticipated, which was puzzling given the excellence of German repair work. What the analysts missed was the dispersal of work away from the factory and the German penchant for continuing work in buildings with damaged upper stories but intact ground floors and basements.12  Because Krupps was a high-value facility, RE8 personnel also produced a report on reconstruction, noting that the factory complex’s productive output had been reduced by perhaps 40 percent until at least December 1944.
