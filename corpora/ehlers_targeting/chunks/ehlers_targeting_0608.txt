-14 July raid on Aachen, RE8 analysts placed industrial loss at 34 million man-hours or 128 days’ lost labor for every worker in the city. Loss of man-hours in fact became the sine qua non of RE8 damage assessments in 1943.42  Page 143 of 423 37%  bombing. One of the most significant things about this raid, aside from its destructiveness, was the accurate Pathfinder Force marking and main-force bombing of a target well outside the range of Oboe. Another was the use of chaff, which the British called Window. Window, which was composed of bundles containing thousands of strips of aluminum foil, blinded German radar, which as yet lacked moving target indicators. British bombers were thus able to attack cities with little resistance until moving target indicators became available to the Germans in August 1943. This period also encompassed the opening attacks in Harris’s grandest scheme: the battle of Berlin, which he expected to result in German capitulation but instead nearly destroyed Bomber Command. In fact, as the Germans adjusted to British night tactics and devised countermeasures, the British loss rate climbed to 7 percent or more per raid, a price Bomber Command simply could not pay if it was to continue as an effective fighting force.  By the time the battle of the Ruhr ended and the battle of Berlin began, Bomber Command had done grievous damage to many cities. An RE8 bomb damage assessment report assessed the effects of fifteen raids on nine cities between 4 July and 30 September 1943. The report concluded that about 9.5 percent of nonindustrial and 5 percent of industrial buildings in these cities were destroyed or seriously damaged. In total, the nine towns lost about three weeks’ production and approximately 4.1 million man-months of labor, which equaled twenty-five days for every worker in each of those towns. This focus on man-months and man-hours of labor lost was joined by an equally heavy emphasis on dwelling units and factories destroyed or damaged,
