y-five days for every worker in each of those towns. This focus on man-months and man-hours of labor lost was joined by an equally heavy emphasis on dwelling units and factories destroyed or damaged, the former to gauge morale effects and the costs of resettling the homeless, the latter to gauge the effects on Germany’s war economy. These figures, though in most cases fairly precise, posed as many questions as they answered.1®  An Inescapable Conundrum: Air Intelligence for City Raids  The figures came directly from raid assessment data sheets produced for every city raid, which listed population, number of industrial workers, and dwelling units. They then provided calculations of damage to industrial and commercial buildings and housing units, estimated the total casualties, and assessed industrial loss. The last calculation included production lost as a result of damage and the repair time required to bring each plant back on line, absenteeism due to the workers’ loss of housing and subsequent resettlement, and the loss of man-hours as a result of diversion of labor from production to relief and repair efforts. The end result of this assessment was production loss in millions of man-hours and by individual worker. Thus, for a 13-14 July raid on Aachen, RE8 analysts placed industrial loss at 34 million man-hours or 128 days’ lost labor for every worker in the city. Loss of man-hours in fact became the sine qua non of RE8 damage assessments in 1943.42  Page 145 of 423 37%  damage to industrial and commercial buildings and housing units, estimated the total casualties, and assessed industrial loss.
