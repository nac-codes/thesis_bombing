s could fly, Harris went so far as to claim that Lancasters by themselves could inflict “a state of devastation in which surrender is inevitable” by 1 April 1944.21 As Germany’s continued resistance clearly demonstrated, Harris’s claim was wildly optimistic. Despite the unstinting sacrifice and gallantry of Bomber Command aircrews, the battle of Ber- lin was a resounding defeat.22  As the battle of Berlin raged, Bomber Command’s chief intelligence officer released an important damage assessment, compiled from earlier Allied Central Interpretation Unit (ACIU), RE8, and MEW reports, purporting to demonstrate the decisive results of city attacks from 1 March to 31 December 1943. What it did instead was highlight how little Bomber Command had done that was of decisive importance. In fact, the report foundered on the same shoals that had sunk earlier efforts: a fixation on man-hours of labor lost and the number of structures destroyed, an inability to define what comprised “decisive” results, and a failure to translate “morale effect” into a meaningful measure. The report began with an assessment that British bombing had cost Germany 1 million man-years in lost labor. “The loss inflicted on the enemy,” it said, “represents the total loss of nearly a complete month’s work by every single factory worker in the whole of greater Germany. This has not fallen in- discriminately but has affected most the essential war workers, while those who have escaped direct effects of air attacks are predominantly those who contribute least to the war effort.”22  The report was wrong on both counts, first because many of Germany’s skilled workers were already working at dispersed plants; and second, because bombing did the greatest harm to those who contributed least to the war effort, who were seen as the most expendable, or both. Those in the first category included old people, children, and to a much lesser degree women; those in the latter category included foreign forced laborers. Equ
