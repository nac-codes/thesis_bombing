fects of air attacks are predominantly those who contribute least to the war effort.”23  The report was wrong on both counts, first because many of Germany’s skilled workers were already working at dispersed plants; and second, because bombing did the greatest harm to those who contributed least to the war effort, who were seen as the most expendable, or both. Those in the first category included old people, children, and to a much lesser degree women; those in the latter category included foreign forced laborers. Equally noteworthy was an RE8 reminder that key industries, including aircraft factories and ball-bearing plants (both at the top of the Allies’ target priority list), tended to be located on the outskirts of cities and thus less likely to be damaged. Only precision-instrument and chemical factories, often in old buildings near the city center, were frequently hit.24  An even more telling sign of Bomber Command's inability to knock Germany out of the war was the estimate of cumulative damage to key industries. Serious damage, according to the report, had been done to 0.4 percent of liquid fuel production facilities (which British intelligence agencies held to be the most important and vulnerable industry), 0.2 percent of singleengine fighter aircraft factories (the highest-priority CBO target by this time), 1.1 percent of other aircraft plants (including those producing bombers, another high-priority CBO target), 0.5 percent of aeroengine plants (yet another high-priority CBO target), and 0 percent of Germany’s ball-bearing factories (ditto). The results for synthetic rubber were equally dismal, at 0.5 percent of total capacity. The only target cat- egories suffering serious damage were engineering and armaments (32.1 percent), chemicals and explosives (10 percent), textiles (13.6 percent), and food (11.8 percent).  Damage to engineering, armaments, and chemical plants, all of which were vital industries, was indeed significant. However, the measure of mer
