cent), textiles (13.6 percent), and food (11.8 percent).  Damage to engineering, armaments, and chemical plants, all of which were vital industries, was indeed significant. However, the measure of merit for “serious damage” was not percentage loss of production for each industry, but rather percentage of factory floor space, in square feet, that had been seriously damaged. But this did not equate to percentage of lost production. In many cases, production continued even in damaged factories. The Germans also dispersed increasing numbers of their industries, leaving fewer high-value installations to be damaged by city raids. Consequently, intelligence personnel underestimated both the actual production levels and the available floor space associated with each industry. Bomber Command’s figures, already inaccurate as a result of the use of damaged floor space as the measure of merit, were in fact doubly inflated because they were based on damage as a percentage of floor space at all known facilities within a given industry. These damage figures, had they been adjusted for these realities, would have been notably more modest. As for damage to textiles and food production, neither caused the Germans much discomfort. They had long been expropriating both from the occupied lands and did not experience textile shortages until 1945. And although civilians ran short on food by then, there is little evidence German armies ever did.  Damage reports for city raids were thus technically precise but analytically flawed. The flaw was due in part to the influence of Arthur Harris, who was determined to demonstrate that his city bombing effort was paying dividends. Any doubts about his influence disappear as we read his Intelligence Directorate’s statement on the effects of city raids from 6 March 1943 to 6 March 1944:  So, as this period drew to a close it became apparent that Bomber Command had done its job in preparing the way for the Armies’ return to the Continent; the back of
