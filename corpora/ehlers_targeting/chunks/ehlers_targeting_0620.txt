stimate of cumulative damage to key industries. Serious damage, according to the report, had been done to 0.4 percent of liquid fuel production facilities (which British intelligence agencies held to be the most important and vulnerable industry), 0.2 percent of singleengine fighter aircraft factories (the highest-priority CBO target by this time), 1.1 percent of other aircraft plants (including those producing bombers, another high-priority CBO target), 0.5 percent of aeroengine plants (yet another high-priority CBO target), and 0 percent of Germany’s ball-bearing factories (ditto). The results for synthetic rubber were equally dismal, at 0.5 percent of total capacity. The only target cat- egories suffering serious damage were engineering and armaments (32.1 percent), chemicals and explosives (10 percent), textiles (13.6 percent), and food (11.8 percent).  Damage to engineering, armaments, and chemical plants, all of which were vital industries, was indeed significant. However, the measure of merit for “serious damage” was not percentage loss of production for each industry, but rather percentage of factory floor space, in square feet, that had been seriously damaged. But this did not equate to percentage of lost production. In many cases, production continued even in damaged factories. The Germans also dispersed increasing numbers of their industries, leaving fewer high-value installations to be damaged by city raids. Consequently, intelligence personnel underestimated both the actual production levels and the available floor space associated with each industry. Bomber Command's figures, already inaccurate as a result of the use of damaged floor space as the measure of merit, were in fact doubly inflated because they were based on damage as a percentage of floor space at all known facilities within a given industry. These damage figures, had they been adjusted for these realities, would have been notably more modest. As for damage to textiles and food production,
