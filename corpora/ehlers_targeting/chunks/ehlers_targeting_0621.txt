at all known facilities within a given industry. These damage figures, had they been adjusted for these realities, would have been notably more modest. As for damage to textiles and food production, neither caused the Germans much discomfort. They had long been expropriating both from the occupied lands and did not experience textile shortages until 1945. And although civilians ran short on food by then, there is little evidence German armies ever did.  Damage reports for city raids were thus technically precise but analytically flawed. The flaw was due in part to the influence of Arthur Harris, who was determined to demonstrate that his city bombing effort was paying dividends. Any doubts about his influence disappear as we read his Intelligence Directorate’s statement on the effects of city raids from 6 March 1943 to 6 March 1944:  ~ oi Se ———  i Le  So, as this period drew to a close it became apparent that Bomber Command had done its job in preparing the way for the Armies’ return to the Continent; the back of the enemy’s war machine had been broken and the problem now was how the Strategic Bomber Forces were, over the next few months, to keep the shattered industries of the Reich from recovering too fast and to stop the movement of supplies and equipment from Germany to France. It had been a year of success on a scale never hitherto imagined, and there was not a home in Germany that was not reaping the harvest which it had helped to sow.22  But Bomber Command had not broken the back of the enemy’s war machine, as its own analyses made clear; nor had the Luftwaffe been defeated. The former task was accomplished in 1944-1945 with the oil and transportation campaigns in conjunction with major land campaigns, and the latter by USAAF day raids on fighter, aeroengine, and ball-bearing factories, which forced the Luftwaffe into a battle of attrition it could not win.  That leaves one other issue: morale, the secondary objective in Bomber Command’s city campaigns. Pre
