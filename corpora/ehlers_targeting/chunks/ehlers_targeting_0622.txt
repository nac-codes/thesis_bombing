nd ball-bearing factories, which forced the Luftwaffe into a battle of attrition it could not win.  That leaves one other issue: morale, the secondary objective in Bomber Command’s city campaigns. Predictably, even the brightest intelligence specialists failed to develop an equation to measure what was, in effect, not measurable in any but the most general terms. A steady stream of agent reports indicated that civilian morale deteriorated as the weight of attack increased, but they also made clear the utter lack of interest in surrender on the part of the Nazi leadership. Although it took some time to recognize the futility of trying to defeat Germany by breaking its people’s morale, the CCS directive of September 1944 closed the issue decisively. It was modeled on the original guidance in the January 1943 directive but said, “The overall mission of the Strategic Air Forces is the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic systems and the direct support of land and naval forces.”2° Morale was no longer even mentioned. And so the morale effect, first introduced by Trenchard and echoed by many airmen, finally died a quiet and long-overdue death—or so it seemed. The morale issue was in fact anything but dead and would remain a de facto target set until VE Day.22  Bomber Command City Raids, 1943: Reassessing Their Impacts  Despite Bomber Command's inability to defeat Germany on its own, its efforts did pay major dividends, especially when viewed in conjunction with USAAF raids. An RE8 report noted that from March through December 1943, bombing had done serious damage to 190 million square feet (7 square miles) of industrial and 590 million square feet (21 square miles) of nonindustrial property. This included 4.5 percent of estimated total factory building space in Germany. British bombs destroyed 1.4 million dwellings, forcing the resettlement of over 4.5 million people. This represented 6 percent of total dwelling units in
