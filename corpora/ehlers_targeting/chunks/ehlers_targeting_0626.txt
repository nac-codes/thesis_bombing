ness, as we have seen, was the large degree of disruption, dislocation, and dispersal of factories and people. When considering these effects, it is important to keep in mind one of the key arguments made at the beginning of this work: that Allied bombing was the creator of friction in the German war economy par excellence. This was certainly true of city attacks. As Richard Overy noted, “Bombing also had the effect of interrupting in arbitrary and unpredictable ways the web of supplies of materials and parts on which the whole industrial structure depended. The gradual collapse of the supply system forced firms to carry larger stocks again, and left regular gaps in the supply of components or scarce materials.”2° The battle of the Ruhr marked the first point at which these problems became pronounced. Ultra intercepts, which became more frequent in late 1943, record this growing shortage of components, including spare parts for artillery as well as Me 109 and FW 190 propellers. The salvaging of crashed fighter aircraft also took priority over all other salvage efforts, indicating how desperate the Germans were for spare parts for these planes.24  Thus, although city attacks were clearly not decisive, they did create serious difficulties for the Germans, whether in halting production in factories for varying periods of time or forcing the dispersal of war industries. This process took time and required the services of huge numbers of both skilled and unskilled workers, of which the former were in short supply as more and more skilled (and older) male workers traded in their overalls and tools for uniforms and rifles and headed to the front. Although this increasing shortage of skilled workers was an ancillary problem, its interaction with the direct and indirect effects of bombing was significant. The adverse effects of dispersion became even more acute once bombers began attacking the German transportation network in late 1944, disrupting the flow of components to c
