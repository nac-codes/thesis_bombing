of bombing was significant. The adverse effects of dispersion became even more acute once bombers began attacking the German transportation network in late 1944, disrupting the flow of components to central assembly points and causing huge quality-control problems throughout German industry. Horst Boog made this clear when he pointed out that the dispersal of aircraft production resulted in the establishment of around 700 small shops, whereas previously the entire industry resided in 30 large factories. On the human side of this disruption, Boog said, “The number of man hours lost through night alerts and absenteeism are incalculable.”22  Equally important, recent scholarship has demonstrated conclusively that the German war economy was already tightly stretched by 1943 and that certain vital materials, including steel and sub- components for a huge array of heavy weapons and aircraft, were in extremely short supply. Add to this a severe coal shortage in 1942, and the conditions for serious injury were present.?4 Three other factors exacerbated this problem, creating a major crisis in German armaments production. The first was Bomber Command’s effort against the Ruhr, which housed most of the steel and subcompo- nents factories. These targets suffered severe damage, as did the transportation hubs responsible for moving goods to arms factories and assembly points. The second was the start of intensive USAAF daylight bombing (addressed in greater detail later), which caused major damage to several different industries (especially aircraft factories and ball-bearing plants), exacerbated the already serious stoppages and dislocation in the war economy, and forced yet another acceleration of dispersal. The third factor was the high combat tempo throughout 1942-1943, which left the Wehrmacht in desperate need of replacement heavy weapons, vehicles, and other equipment. By bringing Speer’s nascent “armaments miracle” to a screeching halt during the second half of 1943, bom
