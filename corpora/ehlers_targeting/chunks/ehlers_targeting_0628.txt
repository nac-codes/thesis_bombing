ft the Wehrmacht in desperate need of replacement heavy weapons, vehicles, and other equipment. By bringing Speer’s nascent “armaments miracle” to a screeching halt during the second half of 1943, bombing created serious equipment shortages at the front. It also inhibited the Germans from developing new generations of weapons, as they instead struggled to keep current models coming off the production lines. Steel output, the key indicator for heavy-weapons production other than aircraft, suffered a 400,000-ton shortfall as a result of Bomber Command raids.24 Adam Tooze concluded, “Reading contem-  Page 150 of 423 38%  SPAS LAL OL RAO O16 1A UE UU iis CLLERLLVELIE OD, AS WE AVE SEELL, WAS LILe LAL EE ME BIS UE UMLOL UP LLU il, MLDILVUR ALIVE, ALI UO VEL Odi UL LALLULIED GLI POURS.

This was certainly true of city attacks. As Richard Overy noted, “Bombing also had the effect of interrupting in arbitrary and unpredictable ways the web of supplies of materials and parts on which the whole industrial structure depended. The gradual collapse of the supply system forced firms to carry larger stocks again, and left regular gaps in the supply of components or scarce materials.”2° The battle of the Ruhr marked the first point at which these problems became pronounced. Ultra intercepts, which became more frequent in late 1943, record this growing shortage of components, including spare parts for artillery as well as Me 109 and FW 190 propellers. The salvaging of crashed fighter aircraft also took priority over all other salvage efforts, indicating how desperate the Germans were for spare parts for these planes.24  Thus, although city attacks were clearly not decisive, they did create serious difficulties for the Germans, whether in halting production in factori
