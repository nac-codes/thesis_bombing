Germans were for spare parts for these planes.24  Thus, although city attacks were clearly not decisive, they did create serious difficulties for the Germans, whether in halting production in factories for varying periods of time or forcing the dispersal of war industries. This process took time and required the services of huge numbers of both skilled and unskilled workers, of which the former were in short supply as more and more skilled (and older) male workers traded in their overalls and tools for uniforms and rifles and headed to the front. Although this increasing shortage of skilled workers was an ancillary problem, its interaction with the direct and indirect effects of bombing was significant. The adverse effects of dispersion became even more acute once bombers began attacking the German transportation network in late 1944, disrupting the flow of components to central assembly points and causing huge quality-control problems throughout German industry. Horst Boog made this clear when he pointed out that the dispersal of aircraft production resulted in the establishment of around 700 small shops, whereas previously the entire industry resided in 30 large factories. On the human side of this disruption, Boog said, “The number of man hours lost through night alerts and absenteeism are incalculable.”22  Equally important, recent scholarship has demonstrated conclusively that the German war economy was already tightly stretched by 1943 and that certain vital materials, including steel and sub- components for a huge array of heavy weapons and aircraft, were in extremely short supply. Add to this a severe coal shortage in 1942, and the conditions for serious injury were present.22 Three other factors exacerbated this problem, creating a major crisis in German armaments production. The first was Bomber Command’s effort against the Ruhr, which housed most of the steel and subcompo- nents factories. These targets suffered severe damage, as did the transportation h
