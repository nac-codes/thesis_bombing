destroyed Bomber Command. Given the German steel and subcomponents crises, persistent attacks against the Ruhr would have paid greater dividends.*° As Hitler himself said, “The Ruhr is the one base for our industry which cannot be evacuated.”22  Even so, the battle of the Ruhr was disastrous for Germany. Although aggregate production eventually increased, it did not do so until 1944, and even then large numbers of now-outclassed weapons such as the Bf 109 and Mk-IV medium tank continued to roll off assembly lines, often unserviceable as they awaited components missing as a result of transportation and production problems. Newer weapons, such as the Panther and Tiger tanks, the FW 190, and the Me 262, appeared in smaller numbers and later than would otherwise have been the case.22 Albert Speer addressed this issue som- berly in a speech to the Reich’s Gauleiters on 6 October 1943:  We have lived through times in army equipment when our tanks were inferior to those of the Russians. .. . The Luftwaffe in the course of the last two years has quite indubitably suffered from an absolute inferiority, a technical inferiority to the weapons of the enemy. And you can see from this example [production of inferior weapons and their poor effectiveness on the battlefield] what it means to be able to procure the quantity and to be qualitatively inferior. This is quite unsupportable in our situation.22  In other words, even if the Germans could build enough weapons, they would be of little use because they were technologically inferior to those of the Allies and the Soviet Union.  As Speer noted, problems with aircraft proved particularly daunting because German pilot training was already far inferior to that of the Allies; and the cream of the German fighter force was about to face annihilation in the skies over the Reich. Finally, even as production peaked in July 1944, the oil campaign was getting into high gear, robbing the German army of mobility. It also created a cataclysmi
