nnihilation in the skies over the Reich. Finally, even as production peaked in July 1944, the oil campaign was getting into high gear, robbing the German army of mobility. It also created a cataclysmic aviation fuel shortage for the many new but already outdated aircraft—and their hopelessly outclassed young pilots—as they made their way to “the front” (which, in their case, was dir- ectly overhead). As an American intelligence officer with access to Ultra noted,  The Germans did manage ultimately to restore a very high scale of fighter production. But the setbacks of the summer were so effective as to postpone fighter expansion and cripple their fighter training through the critical period until American fighters themselves won unquestioned air supremacy over every corner of Germany. The very loss of production entailed by the dispersal process itself helped to contribute to the single-engine fighter shortage of which the ensuing months were to provide incontrovertible evidence.42  When viewed in this light, the opportunity costs to German front-line strength were startlingly high. The production cap imposed in the latter half of 1943 resulted in the production of 35 percent fewer tanks, 31 percent fewer aircraft, and 42 percent fewer lorries at a time when having them really mattered, given Germany’s still viable, if unenviable, operational, fuel, and manpower positions. Without this cap, 30,000 additional tanks and 55,000 additional aircraft could have rolled off the production lines.4+  Page 150 of 423 38%  the first point at which these probiems became pronounced. Ultra intercepts, which became more frequent in late 1445, record this growing shortage of components, including spare parts for artillery as well as Me 109 and FW 190 propellers. The salvaging of crashed fighter aircraft also took priority over all other salvage efforts, indicating how desperate the Germans were for spare parts for these planes.24  Thus, although city attacks were clearly not decisiv
