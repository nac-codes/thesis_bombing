Given the German steel and subcomponents crises, persistent attacks against the Ruhr would have paid greater dividends.*° As Hitler himself said, “The Ruhr is the one base for our industry which cannot be evacuated.”22  Even so, the battle of the Ruhr was disastrous for Germany. Although aggregate production eventually increased, it did not do so until 1944, and even then large numbers of now-outclassed weapons such as the Bf 109 and Mk-IV medium tank continued to roll off assembly lines, often unserviceable as they awaited components missing as a result of transportation and production problems.
