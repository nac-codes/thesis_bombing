Hitler and Goring were clearly alarmed by the Ruhr raids and began a huge effort to move both AAA and fighters to the Reich for air defense purposes. On 31 May 1943, the Fithrer simply said, “It is necessary to increase the flak and night fighter forces in order to protect German cities.”“2  Although many of the AAA crews were too old or too young for combat duty, and although they actually downed more aircraft than German fighter pilots, the facts of this huge diversion of material and human resources remain unchanged.

Taken together with all the other damage caused by Bomber Command, one cannot help but be struck by the force of Sebastian Cox’s simple observation about the massive diversion of German personnel and weapons to air-defense duties: “This rather begs the question as to why, if the effects on the Reich economy were not signifi- cant, the Germans felt it necessary to divert military forces badly needed at the front to protecting the Reich?”44  a ed NN Di i as ee Di Bi a Ne ek a nh DN i ee ee AT i a ee ee Sle eh a te 2 ot  Page 152 of 423 39%  ihe diversion of proauctive capacity, weapons, and Manpower to defend the Keich against Neavy DomMbers aiso proved Costly. by November i742, Ultra intercepts confirmed that German aircrart were already leaving the Eastern Front for France to counter bomber operations against U-boat bases. Although these raids proved ineffective, Luftwaffe assets sent to counter them never returned to Russia; they simply folded into the mushrooming Reich air-defense effort. Ultra also confirmed details of the vital conference in January 1943, during which Adolf Galland presided over planning for the activation of the huge fighter
