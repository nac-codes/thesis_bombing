the mushrooming Reich air-defense effort. Ultra also confirmed details of the vital conference in January 1943, during which Adolf Galland presided over planning for the activation of the huge fighter arm that would comprise Luftflotte Reich. These intercepts confirmed the growing flood of requirements for aircraft to return to the Reich. In summer 1942, the Luftwaffe had concentrated 60 percent of its air strength in the east. By July 1943, only 36 percent remained facing the Russians, and an even more pathetic 21 percent of the fighter force. By January 1944, only 17 percent of the fighter force was still in the east. Both day and night fighters, and a large number of Ju-88 bombers reequipped with air-intercept radar for night operations, made up this exodus, indicating that the Germans were every bit as concerned about Bomber Command attacks as they were about USAAF daylight attacks. Equally serious, in early June 1943, Goring ordered a massive dispersal of all aircraft production and Luftwaffe operational assets. By October 1943, combat units had begun cannibalizing aircraft for spare parts as the subcomponents crisis and other effects of the Ruhr campaign took their toll.4%  The huge diversion of antiaircraft artillery (AAA) is well-known in general terms, but many key details are not. Production of AAA accounted for 14 percent of total war production in the first quarter of 1940 but 29 percent by the first quarter of 1943—all before the USAAF had made any serious contributions to the fight. During this same period, the number of heavy AAA pieces in greater Germany increased from 1,700 to 4,500—some 55 percent of all Wehrmacht AAA assets. When one adds medium and light AAA—also of great use at the front—the number was 15,000, with 11,000 of those in the Reich itself, an incredible 73 percent of all AAA assets. Had the Germans been free to allocate AAA as they saw fit, and without the production limitations brought on by steel shortages, they could have deployed
