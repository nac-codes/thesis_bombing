aggregation of factors that brought about the steel famine of 1943, which put a stop to Speer’s armaments expansion until early 1944.48  Finally, although wartime damage assessments did not reveal it, British bombing prompted Hitler to support several outrageously irrational, expensive, and ineffective programs, including the V-2, which caused a huge diversion of scarce resources. Michael Neufeld has estimated that, given the relative sizes of the German and American wartime economies, and total expenditures on development of the V-2 and the atomic bomb, the Nazis spent as great a proportion of their wartime budget on the former as the Americans did on the latter. In view of the V-2’s abject failure to fulfill its role as the  Raich’e nramior “ravance weannn ” wa can anly charactariza the nrncram ac 9 ealaceal wacta nf affart WViewad in thiclicht Rritich hnmhing naid wat annthar cionificant dividand awen if it want wnmen_  Page 154 of 423 39%  eee a ee ee ee ge ee ee ee ee ee ee ae ee 1944, only 17 percent of the fighter force was still in the east. Both day and night fighters, and a large number of Ju-88 bombers reequipped with air-intercept radar for night operations, made up this exodus, indicating that the Germans were every bit as concerned about Bomber Command attacks as they were about USAAF daylight attacks. Equally serious, in early June 1943, Géring ordered a massive dispersal of all aircraft production and Luftwaffe operational assets. By October 1943, combat units had begun cannibalizing aircraft for spare parts as the subcomponents crisis and other effects of the Ruhr campaign took their toll.42  The huge diversion of antiaircraft artillery (AAA) is well-known in general terms, but many key details are not. Production of AAA accounted for 14 percent of total war production in the first quarter of 1940 but 29 percent by the first quarter of 1943—all before the USAAF had made any serious contributions to the fight. During this same period, the number of
