al war production in the first quarter of 1940 but 29 percent by the first quarter of 1943—all before the USAAF had made any serious contributions to the fight. During this same period, the number of heavy AAA pieces in greater Germany increased from 1,700 to 4,500—some 55 percent of all Wehrmacht AAA assets. When one adds medium and light AAA—also of great use at the front—the number was 15,000, with 11,000 of those in the Reich itself, an incredible 73 percent of all AAA assets. Had the Germans been free to allocate AAA as they saw fit, and without the production limitations brought on by steel shortages, they could have deployed another 13,500 guns to the front. Merely the aluminum used up in the production of AAA fuses would have been enough to allow for production of an additional 40,000 fighter aircraft, although their utility would have been severely limited as a result of current and future pilot and fuel shortages. The same cannot be said of heavy AAA pieces—all potent tank killers—and the 1 million men who manned them in Germany rather than on the Eastern Front. Hitler and Goring were clearly alarmed by the Ruhr raids and began a huge effort to move both AAA and fighters to the Reich for air defense purposes. On 31 May 1943, the Fithrer simply said, “It is necessary to increase the flak and night fighter forces in order to protect German cities.”*2  Although many of the AAA crews were too old or too young for combat duty, and although they actually downed more aircraft than German fighter pilots, the facts of this huge diversion of material and human resources remain unchanged. In addition, the German requirement to choose between producing AAA pieces and ammunition and conventional artillery and munitions helped create major gun and ammunition shortages on every front by 1944. Taken together with all the other damage caused by Bomber Command, one cannot help but be struck by the force of Sebastian Cox’s simple observation about the massive diversion of Ge
