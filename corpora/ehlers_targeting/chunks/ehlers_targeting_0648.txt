ery front by 1944. Taken together with all the other damage caused by Bomber Command, one cannot help but be struck by the force of Sebastian Cox’s simple observation about the massive diversion of German personnel and weapons to air-defense duties: “This rather begs the question as to why, if the effects on the Reich economy were not signifi- cant, the Germans felt it necessary to divert military forces badly needed at the front to protecting the Reich?”44  Recent scholarship has also reassessed an issue long thought put to rest: morale and nutrition among German workers. Although German morale never broke, the relentless bombing clearly reduced it, while the gradually tightening civilian rations caused higher levels of sickness and absenteeism. Even workers at their posts were less productive as the slow effects of nutritional inadequacies set in. At the Ford plant in Cologne, for instance, 25 percent of the workforce was absent from work each day.*? Particularly in the Ruhr, where air-raid sirens went off constantly in spring and summer 1943, and indeed throughout much of 1944 and early 1945, simple exhaustion would have been an important factor in gauging productivity. As already noted, there were too few skilled German workers to begin with, and the increasing drafts of older, skilled male workers for the military led to the importation of forced laborers. How well they performed their tasks is difficult to measure with precision, but there can be little doubt that they were less capable or, just as important, less dedicated than the German men they replaced. As Horst Boog has noted:  The number of man-hours lost by frequent air alerts is impossible to measure, but since machine tools suffered relatively little from bomb damage, the human factor must be rated very high in accounting for the decrease in fighter—and other—production in later 1943.... People continued to do their duty in a fatalistic and apathetic mood, and this did not increase their devotion to
