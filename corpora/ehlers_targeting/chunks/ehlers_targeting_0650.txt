orts virtually shut down Rumanian oil and agricultural deliveries to the Reich in summer 1944. Together with the USAAF, Bomber Command also destroyed 111 U-boats in production and another 54 already delivered to the Kriegsmarine. Additionally, 423 merchant vessels were sunk between 1 January 1940 and 30 June 1943, placing the German steel position, already precarious, in a severe predicament. Mining and ship attacks were elements in an aggregation of factors that brought about the steel famine of 1943, which put a stop to Speer’s armaments expansion until early 1944.48  Finally, although wartime damage assessments did not reveal it, British bombing prompted Hitler to support several outrageously irrational, expensive, and ineffective programs, including the V-2, which caused a huge diversion of scarce resources. Michael Neufeld has estimated that, given the relative sizes of the German and American wartime economies, and total expenditures on development of the V-2 and the atomic bomb, the Nazis spent as great a proportion of their wartime budget on the former as the Americans did on the latter. In view of the V-2’s abject failure to fulfill its role as the Reich’s premier “revenge weapon,” we can only characterize the program as a colossal waste of effort. Viewed in this light, British bombing paid yet another significant dividend, even if it went unmen- tioned by air intelligence experts.42  Generalleutnant Josef Schmid, commander of I Jagdkorps, which controlled all Luftflotte Reich day and night fighters from the end of 1943 to VE Day, said after the war that Bomber Command had done little of consequence before the 1,000-plane Cologne raid in May 1942. After that, however, the systematic, increasingly accurate, and steadily heavier nature of the offensive magnified bombing’s indirect effects, as Schmid put it, to an unbearable extent. Bomber Command’s expert abilitv to find and bomb targets bv fall 1944 made the second Ruhr offensive even worse than the first. O
