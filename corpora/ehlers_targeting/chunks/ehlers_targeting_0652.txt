Harris pushed hard for these mine-laying missions while he was deputy director of plans at the air staff in 1939. His efforts paid off. By April 1940, Hampden bombers were deploying magnetic mines—an operation that grew dramatically in scale, sophistication, and effectiveness when Harris took charge at Bomber Command. By VE Day, Bomber Command had deployed 47,000 aerial mines and engaged in other raids that sank 717 merchant vessels and damaged another 665. This effort extended to the Danube River, where Bomber Command 205 Group’s efforts virtually shut down Rumanian oil and agricultural deliveries to the Reich in summer 1944. Together with the USAAF, Bomber Command also destroyed 111 U-boats in production and another 54 already delivered to the Kriegsmarine. Additionally, 423 merchant vessels were sunk between 1 January 1940 and 30 June 1943, placing the German steel position, already precarious, in a severe predicament. Mining and ship attacks were elements in an aggregation of factors that brought about the steel famine of 1943, which put a stop to Speer’s armaments expansion until early 1944.48  Finally, although wartime damage assessments did not reveal it, British bombing prompted Hitler to support several outrageously irrational, expensive, and ineffective programs, including the V-2, which caused a huge diversion of scarce resources. Michael Neufeld has estimated that, given the relative sizes of the German and American wartime economies, and total expenditures on development of the V-2 and the atomic bomb, the Nazis spent as great a proportion of their wartime budget on the former as the Americans did on the latter. In view of the V-2’s abject failure to fulfill its role as the Reich’s premier “revenge weapon,” we can only characterize the program as a colossal waste of effort. Viewed in this light, British bombing paid yet another significant dividend, even if it went unmen- tioned by air intelligence experts.42  Generalleutnant Josef Schmid, commander of
