Command aircrews clearly mattered, both in terms of shortening the war and shortening the Grand Alliance’s casualty lists.  Although RAF intelligence for Bomber Command raids discovered several of these effects, others went unnoticed, in large measure because of the incredibly complex task at hand. Assessing damage to entire urban areas and converting those assessments into meaningful measures of success was inherently complex and frustrating. Such frustration was much less evident in damage reports assessing the American bombing effort with its focus on specific facilities and target sets. These assessments demonstrated not only that USAAF bombing could at times be very accurate, but also that American photointerpreters were becoming adept in their own right at assessing bombing accuracy, effects, and effectiveness.  American Bombing Accelerates: Air Intelligence Implications  The arrival of American specialists accelerated rapidly in 1943. However, the differences between British and American bombing doctrine created several problems as the British sought to meet the Americans’ requirements while training and integrating them at the Air Ministry, ACIU, RE8, and MEW. The first effort to solve these problems occurred at a meeting called by the Air Ministry in March 1943 to discuss requirements for producing damage assessments satisfactory to both parties. Group Captain Sidney Bufton, the Air Ministry’s deputy director of bomber operations and a firm believer in both American and British precision bombardment, chaired the meeting. His emphasis on the production of damage assessments for precision and area attacks helped to ensure a mature intelligence capability was in place for assessing the effects of the transportation and oil offensives in 1944-1945. Bufton began by saying the commands and agencies represented at the meeting produced a variety of reports on bomb damage, but none produced anything assessing the aggregate effects of area and precision bombing or t
