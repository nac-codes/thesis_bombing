saying the commands and agencies represented at the meeting produced a variety of reports on bomb damage, but none produced anything assessing the aggregate effects of area and precision bombing or the ways in which they were either complementary or  duplicative. Bufton was concerned that no interagency machinery existed to assess the bombing effects on various target sets. “If we made a series of concentrated and successful raids,” he asked, “arhat uranld ha tha tra affact anan the Garman urar affart27Sh  Page 156 of 423 40%  Se ee ee ee Eee eee ee eee ee ee ee eee eee  indirect effects, as Schmid put it, to an unbearable extent. Bomber Command's expert ability to find and bomb targets by fall 1944 made the second Ruhr offensive even worse than the first. On the basis of this increasing accuracy and level of damage, Schmid believed it would only have been a matter of time before Bomber Command city attacks paralyzed the German war economy by destroying transportation nodes, doing direct damage to industries, and maximizing friction.*2 Like Speer, who said American bombing did more damage than the British, Schmid may have been catering to his interrogators, but his views are nonetheless worth considering in view of the increasing body of evidence pointing to Bomber Command’s effects on the Reich's war effort.  It is also important to remember the grand and military-strategic contexts within which Bomber Command operated. Bomber Command’s leadership had orders to carry the war to Germany—and it was the only instrument for doing so until 1944. In fact, there is clear evidence that Bomber Command's city bombing, while clearly not decisive, did create significant difficulties for German war production. In this sense, it achieved the objective set for it by the CCS. The bravery and sacrifice of Bomber Command aircrews clearly mattered, both in terms of shortening the war and shortening the Grand Alliance’s casualty lists.
