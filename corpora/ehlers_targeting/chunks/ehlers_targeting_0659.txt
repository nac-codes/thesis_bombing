at the Northwest African Air Force reconnaissance capability was already a combined operation and worked very well. He proposed that reconnaissance and photointerpretation be structured the same way in Great Britain. “American Photo Reconnaissance and Photo Interpretation activity,” Eaker said, “must be closely integrated for control and coordination with similar British agencies.’=4 By September, these combined operations procedures, already in place for nine months, were codified in a USAAF instruction directing that all American requests for aerial photography be mailed direct to ADI(Ph) via courier or made via secure phone call.=  In October, the Bomber Command and 8th Air Force intelligence directorates (Int. 1 and A-2) met to determine how best to produce and share damage reports of mutual interest. They discussed four topics: procedures for sharing copies of photographs taken by each country’s reconnaissance sorties, provision of rapid reports from reconnaissance sorties to the other country’s intelligence directorate, rapid sharing of bomb plots and other intelligence materials produced at flying units and headquarters, and the proper division of labor for producing long-term records of bomb damage.

Such frustration was much less evident in damage reports assessing the American bombing effort with its focus on specific facilities and target sets. These assessments demonstrated not only that USAAF bombing could at times be very accurate, but also that American photointerpreters were becoming adept in their own right at assessing bombing accuracy, effects, and effectiveness.  American Bombing Accelerates: Air Intelligence Implications  The arrival of American specialists accelerated rapidly in 1943. However, the differences between British and American bombing doctrine created several problems as the British s
