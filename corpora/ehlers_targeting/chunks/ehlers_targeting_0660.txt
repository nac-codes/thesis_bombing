lligence Implications  The arrival of American specialists accelerated rapidly in 1943. However, the differences between British and American bombing doctrine created several problems as the British sought to meet the Americans’ requirements while training and integrating them at the Air Ministry, ACIU, RE8, and MEW. The first effort to solve these problems occurred at a meeting called by the Air Ministry in March 1943 to discuss requirements for producing damage assessments satisfactory to both parties. Group Captain Sidney Bufton, the Air Ministry’s deputy director of bomber operations and a firm believer in both American and British precision bombardment, chaired the meeting. His emphasis on the production of damage assessments for precision and area attacks helped to ensure a mature intelligence capability was in place for assessing the effects of the transportation and oil offensives in 1944-1945. Bufton began by saying the commands and agencies represented at the meeting produced a variety of reports on bomb damage, but none produced anything assessing the aggregate effects of area and precision bombing or the ways in which they were either complementary or duplicative. Bufton was concerned that no interagency machinery existed to assess the bombing effects on various target sets. “If we made a series of concentrated and successful raids,” he asked, “what would be the true effect upon the German war effort?”=+  There was general agreement on the need for the ACIU and RE8 to produce damage assessments for area and precision raids and for MEW to assess aggregate damage done by both. In a veiled attack on his own command’s bombing doctrine, Group Captain Paynter, Bomber Command’s chief intelligence officer, argued that “we have got to look ahead to the time when we will be more accurate in our bombing; when we have bombed out the heart of our present targets we should have to look elsewhere.”=2 Clearly, Paynter saw the air war extending beyond city bombing to inv
