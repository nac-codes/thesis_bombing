hole-heartedly in the reconnaissance and interpretation effort ... were well equipped on arrival and were not long in tak- ing full advantage of the operational experience of the British Units.”=2  Cooperation in the reconnaissance arena was equally crucial to the development of an effective damage assessment process for American bombing. From the outset, British photographic reconnaissance units (PRUs) flew sorties for 8th Air Force. By 1943, all American requests for reconnaissance cover went directly to the assistant director of intelligence, photography (ADI(Ph)) at the Air Ministry, which prioritized all such requests from British and American customers. ADI(Ph) exercised operational control over the PRUs and the Central Interpretation Unit (CIU) by putting in place centralized requirements-management and collection-management processes. To enhance this effort, Eaker reminded Portal that the Northwest African Air Force reconnaissance capability was already a combined operation and worked very well. He proposed that reconnaissance and photointerpretation be structured the same way in Great Britain. “American Photo Reconnaissance and Photo Interpretation activity,” Eaker said, “must be closely integrated for control and coordination with similar British agencies.”=4 By September, these combined operations procedures, already in place for nine months, were codified in a USAAF instruction directing that all American requests for aerial photography be mailed direct to ADI(Ph) via courier or made via secure phone call.*  In October, the Bomber Command and 8th Air Force intelligence directorates (Int. 1 and A-2) met to determine how best to produce and share damage reports of mutual interest. They discussed four topics: procedures for sharing copies of photographs taken by each country’s reconnaissance sorties, provision of rapid reports from reconnaissance sorties to the other country’s intelligence directorate, rapid sharing of bomb plots and other intelligence mate
