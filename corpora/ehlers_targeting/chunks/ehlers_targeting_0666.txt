American photointerpreters met RE8’s high expectations was a re- flection of the effective instruction received from their British counterparts and of their own capabilities. An even more fundamental sign of 1st PID’s importance was a decision by 8th Air Force senior officers to move the unit from RAF Medmenham to RAF Pinetree. The move proved beneficial because once K Section joined the 1st PID at Pinetree in May 1944, the entire first-phase and second-phase damage-assessment apparatus was located next door to the British reconnaissance squadrons at Benson and the USAAF units at Mount Farm. This resulted in faster production and dissemination of K Section’s immediate interpretation reports, which meant flying units, headquarters, and target-selection boards such as the Railway Targets Committee, the Joint Oil Targets Committee, and the Com- bined Strategic Targets Committee received necessary information in a matter of hours during the oil and transportation offensives.*2  The 8th Air Force staff was also cooperating more closely with RE8, to which fourteen of sixty-three people assigned in August 1943 were American. The numbers continued to increase. In addition, 8th Air Force was becoming more reliant on targeting and damage-assessment products authored by an American agency, the Enemy Objectives Unit (EOU), at the U.S. Embassy in London, which worked closely with the Air Ministry, RE8, and MEW.*8  The ACIU Matures: Leveraging Combined and Interagency Assets  The arrival of large numbers of Americans at the ACIU brought it to maturity by 1944. From their initial role as apprentices, USAAF photointerpreters quickly transformed the ACIU from a British to a combined operation. By June 1943, seventy Americans were working at Medmenham in several of the ACIU’s twenty-eight sections, with another twenty people en route. Another sixty-seven Americans of the 1st PID were working at RAF Pinetree. Americans were present in all sections by early 1943. These included first-
