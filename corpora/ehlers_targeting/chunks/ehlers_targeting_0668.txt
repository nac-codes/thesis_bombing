ents, and KS reports, which assessed German rubble- clearance and repair efforts and included target illustrations showing damage to specific buildings. They also produced KR reports to address requests for specialized assessments. By 1944, each K Sec- tion damage assessment was going to between 30 and 485 addressees.*1  The next ACIU second-phase office involved in this work—D (industry) Section—tracked every known industrial facility in the Reich and occupied lands.

Fortunately, American photointerpreters were fast learners. The 1st Photographic Intelligence Detachment (1st PID) became so effective that by summer 1943, it provided specialized damage assessments for RE8 analysts to use as they prepared detailed damage reports. This was significant because RE8 reports were the gold standard, and the analysts who wrote them required high-quality data and analysis. The fact that American photointerpreters met RE8’s high expectations was a re- flection of the effective instruction received from their British counterparts and of their own capabilities. An even more fundamental sign of 1st PID’s importance was a decision by 8th Air Force senior officers to move the unit from RAF Medmenham to RAF Pinetree. The move proved beneficial because once K Section joined the 1st PID at Pinetree in May 1944, the entire first-phase and second-phase damage-assessment apparatus was located next door to the British reconnaissance squadrons at Benson and the USAAF units at Mount Farm. This resulted in faster production and dissemination of K Section’s immediate interpretation reports, which meant flying units, headquarters, and target-selection boards such as the Railway Targets Committee, the Joint Oil Targets Committee, and the Com- bined Strategic
