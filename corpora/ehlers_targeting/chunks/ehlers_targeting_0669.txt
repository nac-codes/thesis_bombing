ediate interpretation reports, which meant flying units, headquarters, and target-selection boards such as the Railway Targets Committee, the Joint Oil Targets Committee, and the Com- bined Strategic Targets Committee received necessary information in a matter of hours during the oil and transportation offensives.=2  The 8th Air Force staff was also cooperating more closely with RE8, to which fourteen of sixty-three people assigned in August 1943 were American. The numbers continued to increase. In addition, 8th Air Force was becoming more reliant on targeting and damage-assessment products authored by an American agency, the Enemy Objectives Unit (EOU), at the U.S. Embassy in London, which worked closely with the Air Ministry, RE8, and MEW.28  The ACIU Matures: Leveraging Combined and Interagency Assets  The arrival of large numbers of Americans at the ACIU brought it to maturity by 1944. From their initial role as apprentices, USAAF photointerpreters quickly transformed the ACIU from a British to a combined operation. By June 1943, seventy Americans were working at Medmenham in several of the ACIU’s twenty-eight sections, with another twenty people en route. Another sixty-seven Americans of the 1st PID were working at RAF Pinetree. Americans were present in all sections by early 1943. These included first-phase sections collocated with reconnaissance units to produce immediate interpretation reports; second-phase sections at Medmenham, including K (Damage Assessment), D (Industry), and F (Transportation) Sections; and at RAF Pinetree, where 1st PID provided second-phase analyses for USAAF heavy-bomber raids as K Section did for Bomber Command missions.*2  By June 1943 K Section’s Anglo-American photointerpreters had standardized procedures for second-phase damage assessments. The rigorous standards for this process were clear in instructions issued to K Section interpreters:  In drawing up such summaries the Section has been instructed that all statements are to b
