ntained a card index with several thousand entries, each providing the name of the facility, what it produced, its location, its exact coordinates, and a list of photographic cover by sortie number, print number, date, and quality. The section was divided into five teams, each responsible for one of the following industry groups: iron, steel, nonferrous metals, and electronic equipment; engineering, including motor transport and ar- mored fighting vehicle production, ball bearings, and textiles; oil, coal, coke, and gas; electric power including dams; and chemicals, explosives, synthetic rubber, and plastics.®2  Each working group produced detailed interpretation reports and diagrams with the key buildings and components at each facility, which were used at the Air Ministry, Bomber Command, and other ACIU sections to produce target materials and damage assessments. From fall 1943, much of D Section’s work was devoted to the production of reports on industrial activity. Although such reports were issued for all installations, most addressed oil plants, oil refineries, oil-storage depots, and tank factories.  Representatives of the section were also attached to the Joint Oil Targets Committee, the Armored Fighting Vehicle Targets Committee, and the Jockey Committee (which selected targets for attack in the German aircraft industry), all of which were ultimately subsumed by the Combined Strategic Targets Committee. They also recommended priorities for targets within each industry on the basis of their level of output and previous damage. During the oil offensive, D Section analysts worked closely with their K Section counterparts on damage assessments, providing the insights required to analyze the level of activity at each plant or refinery after an attack, and if the facility was knocked out of action, the amount of time required for repairs to bring it back on line at 25, 50, 75, or 100 percent of preattack capacity.
