ility was knocked out of action, the amount of time required for repairs to bring it back on line at 25, 50, 75, or 100 percent of preattack capacity. Photointerpreters involved in making these judgments maintained daily telephone contact with British and American headquarters and flying units. They also sent frequent requests for reconnaissance coverage of recently bombed facilities to ADI(Ph) and later the Joint Photo Reconnaissance Center (JPRC) so they could monitor repair efforts and the likely date at which each plant would again become operational and thus ready for reattack. To facilitate this process during the oil offensive, D Section interpreters built a board listing each oil target, the dates at- tacked, latest reconnaissance coverage, target-priority ranking, and operational status. They devised similar boards for armored-vehicle targets and for coke oven plants, which produced benzol.®4  Page 159 of 423 40%  an operation is to be made. [However,] it is felt that the value of the P.I. reports will be diminished if men of high intellectual caliber are debarred from stating the results of a careful and detailed study of the information obtainable—a study which no other officer is in a position to make.©2  This guidance left no doubt as to the high standards demanded of K Section interpreters and emphasized their authority to make reasoned statements about the results of their studies. These air intelligence experts, who grew in number from nine in 1940 to fifty-four in 1944, produced K reports, which were standard damage assessments, and KS reports, which assessed German rubble- clearance and repair efforts and included target illustrations showing damage to specific buildings. They also produced KR reports to address requests for specialized assessments. By 1944, each K Sec- tion damage assessment was going to between 30 and 485 addressees.*  The next ACIU second-phase office involved in this work—D (Industry) Section—tracked every known industrial faci
