were ultimately subsumed by the Combined Strategic Targets Committee. They also recommended priorities for targets within each industry on the basis of their level of output and previous damage. During the oil offensive, D Section analysts worked closely with their K Section counterparts on damage assessments, providing the insights required to analyze the level of activity at each plant or refinery after an attack, and if the facility was knocked out of action, the amount of time required for repairs to bring it back on line at 25, 50, 75, or 100 percent of preattack capacity. Photointerpreters involved in making these judgments maintained daily telephone contact with British and American headquarters and flying units. They also sent frequent requests for reconnaissance coverage of recently bombed facilities to ADI(Ph) and later the Joint Photo Reconnaissance Center (JPRC) so they could monitor repair efforts and the likely date at which each plant would again become operational and thus ready for reattack. To facilitate this process during the oil offensive, D Section interpreters built a board listing each oil target, the dates at- tacked, latest reconnaissance coverage, target-priority ranking, and operational status. They devised similar boards for armored-vehicle targets and for coke oven plants, which produced benzol.®  Photointerpreters from D Section also worked closely with analysts at RE8 to produce a vital tool known as the target vulnerability note. Together, D Section and RE8 produced several hundred of these for important targets such as oil plants and marshaling yards. Each provided a summary of target characteristics, key components that had to be damaged or destroyed to reduce or stop production, and the optimal combination of bombs and fuses. One such note, on the Bergius-process oil plant at Pélitz, listed gas generators, compressors, circulators, and injectors as key components to be destroyed and recommended 500-pound bombs as the proper weapo
