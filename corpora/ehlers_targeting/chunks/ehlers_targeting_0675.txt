h note, on the Bergius-process oil plant at Pélitz, listed gas generators, compressors, circulators, and injectors as key components to be destroyed and recommended 500-pound bombs as the proper weapons. To illustrate the plant’s key components, RE8 analysts included an ACIU diagram of Pélitz, which provided a numerical reference and brief explanation for every building. When the oil offensive began, the ACIU and RE8 used this diagram to denote previous damage (shaded in blue) and damage caused by the latest raid (shaded in red).$*  The last second-phase office heavily involved in damage-assessment work was F (Transportation) Section, which began with seven people in 1941 and grew to fifteen by 1944. The head of section was a railway expert in civilian life who had been drafted, given sufficient rank, and put in charge, a story repeated many times at the ACIU, which hired civilians with detailed knowledge of various industries. By September 1941 the section had produced assessments of all major railroad and inland waterway targets to include the level and type of activity as well as overall importance. When the bombing of railroads and, later, bridges, viaducts, and canals in France and Belgium began in March 1944 in preparation for Operation OVERLORD, F Section interpreters had already studied the effects of raids flown against these target types in 1943 and could assess damage with great accuracy. Like their counterparts in D Section, they worked closely with K Section to ensure details on bomb damage made it into K reports. They also worked directly with the Railway Targets Committee to choose the highest-priority targets for attack on the basis of preattack importance and the effects of previous raids on operational capability. Finally, they worked closely with a littleknown but vital intelligence organization, the Railway Research Service, which led the damage-assessment effort for the transportation offensive against the French and Belgian railroads. In 1944 a
