ttleknown but vital intelligence organization, the Railway Research Service, which led the damage-assessment effort for the transportation offensive against the French and Belgian railroads. In 1944 and early 1945, F Section also produced over 500 reports on railroad and waterway targets for use in the production of target materials and damage assessments.®©  Despite their less substantial role in the assessment process, other ACIU Sections got involved on occasion. One was L (Aircraft and Aircraft Industry) Section, which provided several crucial insights. One was the discovery that an 8th Air Force raid on the FW 190 factory at Bremen in April 1943, which had caused serious damage, had bombed an empty facility. The Germans had previously dispersed production from Bremen to Marienburg and a number of smaller plants. This discovery made future targeting and damage-assessment efforts more effective because it prompted interpret- ers to look for signs of dispersal and indicators of such activity.  Two other ACIU offices of note were R1 and R2 (Combined Operations) Sections, which engaged in targeting and damage assessments with and for the Special Air Service teams that played an important role in organizing and supplying the Maquis (French Resistance) in 1944. This interaction proved vital to intelligence efforts during the Normandy campaign and the breakout and pursuit across France. Special Air Service and Maquis teams provided timely damage assessments of their attacks on fuel supplies, trains, barges, and other logistical assets, which complemented Allied bomb- ing raids on marshaling yards, bridges, viaducts, and canals.®®  From a command-and-control perspective, the Technical Control Office also deserves mention. This office fielded production requests from outside agencies, first via ADI(Ph) and then, beginning in May 1944, from the JPRC. A subordinate body known as the Progress Section logged and prioritized all production requests, directed ACIU sections to
