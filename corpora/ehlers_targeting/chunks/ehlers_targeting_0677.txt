Photointerpreters from D Section also worked closely with analysts at RE8 to produce a vital tool known as the target vulnerability note. Together, D Section and RE8 produced several hundred of these for important targets such as oil plants and marshaling yards. Each provided a summary of target characteristics, key components that had to be damaged or destroyed to reduce or stop production, and the optimal combination of bombs and fuses. One such note, on the Bergius-process oil plant at Politz, listed gas generators, compressors, circulators, and injectors as key components to be destroyed and recommended 500-pound bombs as the proper weapons. To illustrate the plant’s key components, RE8 analysts included an ACIU diagram of Pélitz, which provided a numerical reference and brief explanation for every building. When the oil offensive began, the ACIU and RE8 used this diagram to denote previous damage (shaded in blue) and damage caused by the latest raid (shaded in red).  The last second-phase office heavily involved in damage-assessment work was F (Transportation) Section, which began with seven people in 1941 and grew to fifteen by 1944. The head of section was a railway expert in civilian life who had been drafted, given sufficient rank, and put in charge, a story repeated many times at the ACIU, which hired civilians with detailed knowledge of various industries. By September 1941 the section had produced assessments of all major railroad and inland waterway targets to include the level and
