during the Schweinfurt and Regensburg missions in August and October 1943.  Nonetheless, photointerpreters recognized how accurate USAAF bombing could be under the proper conditions. The 9 October 1943 attack on Marienburg, for instance, did such severe damage to the plant that it produced no new aircraft until February 1944. By then the Americans were able to return with many more bombers escorted by P-51 fighters. Virtually every building at the factory was destroyed or severely damaged, and over 100 FW 190s under construction were destroyed. Some 58 percent of bombs fell within 1,000 feet of the aim point, 83 percent within 2,000 feet. Eaker referred to this raid as “the classic example of precision bombing.” This was clearly a case in which bombing was accurate and produced dramatic effects. Attacks continued for several months, and the Germans kept trying to put the pieces back together. But doing so became increasingly difficult; and although they eked out small numbers of aircraft, catastrophic fuel and pilot shortages made  Page 164 of 423 42%  damage. Ihe print library contained 6.5 million prints stored on 2.5 miles of shelves. the Fhotograpnic section Nandled 60,000 tins of film per month and nad several multiprinters capable of producing 1,000 photos per hour. Although the ACIU had not yet grown so large in 1943, it was essentially mature and capable of providing reports to hundreds of customers within hours. These reports provided a foundation for detailed third-phase damage assessments produced at RE8 and MEW. By summer 1943, the ACIU was mature and able to determine bombing effects and effective- ness, which were intensifying rapidly with the arrival of American heavy bombers.  USAAF Raids on Aircraft Factories and Ball-Bearing Plants  From summer 1943 to spring 1944, USAAF heavy bombers and fighter escorts (once they received drop tanks in January 1944) took the air war to the Luftwaffe in an effort to gain air supremacy over the Reich. The battle wa
