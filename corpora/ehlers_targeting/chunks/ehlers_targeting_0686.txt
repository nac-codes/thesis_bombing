spring 1944, USAAF heavy bombers and fighter escorts (once they received drop tanks in January 1944) took the air war to the Luftwaffe in an effort to gain air supremacy over the Reich. The battle was long and costly, and at times it teetered on the edge of failure. But the Americans gained the victory and with it air supremacy not only over the Reich, but also over Normandy. During this huge battle of attrition, intelligence specialists honed their analytical skills by assessing damage to aircraft factories, ball-bearing plants, marshaling yards, and oil plants.  The progress of this offensive against aircraft factories and ball-bearing plants during summer and fall 1943 is recounted in many scholarly works. Although unescorted raids resulted in high losses, they also demonstrated that USAAF aircrews could bomb with remarkable accuracy in good weather. When combined with Bomber Command's efforts, these American raids, though not yet capable of doing overwhelming damage, nonetheless served as clear notice of things to come.  The USAAFâ€™s increasing accuracy resulted from intensive training for bombardiers, navigators, and pilots; from outstanding target materials, including aiming point reports produced by the EOU at the American embassy in London; target vulnerability notes authored by RE8; detailed target maps, charts, and diagrams from Bomber Command Int. 1 and the ACIU; and the Norden bombsight. The high losses resulted from a flawed doctrine stipulating that bombers could fly unescorted without excessive losses. This proved egregiously in error and placed the entire daylight bombardment effort in jeopardy after heavy losses during the Schweinfurt and Regensburg missions in August and October 1943.  Nonetheless, photointerpreters recognized how accurate USAAF bombing could be under the proper conditions. The 9 October 1943 attack on Marienburg, for instance, did such severe damage to the plant that it produced no new aircraft until February 1944. By then the Ame
