g could be under the proper conditions. The 9 October 1943 attack on Marienburg, for instance, did such severe damage to the plant that it produced no new aircraft until February 1944. By then the Americans were able to return with many more bombers escorted by P-51 fighters. Virtually every building at the factory was destroyed or severely damaged, and over 100 FW 190s under construction were destroyed. Some 58 percent of bombs fell within 1,000 feet of the aim point, 83 percent within 2,000 feet. Eaker referred to this raid as “the classic example of precision bombing.” This was clearly a case in which bombing was accurate and produced dramatic effects. Attacks continued for several months, and the Germans kept trying to put the pieces back together. But doing so became increasingly difficult; and although they eked out small numbers of aircraft, catastrophic fuel and pilot shortages made these efforts largely pointless by July 1944, despite increases in German fighter production.  The Limits of Precision Bombing and Air Intelligence  A cautionary word is in order about precision bombing. During the October 1943 Schweinfurt raid, which was one of the most accurate of the war, 228 B-17s dropped 459 1,000-pound and 663 500-pound general-purpose bombs, and 1,751 100-pound incendiaries. Of these 2,873 weapons, approximately 256, or 8.9 percent, hit the buildings or the grounds of the three plants, which totaled 132 acres (0.25 square mile). Heavy bombers were not rapier-like weapons, nor were the bombs they carried. Both were bludgeons, designed to smash buildings and equipment by massing enough destructive force on a target to do serious damage. It is also worth noting that proper weather conditions for this kind of bombing presented themselves relatively rarely, another reason Harris believed city bombing was more consistently effective.  One significant trend intelligence experts noted as attacks on aircraft and ball-bearing industries intensified in summer and fal
