reason Harris believed city bombing was more consistently effective.  One significant trend intelligence experts noted as attacks on aircraft and ball-bearing industries intensified in summer and fall 1943 was a tendency to disperse production as bomb damage increased. An RE8 assessment of repairs at eight aircraft factories attacked during the latter half of 1943 noted that repairs at Marienburg and Regensburg amounted to only 28 percent of total damage inflicted, with similar totals for the other factories. Reconnaissance coverage of the eight plants led RE8 analysts to several conclusions about what was happening within the aircraft industry as a result of USAAF bombing. First, even the most severely damaged plants, such as Marienburg, which lost 70 percent of its buildings’ square footage, received some repairs and began production again, albeit at reduced levels. Second, even light damage often prompted dispersal from a central facility to several satellites producing various components. Third, work continued at damaged plants in both undamaged and damaged buildings. Fourth, there was a tendency to repair buildings that housed the most important parts of the production process. In short, dispersal of war production, which began with Bomber Command city attacks, accelerated with American raids.  Page 164 of 423 42%  was destroyed or severely damaged, and over 100 FW 190s under construction were destroyed. Some 58 percent of bombs fell within 1,000 feet of the aim point, 83 percent within 2,000 feet. Eaker referred to this raid as “the classic example of precision bombing.” This was clearly a case in which bombing was accurate and produced dramatic effects. Attacks continued for several months, and the Germans kept trying to put the pieces back together. But doing so became increasingly difficult; and although they eked out small numbers of aircraft, catastrophic fuel and pilot shortages made these efforts largely pointless by July 1944, despite increases in Ger
