Gathering these photos represented the first step in the targeting and damage-assessment processes. A.P. stands for aim point.

The attack did severe damage and, like many others, either stopped production, forced its dispersal, or both. Dispersal to smaller plants had deleterious effects for quality control, movement of compo- nent parts, and Luftwaffe operations. This plant produced no aircraft from the 9 October 1943 raid until February 1944. Additional raids kept production at low levels. What few aircraft the plant delivered had poor pilots and too little fuel once Operation ARGUMENT broke the Luftwaffe’s back and the oil offensive reduced aviation fuel production severely by summer 1944.
