It also became clear after the war that damage had been more severe than RE8 estimated. During a postwar interrogation, officials from the Kugelfischer Company said the raids reduced ball- bearing production at Schweinfurt by 50 percent, but that repair and dispersal brought production back to 80 percent of the preattack level. (The plant and its satellites never returned to 100 percent of preattack production, an indication that the raids did grievous damage.) They also said repeat raids, while too infrequent, kept production at 40 to 75 percent of the preraid total. Speer said the Germans had already begun to decentralize ball-bearing production by the time of the first Schweinfurt attack on 17 August, but also said a concerted attack on all sources of production would have been a serious problem. Even Swedish imports could not—and in fact did not—compensate entirely for these production losses.2&  A Counterfactual Question: Bomber Command and Ball-Bearing Plants  Page 170 of 423 43%  Annotated bomb plot for the 9 October 1943 Marienburg raid. When photointerpreters analyzed shots such as this using specialized equipment, their deep expertise allowed them to make accurate judgments about everything from damage to production delays and dispersal. (NARA)  Ironically, several precision target sets worth the effort and risk were not attacked with sufficient persistence to produce decisive results—or rarely ever, as in the case of electrical power. German ball- bearing factories were a crucial case in point. According to RE8, the first USAAF raid on Schweinfurt, on 17 August, caused a 15 percent loss in production and a similar loss of finished product at the three major factories, which produced over 70 percent of Germany’s ball bearings. The 14 October raid did severe damage, including destruction of the ball-bearing-forming and heat-treatment build- ings and the top two stories of the assembly and storage building. The ACIU K report said:  Very heavy and concentra
