wo Bomber Command missions finally flown against the ball-bearing plants in February 1944, was that Schweinfurt was simply too difficult a target for Bomber Command to hit with a high degree of accuracy at that point in the war. Damage assessments from these raids seemed to bear this out, but a sample of just two raids left a great deal of uncertainty. Air Commodore Sydney Bufton, Portal’s director of bomber operations at air staff, and Group Captain Richard Morley, his deputy, disagreed with Harris (as they almost always did). The ensuing series of debates had their roots in available air intelli- gence. What people knew or did not know, and how they chose to use intelligence, proved key to the outcome.  The arguments went into high gear in February 1943—half a year before the first USAAF raid and a year before Bomber Command’s. Morley, a disciple of Bufton’s regarding precision bombing, asserted that ball bearings represented the “outstanding example of a true economic bottleneck.”22 He warned attacks might lead to heavy losses but claimed results achieved would more than justify casualties. Morley also observed that if Bomber Command attacked Schweinfurt at night, Harris had to order the raids before limited hours of darkness prevented penetration into southern Germany.22  On 23 May 1943, Bufton pressed again for an attack on Schweinfurt. He reminded Bottomley of the target’s importance and the urgent need for “one overwhelming day and night operation by British and American heavy bomber forces.”®+ To drive home Schweinfurt’s importance, Bufton pointed to a preliminary EOU report, produced on 7 May, noting that ball and roller engine bearings salvaged from crashed German aircraft between 1939 and 1942 had been produced at the three factories at Schweinfurt or the one at Stuttgart.22 Bufton knew the Americans were planning to attack Schweinfurt within three months, and he pleaded with Bottomley to seek at least a coordinated raid by Mosquito light bombers.®2 This
