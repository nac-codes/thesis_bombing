at Stuttgart.22 Bufton knew the Americans were planning to attack Schweinfurt within three months, and he pleaded with Bottomley to seek at least a coordinated raid by Mosquito light bombers.®2 This was the Bufton-Morley team’s sixth effort to goad Bomber Command into action, but Harris demurred, even though ball bearings ranked high in the POINTBLANK directive. Bufton and Morley had an influential supporter in Portal. But as he was to do later dur- ing the oil dispute with Harris, he chose to avoid a showdown, even though by summer 1943 he was already abandoning the idea that city bombing could be decisive.  The two Bomber Command raids on Schweinfurt—24-25 February and 26-27 April—came long after the Germans had dispersed their ball-bearing production and stocks, and neither attack was a success because of poor target marking and high winds, so we have no way of knowing whether a concerted effort in the summer and fall of 1943 would have produced the crisis Speer and the Kugel- fischer executives said could have occurred.84  Perhaps Harris was right when he said Schweinfurt was too difficult a target for Bomber Command at this stage of the war, but given significant successes during the same time frame against French and Belgian marshaling yards, this seems unlikely. In fact, he used an MEW report to make his point about what he viewed as the effort’s futility. In July 1944, he drew the Air Ministry’s attention to an MEW weekly intelligence report. Ball-bearing production, MEW estimated, had fallen by 54 percent. The report claimed that if attacks were resumed, and imports from Sweden reduced, the chance existed that these efforts “may well eventually have an effect on German military capabilities.”®> Pointing to this weak language (the report actually underestimated the impact of ball-bearing attacks, as statements made by Oberstleutnant Kogler, a captured Luftwaffe Geschwader Kommodore, will illustrate shortly), Harris said the case was clearly closed. He furth
