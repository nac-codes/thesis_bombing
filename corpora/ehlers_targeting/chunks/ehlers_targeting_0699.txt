the impact of ball-bearing attacks, as statements made by Oberstleutnant Kogler, a captured Luftwaffe Geschwader Kommodore, will illustrate shortly), Harris said the case was clearly closed. He further asked that “the enthusiastic assertions of the past on this subject may in future be tempered with more discretion whenever targets of a like nature are urged upon us by the Ministry of Economic Warfare.”2° He then concluded: “I trust that the MEW will be called upon to account for their overweening enthusiasm over the enemy’s ball bearing position, in view of their calculations as to the effects already achieved at so heavy acost in life and effort.”®2  Thus, the British did not join the attack on ball bearings in August and October 1943. And while American accuracy might have been quite good, losses were excessive; and a period of bad weather lasting until early January 1944 gave 8th Air Force a rationale to stand down and await the arrival of fighter escorts with drop tanks. Nonetheless, the USAAF had set a precedent. With good weather, American bombers could do very serious damage to targets deep within the Reich. They would return with a vengeance in January and February 1944, and every month thereafter, to prove this again.

Both damage assessments and postwar interrogations of Kugelfischer executives indicate this could have been the cz case. However, Harris’s view, reflected in the poor results of two Bomber Command missions finally flown against the ball-bearing plants in February 1944, was that Schweinfurt was simply too difficult a target for Bomber Command to hit with a high degree of accuracy at that point in the war. Damage assessments from these raids seemed to bear this out, but a sample of just two raids left a great deal of uncertainty.
