During the re-training I lost the following: six excellent pilots killed, a large number seriously wounded, and between 40 and 50 aircraft, I can no longer remember the number exactly. Only because of technical defects. Each time a “Gruppe” went to a so-called “Gruppe” training flight, I had to count on probably one killed and two, three, four, or five emergency landings of which a certain number of aircraft had to be written off because they were damaged. ... Those were conditions which of course did not contribute towards raising the pilots’ self-confidence or strengthening their confidence in their aircraft.22  These catastrophically high loss rates in training give testimony to the hidden costs of dispersed production. Kogler also noted that damage done to the ball-bearing plants and reserve stocks at Schweinfurt forced the Germans to use sleeve bearings in the crankshaft of the FW 190D’s Jumo 213A engine, causing serious mechanical problems. It also reminds us what might have happened had Bomber Command joined the USAAF in its August and October 1943 raids. He closed his sobering narrative with a summary of his unit’s combat experience, which lasted precisely two days because every pilot except Kogler was killed or wounded and his aircraft badly damaged or destroyed. Two suffered complete engine failure before they even made it into combat.*4 A 25 December 1944 Ultra intercept stated similarly that over 20 percent of all aircraft taking off on 23 December in support of the Ardennes offensive had to turn back as a result of various mechanical problems. Horst Boog has also noted that by spring 1944, 60 percent of Ger
