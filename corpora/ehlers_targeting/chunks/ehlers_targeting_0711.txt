country reside at the JPRC to receive collection requests and assign priorities. The JPRC became active in May 1944. It worked closely with No. 106 Group, which controlled all British PRUs and the ACIU, and with the 325th Reconnaissance Wing, which controlled American assets.2 This centralized control facilitated rapid receipt, tasking, and dissemination of requests and products, including damage assessments.°* When the JPRC, under combined operational control, went into action on 26 May 1944, it proved an es- sential, timely, and effective organizational evolution, bringing the air intelligence organization to maturity.22  The Heart of Intelligence: Technologies, Technicians, Techniques  This capability rested on important technologies, technicians, and techniques that came of age between 1940 and 1944. It depended on aircraft capable of penetrating enemy airspace and cameras taking high-resolution photos. Decryption of Ultra intercepts was also of crucial importance. The British excelled in the development of high-speed, high-altitude aircraft, while the Americans led in the invention of superb cameras and film. The importance of these technologies becomes evident when we consider that British reconnaissance missions averaged 100 a month in 1940 but 1,110 in April 1945. By 1945, the Americans contributed another 1,000 sorties per month. The total number of missions flown from 1939 to VE Day is not known, but the Anglo-American total for the period January 1944 to VE Day was more than 125,000 sorties. They flew perhaps 75,000 more from January 1940 to December 1943, which means an aggregate figure of around 200,000 sorties. These sorties, if successful, brought back 1,300 to 1,650 negatives, each covering 2 square miles of the earth’s surface. This meant an average sortie produced photographs covering 3,000 square miles of ter-  Page 173 of 423 43%  intercept stated similarly that over 20 percent of all aircraft taking off on 23 December in support of the Ardennes
