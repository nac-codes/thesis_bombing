es, if successful, brought back 1,300 to 1,650 negatives, each covering 2 square miles of the earth’s surface. This meant an average sortie produced photographs covering 3,000 square miles of ter- ritory. By VE Day, the ACIU Photographic Section had produced over 30 million prints.2®  In August 1940, the twenty Spitfires in service with the Photographic Development Unit were penetrating deeply into the Reich, obtaining the first coverage of Berlin (a round-trip distance of 1,550 miles) and other major cities. The British quickly photographed every industrial and military installation in German-occupied Europe. By 1942, the Mosquito joined the reconnaissance force. It had greater range, more cameras, and an observer, which allowed for better navigation and target location. The “Mossie” could cover targets as far east as Poland, East Prussia, Silesia, and Austria. At the same time, the PRU established an operational training unit for new pilots. Only veterans with superior flying skills were accepted. Consequently, as the loss rate climbed in late 1941 with the Germans’ introduction of the Bf 109G, which was optimized for high-altitude intercepts, the British took countermeasures.22  This began in late 1941 with the installation of the Merlin 45 engine in the Spitfire. As losses once again mounted in early 1943, the British fitted the Merlin 61 engine with a two-stage supercharger in all reconnaissance Spitfires and Mosquitoes. It gave the new Spitfire XI and Mosquito IX (operational by spring 1943) combat ceilings of 41,000 and 36,000 feet. In late 1943, the Mosquito PR XVI appeared. It was the first Allied reconnaissance aircraft with a pressurized cabin, allowing it to operate from altitudes above 40,000 feet.
