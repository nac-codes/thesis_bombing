to action on 26 May 1944, it proved an es- sential, timely, and effective organizational evolution, bringing the air intelligence organization to maturity.22  The Heart of Intelligence: Technologies, Technicians, Techniques  This capability rested on important technologies, technicians, and techniques that came of age between 1940 and 1944. It depended on aircraft capable of penetrating enemy airspace and cameras taking high-resolution photos. Decryption of Ultra intercepts was also of crucial importance. The British excelled in the development of high-speed, high-altitude aircraft, while the Americans led in the invention of superb cameras and film. The importance of these technologies becomes evident when we consider that British reconnaissance missions averaged 100 a month in 1940 but 1,110 in April 1945. By 1945, the Americans contributed another 1,000 sorties per month. The total number of missions flown from 1939 to VE Day is not known, but the Anglo-American total for the period January 1944 to VE Day was more than 125,000 sorties. They flew perhaps 75,000 more from January 1940 to December 1943, which means an aggregate figure of around 200,000 sorties. These sorties, if successful, brought back 1,300 to 1,650 negatives, each covering 2 square miles of the earth’s surface. This meant an average sortie produced photographs covering 3,000 square miles of ter- ritory. By VE Day, the ACIU Photographic Section had produced over 30 million prints.2&  In August 1940, the twenty Spitfires in service with the Photographic Development Unit were penetrating deeply into the Reich, obtaining the first coverage of Berlin (a round-trip distance of 1,550 miles) and other major cities. The British quickly photographed every industrial and military installation in German-occupied Europe. By 1942, the Mosquito joined the reconnaissance force. It had greater range, more cameras, and an observer, which allowed for better navigation and target location. The “Mossie” could cover t
