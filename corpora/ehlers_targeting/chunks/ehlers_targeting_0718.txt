Europe. By 1942, the Mosquito joined the reconnaissance force. It had greater range, more cameras, and an observer, which allowed for better navigation and target location. The “Mossie” could cover targets as far east as Poland, East Prussia, Silesia, and Austria. At the same time, the PRU established an operational training unit for new pilots. Only veterans with superior flying skills were accepted. Consequently, as the loss rate climbed in late 1941 with the Germans’ introduction of the Bf 109G, which was optimized for high-altitude intercepts, the British took countermeasures.  This began in late 1941 with the installation of the Merlin 45 engine in the Spitfire. As losses once again mounted in early 1943, the British fitted the Merlin 61 engine with a two-stage supercharger in all reconnaissance Spitfires and Mosquitoes. It gave the new Spitfire XI and Mosquito IX (operational by spring 1943) combat ceilings of 41,000 and 36,000 feet. In late 1943, the Mosquito PR XVI appeared. It was the first Allied reconnaissance aircraft with a pressurized cabin, allowing it to operate from altitudes above 40,000 feet. When the Me 163 and Me 262 began taking a toll on reconnais- sance aircraft in 1944, the British introduced the Spitfire PR 19. It had a 2,035-horsepower Griffon engine, a pressurized cabin, and a combat ceiling of nearly 50,000 feet, which placed it at the limits of the operational envelope for piston-engine aircraft but above the operating altitude of the Me 262. This development resulted in decreasing loss rates from approximately 2 percent to nearly nil.1°  These impressive operational altitudes came together with the F52 camera and its 36” lens, which provided 1:13,000 scale resolution from 40,000 feet. Such sharpness allowed photointerpreters to determine the type of traffic on railroad sidings, the state of construction of individual U-boats, the layout of radar installations, and a wealth of other information not previously discernible on photographs
