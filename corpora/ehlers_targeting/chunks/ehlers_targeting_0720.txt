he CIU. British photointerpreters were not considered journeymen until they had completed a yearlong appren- ticeship with CIU veterans. Fourth, and most important, ACIU leadership held photointerpreters to the most rigorous standards while giving them the authority to make judgments about what they discovered in photos they studied. The ACIU hired archaeologists, geologists, botanists, painters and sculptors, photogrammetrists, photographers, town planners, and writers.1°  The Americans followed the British lead in hiring photointerpreters. An AAFAIS manual emphasized:  A good photo interpreter is an individual who has patience, a flair for detail and a highly retentive memory. He should be an inquisitive person and one who is not easily discouraged by lack of  Page 176 of 423 44%  This began in late 1941 with the installation of the Merlin 45 engine in the Spitfire. As losses once again mounted in early 1943, the British fitted the Merlin 61 engine with a two-stage supercharger in all reconnaissance Spitfires and Mosquitoes. It gave the new Spitfire XI and Mosquito IX (operational by spring 1943) combat ceilings of 41,000 and 36,000 feet. In late 1943, the Mosquito PR XVI appeared. It was the first Allied reconnaissance aircraft with a pressurized cabin, allowing it to operate from altitudes above 40,000 feet. When the Me 163 and Me 262 began taking a toll on reconnais- sance aircraft in 1944, the British introduced the Spitfire PR 19. It had a 2,035-horsepower Griffon engine, a pressurized cabin, and a combat ceiling of nearly 50,000 feet, which placed it at the limits of the operational envelope for piston-engine aircraft but above the operating altitude of the Me 262. This development resulted in decreasing loss rates from approximately 2 percent to nearly nil.1°2  These impressive operational altitudes came together with the F52 camera and its 36” lens, which provided 1:13,000 scale resolution from 40,000 feet. Such sharpness allowed photointerpreters to deter
