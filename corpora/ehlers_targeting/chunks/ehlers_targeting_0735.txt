il, and also a transportation campaign against railroads and canals, which led in early 1945 to a catastrophic disruption in the movement of coal, components, and oil. The destruction of Germany’s oil and transportation assets also undermined the Wehrmacht’s mobility and combat power, which Spaatz held to be the third major contribution to victory. The fourth objective noted at the end of the previous chapter, isolating German units in Normandy from their sources of supply and reinforcement in preparation for Operation OVERLORD and during the actions to follow, was in effect a subset of this larger effort against the Wehrmacht. Throughout the document, and in Spaatz’s wartime correspondence, there was a clear recognition that bombing could shorten the war and make it much less costly in blood and treasure.t  Damage assessments for these offensives were central to success. Photoreconnaissance, photointerpretation, and Ultra intercepts were coming together in a complementary damage assessment capability that allowed the Allies to gauge effects and effectiveness within days or hours. In short, a superb reconnaissance capability came together synergistically with the world’s best signals intelli- gence and cryptographic units at Bletchley Park, and later with ground-survey teams collecting data at captured facilities, to give the Allies a deep knowledge of the German war effort’s vulnerabilities. By spring 1944, very little of significance happened in the Reich and occupied Europe without being observed, analyzed, and put to use. The Allies missed a number of things or simply got them wrong, but these errors of omission and commission did not seriously degrade their appreciation of airpower’s effectiveness.?  By January 1944, the Allies had the heavy bombers, escort fighters, and air intelligence they needed to take the air war to Germany and to assess how they were doing. Spaatz had been closely monitoring all intelligence sources, including Ultra, and was aware of the
