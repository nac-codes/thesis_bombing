s, and air intelligence they needed to take the air war to Germany and to assess how they were doing. Spaatz had been closely monitoring all intelligence sources, including Ultra, and was aware of the Luftwaffe’s many challenges, from fuel and pilot shortages to wholesale disbanding of bomber and other units.? With the start of Operation ARGUMENT on 24 January, the Americans set out to wrest control of the air over the Continent from their German adversaries. They won a resounding victory. This air campaign against the Luftwaffe and the German aircraft industry was ferocious. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) destroyed 3,700 German fighters and damaged another 1,400 at the cost of 946 bombers and 397 fighters. Although bombers did serious damage to aircraft, aeroengine, and ball-bearing plants, the decisive factor was the relentless destruction of Luftwaffe fighters and their increasingly inadequately trained pilots, who were compelled to engage the Americans in a losing effort to protect their sources of supply. During forty-seven major attacks by 5,166 heavy bomber sorties against the German aircraft industry from January through March 1944, USAAF aircraft inflicted such severe losses on the Luftwaffe that it never again posed a major threat to Allied operations. This all-out effort, based on General Hap Arnold’s orders to “destroy the enemy air forces wherever you find them, in the air, on the ground and in the factories,” made possible the transportation and oil offensives by removing the most significant barrier to their execution: the Luftwaffe.4  As this battle for air supremacy raged over the Reich, another raged among senior Allied leaders as they debated their options for employing heavy bombers in support of OvERLORD—and all purported to be using the best available intelligence to make their cases. This preinvasion debate, one of the most acrimonious of the war, highlighted the degree to which intelligence was in fact a highly political commodity
