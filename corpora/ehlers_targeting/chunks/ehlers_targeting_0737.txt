best available intelligence to make their cases. This preinvasion debate, one of the most acrimonious of the war, highlighted the degree to which intelligence was in fact a highly political commodity liable to either proper use or misuse—or both—for the purposes of establishing strategic, operational, and tactical objectives and methods. Air Vice Marshal E. J. Kingston- McCloughry, chief operations planner for the Allied Expeditionary Air Force (AEAF), said, “Frequently the various authorities in the Services and departments each interpreted and sometimes twisted intelligence material to suit their own particular purposes. There was probably no more outstanding case of this partisan use of intelligence than in ‘Overlord.””2 He continued: “The arguments put forward by the opponents of the plan were completely confounded by the facts.”® As will become clear, his first statement was entirely correct, and the second one only partially so because of the vary- ing degree to which each player used intelligence for political purposes and in a manner not consistent with the facts. Even Lord Tedder, generally known for a level-headed approach to most issues, said of the Normandy transportation campaign, “This plan was to run like a thread through all the operations up to the end of the war; true, sometimes a very tangled thread—tangled sometimes by deliberate intrigue and sometimes by ignorance and misunderstanding.”” Before we delve into this battle and its outcomes, however, it is important to understand each of the plans and how compet- ing interests championed them.  There were four competing plans for isolating the Normandy battle area and giving Allied armies time to establish a lodgment: one put forth by Tedder and his scientific advisor, Professor Solly Zuckerman; the second by Spaatz; the third by the Enemy Objectives Unit (EOU) with Spaatz’s tacit support; and the fourth by Harris.® Tedder, as Eisenhower’s deputy supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces,
