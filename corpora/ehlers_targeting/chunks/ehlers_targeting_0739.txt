This all-out effort, based on General Hap Arnold’s orders to “destroy the enemy air forces wherever you find them, in the air, on the ground and in the factories,” made possible the transportation and oil offensives by removing the most significant barrier to their execution: the Luftwaffe.4  As this battle for air supremacy raged over the Reich, another raged among senior Allied leaders as they debated their options for employing heavy bombers in support of OVERLORD—and all purported to be using the best available intelligence to make their cases.
