ues, said of the Normandy transportation campaign, “This plan was to run like a thread through all the operations up to the end of the war; true, sometimes a very tangled thread—tangled sometimes by deliberate intrigue and sometimes by ignorance and misunderstanding.”2 Before we delve into this battle and its outcomes, however, it is important to understand each of the plans and how compet- ing interests championed them.  There were four competing plans for isolating the Normandy battle area and giving Allied armies time to establish a lodgment: one put forth by Tedder and his scientific advisor, Professor Solly Zuckerman; the second by Spaatz; the third by the Enemy Objectives Unit (EOU) with Spaatz’s tacit support; and the fourth by Harris.* Tedder, as Eisenhower’s deputy supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, favored a concerted attack on railroads in France and Belgium, with emphasis on key marshaling yards, to isolate German troops in the battle area from supplies and reinforcements. Spaatz favored an attack on oil production. In this way, he said, the Germans would be deprived of tactical mobility on all the fighting fronts as fuel supplies dried up. His EOU advisors advocated an associated effort against bridges along the Seine and Loire rivers. These attacks would isolate German forces from sources of supply and reinforcement. Finally, Harris proposed continued attacks on German cities as the only effective means for impeding the enemy’s response to the landings.  Eisenhower, who exercised operational control over the heavy bombers from April to September 1944, chose Tedder’s plan at a tense meeting of senior leaders on 25 March 1944. But he also gave Spaatz quiet permission to go after oil, and the EOU bridge plan was also eventually implemented. In effect, then, the Allies, who by this time had enough aircraft to pull it off, executed three of the four plans, but the road leading to this outcome was strewn with the wreckage caused by five mo
