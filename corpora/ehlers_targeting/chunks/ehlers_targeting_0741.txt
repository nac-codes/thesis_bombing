In effect, then, the Allies, who by this time had enough aircraft to pull it off, executed three of the four plans, but the road leading to this outcome was strewn with the wreckage caused by five months of ferocious debate. Through it all, intelligence, used properly and improperly, formed the grist for everyone’s arguments.  The Italian Background  The three plans put into practice each had its genesis in an earlier effort to isolate German ground forces in Italy by bombing the transportation network on which they relied for supplies and reinforcements. Damage assessments from this effort played a central role in the later and more successful effort in France and the Low Countries.2  Planning for transportation attacks against the Italian railroad network began in spring 1943 with a Northwest African Air Force (NAAF) A-2 assessment of vulnerabilities. It focused on interdicting vital oil and coal shipments. The A-2 recommended attacks on locomotives and rolling stock to reduce Italy’s carrying capacity. This meant attacking marshaling yards. Also significant was the report's finding that the Brenner Pass carried almost 50 percent of train traffic into Italy and two Swiss lines another 38 percent, with the rest moving over smaller lines from France and Yugoslavia. Interdic- tion of the Brenner Pass and the lines entering Italy from Switzerland thus had high priority. The Mediterranean Allied Photographic Reconnaissance Wing prepared target materials accordingly.12  The NAAF A-2 report also noted there were three major north-south rail lines: one along each coast, and one through the Apennines from Bologna to Rome. Marshaling yards at Rome and Naples formed bottlenecks in this network. Because the east-coast line turned west to Naples, most east coast traffic and all north-south traffic passed through marshaling yards east of Naples, making these key targets. Rolling stock and locomotive production were weak and vulnerable. All locomotive factories were targets.4
