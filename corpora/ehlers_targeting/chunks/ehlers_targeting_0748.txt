rt, and provided little maneuver room for Allied armies. The effects of bombing rail centers were significant, but their effectiveness was limited because the Germans could always get adequate supplies to combat units. Nonetheless, Zuckerman and Tedder recognized the potential effectiveness of a larger transportation offensive against France precisely because of the geographic differences. Although Italian geog- raphy made breakthroughs south of the Po River Valley difficult, that of France provided opportunities for breakout and maneuver warfare once beyond the hedgerows.  Nonetheless, Zuckerman and Tedder had to rely in part on faith, particularly given the sometimes discouraging damage reports from the Italian campaign. One such study noted that rail attacks could not prevent the enemy from receiving a minimum supply shipment of 4,000 tons per day, 700 tons of which came by sea and the remainder by railway to railheads, and then via motor transport to the front lines. The report's key insight was, “With the enemy’s ability to maintain his minimum requirements under existing conditions, it is appreciated that air attacks on his supply lines cannot produce a critical situation unless his rate of consumption is raised.”12  Transportation Attacks: Signs of Future Potential  Even in this report, however, Zuckerman saw opportunities. Bombing of Italian rail centers had pushed railheads 90 miles from the front.18 This forced the Germans to use their limited supply of trucks and fuel to make long, dangerous, and inefficient night supply runs from the front lines to the railheads and back again. This was the first instance of what Russell Hart called the “demotorization” of German army divisions, which were forced to use their trucks as supply haulers rather than troop transports.12 This change in function reduced tactical mobility, created a severe and worsening truck shortage, and increased fuel consumption.
