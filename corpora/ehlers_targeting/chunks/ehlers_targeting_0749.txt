orts.12 This change in function reduced tactical mobility, created a severe and worsening truck shortage, and increased fuel consumption. The combination of blackout headlights, poor roads, and night bomber attacks all took a toll on machines and men. The result was a loss of 1,500 trucks during the first four months of 1944.2° Despite reports to the contrary, the Germans apparently had barely adequate fuel stocks to prevent an Allied breakthrough to Rome until late May 1944. After that, shortages became increasingly pervasive. Hilly terrain saved the German withdrawal, as the German 10th Army noted in its field diaries. General Alexander lamented, “If only the country were more open we could make hay of the whole lot.”24 Yet it was Allied ground power and operational acumen, not fuel shortages, that proved most significant. The bombing of marshaling yards, combined with German artillery ammunition shortages brought on by Operation sTRANGLE, created serious logistical problems for the Germans, but none proved insurmountable. Still, Zuckerman argued correctly that concerted bombing of French rail centers would lead to greater success given France's different terrain. Italy’s geography simply made decisive air action too difficult—and the Al- lies were still learning the interdiction process in 1943, something we should not forget.22  A senior Italian officer confirmed German logistical difficulties during an interrogation in January 1944, saying they suffered from serious fuel, truck, and ammunition shortages. He recommended the Allies continue attacks on marshaling yards and key bridges to force the Germans to use more gas and wear out more trucks. To buttress his case, he quoted a German general staff officer as having said on 15 November 1943, “If the bombings of our communications had continued as in September and October, we would have had to withdraw to a line north of Rome.”22 Unfortunately, Allied bombers did not continue these raids, instead moving to other
