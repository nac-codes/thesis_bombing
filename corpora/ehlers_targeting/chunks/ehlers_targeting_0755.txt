equipment at rail centers had a major and long-term impact. Caliendo said the 18 April 1943 raid on Palermo’s marshaling yards caused severe damage, as had the 19 July 1943 and 7 March 1944 attacks on Rome’s. Through lines were repaired in days, but marshaling operations were seriously disrupted, leading to long delays in train assembly and movement. He suggested that concerted attacks followed by frequent reconnaissance would allow the Allies to assess damage, track the progress of repairs, and schedule repeat attacks. These ideas proved prescient.24  What Zuckerman and Tedder glimpsed in these reports, interrogations, and discussions was a vision of attacks on marshaling yards in advance of and after OVERLORD pushing railheads back, forcing the Germans to demotorize their divisions and use their trucks for logistics rather than maneuver. The strain on their trucks and the huge quantities of gasoline they used during these supply runs would lead to serious truck and fuel shortages. High loss rates for trucks driven at night, over bad roads, and attacked by night bombers would increase truck and supply shortages; accidents and air attacks often destroyed cargo along with the trucks. The German army’s combat power would thus be compromised by constant and severe supply shortages. The Germans in Italy had been fortunate to defend a mountainous peninsula ill-suited to effective air attack. Their comrades in France would not be so lucky.  The Spaatz/EOU Oil Plan  Spaatz’s plan, which his staff developed in just thirty-six hours, called for an all-out attack on oil production to immobilize the Wehrmacht. At Spaatz’s request, EOU also planned attacks on bridges over the Seine and Loire rivers to delay troops and supplies, a supplemental plan Spaatz chose not to argue at the 25 March 1944 meeting. Spaatz gave his staff three requirements: provide air supremacy for the invasion; speed the possible collapse of Germany before an invasion; and, if Germany did not collapse, pr
