team followed bridge attacks carefully and were impressed by the amount of time it took German combat engineers to rebuild damaged bridges. The Germans spent an average of seventeen days completing these repairs. It took them up to a month to repair longer steel bridges. Zuckerman argued against the practice, estimating it would take an average of 1,200 tons of bombs to drop one bridge. The EOU estimate of 220 tons proved more accurate.2+  Spaatz also profited from 15th Air Force Operational Research Section reports on bridge attacks. The culminating report noted that 706 bombers dropped 1,906 tons of bombs on bridges during the period from 1 April to 4 June 1944. Their accuracy in good weather was 41 percent of bombs within 1,000 feet; in bad weather, it was 26 percent within 1,000 feet. Of twentytwo bridges attacked, seven  Page 191 of 423 47%  SUBSESSLEU Lildl CULICEL LEU ALLAC hs LUMOWEU DY LLEUQUEIIL LECOLII I dl sod lICe WOU ALLOW LIE FALE Ss LU dooton Udllldee’, LIACK LITE PLUEIESS Ul LO Pallo, AllUt sCllicurule LE Peal dlldtho.

What Zuckerman and Tedder glimpsed in these reports, interrogations, and discussions was a vision of attacks on marshaling yards in advance of and after OVERLORD pushing railheads back, forcing the Germans to demotorize their divisions and use their trucks for logistics rather than maneuver. The strain on their trucks and the huge quantities of gasoline they used during these supply runs would lead to serious truck and fuel shortages. High loss rates for trucks driven at night, over bad roads, and attacked by night bombers would increase truck and supply shortages; accidents and air attacks often destroyed cargo along with the trucks. The German army’s combat power would thus be compromised by constant and severe supply shortages. The Germans in Italy had been fortunate to defend a mountainous peninsula ill-suited to effective air attack. Their comrades in France would not be so lucky.  The Spaatz/EOU Oi
