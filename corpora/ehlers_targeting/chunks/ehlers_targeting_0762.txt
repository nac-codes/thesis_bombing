an exception to LeMay’s lead-bombardier technique. Bridges had recognizable aim points that allowed even inexperienced bombardiers to lay the Norden bombsight’s crosshairs on target.22 Nonetheless, heavy bombers proved to be the wrong platform for bridge attacks (more than 100 sorties per successful bridge attack was not exactly impres- sive). That role quickly passed to fighter-bombers and “mediums” during the campaign in France, with the “heavies” focusing on larger targets they could reliably hit.  Eisenhower’s decision to adopt the Tedder-Zuckerman plan, but also allow Spaatz to go after oil targets, and AEAF Commander Air Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory’s Tactical Air Force commanders to  Page 191 of 423 47%  SME OPUGKLL/ HOY ULE LE LAr  Spaatz’s plan, which his staff developed in just thirty-six hours, called for an all-out attack on oil production to immobilize the Wehrmacht. At Spaatz’s request, EOU also planned attacks on bridges over the Seine and Loire rivers to delay troops and supplies, a supplemental plan Spaatz chose not to argue at the 25 March 1944 meeting. Spaatz gave his staff three requirements: provide air supremacy for the invasion; speed the possible collapse of Germany before an invasion; and, if Germany did not collapse, provide maximum support for OVERLORD.2* Spaatz said his advocacy of the oil option did not imply that attacks on transportation assets should not play a strong part in isolating the battle area. He emphasized in private discussions that bridge attacks would address this issue. Spaatz also noted that Germany’s fourteen largest synthetic oil plants comprised 80 percent of synthetic oil and fuel production. His plan called for attacks on these and the thirteen largest crude oil refineries, which accounted for 60 percent of refining capacity. Spaatz said transportation attacks would not affect the course of the initial battle but oil attacks would; that transportation raids would not bring out the Luftwaffe, but that “they will d
