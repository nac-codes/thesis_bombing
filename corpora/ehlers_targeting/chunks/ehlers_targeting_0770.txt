the lessons of the Italian campaign indicated that reducing traffic flow was key: “If the enemy were deprived of the use of locomotives in a given area, and if in addition he were also deprived of the ability  Page 192 of 423 47%  e——eEOEeyeeeEeee_ Eee See EE ——_ — —_E—_— — OO OOOO TE LS eee —e—eeeeeeee ee eee ee eeeeeeeeeeeeeEeeeEeEeEE—_E—E—E—E—_EeeEeE—eEE—e——_Ee—EeE—eE—Ee—E_EeeEEe—_eeE—E—eE——_————E——e_E eee ee eee eee  effects, was one of the war’s great command and intelligence failures.

They had a long leg up on the competition because they began planning the transportation campaign four months before competitors even began working on their proposals. The fact that Tedder was Eisenhower’s deputy and a superb airman—and had his superior’s complete and well-earned trust—also brightened the transportation campaign’s prospects for approval.  The TIC was composed of every civilian and military railroad expert, including C. E. R. Sherrington, head of the Railroad Research Service (RRS) and committee chair; Squadron Leader W.

These players soon comprised the Transportation Targets Committee (TTC), which made target recommendations to Eisenhower, Tedder, and Leigh-Mallory.
