ered 4,260 of 12,000 locomotives belonging to the French National Railroad (the Société National des Chemins du Fer, or SNCF) for use in Germany and the east. Most were heavy locomotives for pulling large trains and represented a disproportionate loss of motive power. The RRS said the SNCF was carrying as much as it could and would be un- able to expand operations after D-day as a result of locomotive shortages.  Zuckerman’s influence became clear in a summary of the offensive against Italy’s railroads, which noted that concerted bombing of six rail centers  virtually brought the railway system to a standstill through the destruction or isolation of servicing and repair facilities, rolling stock and tracks (with the consequent blocking of yards), the dislocation of signaling and switch systems, the interruption of water and electrical supplies. ... The paralysis so caused was not a result of the cutting of lines, nor was it determined by the geographical lay-out of the system: essentially it was the result of widespread damage affecting every element of the railway centres attacked, and particularly of the destruction of rolling stock and servicing facilities, and of the choking of marshalling yards.22  The most the Germans could do was open one or two through lines within a week of the attacks. By the end of the Sicilian campaign, the railhead was north of Naples. An RRS note in the paper said the lessons of the Italian campaign indicated that reducing traffic flow was key: “If the enemy were deprived of the use of locomotives in a given area, and if in addition he were also deprived of the ability to use locomotives transferred from elsewhere, railway movement within the area would come to a standstill.”32  In another argument imported from Zuckerman’s analyses, the paper emphasized that destruction of repair facilities was essential to reducing locomotive serviceability. The requirement for maintenance, which occurred at marshaling yards, meant nearly 40 percent
