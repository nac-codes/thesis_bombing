s), the dislocation of signaling and switch systems, the interruption of water and electrical supplies. ... The paralysis so caused was not a result of the cutting of lines, nor was it determined by the geographical lay-out of the system: essentially it was the result of widespread damage affecting every element of the railway centres attacked, and particularly of the destruction of rolling stock and servicing facilities, and of the choking of marshalling yards.22  The most the Germans could do was open one or two through lines within a week of the attacks. By the end of the Sicilian campaign, the railhead was north of Naples. An RRS note in the paper said the lessons of the Italian campaign indicated that reducing traffic flow was key: “If the enemy were deprived of the use of locomotives in a given area, and if in addition he were also deprived of the ability to use locomotives transferred from elsewhere, railway movement within the area would come to a standstill.”22  In another argument imported from Zuckerman’s analyses, the paper emphasized that destruction of repair facilities was essential to reducing locomotive serviceability. The requirement for maintenance, which occurred at marshaling yards, meant nearly 40 percent of locomotives would be there at any given time and thus liable to destruction. Where there were locomotives, there was also rolling stock. Finally, rail centers housed signaling systems, track-crossing controls, and through lines vital to efficient operations. Destruction of these items at adjacent rail centers would make movement in an entire region nearly impossible.22  Equally important, the Germans could not return many of the 4,260 locomotives and 140,000 wagons looted from France because they were used in the Reich or the east.42 In addition, not only was there no spare track in France, but the Germans had already removed several hundred miles of tracks and crossings for use in Russia, meaning that every foot of track destroyed would re
