intelligence analyses supporting it to rout his opponents. For instance, he demonstrated conclusively that EOU, Air Ministry, and JIC analyses (all three in favor of Spaatz’s oil plan) underestimated the degree to which German transportation assets were spread thinly on the ground.*” Yet the case was not airtight, and the Tedder-Zuckerman team also occasionally played fast and loose with intelligence. Zuckerman’s refusal to consider the efficacy of bridge attacks was the first such instance. Bridge attacks during Operation sTRANGLE in Italy, made by medium and fighter-bombers, created significant mobility and resupply problems for the Germans. Zuckerman and Tedder had access to all reports for these attacks. Their decision to ignore them was ill-founded.48  Tedder also worked, somewhat disingenuously, to undermine Spaatz’s oil plan. Just before the meeting, he told Portal, “I am frankly skeptical of the Oil Plan, partly because we have been led up the garden path before, partly because the targets are in difficult areas ... and partly because I am not sure of the vulnerability of the new synthetic oil plants.”42 Each argument was flawed. The fact that oil attacks had been tried before and had not worked ignored the existing realities. Tedder’s effort to discredit Spaatz’s proposed oil offensive, with thousands of four-engine bombers, by comparing it to the relatively miniscule and ineffective RAF oil attacks in 1940-1941, is difficult to comprehend. The earlier offensive was bound to fail for reasons already made clear. The claim that oil plants were in “difficult areas” to strike was also inaccurate. Quite the opposite was often true. In most cases these facilities, especially the large hydrogenation plants, were outside of urban areas and thus made very good aim points for USAAF “precision” and the emerging RAF “night precision” techniques, both visually and because of their distinctive radar returns. Finally, Tedder’s assertion that he was “not sure of the real
