handled several analytical issues, it did exceptionally well with the bridge-attack proposal, which also included attacks on key road junctions, rail junctions, railroad tracks in open country, and forward depots—especially fuel and ammunition. Although Spaatz chose not to bring up this plan at the 25 March 1944 meeting, he and his staff persisted in their efforts behind the scenes and eventually made these targets part of what became the three-pronged offensive: transportation, oil, and bridges/junctions/depots. Once again, it took proof provided by damage assessments to prove bridge attacks would be decisive in conjunction with raids on the other target sets. An experimental low-level attack by P-47 fighter-bombers, similar to the trial night precision attacks the RAF leadership ordered Bomber Command to carry out against marshaling yards, took place at Vernon on 7 May 1944—just a month before OVERLORD. It was a stunning success, made clear the need to integrate “tactical” air assets into the larger plan as quickly as possible, and sold Eisenhower and Tedder, along with Portal, on the value of this target set. This attack followed an earlier one by RAF Ty- phoon fighterbombers, on 21 April, against several bridges, in which they either destroyed the crossings or rendered them unusable.*2  However, Walter Rostow said of the machinations involved in getting bridge attacks added to the preinvasion program: “It should not have required a concerted conspiratorial endeavor leading up to the serendipitous attack on Vernon on 7 May to alter policy.”®° As he further noted, Operation sTRANGLE had already proven the value of bridge attacks by tactical aircraft. When bridge attacks began in earnest on 8 May, every senior officer involved in these debates received photos of excellent quality and associated damage assessments demonstrating how devastating fighter-bomber attacks were against this target set. This was another case where senior leaders’ adversarial natures, combin
