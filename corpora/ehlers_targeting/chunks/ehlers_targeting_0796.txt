ided incontrovertible evidence that British aircrews were able not only to hit rail centers at night, but also to cause devastating damage.®  Harris also turned to an RE8 report with which he intended, among other things, to frighten the political leadership away from the transportation offensive. It estimated that between 80,000 and  160,000 French and Belgians would become casualties. The study’s accuracy was dubious at best and not up to RE8’s usually high standards.

An experimental low-level attack DY F-4/ Tignter-Dombers, similar to the trial Nignt precision attacks the KA leadership ordered Bomber Command to carry out against marshaling yards, took place at Vernon on 7 May 1944—just a month before OVERLORD. It was a stunning success, made clear the need to integrate “tactical” air assets into the larger plan as quickly as possible, and sold Eisenhower and Tedder, along with Portal, on the value of this target set.

When bridge attacks began in earnest on 8 May, every senior officer involved in these debates received photos of excellent quality and associated da
