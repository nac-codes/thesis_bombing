n the value of bridge attacks by tactical aircraft. When bridge attacks began in earnest on 8 May, every senior officer involved in these debates received photos of excellent quality and associated damage assessments demonstrating how devastating fighter-bomber attacks were against this target set. This was another case where senior leaders’ adversarial natures, combined with the fractured command-and-control structure, led to a situation in which useful intelligence did not receive the required attention until much later than it should have. It also pointed out that intelligence specialists were themselves vulnerable to both error and partisanship.*+  The one plan not seriously considered by any senior leaders—Harris’s plan—failed from the outset as a result of the shortcomings and occasional manipulations of its intelligence analyses. Harris put himself in a position of disadvantage immediately by suggesting that the best thing Bomber Command could do was simply continue attacks on urban areas as the only effective means for keeping the Germans disorganized and distracted up to and during OVERLORD. Somehow, Harris reasoned, this would translate into a German inability to respond effectively to the invasion. Nobody was prepared to entertain this, particularly given Bomber Command’s appalling loss rate during the battle of Berlin.®* Harris and his staff produced the meticulous damage assessments described in preceding chapters, but these only confirmed in everyone’s minds the inconclusive nature of the data. Harris’s fallback position was to argue, on the basis of older and selective damage assessments, that his bombers could not hit marshaling yards with the required accuracy, an untenable position given his command’s increasingly effective night precision capabilities. Portal put a swift end to that by issuing an order for raids against six French marshaling yards (expanding later to twelve) on 4 March 1944. The ensuing intelligence provided incontrovertible evide
