. Portal put a swift end to that by issuing an order for raids against six French marshaling yards (expanding later to twelve) on 4 March 1944. The ensuing intelligence provided incontrovertible evidence that British aircrews were able not only to hit rail centers at night, but also to cause devastating damage.  Harris also turned to an RE8 report with which he intended, among other things, to frighten the political leadership away from the transportation offensive. It estimated that between 80,000 and 160,000 French and Belgians would become casualties. The study’s accuracy was dubious at best and not up to RE8’s usually high standards. Its authors assumed very few people would evacuate cities and towns holding key targets. In addition, they assumed aiming errors on the same scale as those for raids over Germany, even though they knew bombers would be attacking at much lower altitudes as a result of scarce antiaircraft artillery and fighter assets in France and Belgium. They also calculated that all bombs released would cause casualties—a huge stretch. The casualty figures also included minor injuries (the vast majority), a point Bomber Command deliberately kept out of the spotlight. Finally, they assumed the French and Belgians would be intolerant of the bombing, thus turning them against their erstwhile allies.“ Playing fast and loose with intelligence reports doomed Harris's already hopeless plan. However, the report on civilian casualties caused an uproar in the prime minister’s office and the War Cabinet. This threatened to derail the transportation offensive and played a central role in delaying it for nearly two months even though Eisenhower and his staff warned the prime minister that Bomber Command's figures were “grossly exaggerated.”®  These partisan uses of intelligence by all parties played themselves out within a much larger arena defined by acrimony and gridlock caused in large measure by unclear and contested air command- and-control relationships.
