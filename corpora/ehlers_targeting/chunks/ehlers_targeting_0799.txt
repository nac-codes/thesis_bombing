intelligence by all parties played themselves out within a much larger arena defined by acrimony and gridlock caused in large measure by unclear and contested air command- and-control relationships. Consequently, senior civilian and military leaders not only used their intelligence estimates to their own advantage, but also did so in an effort to establish the operational air scheme they most desired. Every senior officer had different ideas on this issue, and intelligence reports influenced them—or were themselves hijacked by the key players—for good or ill. It was in this atmosphere, and with these reports either in hand or under production, that the greatest bombing-related argument of the war played itself out. As Vincent Orange noted, these otherwise superb officers “competed with each other to oppose vehemently, rather than to evaluate, the [transportation] plan.”® Why this collection of fine wartime leaders could not figure out that synergy between the respective plans made the most sense is perplexing to say the least, and the failure of an otherwise sophisticated and capable air intelligence organization to help them figure it out was as egregious then as it would be today.  Air Intelligence Issues within the Larger Context  The complex interaction between intelligence, politics, and operations got into high gear in January 1944, when it appeared as though Air Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory would have operational control not only over tactical aircraft, but also over heavy bombers. This drew an immediate reaction from every other major player, most of whom saw Leigh-Mallory’s plans as either ineffective or disastrous. His Joint Planning Staff intelligence officers believed that unless they took measures beforehand, German leaders would be able more quickly to concentrate their forces, using northwest Europe’s dense road and rail networks. Consequently, their first plan, designed during the last half of 1943, was intended to delay movement of enemy forces a
