rstwhile allies.“ Playing fast and loose with intelligence reports doomed Harris’s already hopeless plan. However, the report on civilian casualties caused an uproar in the prime minister’s office and the War Cabinet. This threatened to derail the transportation offensive and played a central role in delaying it for nearly two months even though Eisenhower and his staff warned the prime minister that Bomber Command's figures were “grossly exaggerated.”©  These partisan uses of intelligence by all parties played themselves out within a much larger arena defined by acrimony and gridlock caused in large measure by unclear and contested air command- and-control relationships. Consequently, senior civilian and military leaders not only used their intelligence estimates to their own advantage, but also did so in an effort to establish the operational air scheme they most desired. Every senior officer had different ideas on this issue, and intelligence reports influenced them—or were themselves hijacked by the key players—for good or ill. It was in this atmosphere, and with these reports either in hand or under production, that the greatest bombing-related argument of the war played itself out. As Vincent Orange noted, these otherwise superb officers “competed with each other to oppose vehemently, rather than to evaluate, the [transportation] plan.”®* Why this collection of fine wartime leaders could not figure out that synergy between the respective plans made the most sense is perplexing to say the least, and the failure of an otherwise sophisticated and capable air intelligence organization to help them figure it out was as egregious then as it would be today.
