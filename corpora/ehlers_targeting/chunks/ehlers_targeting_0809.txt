d that the Allies had a huge number of strategic and tactical aircraft, but he warned that it was still essential to select a target that would produce results and remain within the capabilities of this huge air armada. The oil plan, he believed, would yield significant long-term benefits. Yet he also believed there was no evidence that “the Oil plan can, in the short term available, seriously affect the enemy ability to meet the OVERLORD assault.”22 He continued:  Page 203 of 423 50%  diverting our best weapon from the military function, for which it has been equipped and trained, to tasks which it cannot carry out. This might give some specious appearance of “supporting” the army, in reality it would be the gravest disservice we could do them. It would lead directly to disaster.  Given these kinds of attacks on the plan, even Tedder, its coauthor, was having his doubts—not about the plan itself, but about gathering adequate support. Without the bomber chiefs’ participation, the plan would not work. As we now know, the Combined Chiefs of Staff’s eventual answer was simply to give Eisenhower, and Tedder as his deputy, direct control of the heavies, but that had not yet transpired. In a letter to Portal, Tedder lamented, “I am afraid that having started as a confirmed optimist I am steadily losing my optimism as to how this is all going to work out. . . . The so-called ‘Committee’ has shown no signs so far of producing any constructive results. Iam more and more being forced to the unfortunate conclusion that the two strategic forces [Spaatz and Harris] are deter- mined not to play.”2. This was the one point at which Tedder approached anything like despair.  Worse was to come. The army’s War Office also resisted his plan. The primary objective, they said, must remain the destruction of the Luftwaffe. If the transportation plan diverted heavy bombers from this effort, it was not worth the cost. Only surplus bombers should go to preinvasion support. Consequently, they
