destruction of the Luftwaffe. If the transportation plan diverted heavy bombers from this effort, it was not worth the cost. Only surplus bombers should go to preinvasion support. Consequently, they called for attacks on oil, tank production, tank depots, ordnance depots, motor transport parks, and radar systems. How, precisely, these were to slow the movement of German reinforcements to the Normandy battle area went entirely unremarked.®  At the same time, Bufton told Bottomley that, in his opinion, “The Transportation Plan will not produce any material effect upon the course of the OVERLORD battle in the critical period D to D+5 weeks ...asatarget system... it has little or nothing to recommend it.” Bottomley, despite his close relationship with Bufton, advised Portal that he did not support Bufton’s recommendations. In his view, concerted attacks on marshaling yards would have immediate benefits. They had the added benefit of a de facto continuation of heavy raids on western Germany’s main industrial area (much to Harris’s liking) since the plan called for attacks on a number of rail centers in the Ruhr.78  Surprisingly, Tedder’s spirits rebounded in the days leading up to the 25 March 1944 meeting, perhaps because he knew he still had Eisenhower's full support, and because Portal, at Bottomley’s urging, lined up behind the transportation plan. His arguments going into the meeting were compelling and well supported by a wealth of Zuckerman’s intelligence. Tedder acknowledged that the Allies had a huge number of strategic and tactical aircraft, but he warned that it was still essential to select a target that would produce results and remain within the capabilities of this huge air armada. The oil plan, he believed, would yield significant long-term benefits. Yet he also believed there was no evidence that “the Oil plan can, in the short term available, seriously affect the enemy ability to meet the OVERLORD assault.”22 He continued:  The transportation plan is t
