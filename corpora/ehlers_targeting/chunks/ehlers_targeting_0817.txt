e was simply too mammoth to allow for anything approaching optimal coordination. Consequently, intelligence chiefs and their analysts sometimes did not coordinate with other organizations, either as a result of their imperfect integration, or as the result of outright refusal on the part of senior operational leaders to allow them to do so. In the case of the transportation offensive, USSTAF/EOU, Bomber Command, the Air Ministry, and MEW, among others, made an alliance of convenience against Tedder and Zuckerman’s plan, which had support only from their own staffs and RES. Of course, Tedder also had Eisenhower’s ear and complete trust, which proved decisive in the final outcome.®3  The Key Meeting: 25 March 1944  When Eisenhower decided in favor of the transportation plan at the 25 March 1944 meeting, he said everything he had read convinced him that apart from the continuing attack on the Luftwaffe, only the ¢ transportation plan would allow the air forces to make important ela ae to the land battle during th the first weeks of OVERLORD.

Yet he also believed there was no evidence that “the Oil plan can, in the short term available, seriously affect the enemy ability to meet the OVERLORD assault.”22 He continued:  The transportation plan is the only plan offering a reasonable prospect of disorganising enemy movement and supply in the time available, and of preparing the ground for imposing the tactical delays which can be vital once land battle is joined. It is also consistent with POINTBLANK. S
