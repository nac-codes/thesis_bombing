allow for anything approaching optimal coordination. Consequently, intelligence chiefs and their analysts sometimes did not coordinate with other organizations, either as a result of their imperfect integration, or as the result of outright refusal on the part of senior operational leaders to allow them to do so. In the case of the transportation offensive, USSTAF/EOU, Bomber Command, the Air Ministry, and MEW, among others, made an alliance of convenience against Tedder and Zuckerman’s plan, which had support only from their own staffs and RE8. Of course, Tedder also had Eisenhower’s ear and complete trust, which proved decisive in the final outcome.&3  The Key Meeting: 25 March 1944  When Eisenhower decided in favor of the transportation plan at the 25 March 1944 meeting, he said everything he had read convinced him that apart from the continuing attack on the Luftwaffe, only the transportation plan would allow the air forces to make important contributions to the land battle during the first weeks of OVERLORD. Meeting minutes reveal some useful insights about how participants either used or failed to use intelligence, professional and personal connections, position, and force of personality to win the day. Tedder began the meeting with an overview, saying his plan had two vital principles. First, the Luftwaffe must remain the top priority to ensure air supremacy for OVERLORD and all other operations on the continent. The next priority should be a sustained attack on enemy transportation—in particular locomotive repair shops and marshaling yards, which in most cases were collocated. Tedder used Zuckerman’s intelligence assessments with great skill, noting the scarcity of motive power (locomotives) and the ability to reduce dramatically and thus “canalize” any German movement toward Normandy, helping fighter-bombers to do their deadly work. Tedder, always a deep thinker, concluded his introduction with an assertion that he “did not wish to claim too much for the p
