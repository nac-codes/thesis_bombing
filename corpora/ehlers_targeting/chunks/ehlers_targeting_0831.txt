nal relationships he had developed with Eisenhower, Tedder, and Zuckerman. Most important was his determination to stay loyal to Eisenhower, even if this meant working his oil and bridge agendas through back channels, which he ultimately did with great success. Arnold’s admonition that “you should stay in Ike’s pocket” was always foremost in Spaatz’s thinking. Finally, Spaatz was not willing to strain his relationship with the commanders of the Tactical Air Forces, who would direct most of the bridge/junction/depot attacks.2%  Spaatz also probably chose not to push these proposals because even before this meeting, it had become clear that USSTAF would be directly under Eisenhower’s control; the formal start of this command arrangement was 14 April 1944. Eisenhower had already told Churchill that he “would simply have to go home’ if he did not receive direct command of all heavy bombers, a statement that took Churchill aback and proved instrumental in swaying him. After the 25 March 1944 meeting, Spaatz claimed he was “ecstatic” about the outcome simply because it kept his bombers from Leigh- Mallory’s command. So in this case, sound intelligence gave way for the time being to pragmatic political and command-and-control considerations, but this was not the end of Spaatz’s ultimately successful efforts. Spaatz left the meeting, in his own words, “jubilant and overjoyed” because his bombers would remain under Eisenhower’s and Tedder’s command. He also knew he still had plenty of opportunities to change his superiors’ minds on oil and bridges, which he did with great skill, diplomacy, and occasional sleight of hand.8*  Harris said Bomber Command could contribute in two ways: with night precision raids on most of the marshaling yards to be struck, and with continued attacks on cities. By going along yet asking for nothing more than what his command was already doing, Harris found a middle way as well as the opening required to contribute directly to the preinvasion effor
