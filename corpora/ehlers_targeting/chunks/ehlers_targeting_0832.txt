on cities. By going along yet asking for nothing more than what his command was already doing, Harris found a middle way as well as the opening required to contribute directly to the preinvasion effort while pursuing his city campaign.22  Portal made several comments at critical junctures in the meeting that helped lay the groundwork for the combined transportation-oil-bridges plan that ultimately emerged. He said that the oil plan had great potential, and he asked Mr. Lawrence of MEW to clarify just how the plan would assist both preinvasion and postinvasion efforts. Mr. Lawrence replied that although it would likely not have an immediate impact in the Normandy battle area, it would most certainly have a widespread effect within about three months. This, Portal said, showed conclusively that although the oil offensive could not have the desired effects in support of OVERLORD, it could well be of great significance later and should therefore receive very careful attention. Eisenhower agreed.2+  Adaptability or Intransigence? Senior Officers and Intelligence  One of the striking things about the meeting and its aftermath was the varying degrees to which subsequent damage assessments and other intelligence reports changed the senior airmen’s views. Spaatz, quite reasonably, felt vindicated by his aircrews’ victory over the Luftwaffe along with the almost immediate effects of oil and, later, bridge attacks on German operational capabilities. These brought Portal and Tedder firmly into the oil-and-bridges camp, a testament to their flexibility. At the same time, Spaatz later, and more begrudgingly, acknowledged how decisive the Tedder-Zucker- man transportation plan was in canalizing and restricting train movements even before they reached bombed-out bridges—a process we will see unfolding in subsequent pages. In this sense, although he gradually backed away from his idea that bombing could win the war, Spaatz was largely unrepentant and thus not disposed to change his
