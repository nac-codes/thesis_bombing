ll see unfolding in subsequent pages. In this sense, although he gradually backed away from his idea that bombing could win the war, Spaatz was largely unrepentant and thus not disposed to change his operational views as a result of available intelligence, which in any case largely supported his positions. And like the rest of his comrades, he chafed under political decisions that overrode evidence presented in his staff’s intelligence documents. The militarily pointless bombing of U-boat bases was an early case, while the politicians’ dogged insistence on cRossBow’s strikes on V-1 launch sites was a later one. Above all, Spaatz and Arnold detested what Arnold described as the process of “diversion, diversion, and yet more diversion” that constantly threatened to rob Spaatz of the potent heavy-bomber force he needed to achieve his objectives.22  Tedder did better than most in understanding, on the basis of intelligence inputs, how the synergy among transportation, oil, and bridge (and later canal/waterway) attacks was degrading German operational capabilities. Although Tedder was first and foremost a transportation plan advocate, he supported Spaatz’s oil plan and its implementation from early in the process and signed on to bridge attacks as soon as he saw their complementary role in the larger effort. His careful review of intelligence reports, combined with his willingness in almost all cases to consider them objectively, allowed him to see clearly how heavy bombers could best work with other air assets as well as armies and navies to degrade and ultimately undermine the German war effort.  Portal’s willingness to learn from intelligence is perhaps the most clear. His recommendations on the move to city bombing, which he supported on the basis of the inability, at the time, to hit point targets at night, is one case in point. He read the intelligence carefully, recognized the political pressures building up in favor of city bombing, and threw his weight behind th
