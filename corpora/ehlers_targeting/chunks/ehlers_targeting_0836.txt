on the basis of intelligence inputs, how the synergy among transportation, oil, and bridge (and later canal/waterway) attacks was degrading German operational capabilities. Although Tedder was first and foremost a transportation plan advocate, he supported Spaatz’s oil plan and its implementation from early in the process and signed on to bridge attacks as soon as he saw their complementary role in the larger effort. His careful review of intelligence reports, combined with his willingness in almost all cases to consider them objectively, allowed him to see clearly how heavy bombers could best work with other air assets as well as armies and navies to degrade and ultimately undermine the German war effort.  Portal’s willingness to learn from intelligence is perhaps the most clear. His recommendations on the move to city bombing, which he supported on the basis of the inability, at the time, to hit point targets at night, is one case in point. He read the intelligence carefully, recognized the political pressures building up in favor of city bombing, and threw his weight behind the effort. The fact that available intelligence later drove him to shift his support from city attacks to transportation and oil further substantiates his willingness to give intelligence serious consideration. Portal’s effort to stop the bombing of U-boat bases in France, though ultimately unsuccessful, was another example of the attention he paid to intelligence. His support for USAAF daylight bombing never flagged, even though it began before the Americans had proven themselves. The intelligence he received as American bombing picked up, and as Spaatz’s aircrews destroyed the Luftwaffe day fighter force, kept him on course here. Portal’s strong support for the transportation, oil, and bridge plans indicates that he understood their potential synergy as well as Tedder. This flexible and pragmatic approach to intelligence allowed Portal to support Eisenhower and Tedder throughout the latter
