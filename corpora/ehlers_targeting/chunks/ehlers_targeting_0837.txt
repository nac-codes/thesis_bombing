lans indicates that he understood their potential synergy as well as Tedder. This flexible and pragmatic approach to intelligence allowed Portal to support Eisenhower and Tedder throughout the latter period of the war. Denis Richards noted that “Portal’s sustained support of Tedder was a vital factor in the achievement of victory, first in Africa and then in Europe.”*4 Perhaps Portal’s only notable failure to use intelligence effectively (aside from raids on U-boat bases—a political battle he could not win) was his inability to rein Harris in completely as he persisted in pursuing his city-bombing effort even as he attacked oil targets.2*  Harris, although wedded to his city-bombing effort throughout the war, did recognize after the war that while the senior leadership had “bet on an outsider” with respect to oil, it proved to be the “panacea target” heavy bombers could most significantly affect. His real failures in the intelligence arena were, first, his unwillingness to keep an open mind about the reports he saw, and more importantly, his intransigent position in favor of city bombing even after the transportation and oil offensives had so clearly succeeded. The depth of Harris’s failure to consider compelling intelligence will become clear in our look at the oil offensive. If Ralph Bennett’s assertion that “Harris was completely impervious to intelligence” is a bit harsh, it does not greatly stretch the truth.2&  At the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, Eaker and his operations and intelligence chief, Brigadier General Charles Cabell, proved adept at using intelligence to determine tactical and operational courses of action. Cabell had the unique position of combined operations-intelligence chief, and he was also a brilliant intelligence analyst and consumer in his own right. The fact that Eaker and Cabell led a series of huge air campaigns, fought out in the largest active military theater of operations in Europe, stands as a testament to their effective use of
