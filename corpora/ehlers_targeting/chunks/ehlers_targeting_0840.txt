f the problem and a plan to warn civilians living near rail yards to move away. The letter also emphasized that the transportation plan would not interfere greatly with Bomber Command’s city attacks—something of great importance to Harris and, to an increasingly limited but still real extent, Churchill. But the civilian-casualty issue, with its competing intelligence estimates, most clearly stretched out the debate—even more than the continuing efforts to get oil and bridges onboard—and further delayed the full implementation of preinvasion bombing.  Early in April, Churchill advised Eisenhower that the cabinet was becoming increasingly concerned at the possibility of heavy civilian casualties. It took a concerted effort by Eisenhower, Tedder, and Portal to derail this opposition, starting with intelligence analyses countering the ones RE8 and Bomber Command had put forth. When bombing started, SHAEF provided additional reports based on French and Belgian human intelligence sources, proving civilian casualties were much lower than expected.1°° Perhaps most decisive, however, were the political allies this group brought onboard. General Pierre Koenig, senior Free French Forces officer in the United Kingdom, said forcefully on 16 May, “This is war. It must be expected that people will be killed. We would take twice the anticipated loss to be rid of the Germans.”12 Even more decisive was Roosevelt’s utter lack of support for Churchill throughout the debate. The critical moment came on 11 May, when Roosevelt told Churchill flatly that he felt compelled to listen to Eisenhower, and that military considerations must outweigh loss of civilian life: “However regrettable the attendant loss of civilian lives is, 1am not prepared to impose from this distance any restriction on military action by the responsible commanders that in their opinion might militate against the success of ‘OVERLORD’ or cause additional loss of life to our Allied forces of invasion.”1°2 As it turned ou
