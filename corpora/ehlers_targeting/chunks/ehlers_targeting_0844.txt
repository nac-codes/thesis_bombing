nd Hughes. The TTC used the myriad damage assessments produced during the transportation offensive to assess damage to each target, update its weekly target priority list, request reconnaissance sorties, and issue progress reports. These assessments included strike photos and strike-attack reports with bomb plots from bombardment units, first-phase (immediate) and second-phase (interpretation) reports from ACIU K and F Sections, and third-phase reports from MEW and the RRS1%  The result of the TTC’s efforts was a comprehensive target list including rail centers and bridges but initially overlooking canals. An Office of Strategic Services report pushed for attacks on canals. The Office of Strategic Services provided detailed information on canal locks outside French towns, and it closed with a note that the Maquis was already sabotaging them and that large contingents of the Germans’ Todt Organization were repairing them. These were recommendations airmen should have heeded. The fact that a copy of the report is in Spaatz’s files indicates he and his staff read it. They should have planned accordingly but instead had to rely on SAS reports, produced over a month after D-day, before they realized the Germans were using canals to transport supplies and en- tire divisions into Normandy.12%  As Allied leaders argued over the plan and its timing, Portal had already told Harris to begin the “experimental” raids on 4 March 1944. These confirmed the effectiveness of Gee- and Oboe-guided attacks on these targets and undermined Harris’s arguments that his bombers could not reliably hit them.1@ His target list encompassed at first six and then twelve vital marshaling yards, including the huge one at Trappes, outside of Paris, which was the first to feel the fury of Bomber Command’s raids.42%  Etaples ENGLISH pu Map 12 CHANNEL Normandy  Peronne Ea} Transport  Network  a La Pére Ratiroed  Main Road  Bridge  Page 212 of 423 52%  isennhower'’s unwavering support for the plan and Ko
