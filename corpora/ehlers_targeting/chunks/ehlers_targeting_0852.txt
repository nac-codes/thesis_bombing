attack on Lille by 239 aircraft destroying a locomotive shed, a locomotive repair shop, and most of the wagon repair facilities. According to French records obtained after the liberation of Lille, 2,124 of the 2,959 wagons in the yard were smashed, along with several locomotives. Another fourteen raids during the following four days caused moderate or light damage and destroyed a number of wagons and locomotives. The rate of destruction, particularly for wagons and engines, far outpaced repairs.

Summary No. 2, for raids carried out 23-30 March, and all subsequent summaries were divided into three parts: attacks, damage and repair, and deductions (assessments). The most effective raid that week was against Creil, where bombers flattened every structure and destroyed twenty-one locomotives along with large quantities of rolling stock.

Most locomotives were still i
