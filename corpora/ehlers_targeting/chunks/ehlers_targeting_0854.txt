g the following four days caused moderate or light damage and destroyed a number of wagons and locomotives. The rate of destruction, particularly for wagons and engines, far outpaced repairs. Reconnaissance also confirmed the locomotive repair depots formerly at Amiens and Creil had been transferred to Crepy-en-Valois, Compiégne, and Le Bourget, which prompted raids there 12  Attacks on 14-20 April were the first carried out under Eisenhower’s bombing directive. Of the ten, two caused severe (category A) damage, three caused moderate (category B) damage, and five missed. The two category A raids caused severe damage to Charleroi/St. Martin and Juvisy. At Charleroi, on 18 April, one roundhouse was destroyed and the other severely damaged. All other structures were heavily damaged, all through tracks cut, and a large number of wagons destroyed. At Juvisy, which was attacked on 18-19 April, heavy bombers obliterated the transshipment and locomotive sheds and destroyed a large number of locomotives and wagons.142 Marshaling yards attacked during the pre-OVERLORD transportation campaign. Many German units trying to reach the battle area and throw Allied armies back into the sea had to pass through rail yards in Belgium and France, espe- cially Paris. The concentration of targets in these areas makes this clear. (Mark, Aerial Interdiction, 224)  RTC damage assessments evolved rapidly as the campaign progressed. Summary No. 2, for raids carried out 23-30 March, and all subsequent summaries were divided into three parts: attacks, damage and repair, and deductions (assessments). The most effective raid that week was against Creil, where bombers flattened every structure and destroyed twenty-one locomotives along with large quantities of rolling stock. The French and Germans simply abandoned it. Reconnaissance during this period also highlighted Trappes, where seventeen days of repairs were required before even basic marshaling activities resumed. Most locomotives were still
