a timetable meant continuous work for 4 weeks.”12 The raid destroyed the engine shed, a control tower, and many wagons. Some of these, loaded with ammunition, caused huge secondary explosions and fires.44  It quickly became obvious that bombing was producing major effects. Less clear was its effectiveness in terms of interdicting the movement of German reinforcements and supplies. In the press of events, people sometimes forgot Zuckerman’s caveat: transportation attacks would not produce major effects for several weeks, and they would act in concert with medium and fighter-bomber oper- ations along with SAS/Maquis missions.  Despite these concerns, copious intelligence indicated how severely pre-OVERLORD attacks impeded rail movements. In January, there were already 347 trains held up in French marshaling yards awaiting locomotives. Each had sixty to ninety wagons, meaning there were 21,000-31,500 wagons sitting idle. Once attacks began, idled trains increased in number as locomotives were wrecked. This made raids even more devastating as they destroyed thousands of wagons on sidings.41&  By now, SHAEF’s Intelligence Operations Section was producing reports for individual rail centers, which showed increasingly severe and permanent damage. Along with ACIU K and F reports, these products were building blocks for third-phase RRS assessments. They included a description of the marshaling yard and key facilities, dates of attacks and tonnages dropped, and results based on reconnaissance cover as well as ACIU K and F reports. Three critical components—locomotive repair facilities, marshaling facilities, and through lines—each received an out-of-action percentage, and the rail center a category A, B, or C damage rating. By late May, most had an A or B rating. Damage to locomotive repair shops and marshaling facilities was increasingly severe, and the number of destroyed and damaged locomotives was skyrocketing. A 23 May SHAEF damage assessment said nearly half of locomot
