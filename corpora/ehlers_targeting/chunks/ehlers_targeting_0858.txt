otive repair shops and marshaling facilities was increasingly severe, and the number of destroyed and damaged locomotives was skyrocketing. A 23 May SHAEF damage assessment said nearly half of locomotive shops were 50 to 100 percent destroyed. Consequently, the Germans often had to write off damaged engines, worsening the shortage of motive power.2  The Germansâ€™ problems also increased when bridges came under concerted attack on 8 May. Most bridges over the Seine and Loire were down within the next two weeks, as were many over the Albert Canal, the Meuse, and most other major waterways. These attacks forced the Germans to unload trains at these bridges, reload them onto barges, unload the barges on the far side of the river, and then either reload on trains there or road march. The latter became the more common practice after D-day, with a variety of deleterious effects. Ultra intercepts allowed intelligence specialists to track them. They also gave clear insight into the effectiveness of complementary rail and bridge attacks.48  Delaying the German Response to Allied Landings  Page 219 of 423 54%  missed. [he two category A raids caused severe damage to Cnarleroi/st. Martin and Juvisy. At Cnarlerol, on 18 April, one roundhouse was destroyed and the other severely damaged. All other structures were heavily damaged, all through tracks cut, and a large number of wagons destroyed. At Juvisy, which was attacked on 18-19 April, heavy bombers obliterated the transshipment and locomotive sheds and destroyed a large number of locomotives and wagons.142  This growing catalog of destruction soon included marshaling yards in western Germany, with Aachen and Hamm suffering severe damage from raids on 11-12 and 22 April. Aachen was down for nearly two weeks, and Hamm never fully recovered. Fritz Knickenberg, chief inspector of the Hamm railway district, said the 22 April raid was the worst of the war, blanketing the facility with 1,251 craters. No trains moved for two days, and
