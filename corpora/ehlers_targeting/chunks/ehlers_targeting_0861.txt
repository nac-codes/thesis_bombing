throw Allied armies back into the sea. Their failure was largely a result of the transportation offensive. The 1st SS Panzer Division, for instance, left Louvain, Belgium, on 17 June and did not reach Caen until 4 July, seventeen days later. The journey involved 270 rail miles and another 140 road miles. It would have taken three days under preattack conditions, but bombing of marshaling yards at Ghent, Lille, and Maubeuge caused delays of over a week. Attacks on rail centers around Paris forced the division to road march. Along the way, it was attacked regularly by fighter-bombers, suffering significant losses, and further delayed crossing the  Seine, where the bridges were down. When the division finally arrived in Normandy, it was low on fuel, cohesion, and morale.442  Cherbourg  ¢ Cotentin  Plan Over orp  Page 219 of 423 54%  Despite these concerns, copious intelligence indicated how severely pre-OVERLORD attacks impeded rail movements. In January, there were already 347 trains held up in French marshaling yards awaiting locomotives. Each had sixty to ninety wagons, meaning there were 21,000-31,500 wagons sitting idle. Once attacks began, idled trains increased in number as locomotives were wrecked. This made raids even more devastating as they destroyed thousands of wagons on sidings.14&  By now, SHAEF’s Intelligence Operations Section was producing reports for individual rail centers, which showed increasingly severe and permanent damage. Along with ACIU K and F reports, these products were building blocks for third-phase RRS assessments. They included a description of the marshaling yard and key facilities, dates of attacks and tonnages dropped, and results based on reconnaissance cover as well as ACIU K and F reports. Three critical components—locomotive repair facilities, marshaling facilities, and through lines—each received an out-of-action percentage, and the rail center a category A, B, or C damage rating. By late May, most had an A or B rating. Damage
