sion, which required ten days; and the 265th Infantry Division, which spent nine days on the march.428 German POWs described this problem clearly, making it obvious that the Germans, having failed to throw Allied armies into the Channel early, would not do so at all. The battle in the bocage became one of attrition, in which the Germans fought skillfully but with an increasingly strained and ultimately disastrous supply situation.  SS Obergruppenfiihrer Josef “Sepp” Dietrich, commander of 1st SS Panzer Corps, said the seventy-three days of action defending Caen were the hardest of his career:  The supply problem became more and more difficult. Fuel and ammunition had to come more than 400 km [250 miles] over roads that were under the control of the enemy air force 24 hours a day. The losses of vehicles loaded with fuel and ammunition were felt severely, and deprived our defense of the necessary support. We could not mount any more attacks of our own.... The sup- ply problem became even more difficult because of the destruction of bridges, roads, and railroads.122  Bombing Results Become Clear  A 6 July USSTAF A-2 report said, “The evidence is already conclusive that these operations have had a disastrous effect on enemy logistics.”12° ACIU, SHAEF, and RRS reports, combined with Ultra intercepts and intelligence gleaned from POW interrogations, gave intelligence personnel a clear understanding of airpower’s key role in the campaign. Reconnaissance photos and Ultra intercepts pro-  vided a nearly complete picture of the status of marshaling yards and bridges, rates of repair, and the proper moment for reattacks.124  Page 222 of 423 54%  Gti alll All MAKE CAllEeLOUs LUAU Mild CLES, Usills UP LUC IIICIEIME ILS, Wed iilf UUL LIEV Y CQUIVITICIIL, ALIU LARIIIS Coho Ud Lies LOTT TELL ALIU LIS TILEL-DULLIVEL ALLACKo.
