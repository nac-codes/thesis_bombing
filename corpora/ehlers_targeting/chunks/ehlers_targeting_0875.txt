Fighter-bombers were already singling out the tankertrucks for destruction. During the road march north on 5-7 June, the division moved at night, attacked by night bombers. Bayerlein constantly lost men and vehicles and had to lead his division on long detours, slowing down the move and causing accidents and wear and tear on equipment. In addition, the distant railheads forced Bayerlein to send trucks constantly on supply runs. These took several days to complete a round-trip journey. Demotorization had the usual negative effects on combat power and maneuverability.122  A similar pattern unfolded for the 17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division, which arrived at the front after nine days of rail and road movement; the 2nd Panzer Division, which required five days to get to the front; the 77th Infantry Division, which required ten days; and the 265th Infantry Division, which spent nine days on the march.128 German POWs described this problem clearly, making it obvious that the Germans, having failed to throw Allied armies into the Channel early, would not do so at all. The battle in the bocage became one of attrition, in which the Germans fought skillfully but with an increasingly strained and ultimately disastrous supply situation.  SS Obergruppenfihrer Josef “Sepp” Dietrich, commander of 1st SS Panzer Corps, said the seventy-three days of action defending Caen were the hardest of his career:  The supply problem became more and more difficult.
