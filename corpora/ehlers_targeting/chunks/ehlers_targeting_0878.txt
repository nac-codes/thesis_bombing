AAF Eval Bd/ETO, "Effectiveness of Air Attac! nst Rail Transportation in the Battle of France,” p. 68; Zuckerman, From Apes to Warlords, 299.  Rail traffic trends in France and the vital Région Nord. This precipitous decline in rail traffic forced the Germans to use roads and inland waterways—both also heavily attacked, but by medium and fighter-bombers—to reinforce and  resupply. It became impossible for the Germans to keep up with the Allied buildup or to engage in large-scale maneuver warfare once the French transportation infrastructure collapsed under constant Allied air attacks. (Eduard Mark, Aerial Interdiction in Three Wars /Washington, D.C.: Center for Air Force History, 1994], 239)  Reestablishing through traffic at rail centers averaged seven days, while bridge repair took an average of ten days, with severely damaged bridges averaging sixteen days. Repairs also took longer on average after D-day because repeated attacks did increasingly severe damage to bridge structures, degraded the load-bearing capacity of surrounding earth, and, as the number of attacks skyrocketed, spread repair crews thin. In addition, new reconnaissance cover of each bridge became available on average every 3.7 days, so there was rarely a time when the Allies did not know the optimal moment for reattacks.122  As damage reports illustrated, rail center attacks had already taken a heavy toll on the French railroad network prior to D-day and brought it to the point of severe crisis by July. An RRS assessment, based in part on a report by the SNCF director general that had fallen into Allied hands just before his arrest by the Germans on D-day, said a great deal about what the transportation offensive was doing to German logistics and combat power. First, it noted that by the end of May, of nineteen major marshaling yards in northeast France and around Paris, only three were working at 100 percent of preattack capacitv. one at 70 percent. three between 15 and 40 percent. and the othe
