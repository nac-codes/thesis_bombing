of nineteen major marshaling yards in northeast France and around Paris, only three were working at 100 percent of preattack capacitv. one at 70 percent. three between 15 and 40 percent. and the other twelve at 10 percent or less.

Rail traffic trends in France and the vital Région Nord. This precipitous decline in rail traffic forced the Germans to use roads and inland waterways—both also heavily attacked, but by medium and fighter-bombers—to reinforce and resupply. It became impossible for the Germans to keep up with the Allied buildup or to engage in large-scale maneuver warfare once the French transportation infrastructure collapsed under constant Allied air attacks. (Eduard Mark, Aerial Interdiction in Three Wars /Washington, D.C.: Center for Air Force History, 1994], 239)  Reestablishing through traffic at rail centers averaged seven days, while bridge repair took an average of ten days, with severely damaged bridges averaging sixteen days. Repairs also took longer on average after D-day because repeated attacks did increasingly severe damage to bridge structures, degraded the load-bearing capacity of surrounding earth, and, as the number of attacks skyrocketed, spread repair crews thin. In addition, new reconnaissance cover of each bridge became available on average every 3.7 days, so there was rarely a time when the Allies did not know the optimal moment  for reattacks.122  As dam
