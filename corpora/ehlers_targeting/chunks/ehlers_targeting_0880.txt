. In addition, new reconnaissance cover of each bridge became available on average every 3.7 days, so there was rarely a time when the Allies did not know the optimal moment  for reattacks.122  As damage reports illustrated, rail center attacks had already taken a heavy toll on the French railroad network prior to D-day and brought it to the point of severe crisis by July. An RRS assessment, based in part on a report by the SNCF director general that had fallen into Allied hands just before his arrest by the Germans on D-day, said a great deal about what the transportation offensive was doing to German logistics and combat power.43 First, it noted that by the end of May, of nineteen major marshaling yards in northeast France and around Paris, only three were working at 100 percent of preattack capacity, one at 70 percent, three between 15 and 40 percent, and the other twelve at 10 percent or less. The number of serviceable locomotives dropped from 15,927 to 11,300, while destruction of repair shops removed most recuperative capacity. Total serviceable wagons decreased from 434,000 to 203,000. In addition, seventy-four bridges and tunnels were out of service and another eleven partially unserviceable, most along the Seine and Loire. Of 467 locomotive repair sheds, 70 were destroyed, 20 rendered temporarily unusable, and many more damaged. SNCF train- miles per day dropped from 104,780 on 1 November 1943 to 71,300 on 1 May 1944. Also important, though not good for relations with the French, air attacks killed 1,262 and wounded 4,040 hard-to- replace SNCF workers by 1 May. To reduce losses in the northern region, on 2 May, the Germans began diverting traffic to the east and southeast regions, causing serious delays for troops and supplies heading to Normandy. They now made a circuitous journey through eastern and central France and stopped at the Loire, where the bridges were down. It was here, after D-day, that truck convoys col- lected supplies.1+24  An SNCF departme
