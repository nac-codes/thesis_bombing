ied hands just before his arrest by the Germans on D-day, said a great deal about what the transportation offensive was doing to German logistics and combat power.3 First, it noted that by the end of May, of nineteen major marshaling yards in northeast France and around Paris, only three were working at 100 percent of preattack capacity, one at 70 percent, three between 15 and 40 percent, and the other twelve at 10 percent or less. The number of serviceable locomotives dropped from 15,927 to 11,300, while destruction of repair shops removed most recuperative capacity. Total serviceable wagons decreased from 434,000 to 203,000. In addition, seventy-four bridges and tunnels were out of service and another eleven partially unserviceable, most along the Seine and Loire. Of 467 locomotive repair sheds, 70 were destroyed, 20 rendered temporarily unusable, and many more damaged. SNCF train- miles per day dropped from 104,780 on 1 November 1943 to 71,300 on 1 May 1944. Also important, though not good for relations with the French, air attacks killed 1,262 and wounded 4,040 hard-to- replace SNCF workers by 1 May. To reduce losses in the northern region, on 2 May, the Germans began diverting traffic to the east and southeast regions, causing serious delays for troops and supplies heading to Normandy. They now made a circuitous journey through eastern and central France and stopped at the Loire, where the bridges were down. It was here, after D-day, that truck convoys col- lected supplies.1*4  An SNCF department head wrote the director a memo in early May, a copy of which also fell into Allied hands, with the following observations:  Bombardment operations relating to transport [are] perfectly conceived and realized. If we, who belong to the S.N.C.F., had to practice a sabotage of the same character, we would not do any bet- ter. Disorganization is progressive and irreparable. The Allies make work necessary and know how to adjust their raids to await the repercussions of previ
