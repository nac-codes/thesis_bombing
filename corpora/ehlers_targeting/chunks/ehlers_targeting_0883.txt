the same character, we would not do any bet- ter. Disorganization is progressive and irreparable. The Allies make work necessary and know how to adjust their raids to await the repercussions of previous raids. When one speaks of working resumed, it means that we made atrain pass. ... These recent days ... movement of troop trains is totally interrupted. ... The Germans were furious. It would be impossible now to pass a div- ision from north to south or south to north.14%  By the third week of May, traffic through stations north of Paris was reduced from 186 trains per day to 61. Only small trains snuck through between attacks. By D-day, locomotive and crew shortages idled 1,017 trains. By 9 June, the figure was 1,278 trains. Only 495 trains moved in June, an 87.5 percent traffic reduction. Damage to rail centers required a shift from large trains (sixty to ninety wagons) carrying a division to small trains (three to eighteen wagons). It also caused delays, diversions, and circuitous routing, playing havoc with troop and supply movements.12&  Colonel Hans Hoeffner, a senior logistics officer, painted a gloomy picture. Fielded forces required 7,000 tons of supplies per day, 5,000 of which were supposed to come by train and the other 2,000 by truck. However, an average of only three trains per day entered the battle area, delivering about 1,400 tons, while another 700 tons moved by barge down the Seine from Paris to Rouen, and another 1,200 tons by truck convoy—a total of 3,300 tons. Given the weakened state of German divisions, the minimum requirement was probably closer to 5,250 tons. Still, this left a shortfall of 1,950 tons. Finally, supply shipments contained 70 percent ammunition, 20 percent fuel, and 10 percent rations, underscoring the degree to which German operations were becoming static and defensive.122  In two subsequent reports, the RRS completed its assessment of the transportation campaign’s effects and effectiveness. During July, the Germans moved 39
