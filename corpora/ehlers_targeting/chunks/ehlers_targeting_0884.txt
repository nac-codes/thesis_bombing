ations were becoming static and defensive.122  In two subsequent reports, the RRS completed its assessment of the transportation campaign’s effects and effectiveness. During July, the Germans moved 395 trains, an average of thirteen every twenty-four hours in all of France. Of sixty-seven fuel trains dispatched by the end of June from Strasbourg, only four made it to forward depots. The rest were rerouted to more distant points, making for long supply runs by truck convoys. These detours led to major delays, greater stress on locomotives, serious fatigue for the shrinking pool of SNCF workers, and hence greater friction at all points in the transportation effort. Reconnaissance coverage allowed the Allies to see when trains were forming up, when units they were transporting arrived, and when the optimum time for attack—as trains were loading—had arrived.128  The critical locomotive shortage forced the Germans to bring 200 engines from the east, where they were sorely missed during the Russian summer offensive. Even more serious was the impact of the railroad crisis on units in southern and southwestern France once Operation DRAGOON (ANVIL) threatened to cut off German troops.22  Extended Operational Impacts: Southern France  Just before DRAGOON, Eaker, commanding 15th Air Force, cabled Spaatz a list of twelve bridges that had to be knocked out to achieve complete railroad interdiction before the landings. These were promptly dropped.14° The end result for German units of the 19th Army in southeastern France was a disaster. They quickly ran out of fuel and had no rail transportation, so they were thus forced to flee, for the most part on foot. A few had motorized vehicles, but these came under fighter-bomber attack and were destroyed or ran out of fuel and had to be abandoned.
