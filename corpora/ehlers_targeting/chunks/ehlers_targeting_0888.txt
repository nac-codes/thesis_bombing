Most reached the frontiers of Germany and were reequipped (not as well as previously) to fight in the war’s closing campaigns; but somewhere along the back roads of southern France, their faith in a German victory faltered. In consequence of these cataclysms, Albert Speer, touring the Reich’s western defenses, wrote to the Fiihrer on 15 September 1944, saying, “The lack of heavy weapons felt by the army on the Western Front is shock- ing. ...

Reconnaissance aircraft discovered them near Nevers, Bruges, and Poitiers, moving northeast mostly on foot.
