all trains snuck through between attacks. By D-day, locomotive and crew shortages idled 1,017 trains. By 9 June, the figure was 1,278 trains. Only 495 trains moved in June, an 87.5 percent traffic reduction. Damage to rail centers required a shift from large trains (sixty to ninety wagons) carrying a division to small trains (three to eighteen wagons). It also caused delays, diversions, and circuitous routing, playing havoc with troop and supply movements.42&  Colonel Hans Hoeffner, a senior logistics officer, painted a gloomy picture. Fielded forces required 7,000 tons of supplies per day, 5,000 of which were supposed to come by train and the other 2,000 by truck. However, an average of only three trains per day entered the battle area, delivering about 1,400 tons, while another 700 tons moved by barge down the Seine from Paris to Rouen, and another 1,200 tons by truck convoy—a total of 3,300 tons. Given the weakened state of German divisions, the minimum requirement was probably closer to 5,250 tons. Still, this left a shortfall of 1,950 tons. Finally, supply shipments contained 70 percent ammunition, 20 percent fuel, and 10 percent rations, underscoring the degree to which German operations were becoming static and defensive.422  In two subsequent reports, the RRS completed its assessment of the transportation campaign’s effects and effectiveness. During July, the Germans moved 395 trains, an average of thirteen every twenty-four hours in all of France. Of sixty-seven fuel trains dispatched by the end of June from Strasbourg, only four made it to forward depots. The rest were rerouted to more distant points, making for long supply runs by truck convoys. These detours led to major delays, greater stress on locomotives, serious fatigue for the shrinking pool of SNCF workers, and hence greater friction at all points in the transportation effort. Reconnaissance coverage allowed the Allies to see when trains were forming up, when units they were transporting arrived,
