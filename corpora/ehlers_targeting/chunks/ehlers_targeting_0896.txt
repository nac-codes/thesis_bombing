SAS teams destroyed more canal locks on the Seine, holding up fuel shipments to the front; and the Maquis destroyed several barges carrying 100,000 gallons of fuel on the Niévres River near its confluence with the Loire. Smaller attacks destroyed another 264,100 gallons of fuel. Taken together, these actions destroyed nearly 400,000 gallons of fuel and represented a banner day in the unremitting effort to deplete Ger- man fuel stocks.142  Attacks increased with the destruction of seventy railroad fuel tank cars on 5 August. Each carried about 8,000 gallons, representing a loss of 560,000 gallons, which the Germans could ill afford with  thair num wohicloc chart af firal in tha Avranchac_Falaica araae and thie unahla tn anaaca in mananwar wrarfara urith Alliad farcac durina tha hraakant An 19 Aumict tha CAC dactrawad annthar 2046 159  Page 228 of 423 55%  The Traffic Desert  By September, the third and final RRS report said, intelligence personnel saw “the final petering out of German formation movements on the S.N.C.F. and Belgian State Railways... the study of which has been undertaken by this Service ever since adequate information became available towards the close of 1941.”144 This confirmed not only the demise of organized rail movement, but also the usefulness of the intensive RRS analysis of French and Belgian railroads for nearly three years before the transportation offensive. The agency understood the SNCF’s strengths and weaknesses, influ- encing how the Allies planned and executed this decisive campaign. Superb reconnaissance photos, as well as ACIU K and F damage assessments, made the jobs of RRS analysts much easier.  Only 294 trains moved during August 1944, down from 535 in June and 395 in July. Nearly complete paralysis of the railroads had set in, with troop delays, detours, and high threat of night and fighter-bomber attacks the rule. Continuing raids on marshaling yards, bridges, viaducts, and canals reduced remaining transportation capabilities
