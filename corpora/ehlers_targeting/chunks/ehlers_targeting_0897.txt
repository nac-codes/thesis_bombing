troop delays, detours, and high threat of night and fighter-bomber attacks the rule. Continuing raids on marshaling yards, bridges, viaducts, and canals reduced remaining transportation capabilities to nearly nil.145 Canals were not on the original tar- get list but were added in July, when SAS teams in France discovered the Germans were using barges on the Seine and Loire to move troops and supplies into Normandy.  The SAS-Airpower Tie: Direct-Action Missions in Context  The British had long planned to use large numbers of SAS teams, each with five to ten men working with the Maquis. They had orders to attack trains, truck convoys, vehicle parks, and supply depots and to report on enemy troop movements and the effects of air attacks. Planners envisioned an SAS force in France of between 2,250 and 2,900 men. SAS teams, working with the Maquis and American Office of Strategic Services Jedburgh teams, had French and Belgian interpreters assigned. Also, and of vital importance for the timely SAS intelligence so valuable during the transportation campaign, each team had a secure radio. An SAS operations order said, “All fuel dumps and fuel storage facilities supplying B Echelons of certain armoured divisions will be considered in detail and attacked. Roads leading to alternative dumps will then be ambushed.”!“£ This was another clear indication, along with targeting fuel tanker-trucks and trains, that Allied leaders sought to maximize the synergy be- tween transportation and oil attacks.  At the fifth meeting of the AEAF Bombing Committee in January 1944, discussions focused on coordinating air attacks, Special Operations Executive sabotage, and SAS direct-action missions to maximize effects. Special Operations Executive representatives and their SAS counterparts focused on railroad lines and signaling devices within 150 miles of the battle area. From the outset, bomb- ing and special operations were closely connected through the targeting-bombing-assessment feedback l
