a day, when in fact the total proved closer to 100 as a result of the first phase of crossBow, the heavy-bomber effort against V-1s. Nonetheless, the threat appeared dire, and in late December, Bomber Command and the USAAF—especially the latter, given its “daylight precision” capabilities—went after the sites. This preponderance of American bombers in what Spaatz and Arnold thought should be a British-led effort created some tense moments and further convinced Spaatz his bombers must not come under Leigh-Mallory’s command.154  Initial raids proved highly effective: the heavies flattened virtually every large launch complex, forcing the Germans to concentrate repair efforts on parts of the sites vital to launch operations. When new sites appeared on the Cherbourg Peninsula in spring 1944, they received the same treatment. As Babington-Smith noted, early raids proved effective because they put a cap on the maximum number of daily launches—down from the projected 2,000 to the actual 100. But the Germans changed their procedures, building much smaller and simpler launch sites with heavy camouflage. They also left sites unfinished and brought in the last, vital, components only when about to launch rockets. These countermeasures made bombing difficult because the Allies could not keep pace with the time-sensitive targeting cycle. From this point forward, despite a growing diversion of heavy bombers to crosssow targets, both effects and effectiveness were limited.1*2 As Lieutenant Colonel Haines, a USAAF Ultra analyst, noted,  It must be candidly recorded that air power had proved almost wholly ineffectual against the first and helpless against the second of these advances in technology [the V-1 and V-2]. Bombard- ment of sites, transport, and production had reduced the enemy scale of effort, but it was only an inadequate countermeasure which his efforts would have circumvented if he could have re- tained occupation of the launching sites [Allied armies overran them in su
