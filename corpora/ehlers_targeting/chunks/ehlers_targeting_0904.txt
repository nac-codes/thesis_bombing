scale of effort, but it was only an inadequate countermeasure which his efforts would have circumvented if he could have re- tained occupation of the launching sites [Allied armies overran them in summer and fall 1944].153  One indication the Germans understood Allied ineffectiveness after the first phase of their offensive was a decision not to send up fighters to protect launch sites. The V-weapon assault was high on Hitler’s list of priorities. If the Germans had thought that the entire effort was at risk of collapse under the weight of bombing, a fighter reaction should have been forthcoming. There was none.154 Despite the clear limits of bombing effectiveness after the first phase of cRossBow, all evident in intelligence reports, political imperatives—as with U-boat pens—again proved insurmountable.

Like all other high-value target sets, this one had been under careful ACIU observation since the first test launches at Peenemiinde in October and December 1942. By October 1943, despite severe damage and delays caused by Bomber Command’s 17-18 August night precision raid, the Germans were clearly preparing to launch these weapons from several massive sites under construction in the Pas de Calais region. Over 200 photoreconnaissance sorties, flown on the basis of insights provided by a French agent whose company received contracts to build several of the sites, and the thousands of pictures they produced, left no doubt something significant was afoot. The prime minister presided over a meeting on 8 November 1943 in which all available intelligence received careful consideration, especially the “ski ramp” launch sites for the V-1, which were obviously intended to fire rockets. The first
