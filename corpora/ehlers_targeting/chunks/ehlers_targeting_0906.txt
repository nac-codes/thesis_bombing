s, both effects and effectiveness were limited.152 As Lieutenant Colonel Haines, a USAAF Ultra analyst, noted,  It must be candidly recorded that air power had proved almost wholly ineffectual against the first and helpless against the second of these advances in technology [the V-1 and V-2]. Bombard- ment of sites, transport, and production had reduced the enemy scale of effort, but it was only an inadequate countermeasure which his efforts would have circumvented if he could have re- tained occupation of the launching sites [Allied armies overran them in summer and fall 1944].153  One indication the Germans understood Allied ineffectiveness after the first phase of their offensive was a decision not to send up fighters to protect launch sites. The V-weapon assault was high on Hitler’s list of priorities. If the Germans had thought that the entire effort was at risk of collapse under the weight of bombing, a fighter reaction should have been forthcoming. There was none.=4  Despite the clear limits of bombing effectiveness after the first phase of cRossBow, all evident in intelligence reports, political imperatives—as with U-boat pens—again proved insurmountable. Consequently, policy makers ignored intelligence, including a huge collection of Ultra intercepts indicating the Germans were having no serious trouble working their more modest launch program around Allied bombing. On 19 April, political leaders gave V-1 launch sites highest priority in the POINTBLANK scheme—even higher than the Luftwaffe. As Richard Davis notes, “This may have been the final straw for Spaatz, whose forces Tedder proposed to divert from POINTBLANK for a target system chosen solely for British domestic political considerations.”15* Spaatz’s ultimately successful efforts to keep his heavies away from Leigh-Mallory’s control went into high gear here. He also spent much time trying to minimize diversion of USAAF heavy bombers to a target set he knew was impossible to attack with any significan
