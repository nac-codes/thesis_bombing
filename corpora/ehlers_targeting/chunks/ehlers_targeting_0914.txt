In addition to his standard duties, Major Brown led a groundsurvey team that visited the Trappes marshaling yard in October 1944 to collect ex post facto BDA and French damage records. Major Brown’s report on Trappes contributed to the iterative learning process that played a crucial role in the Allied intelligence effort, as did his team’s work at the Gennevilliers POL storage facility and the Amizy railroad bridge. (USAFA)  The first teams arrived in France in September 1944. Each had eight men, including four damage-assessment specialists and a targets intelligence officer, who followed a three-phase process during each survey. They assembled all attack data (number of attacks, numbers of aircraft and bombs in each attack, and bomb-fuse combinations), interviewed people with information about bombing  effects, and conducted fieldwork. Zuckerman and his scientific team, made up of four officers and several bomb-damage experts who had done this work in 1940 with German bombing of the United Kingdom, turned mountains of data into useful reports.
