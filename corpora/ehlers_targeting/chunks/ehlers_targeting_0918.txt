needed to keep trains running, including marshaling facilities, through lines, signaling and telephone equipment, and water and coal supplies. Bridge attacks proved an indispensable companion target set.1®2 The BAU report also emphasized the utility of SHAEF’s twice-daily target-selection meetings. These venues, in which intelligence officers and RRS civilian experts brought the latest sources to light, helped commanders pick proper targets for upcoming attacks. With few exceptions, this process worked quite well.1%  <a “yy ~ t.$ ss  a. o - —< - > a em b - ve wa oll  oi. Smashed trains and wagons at Trappes. Aside from delaying and disorganizing rail movements, this kind of damage also destroyed goods on wagons and flatcars. The remnants of trucks and other items are littered about. Allied intel- ligence became good enough to allow bombers to catch trains and barges as they were loading or fully loaded, often causing severe damage and high casualties. (USAFA)  The report also confirmed the complementary effects of heavy-bomber and fighter-bomber attacks. As rail centers and their engine repair depots succumbed to bombing, fighter-bomber attacks on running trains reached 500 to 600 per day after D-day. These strikes were mostly within 100 miles of the front and caused a precipitous decrease in traffic, which by D-day was already down to 30 per- cent of January levels. Traffic dropped to 10 percent of January levels by July and for the rest of the campaign.1&  On a related note, Zuckerman emphasized, “French and German records testify to the extreme and immediate sensitivity of traffic-flow attacks of rail centres. In this respect the complex rail network of France and Belgium behaved no differently from the much simpler railway system of Sicily and Southern Italy.”16° He noted four key factors in the success of the transportation offensive: destruction  Page 239 of 423 58%  On arelated note, Zuckerman emphasized, “French and German records testify to the extreme and
