TEN  THE ATTACK ON OIL, APRIL-DECEMBER 1944  Air Intelligence, Bombing, and the Acceleration of German Defeat in the Field  With the attacks on the hydrogenation plants, systematic raids on economic targets have started at the most dangerous point. —Albert Speer to Adolf Hitler, 30 May 1944  Intelligence at the Center: The Oil Offensive’s Origins  Fuel shortages brought on by the oil offensive had a catastrophic effect on Wehrmacht operations. The attack on oil succeeded largely because of basic weaknesses in Germany’s oil and fuel industries, including consumption at a higher rate than accumulation of stocks and strategic reserves of 1.9 million tons at the start of the war compared with an annual consumption of 7.5 million tons. Thus, Germany’s oil supply required constant replenishment. The strategic reserve fell sharply in late 1939 and never exceeded 1.5 million tons. Oil reserves increased with the victories of 1940, but the Reich was now responsible for Italy’s oil requirements and those of the occupied lands. Another key weakness was concentration of fuel production at twentysix large and vulnerable synthetic oil plants and crude oil refineries, which produced 63 percent of the Reich’s gasoline and 90 percent of its aviation fuel.+  When they achieved air supremacy in spring 1944, the Allies went after oil even as they engaged in two consecutive transportation campaigns, first in support of OVERLORD and later against the Reich to undermine the German war economy. These campaigns were highly synergistic. As we have seen, heavy bombers pushed railheads far from the front, forcing the Germans to use truck convoys and, ironically, much more fuel as they made long and dangerous supply runs. Night bombers and fighter-bombers singled out these convoys, along with fuel depots and fuel trains, in an effort to destroy as much
