Every one of these synthetic oil plants and oil refineries came under attack in spring-summer 1944 and produced very little oil and fuel once bombers engaged them. Follow-on attacks were timed to hit each plan work crews completed repairs to damage caused by previous raids. The Germans often snuck in a bit of production between raids, but never very much.

Once bombing of the Reich’s synthetic oil plants got into high gear in May 1944, results were immediate and increasingly catastrophic for German operational mobility and combat power. The same kinds of catastrophic effects occurred at Ploesti and all other conventional oil refineries. (Richard G. Davis, Carl A. Spaatz and the Air War in Europe /Washington, D.C.: Center for Air Force History, 1993], 506)  ACIU photointerpreters had studied the German oil industry intensely since 1940.
