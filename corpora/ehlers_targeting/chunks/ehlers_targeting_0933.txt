d petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) products refined from crude oil decreased from 697,000 tons per month in April 1944 to 33,000 per month in April 1945. The quantity of finished petroleum products from synthetic oil plants decreased from 480,000 tons to 16,000 per month. These figures equaled 4.5 and 3 percent, respectively, of preattack production?  The reconnaissance effort got into high gear in 1941 with extensive coverage of new synthetic oil plants. The Bergius plant at Leuna first came under a Spitfire’s cameras on 13 July 1941. Photos showed eighteen high-pressure coal-conversion cylinders, each capable of producing 22,000 tons of oil per year, an annual total of 396,000 tons. A follow-up sortie noted a second plant under construction at Leuna, which would nearly double output at the site.2 Another important discovery followed when the first cover of Pélitz arrived on 13 September.2 Pélitz soon became the Reich’s leading producer of aviation fuel. Gelsenkirchen was first photographed in December 1940. Photointerpreters estimated its annual output for 1941 and 1942 at 250,000 tons per year and for 1943 at 350,000 tons.22 Reports followed quickly for Magdeburg, Liitzkendorf, and Zeitz, which together produced nearly a million tons of fuel annually.+4 The discovery of Briix, the Reich’s largest oil plant, followed in May 1942.  Briix was one of those instances in which mundane sources—advertisements for workers in Prague newspapers and petroleum engineers in German engineering journals—tipped off the British. The sortie they sent to investigate discovered the plant. Its fifteen coal-conversion stalls could each produce 50,000 tons of oil annually, a total output of 750,000 tons. Two were complete within two months, providing an initial output of 100,000 tons a year. During the next two years, reconnaissance confirmed addition of further stalls. By summer 1944, Briix would have produced 1,250,000 tons of oil a vear. had homhers not rendered it inonerative in
