l offensive.*  When that offensive began, Kent and his team guided bombers to the most important targets by helping the JOTC and later the CSTC Working Committee (Oil) build weekly target lists. Their successes rested on the foundation provided by a mature reconnaissance capability. With abundant photos in hand, ACIU photointerpreters uncovered every oil target in the Reich and occupied Europe. These included two oil fields in the Vienna basin and others in Germany, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. The discovery of the huge plant at Briix and a second large plant at Blechammer also proved vital. Intelligence gave airmen the insights required to destroy Germany’s oil industry. Consequently, the quantity of finished petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) products refined from crude oil decreased from 697,000 tons per month in April 1944 to 33,000 per month in April 1945. The quantity of finished petroleum products from synthetic oil plants decreased from 480,000 tons to 16,000 per month. These figures equaled 4.5 and 3 percent, respectively, of preattack production.2  The reconnaissance effort got into high gear in 1941 with extensive coverage of new synthetic oil plants. The Bergius plant at Leuna first came under a Spitfire’s cameras on 13 July 1941. Photos showed eighteen high-pressure coal-conversion cylinders, each capable of producing 22,000 tons of oil per year, an annual total of 396,000 tons. A follow-up sortie noted a second plant under construction at Leuna, which would nearly double output at the site.2 Another important discovery followed when the first cover of Pélitz arrived on 13 September.2 Pélitz soon became the Reich's leading producer of aviation fuel. Gelsenkirchen was first photographed in December 1940. Photointerpreters estimated its annual output for 1941 and 1942 at 250,000 tons per year and for 1943 at 350,000 tons.12 Reports followed quickly for Magdeburg, Liitzkendorf, and Zeitz, which together produced nearly a million tons of fuel annually.+4
