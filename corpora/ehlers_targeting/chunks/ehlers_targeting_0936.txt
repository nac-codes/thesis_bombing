41 and 1942 at 250,000 tons per year and for 1943 at 350,000 tons.12 Reports followed quickly for Magdeburg, Liitzkendorf, and Zeitz, which together produced nearly a million tons of fuel annually.+4 The discovery of Briix, the Reich’s largest oil plant, followed in May 1942.  Briix was one of those instances in which mundane sources—advertisements for workers in Prague newspapers and petroleum engineers in German engineering journals—tipped off the British. The sortie they sent to investigate discovered the plant. Its fifteen coal-conversion stalls could each produce 50,000 tons of oil annually, a total output of 750,000 tons. Two were complete within two months, providing an initial output of 100,000 tons a year. During the next two years, reconnaissance confirmed addition of further stalls. By summer 1944, Briix would have produced 1,250,000 tons of oil a year, had bombers not rendered it inoperative in spring 1944 and kept production very low and intermittent until VE Day.12  Another report on the Fischer-Tropsch plant at Sterkrade-Holten described the plant’s key features and those of the Fischer-Tropsch process.12 The key difference between Fischer-Tropsch and Bergius plants was the former’s use of hard (black) coal and the latter’s use of soft (brown) coal. The Bergius process was also more efficient and produced higher grades of fuel, including aviation fuel. New Bergius and Fischer-Tropsch plants coming online between 1941 and 1944 represented a major increase in production and promised, along with deliveries from Ploesti, to make the German oil position secure. Had the Germans conquered the Caucasus oil fields, their position would have been strong. Failure to do so, combined with huge fuel demands brought on by a three-front war and severe damage caused by the oil offensive, spelled disaster.  One report, from January 1942, said the Russian campaign had already reduced German oil stocks from 5,000,000 to 3,000,000 barrels, nearly half of which was unusabl
