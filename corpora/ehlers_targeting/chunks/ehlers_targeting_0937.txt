e oil offensive, spelled disaster.  One report, from January 1942, said the Russian campaign had already reduced German oil stocks from 5,000,000 to 3,000,000 barrels, nearly half of which was unusable because it was in pipelines, refining equipment, or supply trains. An increasing use of substitute fuels indicated a worsening oil shortage. The report concluded, “It seems that our general estimates are correct and that the Germans will enter the campaigning season of 1942 with only a fraction of the oil reserves they have previously had, reserves so low in fact that their strategy in 1942 must be conditioned by the need to obtain a further suvvlv of oil.”14 Soviet officers. recognizing the stringencv of Germanv’s oil position. pressed the British to attack oil plants. The secretarv of state for air. Sir Archibald Sinclair. was  Page 248 of 423 59%  16,000 per month. These figures equaled 4.5 and 3 percent, respectively, of preattack production.2  The reconnaissance effort got into high gear in 1941 with extensive coverage of new synthetic oil plants. The Bergius plant at Leuna first came under a Spitfire’s cameras on 13 July 1941. Photos showed eighteen high-pressure coal-conversion cylinders, each capable of producing 22,000 tons of oil per year, an annual total of 396,000 tons. A follow-up sortie noted a second plant under construction at Leuna, which would nearly double output at the site.2 Another important discovery followed when the first cover of Pélitz arrived on 13 September.? Pélitz soon became the Reich’s leading producer of aviation fuel. Gelsenkirchen was first photographed in December 1940. Photointerpreters estimated its annual output for 1941 and 1942 at 250,000 tons per year and for 1943 at 350,000 tons.12 Reports followed quickly for Magdeburg, Liitzkendorf, and Zeitz, which together produced nearly a million tons of fuel annually.4 The discovery of Briix, the Reich’s largest oil plant, followed in May 1942.  Briix was one of those instances in whi
