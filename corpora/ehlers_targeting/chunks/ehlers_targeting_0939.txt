an oil stocks from 5,000,000 to 3,000,000 barrels, nearly half of which was unusable because it was in pipelines, refining equipment, or supply trains. An increasing use of substitute fuels indicated a worsening oil shortage. The report concluded, “It seems that our general estimates are correct and that the Germans will enter the campaigning season of 1942 with only a fraction of the oil reserves they have previously had, reserves so low in fact that their strategy in 1942 must be conditioned by the need to obtain a further supply of oil.” Soviet officers, recognizing the stringency of Germany’s oil position, pressed the British to attack oil plants. The secretary of state for air, Sir Archibald Sinclair, was sufficiently impressed to press Portal, yet again, for an attack on oil.45 Portal fired back, noting MEW believed only a concerted attack on Germany’s synthetic oil plants and the crude oil refineries at Ploesti could achieve decisive effects. Bomber Command could not do this. The matter rested there for the next two years.1&  In July 1942, a committee of twelve oil experts from six civilian companies, the Air Ministry, the ACIU, and MEW arrived at similar conclusions. Denying the production of twelve Bergius plants or the fuel from Ploesti, they said, would cause major problems for Germany’s war effort, while denial of both could be decisive. They estimated Germany and its allies produced about 15,000,000 tons annually of finished POL products, a figure corresponding almost exactly with German and Rumanian records captured in 1944-1945.12  In 1943, however, the picture was less rosy. A JIC report said although Germany’s strategic reserve was largely depleted and its oil position precarious for the moment, by mid-1943, several new oil plants would begin production, resulting in another 1,000,000 tons annually of fuel. Output would increase even further in 1944.48 Despite this concern, a report produced four days later said Allied operations were placing an eno
