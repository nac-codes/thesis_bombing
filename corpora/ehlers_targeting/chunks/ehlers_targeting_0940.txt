, resulting in another 1,000,000 tons annually of fuel. Output would increase even further in 1944.48 Despite this concern, a report produced four days later said Allied operations were placing an enormous strain on the Reich’s oil resources. If they could open new fronts in Italy and France, and bombers could attack Ploesti and German oil plants, the Reich’s position might become bleak. “Stocks of oil in Axis Europe have fallen so low,” it said,  and the stringency of the Axis oil position is such that .. . (a) any action that can be taken by the United Nations which will result in forcing the Axis substantially to increase the consumption of oil during the coming winter may vitally limit Germany’s strategic capabilities; (b) the effect of the removal of even a relatively small source of oil supply has now become out of all proportion to the intrinsic importance of the source itself. Therefore, the destruction of any of the synthetic oil plants may give a valuable dividend; and (c) a crippling blow will be struck at the enemy’s cap- acity to continue the war if and when it becomes possible to interrupt the Roumanian source of supply or the means by which oil supplies from Roumania are transported to Germany.12  There was absolutely no “slack” in Germany’s oil position. A Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) report made Roosevelt and Churchill aware of this: “We have taken note that the Axis oil situation is so restricted that it is decidedly advantageous that bombing attacks on the sources of oil, namely the Rumanian oil fields and oil traffic on the Danube, and the synthetic and producer gas plants in Ger- many, be undertaken as soon as other commitments allow.”22  Additional reports followed, confirming this. A JIC report cautioned that with the 1,000,000 barrels of oil per year previously given to Italy now back in German hands, the Third Reich’s oil production from November 1942 through April 1943 exceeded consumption by 500,000 to 600,000 barrels.2+ However, the bat
