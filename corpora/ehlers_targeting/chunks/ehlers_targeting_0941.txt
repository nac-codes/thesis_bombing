r year previously given to Italy now back in German hands, the Third Reich’s oil production from November 1942 through April 1943 exceeded consumption by 500,000 to 600,000 barrels.2+ However, the battle of Kursk, followed by the Russian offensive, erased these gains and again made Germany’s situation precarious. The Italian campaign and the battle for air supremacy over the Reich also contributed to the gradual depletion of fuel stocks.22  By November 1943, the JIC noted that Germany had failed to bring new oil plants online as quickly as predicted, while Allied offensives had taken a serious toll on fuel reserves. Even more ominous for Germany, Allied air bases in Italy were now in range of Ploesti and other key refineries and oil plants in central and eastern Europe.”# General Spaatz, soon to command the United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF), and his director of intelligence, Brigadier General George McDonald, sensed that when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) had gained air supremacy, oil had to be the key target set. In the plan he submitted for completion of the Combined Bomber Offensive, Spaatz pushed for an all-out attack on oil to undermine German combat power on all fighting fronts.24 So did Air Commodore Sidney Bufton, who argued, “The denial of the bulk of his oil supplies would make it impossible for the enemy to sustain his present scale of military operations on the Russian and Italian fronts and at the same time to deploy his maximum effort for the repulse of ‘ovERLoRD.””22 Bufton also recommended oil attacks as a means for defeating the Luftwaffe “at both ends”—by killing pilots in the air as they defended Germany’s oil installations, and by robbing the Luftwaffe of fuel to train and operate. The first hard blows of this crucial air campaign fell not on Germany, but  Page 248 of 423 59%  ee ee ae es Cee ee ee ee ee ee ee ae oe, a ee eS a SS ee eS ey eee Re ee ee eee ee eee eee ae severe damage caused by the oil offensive, spe
