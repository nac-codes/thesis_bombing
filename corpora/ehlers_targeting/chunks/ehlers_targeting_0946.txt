Therefore, the destruction of any of the synthetic oil plants may give a valuable dividend; and (c) a crippling blow will be struck at the enemy’s cap- acity to continue the war if and when it becomes possible to interrupt the Roumanian source of supply or the means by which oil supplies from Roumania are transported to Germany./2  There was absolutely no “slack” in Germany’s oil position. A Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) report made Roosevelt and Churchill aware of this: “We have taken note that the Axis oil situation is so restricted that it is decidedly advantageous that bombing attacks on the sources of oil, namely the Rumanian oil fields and oil traffic on the Danube, and the synthetic and producer gas plants in Ger- many, be under
