an fronts and at the same time to deploy his maximum effort for the repulse of ‘ovERLoRD.””2* Bufton also recommended oil attacks as a means for defeating the Luftwaffe “at both ends”—by killing pilots in the air as they defended Germany’s oil installations, and by robbing the Luftwaffe of fuel to train and operate. The first hard blows of this crucial air campaign fell not on Germany, but on Rumania.  Opening Rounds: Ploesti  Allied airmen had long wanted to attack Ploesti. Its eleven major crude oil refineries provided Germany with 1.5 million tons of POL products annually—30 percent of its supplies. They comprised the central targets for MAAF bombers.2° The first major effort, a low-level attack by 9th Air Force B-24s, occurred on 1 August 1943. Although the Americans suffered heavy losses, they did severe damage, decreasing annual refining capacity from 9,235,000 to 5,300,000 tons—a 42.5 percent decline.22 Luftwaffe Generalleutnant Alfred Gesternberg, in charge of Ploesti’s air defenses, built a ring pipeline that allowed the Rumanians to move crude oil from damaged to operational refineries, but he could not convince the Rumanians to repair all their refineries.28 Because they had excess refining capacity, the Rumanians viewed this as wasted effort.22 Instead, they wrote off two refineries, reducing their annual capacity to 8,000,000 tons.22 To make matters worse, they did not build protective concrete walls around key equipment and storage tanks. Consequently, the April-August 1944 MAAF campaign against Ploesti had rapid and severe effects.  Increased Rumanian deliveries in November 1943 signaled production was back on track, although it now took nearly all of Rumania’s output to meet Germany’s increasing demands. One key development was the increase of oil shipments on the Danube from 2,260 tons per week in November 1943 to 3,850 in December. This required 9.4 oil trains per day, each with thirty cars holding 13.6 tons of oil per car, unloading at Giurgui.24
