nts on the Danube from 2,260 tons per week in November 1943 to 3,850 in December. This required 9.4 oil trains per day, each with thirty cars holding 13.6 tons of oil per car, unloading at Giurgui.24 These shipments made the bombing of Ploesti urgent. Spaatz and Eaker pushed hard for authority to launch this effort. Yet they did not receive a go-ahead from the CCS to mine the Danube until early April, and it took nearly two months more for permission to attack Ploesti. However, in an act of calculated insubordination, Spaatz and Eaker ordered the first raids on Ploesti in early April. In fact, two weeks before the CCS gave the go-ahead, Eaker told Spaatz, “We mean to finish off this job in the Ploesti area with the first favorable weather.”22  When they had permission to attack targets on the Danube, the MAAF Strategic Targets Committee quickly exploited vulnerabilities in Rumania’s oil-shipping activities, including the rail-to-barge transshipment process and barges, the former with bombing raids and the latter with aerial mining. By late April 1944, mining caused severe difficulties because the Germans and Rumanians lacked equipment to sweep the advanced acoustic mines.#2 Given RAF expertise in aerial mining, 205 Group, the only British heavy-bomber outfit in MAAF, led this effort beginning 8 April 1944. The Danube was vital to the German war economy because it was the primary artery for shipping Rumanian oil and agricultural products. Barges involved in oil transshipment each carried a load equivalent to 110 13.6-ton rail wagons and were thus critical targets. No. 205 Group mined at low level, in moonlight conditions, completing a total of eighteen operations by early October 1944 and laying 1,382 1,000- pound mines. River transport came to a near standstill.24  Page 250 of 423 59%  pipeline that allowed the Rumanians to move crude oil from damaged to operational refineries, but he could not convince the Rumanians to repair all their refineries.28 Because they ha
