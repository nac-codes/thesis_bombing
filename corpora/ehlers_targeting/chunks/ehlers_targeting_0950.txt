250 of 423 59%  pipeline that allowed the Rumanians to move crude oil from damaged to operational refineries, but he could not convince the Rumanians to repair all their refineries.28 Because they had excess refining capacity, the Rumanians viewed this as wasted effort.22 Instead, they wrote off two refineries, reducing their annual capacity to 8,000,000 tons.22 To make matters worse, they did not build protective concrete walls around key equipment and storage tanks. Consequently, the April-August 1944 MAAF campaign against Ploesti had rapid and severe effects.  Increased Rumanian deliveries in November 1943 signaled production was back on track, although it now took nearly all of Rumania’s output to meet Germany’s increasing demands. One key development was the increase of oil shipments on the Danube from 2,260 tons per week in November 1943 to 3,850 in December. This required 9.4 oil trains per day, each with thirty cars holding 13.6 tons of oil per car, unloading at Giurgui.2! These shipments made the bombing of Ploesti urgent. Spaatz and Eaker pushed hard for authority to launch this effort. Yet they did not receive a go-ahead from the CCS to mine the Danube until early April, and it took nearly two months more for permission to attack Ploesti. However, in an act of calculated insubordination, Spaatz and Eaker ordered the first raids on Ploesti in early April. In fact, two weeks before the CCS gave the go-ahead, Eaker told Spaatz, “We mean to finish off this job in the Ploesti area with the first favorable weather.”22  When they had permission to attack targets on the Danube, the MAAF Strategic Targets Committee quickly exploited vulnerabilities in Rumania’s oil-shipping activities, including the rail-to-barge transshipment process and barges, the former with bombing raids and the latter with aerial mining. By late April 1944, mining caused severe difficulties because the Germans and Rumanians lacked equipment to sweep the advanced acoustic mines.#4 Given RAF
