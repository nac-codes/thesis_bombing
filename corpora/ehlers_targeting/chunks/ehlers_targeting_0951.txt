By late April 1944, mining caused severe difficulties because the Germans and Rumanians lacked equipment to sweep the advanced acoustic mines.#4 Given RAF expertise in aerial mining, 205 Group, the only British heavy-bomber outfit in MAAF, led this effort beginning 8 April 1944. The Danube was vital to the German war economy because it was the primary artery for shipping Rumanian oil and agricultural products. Barges involved in oil transshipment each carried a load equivalent to 110 13.6-ton rail wagons and were thus critical targets. No. 205 Group mined at low level, in moonlight conditions, completing a total of eighteen operations by early October 1944 and laying 1,382 1,000- pound mines. River transport came to a near standstill.44  Page 251 of 423 60%  When they had permission to attack targets on the Danube, the MAAF Strategic Targets Committee quickly exploited vulnerabilities in Rumaniaâ€™s oil-shipping activities, including the rail-to-barge transshipment process and barges, the former with bombing raids and the latter with aerial mining.
