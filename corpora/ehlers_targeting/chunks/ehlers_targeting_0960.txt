veral hits on the gas-generating plant and refinery, boiler house, condensing tower, and power plant. Zeitz sustained at least twelve hits on the gas-generating plant, three on the purification and conversion plant, one on the injector house (with another near miss), and several hits on the power plant. Damage to Leuna was good, with large fires visible in the hydrogen contact houses and numerous other buildings throughout the plant. The results at Liitzkendorf were fair, with the Fischer-Tropsch gas-condensation building, the contactoven house, and power plant all hit. On the basis of what photointerpreters knew about synthetic oil plants, the hits scored on these key components ensured that these plants would be out of action for at least four weeks.4+  Four days after this opening round of raids, McDonald contacted Dewdney at Research and Experiments Department Eight (RE8) to request detailed assessments. He sent copies of the memo to 8th Air Force Operational Research Section, Enemy Objectives Unit, and the 19th Photographic Intelligence Detachment at RAF Pinetree, involving specialists at all locations in the production process, which by now was the norm. The 19th Photographic Intelligence Detachment had provided damage assessments for RE8’s detailed studies since late 1942, and analysts there relied in turn on ACIU K and D reports.42  The assessment for Briix, which was based on reconnaissance photos taken an hour and a half and again seventeen days after the raid, showed a loss of seven weeks’ output—about 95,000 tons of synthetic oil. It confirmed direct hits on the gas plant, where one of five generators was destroyed and another two damaged; three hits on the power plant; two on the blower house; two of five gas holders destroyed and two damaged; and severe damage to the distillation unit’s pipe works. Full production could resume in three to four months. The plant was still completely inactive seventeen days after the raid.*2  The attack on Bohlen also ca
