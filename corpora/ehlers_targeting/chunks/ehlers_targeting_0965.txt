A key reason for this success was the superb accuracy resulting from expert Pathfinder Force employment of improved Oboe sets, allowing Pathfinder Mosquitoes to drop flares with great precision. The 286 mainforce Lancasters then dropped 1,500 of 4,637 bombs—over 32 percent—directly on the plant. The 320 massive 4,000-pound Blockbusters caused severe structural damage, smashing buried electrical and water conduits as well as overhead steam pipes and creating a nightmarish situation for repair crews. These British raids put a much greater weight of bombs on target than did 8th Air Force missions because Lancasters carried 14,000 pounds of bombs and B-17s only 6,000 to 9,000 pounds. British bombers also attacked their targets in trail and individually rather than in combat boxes, producing a heavier concentration of hits around the aim point. These advantages, combined with Oboe and increasingly expert crews, translated into greater accuracy, more severe damage, and very little creep-back from the target. This raid showed just how severely Bomber Command “heavies” could damage synthetic oil plants. Gelsenkirchen-Nordstern had produced 400,000 tons of oil per year since March 1941; it produced only trivial amounts after this raid. ++  Page 254 of 423 60%  AllG Lb’ Teports.  The assessment for Briix, which was based on reconnaissance photos taken an hour and a half and again seventeen days after the raid, showed a loss of seven weeks’ output—about 95,000 tons of synthetic oil. It confirmed direct hits on the gas plant, where one of five generators was destroyed and another two damaged; three hits on the power plant; two on the blower house; two of five gas holders destroyed and two damaged; and severe damage to the distillation unit’s pipe works. Full production could resume in three to four months. The plant was still completely inactive seventeen days after the raid.42  The attack on Bohlen also caused severe damage, with a loss of ten weeks’ production—65,000 tons of
