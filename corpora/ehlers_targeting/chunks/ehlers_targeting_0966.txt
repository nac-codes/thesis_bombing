in three to four months. The plant was still completely inactive seventeen days after the raid.42  The attack on Bohlen also caused severe damage, with a loss of ten weeks’ production—65,000 tons of oil. Direct hits on the power plant and local electricity grid also caused a loss of about 45,000 kilowatts to the electric grid. Full preattack production would not resume for three to four months.“*  The plant at Zeitz took the hardest hammering, with “severe general damage” causing a loss of sixteen weeks’ output, or 120,000 tons of oil. The plant would be shut down for ten weeks and working at 80 percent of capacity within five months. During a second attack in late May, “the whole plant was blanketed by a dense concentration of bombs, and damage was done to almost every unit in the plant.” The boiler house and generator hall took two or three hits, putting the plant out of action for at least three months.4*2  Leuna, although less severely damaged, lost six to ten weeks’ synthetic oil production. All seven boiler houses and four of five compressor houses received hits, putting the plant entirely out of action for at least a month and at 50 percent of preattack production for a second month—a loss of about 82,000 tons of oil.4&  After these initial reports, RE8 analysts produced assessments for every raid. The first analyzed the 28 May attack on Ruhland, which suffered a loss of three to four weeks’ output, or 20,000 to 30,000 tons of oil. The plant would be back at 90 percent of preattack production in a month. Nonetheless, this raid alone reduced the plant’s annual output by between 5.7 and 8.6 percent.42  A 28 May raid on Politz caused serious damage, with hits on the injector-circulator house and other key components resulting in a loss of six weeks’ output, or 70,000 tons of oil. As the assessment noted, Pélitz was “extremely flexible and is able to handle a wide variety of feed stocks, including natural petroleum crude.” It also produced 100,000 tons per month
