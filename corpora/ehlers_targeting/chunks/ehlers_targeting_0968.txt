th similar results at Pélitz, represented an impending catastrophe for the Luftwaffe. The report said a resumption of preattack production, if achievable at all, was not likely before December 1945. A key reason for this success was the superb accuracy resulting from expert Pathfinder Force employment of improved Oboe sets, allowing Pathfinder Mosquitoes to drop flares with great precision. The 286 mainforce Lancasters then dropped 1,500 of 4,637 bombs—over 32 percent—directly on the plant. The 320 massive 4,000-pound Blockbusters caused severe structural damage, smashing buried electrical and water conduits as well as overhead steam pipes and creating a nightmarish situation for repair crews. These British raids put a much greater weight of bombs on target than did 8th Air Force missions because Lancasters carried 14,000 pounds of bombs and B-17s only 6,000 to 9,000 pounds. British bombers also attacked their targets in trail and individually rather than in combat boxes, producing a heavier concentration of hits around the aim point. These advantages, combined with Oboe and increasingly expert crews, translated into greater accuracy, more severe damage, and very little creep-back from the target. This raid showed just how severely Bomber Command “heavies” could damage synthetic oil plants. Gelsenkirchen-Nordstern had produced 400,000 tons of oil per year since March 1941; it produced only trivial amounts after this raid. ++  Page 257 of 423 61%  Ree ee eet ee ee eg ty eee ee ee ce eee a TUE eS ON I IEE SRNR SAAR SAR ARE Re SE SEERA.

Direct hits on the power plant and local electricity grid also caused a loss of about 45,000 kilowatts to the electric grid. Full preattack production would not resume for three to four months.*4  The plant at Zeitz took the hardest hammering, with “severe general damage”
