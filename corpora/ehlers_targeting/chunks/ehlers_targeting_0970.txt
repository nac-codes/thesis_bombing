ell as anybody what the oil offensive portended, wrote to the Fiihrer on 30 May. His warning was blunt and urgent: “With the attacks on the hydrogenation plants, systematic raids on economic targets have started at the most dangerous point. The only hope is that the enemy has also got an Air Staff! Only if the latter had as little comprehension of economic targets as the German one would there be some hope that after a few attacks on this decisive economic target it would turn its attentions elsewhere.”42 Speer’s acerbic quip about the air staff aside, he knew oil attacks targeted “the most dangerous point.” On 17 June, he sent a plea to Reichsminister of finance Schwerin von Kroscik, chief of labor Hierl, and Reichsfiihrer Himmler requesting transfer of all electrotechnicians, pipe layers, and welders from the police, labor service, and Frontier Customs Guard to repair oil plants. “The situation,” he said, “is so urgent and serious that, without your help, it will not be possible for me to repair the Hydrogenation Plants, upon whose speedy reopening depends, to a high degree, the continuation of the war.”=2  The most spectacular success in this opening phase of the oil campaign went to Bomber Command, whose 12-13 June attack on the Gelsenkirchen-Nordstern Bergius plant caused severe damage. The estimated production loss was six months’ output totaling 200,000 tons of synthetic oil, including a loss of 1,000 tons (240,000 gallons) of aviation fuel per day for an indefinite period, which, along with similar results at Pélitz, represented an impending catastrophe for the Luftwaffe. The report said a resumption of preattack production, if achievable at all, was not likely before December 1945. A key reason for this success was the superb accuracy resulting from expert Pathfinder Force employment of improved Oboe sets, allowing Pathfinder Mosquitoes to drop flares with great precision. The 286 mainforce Lancasters then dropped 1,500 of 4,637 bombs—over 32 percent—direct
