finder Force employment of improved Oboe sets, allowing Pathfinder Mosquitoes to drop flares with great precision. The 286 mainforce Lancasters then dropped 1,500 of 4,637 bombs—over 32 percent—directly on the plant. The 320 massive 4,000-pound Blockbusters caused severe structural damage, smashing buried electrical and water conduits as well as overhead steam pipes and creating a nightmarish situation for repair crews. These British raids put a much greater weight of bombs on target than did 8th Air Force missions because Lancasters carried 14,000 pounds of bombs and B-17s only 6,000 to 9,000 pounds. British bombers also attacked their targets in trail and individually rather than in combat boxes, producing a heavier concentration of hits around the aim point. These advantages, combined with Oboe and increasingly expert crews, translated into greater accuracy, more severe damage, and very little creep-back from the target. This raid showed just how severely Bomber Command “heavies” could damage synthetic oil plants. Gelsenkirchen-Nordstern had produced 400,000 tons of oil per year since March 1941; it produced only trivial amounts after this raid. ++  Page 257 of 423 61%  smashing buried electrical and water conduits as well as overnead steam pipes and creating a nigntmarisn situation for repair crews. | hese britisn raids put a mucn greater weight of bombs on target than did 8th Air Force missions because Lancasters carried 14,000 pounds of bombs and B-17s only 6,000 to 9,000 pounds.
