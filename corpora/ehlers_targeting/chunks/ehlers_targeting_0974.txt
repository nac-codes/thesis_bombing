into the push against Ploesti. Russian emphasis on oil attacks confirmed their importance and probably gave Spaatz leverage with Eisenhower as he sought approval of a major and sustained oil offensive.*2  During a meeting on 13 May, General Vladimir Grendal, the Red Army’s senior intelligence officer, emphasized that oil was the key target. He said the Germans had enough gasoline to use motor transport for their troops often, “and that the latest information available from POW’s and other sources showed on the whole Soviet front from the Baltic to Roumania there was no shortage whatever of oil.

Subse- quent policing efforts kept it almost entirely out of action. Long since abandoned, the smashed remnants of the plant appeared to postwar ground-survey teams like nothing more than giant spires and sprawling agglomerations of rusted steel. (NARA)  As we have seen with the transportation offensive, Harris deserves much of the credit for these capabilities. He oversaw the development of Pathfinder Force (8 Group) and his elite “precision” unit (5 Group) while championing the development and procurement of technologies required to make these successes possible. Although Harris viewed oil as another “panacea target,” he went after it, for the most part, with energy and a clear sense of duty, and in so doing, he contributed significantly to the offensive’s success.22  Bombing in Support of the Red Army’s Advance  As the oil offensive got into high gear and Harris came onboard, a delegation of American officers visited their Soviet counterpa
