offensive’s success.22  Bombing in Support of the Red Army’s Advance  As the oil offensive got into high gear and Harris came onboard, a delegation of American officers visited their Soviet counterparts from 10 to 15 May to discuss how bombing could best support the Red Army’s advance. The Russians made one insistent request: attack Ploesti. The visit’s timing was significant, coming during the opening effort against synthetic oil plants and just over a month into the push against Ploesti. Russian emphasis on oil attacks confirmed their importance and probably gave Spaatz leverage with Eisenhower as he sought approval of a major and sustained oil offensive.=2  During a meeting on 13 May, General Vladimir Grendal, the Red Army’s senior intelligence officer, emphasized that oil was the key target. He said the Germans had enough gasoline to use motor transport for their troops often, “and that the latest information available from POW’s and other sources showed on the whole Soviet front from the Baltic to Roumania there was no shortage whatever of oil.
