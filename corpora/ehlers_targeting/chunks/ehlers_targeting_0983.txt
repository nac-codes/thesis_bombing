. The Germans moved a large number of flak batteries to oil plants in an effort to protect them. This raid and another on 20 June did severe damage, knocking the plant completely out of action for nearly eleven weeks. (NARA)  62%  P6litz derelict, 2 March 1945.

(NARA)  Raids on Bergius plants, which produced 90 percent of the Luftwaffe’s aviation fuel, degraded air operations immediately. In June, Reichsmarschall Hermann Goring sent a message ordering “extreme measures on economy” for all noncombat flying, including pilot training.© In fact, the Germans had already broken into their strategic aviation fuel reserve.2 On 30 June, Speer told Hitler, “The enemy has thus succeeded in increasing the decline in the production of aviation spirit to 90% on 22nd June. Only by the most rapid restoration of the damaged plants, which started up again long before the dates scheduled, has this catastrophic loss of 22nd June been partially compensated.”®2 He then noted that if heavy attacks continued, aviation fuel stocks would be exhausted by Sep- tember 1944—an accurate appraisal, as events proved.22 This memo and many others corroborated Ultra intercepts and damage assessments as the oil offensive progressed.  By early July, Luftwaffe leaders had minimized aircraft taxiing, discontinued the dispersion of aircraft during air raids, and reduced the duration of test flights. The first two orders presented obvious hazards to aircraft on the ground, while the latter robbed the air arm of its seed corn, as did
