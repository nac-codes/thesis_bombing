Element in an All-Source Effort  By this time, decrypts also painted a grim picture of the effects oil attacks had on ground operations. On 16 August, Generalfeldmarschall von Kluge requested permission to withdraw from the Argentan-Falaise pocket, blaming fuel shortages. Although he no doubt feared Hitler’s wrath, given the latter’s attitude toward retreat, there is no question the Germans had severe fuel shortages by this point. This request followed an 11 August message from Luftgau West France declaring that “in all evacuations fuel stocks, down to the last pint, [must] be taken back” to the Reich in case of a general withdrawal from France. Between the destruction of marshaling yards, fighterbomber attacks on truck convoys, and Special Air Service-Maquis ambushes, very little fuel made it that far.24 In  Page 265 of 423 62%  Politz derelict, 2 March 1945. The Germans had long since given up trying to repair the plant, which by this time was about to fall to the Red Army. (NARA)  Raids on Bergius plants, which produced 90 percent of the Luftwaffe’s aviation fuel, degraded air operations immediately. In June, Reichsmarschall Hermann Goring sent a message ordering “extreme measures on economy” for all noncombat flying, including pilot training. In fact, the Germans had already broken into their strategic aviation fuel reserve.®® On 30 June, Speer told Hitler, “The enemy has thus succeeded in increasing the decline in the production of aviation spirit to 90% on 22nd June. Only by the most rapid restoration of the damaged plants, which started up again long before the dates scheduled, has this catastrophic loss of 22nd June been partially compensated.”®2 He then noted that if heavy attacks continued, aviation fuel stocks would be exhausted by Sep- tember 1944—an accurate appraisal, as events proved.22 This memo and many others corroborated Ultra intercepts and damage assessments as the oil offensive progressed.  By early July, Luftwaffe leaders had minimized aircra
