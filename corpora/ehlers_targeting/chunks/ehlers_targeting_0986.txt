te appraisal, as events proved.22 This memo and many others corroborated Ultra intercepts and damage assessments as the oil offensive progressed.  By early July, Luftwaffe leaders had minimized aircraft taxiing, discontinued the dispersion of aircraft during air raids, and reduced the duration of test flights. The first two orders presented obvious hazards to aircraft on the ground, while the latter robbed the air arm of its seed corn, as did progressively severe restrictions on pilot training. This message was followed by another from Goring that again stressed the need for “drastic economy” in the use of aircraft fuel and ordering a major reduction of transport aviation flights. In early August, Luftflotte 3 sent a message quoting a new Air Ministry order calling for even greater fuel economy. Only fighter air defense activity remained unrestricted. All other flying, including reconnaissance, training, and bomber and ground-attack sor- ties, was cut to the bone. Meteorological flights were discontinued.  Ina 29 July memo to Hitler acquired by Allied interrogators immediately after the war, Speer summed up these calamities. His tone was despondent:  In almost all cases (shortly after they had started work again) the enemy succeeded in destroying the plants with so lasting an effect that in July, instead of the expected increase, a decline in production had to be recorded, although the reconstruction measures had afforded prospects of a considerable increase. ... If... further attacks take place on the hydrogenation plants, and the enemy succeeds in throttling aviation fuel production to the same extent as he has done up to now, then the operations planned by the German Air Force will be completely impossible in Sep- tember or October. ... All I can dois to point out that if the attacks continue, then on the basis of our experience in June and July, the German Air Force can reckon with a new production of not more than a maximum of 10,000 to 20,000 tons of aviation
