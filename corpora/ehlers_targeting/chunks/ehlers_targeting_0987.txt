at if the attacks continue, then on the basis of our experience in June and July, the German Air Force can reckon with a new production of not more than a maximum of 10,000 to 20,000 tons of aviation fuel in August and September.  Ultra: A Vital Element in an All-Source Effort  By this time, decrypts also painted a grim picture of the effects oil attacks had on ground operations. On 16 August, Generalfeldmarschall von Kluge requested permission to withdraw from the Argentan-Falaise pocket, blaming fuel shortages. Although he no doubt feared Hitler’s wrath, given the latter’s attitude toward retreat, there is no question the Germans had severe fuel shortages by this point. This request followed an 11 August message from Luftgau West France declaring that “in all evacuations fuel stocks, down to the last pint, [must] be taken back” to the Reich in case of a general withdrawal from France. Between the destruction of marshaling yards, fighterbomber attacks on truck convoys, and Special Air Service-Maquis ambushes, very little fuel made it that far4 In a 30 August memo to Hitler, Speer said, “The basis for army movements at the Front is getting so slight that planned operations can no longer take place in October. In the present fuel situation, it is no longer possible to gain offensive successes, as the fuel quantities required for the supplies necessary for an offensive are no longer available.”  Intercepts of messages dealing with damage to oil targets were also valuable. A 16 July message from Generalleutnant Gesternberg, in charge of Ploesti’s air defenses, to military staffs and ministries in Berlin noted the effects of a 15 July attack on Ploesti, providing details on damage to specific components of various refineries, likely loss of production, and approximate time required for repairs. A similar report of 22 July said, “Hydrogenation works Maltheuren near Brueck [Briix]: damage to distillery, oxygen plant and among the tanks.”2£ Such messages corroborated damag
