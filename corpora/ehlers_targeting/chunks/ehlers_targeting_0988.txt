required for repairs. A similar report of 22 July said, “Hydrogenation works Maltheuren near Brueck [Briix]: damage to distillery, oxygen plant and among the tanks.”2£ Such messages corroborated damage assessments or, in cases where the two varied, provided “ground truth.”  Despite these and many other crucial intercepts, Ultra was not unerringly accurate or comprehensive. Many German industrial concerns communicated by other means, especially secure landline communications, while oil and transportation officials turned to Ultra heavily only after the damage caused by these massive air offensives robbed them of these other means of communication. Lieutenant Colonel William Haines, the foremost American authority on Ultra on the basis of his direct access during the war and his interaction with the most senior Allied leaders, said that with the exception of oil, “the best of our damage assessments came from other sources.”2“ This had much to do with the scarcity of intercepts relating to industrial and certain key military concerns (unless one of the military services was discussing it) up to 1944. For instance, Lieutenant Colonel Lewis Powell, Spaatz’s Ultra expert at USSTAF, said Ultra intercepts on the V-1 and V-2 were uncommon, forcing air intelligence personnel to rely on the resistance and other sources. This is why reconnaissance, photointerpreters, and the thousands of intelligence products relying on them proved so important in corroborating both one another and Ultra sources. The laborious process of building complete photographic coverage, producing target folders (all of which were largely done before the oil and transportation offensives began), and writing damage assessments would have been impossible without aerial photographs, photointerpreters, and other air intelligence specialists. Of course, for the oil offensive and, to a lesser degree, the transportation offensives, when German officials began sending huge numbers of Ultra messages, Ultra provid
