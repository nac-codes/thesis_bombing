air intelligence specialists. Of course, for the oil offensive and, to a lesser degree, the transportation offensives, when German officials began sending huge numbers of Ultra messages, Ultra provided the ultimate form of corroboration and, in most cases, ground truth.  Powell’s insights about the role of Ultra are also highly significant, indicating both its centrality and, paradoxically, the ability to plan and execute bombing operations without it:  Certainly no other form of intelligence was as dramatic as ULTRA in terms of shaping strategy, resulting in saving tens of thousands of lives. I think, even if there had been no ULTRA, that with aerial reconnaissance, primarily, plus the work of scholars and economists, we should have identified target systems in Germany. It may have taken us longer—but in the end we would have des-  i i. ee _-----79  Page 265 of 423 62%  production had to be recorded, although the reconstruction measures had afforded prospects of a considerable increase. ... If... further attacks take place on the hydrogenation plants, and the enemy succeeds in throttling aviation fuel production to the same extent as he has done up to now, then the operations planned by the German Air Force will be completely impossible in Sep- tember or October. ... All I can do is to point out that if the attacks continue, then on the basis of our experience in June and July, the German Air Force can reckon with a new production of not more than a maximum of 10,000 to 20,000 tons of aviation fuel in August and September.2  Ultra: A Vital Element in an All-Source Effort  By this time, decrypts also painted a grim picture of the effects oil attacks had on ground operations. On 16 August, Generalfeldmarschall von Kluge requested permission to withdraw from the Argentan-Falaise pocket, blaming fuel shortages. Although he no doubt feared Hitler’s wrath, given the latter’s attitude toward retreat, there is no question the Germans had severe fuel shortages by this poin
