, while oil and transportation officials turned to Ultra heavily only after the damage caused by these massive air offensives robbed them of these other means of communication. Lieutenant Colonel William Haines, the foremost American authority on Ultra on the basis of his direct access during the war and his interaction with the most senior Allied leaders, said that with the exception of oil, “the best of our damage assessments came from other sources.” This had much to do with the scarcity of intercepts relating to industrial and certain key military concerns (unless one of the military services was discussing it) up to 1944. For instance, Lieutenant Colonel Lewis Powell, Spaatz’s Ultra expert at USSTAF, said Ultra intercepts on the V-1 and V-2 were uncommon, forcing air intelligence personnel to rely on the resistance and other sources.?8 This is why reconnaissance, photointerpreters, and the thousands of intelligence products relying on them proved so important in corroborating both one another and Ultra sources. The laborious process of building complete photographic coverage, producing target folders (all of which were largely done before the oil and transportation offensives began), and writing damage assessments would have been impossible without aerial photographs, photointerpreters, and other air intelligence specialists. Of course, for the oil offensive and, to a lesser degree, the transportation offensives, when German officials began sending huge numbers of Ultra messages, Ultra provided the ultimate form of corroboration and, in most cases, ground truth.  Powell’s insights about the role of Ultra are also highly significant, indicating both its centrality and, paradoxically, the ability to plan and execute bombing operations without it:  Certainly no other form of intelligence was as dramatic as ULTRA in terms of shaping strategy, resulting in saving tens of thousands of lives. I think, even if there had been no ULTRA, that with aerial reconnaissance, p
