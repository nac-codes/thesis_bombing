The attaché further noted that if attacks continued, oil stocks would be depleted by mid-February.*4 A month later, he said that the Germans were beginning to run out of fuel.2=  Postwar interrogations of German leaders further corroborated damage reports and Ultra decrypts. One such interrogation confirmed that monthly receipts of aviation fuel fell from 150,000 tons in May 1944 to 52,000 in June and 7,000 tons in September. A slight recovery, to 18,700 tons in October and 39,200 in November, did not allow anything even remotely approaching full employment of available aircraft. Fuel was in even shorter supply than pilots. Aviation fuel reserves also plummeted, with Oberkommando der Wehrmacht stocks falling from 107,000 tons to 30,000 by November. Pilot-training flights were cut in half, and most bomber units were disbanded and their crews assigned to the infantry. The Fiihrer’s 207,000-ton reserve was already exhausted. Ultra intercepts and Nazi leaders thus agreed that the Wehrmacht began feeling the full severity of fuel shortages in August 1944.26  This catastrophic fuel shortage developed not just as a result of heavybomber attacks on marshaling yards, synthetic oil plants, and refineries, but also because the Allies targeted every element of the Reich's fuel production and distribution infrastructure. From 1 June to 31 July, aircraft made 139 depot attacks in France, including a devastating attack on the huge fuel depot at Gennevilliers on 22 June. This raid was the first of many to inflict severe damage on depots in France and western Germany, speeding the exhaustion of fuel reserves, which were largely used up or destroyed by August and could not be replaced because fuel output had nosedived. Gennevilliers supplied 750 tons of gasoline a day before the raid and none afterward. Of the depot’s 125 storage tanks, bombers destroyed 60. AUSSTAF ground-survey team discovered that most of these tanks had contained gasoline. The Standard Oil plant adjoining the de
