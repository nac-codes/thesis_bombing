estruction of distribution facilities shut down operations. Denial of fuel was just as important as its destruction. A CSTC survey team said, “The amounts of fuel destroyed, or denied to the Germans through the destruction of depot facilities, far exceeded our expectations.” Also, because synthetic oil plants and crude oil refineries had been sending fuel, fuel components, and lubricating oils directly to depots to minimize the chances they would be destroyed by air raids, depots in fact completed the final steps in the production process, including bulk breaking and blending.™ Air intelligence officers missed these crucial facts.

One of the most important lessons from Montbartier was the discovery that 1,000-pound bombs could rupture underground storage tanks, something previously thought impossible. By October 1944, intelligence personnel understood depots well enough to recommend fighter-bombers and medium bombers attack them to destroy tank wagons, depot loading facilities, and sidings, while heavy bombers attack underground storage tanks with 1,000-pound bombs. This division of labor proved effective.2+  Analyzing and Exploiting the German Fuel-Distribution Process  These attacks also profited from an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the German fuel-distribution system, allowing analysts to locate each depot, assign it a target priority, and lay on attacks by 8th Air Force heavies or 9th Air Force medium bombers. The process of locating depots and piecing together the administrative structure within which they operated was complete by 194
