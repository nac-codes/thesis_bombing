oil production could not be shipped, the Rumanians shut down two- thirds of oil field production while awaiting repairs. The report closed with guidance for MAAF to keep pumping stations and loading terminals out of action, continue mining the Danube, and carry out attacks on the tugboat fleet. To hamper rail shipments, MAAF bombers continued attacking marshaling yards and interdicting bridges between Ploesti and the Eastern Front.22  By the end of July, production of finished POL products had dropped from 1,360,000 tons in March 1944 (the preattack total) to 673,500 tons (49.5 percent of preattack total). Shipments from Ploesti had nearly ceased as a result of mining of the Danube and attacks on Ploesti’s marshaling yards and bridges between there and the east. Continuing raids on Ploesti had nearly brought fuel production toa standstill. Less heartening, however, was the faster-than-expected repair of German oil plants.42  By the middle of August, these efforts put Leuna, Zeitz, and Bohlen back in production. Output was also about to resume at Magdeburg, Scholven, Gelsenkirchen-Nordstern, Pélitz, and Wesseling. All Fischer-Tropsch plants, with the exception of Homberg, were back in full or partial production. The bulletin concluded with a clear warning: “A strong resurgence of activity in oil production in Germany is therefore imminent.”+54 Consequently, the JOTC sent out a new target list with eighty-nine oil facilities, including sixteen depots, calling for attacks on all plants about to come back online and a con- tinuation of raids on Ploesti1%  Airmen were also heartened by a JIC report emphasizing the increasingly severe curtailment of Luftwaffe operations and saying, “the operational efficiency of the German army, notably in the West, is being drastically affected by lack of fuel which has been a major factor in the present battle.”1°3 They also noted a statement by the Chiefs of Staff that  further reduction in the enemy’s oil supplies may be expected to
