50 on Scholven. The larger number of Gee and Oboe stations now on the Continent facilitated this accurate bombing. These attacks heralded the end of Ruhr oil production. Indeed, subsequent Bomber Command attacks made in daylight with fighter escort, and in conjunction with 8th Air Force raids, knocked out all ten major synthetic oil plants and crude oil refineries in the Ruhr by the end of September. From there, periodic policing occurred as a plant showed signs of resuming production.28  As these attacks developed, the JOTC’s second weekly report noted the Bergius plants at Zeitz, Gelsenkirchen-Nordstern, Bohlen, and Pélitz were out of action until August. A report from a human intelligence source, corroborated by reconnaissance, confirmed serious damage to Ploesti’s marshaling yards had reduced considerably the movement of fuel from there to Germany and the Eastern Front. Damage to pumping stations also prevented the shipment of oil up the Danube. Consequently, because surplus fuel and oil production could not be shipped, the Rumanians shut down two- thirds of oil field production while awaiting repairs. The report closed with guidance for MAAF to keep pumping stations and loading terminals out of action, continue mining the Danube, and carry out attacks on the tugboat fleet. To hamper rail shipments, MAAF bombers continued attacking marshaling yards and interdicting bridges between Ploesti and the Eastern Front.22  By the end of July, production of finished POL products had dropped from 1,360,000 tons in March 1944 (the preattack total) to 673,500 tons (49.5 percent of preattack total). Shipments from Ploesti had nearly ceased as a result of mining of the Danube and attacks on Ploesti’s marshaling yards and bridges between there and the east. Continuing raids on Ploesti had nearly brought fuel production to a standstill. Less heartening, however, was the faster-than-expected repair of German oil plants.42  By the middle of August, these efforts put Leuna, Zeitz,
