sti had nearly brought fuel production to a standstill. Less heartening, however, was the faster-than-expected repair of German oil plants.42  By the middle of August, these efforts put Leuna, Zeitz, and Bohlen back in production. Output was also about to resume at Magdeburg, Scholven, Gelsenkirchen-Nordstern, Pélitz, and Wesseling. All Fischer-Tropsch plants, with the exception of Homberg, were back in full or partial production. The bulletin concluded with a clear warning: “A strong resurgence of activity in oil production in Germany is therefore imminent.”42 Consequently, the JOTC sent out a new target list with eighty-nine oil facilities, including sixteen depots, calling for attacks on all plants about to come back online and a con- tinuation of raids on Ploesti.1®  Airmen were also heartened by a JIC report emphasizing the increasingly severe curtailment of Luftwaffe operations and saying, “the operational efficiency of the German army, notably in the West, is being drastically affected by lack of fuel which has been a major factor in the present battle.”1®3 They also noted a statement by the Chiefs of Staff that  further reduction in the enemy’s oil supplies may be expected to precipitate large scale catastrophes on both the Western and Eastern Fronts, by drastically impairing the mobility of his Army and Air Force formations. Specific recommendations: Attack of remaining Bomber Command oil targets in the Ruhr should always have priority over city targets. Conduct large-scale heavy bomber raids against all major tactical and strategic German oil depots. It is therefore recommended that when this Paper is forwarded by the Chiefs of Staff to the Supreme Commander, the lat- ter’s attention should be drawn to the importance of intensifying our attacks upon oil targets.1%  The next JOTC bulletin warned that summer weather was ending, making an all-out effort imperative. The goal was to put the twenty-five largest oil plants and refineries out of action for at leas
