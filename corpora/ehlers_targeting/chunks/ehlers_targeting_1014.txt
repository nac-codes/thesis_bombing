there was widespread evidence the Germans were using gasoline blended with benzol. Of twenty major benzol plants collectively producing 35,000 tons per month, sixteen were in the Ruhr and highly vulnerable to Bomber Command precision raids. Benzol raised the octane level of gasoline, allowing further blending with alcohol. This three-substance blending had become the norm at German depots. Benzol plants thus came under immediate attack.1%  As oil attacks reached new levels of intensity, the Allied Expeditionary Air Force was deactivated on 15 September. Control of heavy bombers reverted from Eisenhower to Portal and Arnold, who delegated executive authority to Air Marshal Norman Bottomley, the RAF’s deputy chief of air staff, and Spaatz. The Tactical Air Forces, although not subject to this realignment, continued making major contributions to the oil offensive with attacks on smaller refineries, benzol plants, and depots. The Combined Bomber Offensive mission statement now read: “The overall mission of the Strategic Air Forces is the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic systems and the direct support of land and naval forces.” Any reference to morale was gone. The CCS also said heavy bombers were to support the Red Army’s advance whenever possible.128 The follow-on directive, from Bottomley and Spaatz, gave German oil and transportation assets high-  Page 271 of 423 64%  es months. This meant attacking large plants that were currently i inactive to ensure major effects rather than going after smaller but active producers. “Successful attack of these 25 targets before the end of August or early in September,” the bulletin concluded, “would result in the reduction of oil production in September to less than 500,000 tons or about 35% of pre-attack production.”12  Heavy attacks during the first week of August, coupled with Rumania’s defection to the Allies, proved disastrous for German forces.
