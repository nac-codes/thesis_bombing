The importance Speer and Hitler attached to Geilenberg’s mission became clear in the Fiihrer’s proclamation of 30 May 1944, making Geilenberg “Plenipotentiary General for Immediate Action” to repair oil plants and giving him authority to take all necessary measures, including curtailing other industries.142 After the war, Speer revealed that Geilenberg’s efforts usually allowed the resumption of small-scale production at oil plants, amounting to ten to fourteen days’ normal production, before the next round of raids. Intelligence analysts missed this.442  The CSTC: Refining Targeting and Damage Assessment  Bottomley and Spaatz were concerned about a resurgence of production, but they had the advantage of knowing where the Reich’s oil position stood from week to week and expert advisory bodies to help them make the right targeting decisions. In fact, they were also determining how best to bring together intelligence for all high-value targets under a single advisory body, deciding to combine the functions of the Railway Targets Committee, the JOTC, and the Jockey Committee (formed in 1943 to make targeting recommendations for the attack on the Luftwaffe).
