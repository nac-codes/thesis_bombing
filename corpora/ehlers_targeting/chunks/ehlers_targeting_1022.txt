It also issued weekly prioritized target lists, drafted and discussed in the working committees on oil, transportation, and the Luftwaffe, for Spaatz and Bottomley’s approval.42  Bad Weather and Bomber Diversions  Bufton and Maxwell were tireless advocates for oil, and their energy paid dividends, particularly as summer turned to fall and opportunities for visual bombing decreased. The CSTC’s first weekly bulletin, which picked up where JOTC bulletins ended, was sobering. The only oil attacks during the previous week had been by MAAF bombers; bad weather had kept 8th Air Force and Bomber Command grounded. Quantity and quality of postraid reconnaissance photos were poor owing to bad weather, meaning there were eight synthetic oil plants whose operational status was in doubt as a result of the absence of damage assessments. These problems pointed to a major resurgence in oil production, from 319,600 (23.5 percent of preattack capacity) in September to an estimated 503,000  Page 271 of 423 64%  ne attack these measures will almost double output in October raising it to 42% of pr pre attack.”241 By this time, Speer had put Edmund Geilenberg in charge of repairs and given him 300,000 laborers. The importance Speer and Hitler attached to Geilenberg’s mission became clear in the Fiihrer’s proclamation of 30 May 1944, making Geilenberg “Plenipotentiary General for Immediate Action” to repair oil plants and giving him authority to take all necessary measures, including curtailing other industries.14 After the war, Speer revealed that Geilenberg’s efforts usually allowed the resumption of small-scale production at oil plants, amounting to ten to fourteen days’ normal production, before the next round of raids. Intelligence analysts missed this.  Oe inn a a  The CSTC: Refining Targeting and Damage Assessment  Bottomley and Spaatz were concerned about a resurgence of production, but they had the
