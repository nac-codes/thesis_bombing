Experts from the Office of the Petroleum Attaché at the American embassy, the Americans’ Enemy Oil Committee, and the British Ministry of Fuel and Power provided insights, while Flight Lieutenant Kent of ACIU D Section and representatives from the Joint Photo Reconnaissance Center often attended to provide damage assessments.16 The CSTC advised Bottom- ley and Spaatz by recommending target priorities and putting forward SHAEF proposals for the employment of heavy bombers in direct support of ground forces. It also issued weekly prioritized target lists, drafted and discussed in the working committees on oil, transportation, and the Luftwaffe, for Spaatz and Bottomley’s approval 2  Bad Weather and Bomber Diversions  Bufton and Maxwell were tireless advocates for oil, and their energy paid dividends, particularly as summer turned to fall and opportunities for visual bombing decreased.

The only oil attacks during the previous week had been by MAAF bombers; bad weather had kept 8th Air Force and Bomber Command grounded. Quantity and quality of postraid reconnaissance photos were poor owing to bad weather, meaning there were eight synthetic oil plants whose operational status was in doubt as a result of the absen
