jor diversion of heavy-bomber effort to transportation targets. These assertions related to Eisenhower’s request for a plan to attack the Rhine-Ruhr transportation network, almost certainly at Tedder’s request, in an effort to break through and force a German surrender by the end of 1944. The CSTC concluded that if the Allies had any hope of helping achieve this objective, continued oil attacks offered the only chance.424 When Bottomley and Spaatz added their weight, Eisenhower relented, although a smaller version of the Rhine-Ruhr transportation campaign proceeded. Bufton and Maxwell also forestalled a second effort in November to divert bombers from oil targets, noting, “From the strategic aspect the greatest contribution which the strategic bomber forces can make to the defeat of the German armies in the west is by maintaining pressure on the enemy’s sources of oil supply. It should be noted that the contribution which can be made in this respect extends automatically to the Armies on the Russian and Ital- ian fronts.”222  In fact, Spaatz told Arnold in early November that Eisenhower supported a continued emphasis on oil followed by transportation attacks on marshaling yards and bridges in the Rhine-Ruhr region. Spaatz and Bottomley issued a new bombing directive reconfirming these priorities. It emphasized the coordination of “tactical” and “strategic” aircraft in oil and transportation attacks, and in their  contribution to the advance of Allied armies.122 Spaatz closed by saying:  All evidence we have obtained indicates that our attacks during the past two months have been most effective in achieving their end, i.e. (1) reducing mobility of the German Army; (2) major  curtailment in Luftwaffe operations; (3) denying much needed tanks and other vehicles to equip the new German divisions being formed; (4) achieving considerable disruption of the lines of communications in Western Germany. General Eisenhower strongly supports this modified policy.124  Increasing
