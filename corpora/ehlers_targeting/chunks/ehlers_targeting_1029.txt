General Eisenhower strongly supports this modified policy.124  Increasing German Operational Calamities  Aside from the central role of fuel shortages in the German collapse in France, Ultra decrypts made it equally clear that fuel shortages were now having a major impact on German operations on all fronts, including the east. In early September, a message from Jagdkorps II in France said all single-engine fighters were grounded as the Germans scrambled to find enough fuel to fly these aircraft out of France during the retreat.122 On the South Russian Front, Luftflotte 4 reported serious fuel shortages and ordered Fliegerkorps I to operate with minimum required forces—not a good development, given the desperate need of retreating army units for air support.12° On 13 October, Luftgau VII in Germany said the strictest fuel economy measures were necessary because no more fuel would be available until the end of November.122 A few days later, the Air Ministry’s technical branch said all aircraft were out of fuel. The Luftwaffe’s flight-testing program came to a screeching halt.128  Even more worrisome for the Germans was a 25 October order from the commander in chief west (von Rundstedt) requiring the most stringent measures to reduce motor transport, urging the use of horse-drawn wagons and producer-gas vehicles. Even heavy units, whose mobility was vital to their combat effectiveness, were demotorized and remained so, with the partial exception of the Ardennes offensive, for the rest of the war. In fact, only 300 tons of motor fuel was issued during the next ten days, one-sixth the normal allowance. This meant each division in the west’s two army groups received about 5 tons (1,200 gallons) per day instead of the standard 30 tons (7,200 gallons).122 These paltry allotments were adequate only to maintain a static front.  At the end of October, G
