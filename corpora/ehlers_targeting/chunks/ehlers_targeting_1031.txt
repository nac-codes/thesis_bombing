ntend with adverse weather and the addition of benzol plants to the target list. At the first CSTC meeting, Mr. Lawrence of MEW introduced the Working Committee (Oil) report, noting the Ruhr’s synthetic oil and benzol plants accounted for 43 percent of Germany’s synthetic oil production and 67 percent of its benzol. They required immediate attack because re- connaissance cover just obtained on a rare sunny day showed many tank cars in the sidings at these plants. Major Beeson of SHAEF also emphasized the importance of continuing attacks on depots.422  Bufton also said the CSTC had to show airmen and Eisenhower two things: the effects of continued oil attacks and effects on the ground advance of any major diversion of heavy-bomber effort to transportation targets. These assertions related to Eisenhower’s request for a plan to attack the Rhine-Ruhr transportation network, almost certainly at Tedder’s request, in an effort to break through and force a German surrender by the end of 1944. The CSTC concluded that if the Allies had any hope of helping achieve this objective, continued oil attacks offered the only chance.124 When Bottomley and Spaatz added their weight, Eisenhower relented, although a smaller version of the Rhine-Ruhr transportation campaign proceeded. Bufton and Maxwell also forestalled a second effort in November to divert bombers from oil targets, noting, “From the strategic aspect the greatest contribution which the strategic bomber forces can make to the defeat of the German armies in the west is by maintaining pressure on the enemy’s sources of oil supply. It should be noted that the contribution which can be made in this respect extends automatically to the Armies on the Russian and Ital- ian fronts.”222  In fact, Spaatz told Arnold in early November that Eisenhower supported a continued emphasis on oil followed by transportation attacks on marshaling yards and bridges in the Rhine-Ruhr region. Spaatz and Bottomley issued a new bombing directive rec
