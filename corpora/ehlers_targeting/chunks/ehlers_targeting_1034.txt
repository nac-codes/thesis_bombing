With winter on the way and the large Bergius plants in eastern Germany and southwestern Poland coming back online, Bufton and Maxwell recognized that only Bomber Command could inflict the damage required to keep them out of action. The short winter days made it impossible for USAAF bombers to make daylight attacks. The key was convincing Harris to expand his command’s policing of Ruhr oil targets by adding night precision attacks against distant Bergius plants. On 3 November, the CSTC said that “RAF Bomber Command should give special consideration” to raiding such plants, including Leuna and Pélitz.122 They continued:  If enemy plants had been successfully re-attacked whenever opportunity occurred, even though still inactive, the enemy would not have been able to achieve the increase of oil production from 23.5% of his pre attack output in September to 32% in October. Over the winter months a further recovery in German oil production can only be averted by seizing the few expected opportun- ities of effecting long term damage to the major productive plants even though these plants may not have resumed production by time of attack. The aim should now be to complete the destruc- tion of all major producers.134  Page 277 of 423 65%  A - Bottomley and Spaatz added their weight, Eisenhower relented, although a smaller version of the Rhine-Ruhr transportation campaign proceeded. Bufton and Maxwell also forestalled a second effort in November to divert bombers from oil targets, noting, “From the strategic aspect the greatest contribution which the strategic bomber forces can make to the defeat of the German armies in the west is by maintaining pressure on the enemy’s sources of oil supply. It should be noted that the contribution which can be made in this respect extends automatically to the Armies on the Russian and Ital- ian fronts,”222  In fact, Spaatz told Arnold in early November that Eisenhower supported a continued emphasis on oil followed by transportation attacks
