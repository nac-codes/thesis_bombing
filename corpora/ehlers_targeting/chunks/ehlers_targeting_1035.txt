Spaatz and Bottomley issued a new bombing directive reconfirming these priorities. It emphasized the coordination of “tactical” and “strategic” aircraft in oil and transportation attacks, and in their contribution to the advance of Allied armies.122 Spaatz closed by saying:  ee eee Se ee eee  All evidence we have obtained indicates that our attacks during the past two months have been most effective in achieving their end, i.e. (1) reducing mobility of the German Army; (2) major curtailment in Luftwaffe operations; (3) denying much needed tanks and other vehicles to equip the new German divisions being formed; (4) achieving considerable disruption of the lines of communications in Western Germany. General Eisenhower strongly supports this modified policy.124  Increasing German Operational Calamities  Aside from the central role of fuel shortages in the German collapse in France, Ultra decrypts made it equally clear that fuel shortages were now having a major impact on German operations on all fronts, including the east. In early September, a message from Jagdkorps II in France said all single-engine fighters were grounded as the Germans scrambled to find enough fuel to fly these aircraft out of France during the retreat.422 On the South Russian Front, Luftflotte 4 reported serious fuel shortages and ordered Fliegerkorps I to operate with minimum required forces—not a good development, given the desperate need of retreating army units for air support.12° On 13 October, Luftgau VII in Germany said the strictest fuel economy measures were necessary because no more fuel would be available until the end of November.122 A few days later, the Air Ministry’s technical branch said all aircraft were out of fuel.
