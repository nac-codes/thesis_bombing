could arrive at such a conclusion while surrounded by hundreds of intelligence reports to the contrary is perplexing. One unknown is the degree to which Harris’s late inclusion on the Ultra receipt list—7 June 1944 by some accounts, 16 August 1944 according to others—may have influenced his understanding of the sound intelligence analyses underlying the transportation and oil plans in their early phases. But this does not excuse him entirely. Given Harris’s innate skepticism about both intelligence and panacea targets, access to Ultra may not have made a notable difference. Nonetheless, limited use of Ultra in Bomber Command (as opposed to USSTAF, where it often drove operations) and Harris’s evident ignorance of most Ultra intercepts are issues of serious concern that implicate him, his intelligence directorate, and Portal for failing to give Harris access early enough, allowing him to ignore Ultra evidence, or both.126  The key problem with the bombing offensive, Harris complained, “is the number of cooks now engaged in stirring the broth. During the last few weeks every panacea monger and ‘me too expert’ to many of whom we had already (we hoped) given the quietus in the past, has raised his head again.”22 And so Harris, while sending his aircrews forth in admirable attacks on oil and transportation targets, kept going after cities as often as possible. Portal, responding on 5 November to a memo from Harris giving him eight reasons why bombing Cologne and Bochum was preferable to going after oil targets, noted acerbically: “All I needed was one good reason, and I confess that when I get eight reasons I begin to wonder whether all of them are equally good!” He continued:  I would... say, at the risk of your dubbing me “another panacea merchant,” that I believe the air offensive against oil gives us by far the best hope of complete victory in the next few months. It will be a terrific battle between destruction and repair and we cannot afford to give a single point
