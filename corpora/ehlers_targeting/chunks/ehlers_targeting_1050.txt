to go on flogging them even while they are temporarily dead horses until they are utterly destroyed, that puts a different complexion on the matter and opens up a vista of additional losses and loss of effort in every direction which I seriously doubt whether we can stand in the light of the reductions now taking place in the training output on the one hand, and the tremendous calls for increased bombing effort on the other.1#*  He therefore rejected Portal’s suggestion that he misunderstood the importance of oil attacks. His staff, Harris pointed out, had standing orders that any Ruhr oil plants showing signs of resuming operation were to be immediately brought to his notice. Finally, he sought clarification. Was he to obliterate oil targets or simply keep them out of action?  Portal asked Bufton to review Harris’s letter and let him know what he thought. Bufton’s first criticism was Harris’s statement that he aimed to achieve “the best overall effect out of available sorties,” when in Bufton’s opinion his aim should have been to “get the best effect on oil.”146 Bufton did admit that nonoil targets might at times offer better prospects for success, but he considered it vital to give oil first priority. As for intelligence, Bufton said the organizations involved (which he knew well, given his cochairmanship of the CSTC) made it as accurate as possible. Bufton also rejected Harris’s suggestion that there were more oil attacks than necessary. “In my opinion,” he said, “our attacks at present are less frequent than necessary to fulfil the required purpose.”1“2 He also contradicted Harris's claim that photographs of Gelsenkirchen, taken 28 October, showed no signs of activity. On the contrary, “Assessment of cover taken on 28th October showed resumption of production to be imminent.”148 Finally, Bufton said even though the directive did indeed say bombing was simply to keep the oil plants shut down, bad fall weather was making it difficult to verify from aerial photogr
