imminent.”148 Finally, Bufton said even though the directive did indeed say bombing was simply to keep the oil plants shut down, bad fall weather was making it difficult to verify from aerial photographs when plants were coming back online. The only option, in his opinion, was stepping up bombing intensity to delay resumption of POL production. The Joint Intelligence Subcommittee responsible for oil agreed.+42 Consequently, Bufton said, “We should aim at complete destruction with the hope of preventing production for two to three months.”  With these ideas in hand, Portal replied on 11 November, emphasizing eastern Bergius plants and the USAAF’s inability to bomb them during the short winter days. “That is why,” he said, “you are asked to aim at the complete destruction of the plants.”1*1 Bottomley also sent Harris a memo reiterating that the USAAF could not deliver the required weight of attack. Only Bomber Command could. Thus, he said,  no opportunity of attacking oil plants must be lost. ... The weight and density of attack of which your Command has shown itself capable, given adequate marking, far exceeds that normally achieved by the U.S. Air Forces. It is considered that one successful large scale concentrated attack by Bomber Command on an oil target should, on the basis of past experience, result in the long term immobilization of activity which is now required.152  “Now,” Portal continued, “is the time to strike at oil facilities in the Ruhr, before the enemy can resolve his early warning difficulties. It will be time enough to change when heavy casualties do in fact materialise. We should if we can secure the maximum impact on the Ruhr itself, and the quickest direct and indirect effect upon the Ruhr oil.”152 He also protested the final paragraph of Harris’s letter, in which the latter blamed MEW—the ultimate panacea-monger agency in Harris’s view—for foisting another useless target set on his command. MEW’s warning in a recent assessment that “nothing le
