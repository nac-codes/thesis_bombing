letter, in which the latter blamed MEW—the ultimate panacea-monger agency in Harris’s view—for foisting another useless target set on his command. MEW’s warning in a recent assessment that “nothing less than the maximum possible effort of the Allied bomber forces is likely to prove adequate to the task in the difficult conditions of winter” was the kind of statement Harris absolutely despised.  In fact, Harris had argued that MEW  always overstated their case, and no sooner have the identified targets been attacked than more and more sources of supply or other factors unpredicted by MEW have become revealed. The oil plan has already displayed similar symptoms. The benzol plants were an afterthought. I am quite certain that there are dozens more benzol plants of which we are unaware and when and if we knock them all out I am equally certain we shall eventually be told by MEW that German M.T. [motor transport] is continuing to run sufficiently for their purpose on producer gas, steam, indus- trial alcohol, etc., etc. However we should be content if we can deprive them of adequate supplies of aviation fuel. That in itself will take enough doing =  There was little truth in what Harris said. Intelligence specialists had long since located virtually every benzol target in Germany. However, benzol was a lower-priority target waiting its turn until the large plants were out of action. Considering the tone of Harris’s letter, he evidently overlooked or dismissed intelligence pointing to oil as a, and perhaps the, most vital target set in the Reich. Portal once again sought Bufton’s advice as he contemplated his response.  Bufton began by saying Harris was trying “to throw doubt... upon the soundness of the oil plan.”145 He also said the major proportion of oil production came from a limited number of plants. Eleven synthetic plants in central Germany provided 70 percent of Germany’s fuel. Their destruction would speed the end of the war in Europe. But it was Harris’s final
