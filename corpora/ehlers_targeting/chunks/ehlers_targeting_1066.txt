ffair had simply become one of “heads I lose tails you win, and it is an intolerable situation. I therefore ask you to consider whether it is best for the prosecution of the war and the success of our arms, which alone matters, that I should remain in this situation.”1  The errors in Harris’s letter were numerous and betray an inexplicable lack of insight on the oil campaign’s results. It was already clear that once German armies were forced into mobile warfare, they ran out of fuel almost immediately. The most junior intelligence analyst could have dismissed his argument that the Germans needed only 25 percent of full production to continue fighting by pointing out that nearly half of that paltry amount would be tied up in whatever pipeline the Germans managed to keep flowing. The remaining fuel was far too limited to allow for an effective defense once things on the ground became active. As for his stated view that the 1940 oil plan and campaign were unrelated to facts or practical possibilities, he was decidedly wrong. His effort to discredit the 1944-1945 oil campaign by pointing to its predecessor—as Tedder had done during the pre-ovERLORD debates—was a gross error in logic and judgment.  Portal’s reply, dated 20 January 1945, expressed regret that he had failed to win Harris over. The Germans, he said, were short of oil, and current production forecasts fell short of estimated requirements for even a static defense. Further, the Russian advance indicated there would be even more serious fuel shortages and German defeats there, both of which proved true. Although only 13 percent of Bomber Command's effort went against oil targets during the last four months of 1944, Portal admitted he was happy with the results.  Portal then essentially gave up, conceding the argument about panacea targets was not worth pursuing further. He and Harris simply had to agree to disagree. Portal recognized the value of city attacks but said they could not have been decisive without
