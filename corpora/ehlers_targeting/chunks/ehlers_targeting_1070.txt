I am very sorry that you do not believe in it but it is no use my craving for what is evidently unattainable. We must wait until after the end of the war before we can know for certain who was right and I sincerely hope that until then you will continue in command of the force which has done so much towards defeating the enemy and has brought such credit and renown to yourself and to the Air Force.172  Harris made one last reply on 24 January 1945, saying he had misunderstood Portalâ€™s meaning on the question of loyalty, and stating Bomber Command would do its utmost to implement the stated policy.  So the argument ended in a draw. Harris kept his job and continued to bomb German cities even as his command carried out a concerted and highly effective series of oil attacks. Portal allowed an unsatisfactory situation to continue, but he kept Harris after oil. In fact, the upshot of this nearly three months of correspondence was a series of Bomber Command raids that knocked the distant Bergius plants out of action for good. These attacks represented just 11 percent of Bomber Command sorties because there were no longer enough oil targets operational or enough suitable nights to allow for anything approaching full employment of bombers against oil.  The Oil Offensive Continues  Even as this argument raged, the oil offensive continued at full tilt. Attacks during the first week of November that used blind-bombing techniques inflicted moderate damage on several oil plants and refineries.178 Despite these modest successes, virtually every CSTC bulletin from this period bemoaned the bad weather, short days, and great distances to the eastern Bergius plants.122 This troublesome trio made American daylight bombing of eastern German oil plants impossible, but it did not prevent the policing of western plants and refineries, which stayed out of action. And recon- naissance pilots still brought in enough photos to provide a good idea of damage done and rate of repair, as did Ultr
