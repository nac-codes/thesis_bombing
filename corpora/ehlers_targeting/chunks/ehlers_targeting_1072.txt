omber Command raids that knocked the distant Bergius plants out of action for good. These attacks represented just 11 percent of Bomber Command sorties because there were no longer enough oil targets operational or enough suitable nights to allow for anything approaching full employment of bombers against oil.  The Oil Offensive Continues  Even as this argument raged, the oil offensive continued at full tilt. Attacks during the first week of November that used blind-bombing techniques inflicted moderate damage on several oil plants and refineries.178 Despite these modest successes, virtually every CSTC bulletin from this period bemoaned the bad weather, short days, and great distances to the eastern Bergius plants.122 This troublesome trio made American daylight bombing of eastern German oil plants impossible, but it did not prevent the policing of western plants and refineries, which stayed out of action. And recon- naissance pilots still brought in enough photos to provide a good idea of damage done and rate of repair, as did Ultra intercepts.  One of the most glaring indications of severe fuel shortages was the painful process of moving the 6th SS Panzer Army to the Eastern Front. An intercepted message from the director general of armed forces transport noted the central role of fuel shortages in delaying the movement of units to marshaling yards.4£2 Equally troubling, in the east, “Since August 1944 there has been an acute shortage of liquid fuel of every description in Army Group Nord. As a result, operations by Panzer Troops and Air Forces have been temporarily reduced to a minimum. Only some 100 aircraft have been operating daily in the whole of the area of Army Group Nord during this period.”184  German POWs who served on the Eastern Front in summer and early fall 1944 and were transferred to the west highlighted the disastrous fuel situation in the east. They said, “the Russians encircled the Germans again and again, moving ahead faster than the Germans co
