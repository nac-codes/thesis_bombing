leading through Ploesti was 33,000 to 36,000 tons. The Danube was no longer a feasible alternative as a result of Allied mining.+85  Luard then estimated German requirements along the southern portion of the Eastern Front were 12,000 tons per day. This yielded at most a 3:1 rail capacity to supplies ratio, compared to 10:1 in Italy, making the three Rumanian rail centers in question—and the tunnels and bridges in between—prime candidates for heavy-bomber attacks. Luard believed concerted attacks would achieve four things: speed the Russian advance, undermine the governments of Germany’s Balkan satellites and cause their defection, interfere seriously with the German retreat, and set the stage for a follow-on effort to hinder the escape of German units from Greece and southern Yugoslavia. “The main purpose,” Luard concluded, “is not to attack transportation per se, or to destroy freight cars and locomotives, but to reduce the rail capacity to the Eastern Front to the point where the enemy is no longer able to supply his troops opposing the Russian Army.”18° The heavy-bomber raids that followed in summer and early fall 1944 accomplished exactly this, illustrating again the vital interactions between forward-looking intelligence and good operations plans, and the complementary na- ture of transportation and oil attacks.182  As the cataclysm in the Balkans and the east unfolded, ever more severe fuel shortages plagued the Luftwaffe, which had received almost no new aviation fuel since August. An 18 November order to all Luftflotten forbade night ground-attack sorties, bombing missions, and transport missions except to isolated fortresses, and permitted only twenty V-1 launches at a time. Operations took place only if weather and tactical considerations made success likely.428 This order brings home just how absent the Luftwaffe had become, even on the Eastern Front.  On 21 November, all logistics units received an order to prevent fuel losses. Trains were to be loaded
