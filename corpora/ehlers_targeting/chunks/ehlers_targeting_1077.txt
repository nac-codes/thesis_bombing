d fall 1944. Group Captain J. C. E. Luard, chief of MAAF intelligence, produced a paper examining “the possibilities of aid to the Russians through attacks on the Balkan communication system by Italian based long range heavy bombers.”284 Luard noted the Russian capture of Cernauti had severed the main German supply lines. This action threw practically the entire burden of supplying German troops on the Hungarian and Rumanian rail systems, confined between the Carpathians on the north and the Danube on the south. In between, Luard observed, trains moved through a series of bottlenecks, including bridges and tunnels, before emerging onto flat lands to the east. This meant German troops along the southern portion of the front were almost entirely dependent on Rumanian fuel for mobility. Luard identified three transportation bottlenecks: Bucharest, Brasov, and Ploesti. The daily capacity of the two main rail lines leading through Ploesti was 33,000 to 36,000 tons. The Danube was no longer a feasible alternative as a result of Allied mining.1*  Luard then estimated German requirements along the southern portion of the Eastern Front were 12,000 tons per day. This yielded at most a 3:1 rail capacity to supplies ratio, compared to 10:1 in Italy, making the three Rumanian rail centers in question—and the tunnels and bridges in between—prime candidates for heavy-bomber attacks. Luard believed concerted attacks would achieve four things: speed the Russian advance, undermine the governments of Germany’s Balkan satellites and cause their defection, interfere seriously with the German retreat, and set the stage for a follow-on effort to hinder the escape of German units from Greece and southern Yugoslavia. “The main purpose,” Luard concluded, “is not to attack transportation per se, or to destroy freight cars and locomotives, but to reduce the rail capacity to the Eastern Front to the point where the enemy is no longer able to supply his troops opposing the Russian Army.”18° The
