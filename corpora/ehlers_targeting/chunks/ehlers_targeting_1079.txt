of Panzer Lehr. During this division’s refitting in November, there was no fuel for maneuvers. New recruits, most of whom had never driven a tank or truck, had almost no training before they went into action during the Ardennes offensive. Frequent accidents and high vehicle and crew losses followed. The division received its fuel increments just before the Ardennes offensive and hid them in a railway tunnel. Bayerlein was promised five but received two.122 This, he surmised, might give his division 62 miles of movement. In fact, because muddy and snowy conditions doubled or even tripled fuel use, the range was well under 40 miles.121 The division had insufficient fuel during the move to the front, and as always, fighter-bombers singled out fuel trucks. “Gasoline,” Bayerlein said,  was getting short, and every drop of it had to be brought up from Troisdorf [a distance of over 100 miles] by truck. The long march had itself cost about 30 tanks aside from attacks—tanks which had bogged down, run out of gas, or had other mechanical trouble. About this time Model issued an order that all other stalled vehicles along the road should be drained of gas, which should be used to get the tanks up to the front.1%  In the offensive’s aftermath, Bayerlein had to leave fifty-three tanks behind between 11 and 15 January as gas ran out. His troops drained vehicles in repair depots of fuel so tanks on the line would have a bit more for tactical maneuvers.122  Bayerlein noted that, as in Normandy, there was “almost always a shortage of fuel,” which made the following basic tactical actions difficult or impossible: moving tanks for counterattacks, shifting the division’s artillery, bringing up reinforcements, moving reserves to endangered sectors, hauling tanks to repair shops, bringing forward fuel and ammunition, and conducting mobile defensive op- erations. The same set of effects was in play to an even greater extent than in France.424  Page 288 of 423 68%  only if weather and tact
