with a revised production estimate for December: 409,000 tons (30 percent of preattack capacity). If the six major Bergius plants still in operation were knocked out, “the enemy will be confronted with the most acute POL supply situation which he has yet had to face and this will be further aggravated should large scale offensive action be resumed by the Russians on the Eastern Front.”222 The Fithrer himself contributed to this threat of operational catastrophe by ordering the Ardennes offensive, which consumed half of the fuel produced in November and December and thus made it impossible for German armies in the east to rebuild depleted stocks.2® The Germans launched their attack with only one or two fuel increments for each heavy division even with this huge di- version of fuel from the east. And a mere eight oil plants were all that stood between the last vestiges of German battlefield mobility and cataclysmic fuel shortages. They were not long in coming.

His troops drained vehicles in repair depots of fuel so tanks on the line would have a bit more for tactical maneuvers.123  Bayerlein noted that, as in Normandy, there was “almost always a shortage of fuel,” which made the following basic tactical actions difficult or impossible: moving tanks for counterattacks, shifting the division’s artillery, bringing up reinforcements, moving reserves to endangered sectors, hauling tanks to repair shops, bringing forward fuel and ammunition, and conducting mobile defensive op- erations. The same set of effects was in play to an even greater extent than in France.1%4  Allied airmen did not rest on their laurels. Although ten of eleven western synthetic oil plants were inactive, five
