The same set of effects was in play to an even greater extent than in France.1%4  Allied airmen did not rest on their laurels. Although ten of eleven western synthetic oil plants were inactive, five of eleven eastern plants were active, and others probably so. They would produce 180,000 tons of oil in November and 240,000 in December if not attacked. Most Austrian, Czechoslovakian, and Polish refineries were in production. Finally, of twenty-three major benzol plants in the Ruhr, fourteen were fully active.1% Production estimates were 449,000 tons (34 percent of preattack total) in November and 565,000 tons (42 percent) in December.42£ This pointed to a potential re- surgence in oil production.  The news was not all bad, though. Not only were the Ruhr oil plants out of action and now policed as needed, Mr. Lawrence also said the rate of repair of Ruhr oil plants was slower than expected, theorizing that repair capability declined as plants received progressive damage, leading to a point where only major structural repairs could get them running again. The Allies confirmed this in post- war surveys. In addition, earlier production estimates proved too high. Although the Germans got oil plants back online more quickly than expected, output was often under 25 percent of capacity. Production was at most 400,000 tons in October (30 percent of preattack capacity) and 450,000 (34 percent) in November. Also, the former head of the German oil administration in Bucharest, now in Russian hands, corroborated assessments that the Germans had at most a month of oil reserves. “The problem of providing petroleum,” he concluded, “has become the central problem in the Reich.”122  Equally ominous for the Germans was the start of Bomber Command night precision raids against distant Bergius plants. A 6-7 December attack on Leuna did serious damage. It involved the use of H2S Mark III for navigation to target and Pathfinder Force marking by twelve Mosquito aircraft in advance of the 475
