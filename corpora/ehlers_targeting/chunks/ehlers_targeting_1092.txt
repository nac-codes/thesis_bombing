Bombing thus held fuel production at a level low enough to derail the Ardennes offensive and deny divisions in the east an opportunity to rebuild reserves. This combined with an ineffective German logistical system to create disastrous fuel shortages on the Eastern Front by September 1944.  The oil offensive, like the pre-OVERLORD transportation offensive, proved essential in speeding Allied victory by robbing the Wehrmacht of its ability to concentrate, maneuver, or engage in sustained periods of high-intensity combat. Air intelligence was at the center of this momentous victory and would be once again during the impending transportation offensive against the Reich itself.
