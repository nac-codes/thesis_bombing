later observed: “The very serious declines in traffic movement which had been imposed by the end of 1944 were not recognized and the strength of the system as of that date was overestimated. Had the effectiveness of the attacks been fully recognized they might have been pressed home in a more systematic fashion, producing an earlier collapse of the railroad system.”2 But the offensive succeeded despite these intelligence shortcomings. Freight cars loaded in the Reich totaled 900,000 for the week ending 19 August 1944. The total dropped to 700,000 per week by 31 October. A further drop to 550,000 by 23 December was followed by a catastrophic decline to 214,000 by 3 March 1945. Attacks on inland waterways were even more successful. Raids closed the Dortmund-Ems and Mittelland canals on 23 September. Barge traffic on the Rhine and in the Ruhr was constantly interdicted by October. The commodity most affected by these disasters was coal. It became impossible to move this lifeblood of the German economy, as Mierzejewski described it, by water, and after November it was nearly impossible by rail. The results were disastrous for industry and the Reichsbahn, whose coal stocks de- clined from an 18-day supply in October to a 4.5-day supply in February.4  This transportation catastrophe hit the dispersed German war economy especially hard because components from scattered factories could not be moved easily to central assembly points. Progressive disorganization and destruction inflicted on marshaling yards also made movement of weapons, ammunition, and fuel exceptionally difficult. In combination with an inefficient logistical system, this friction often deprived the Wehrmacht of the replacement weapons, ammunition, and fuel necessary for maneuver warfare. Finally, the transportation campaign acted synergistically with oil attacks to produce several vital but often unanticipated effects, including, among other things, severe ammunition and heavy weapons shortages after fall
