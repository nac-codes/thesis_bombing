tation campaign acted synergistically with oil attacks to produce several vital but often unanticipated effects, including, among other things, severe ammunition and heavy weapons shortages after fall 1944.  In view of these impacts, we might be tempted to say this final transportation offensive, and the associated intelligence effort, equaled the oil offensive’s successes. Four things argue against such an assertion. First was the inherent complexity of transportation attacks, which involved militarystrategic attacks on movements of coal and hence on the German war economy, deep interdiction of marshaling yards and bridges, and direct support of ground troops, all designed to hamper movement of reinforcements, weapons, ammunition, and fuel.

Its impact on the German war industry and the Wehrmacht was catastrophic. Alfred Mierzejewski characterized attacks on railroads and inland waterways as decisive if flawed—decisive because it worked, flawed because it got into high gear too late as the result of poor Combined Strategic Targets Committee (CSTC) targeting recommendations and insufficient clarity about the effects of bombing transportation assets.+  The United States Strategic Bombing Survey agreed, saying, “The attack on transportation was the decisive blow that completely disorganized the German economy. It reduced war production in all categories and made it
