points. Progressive disorganization and destruction inflicted on marshaling yards also made movement of weapons, ammunition, and fuel exceptionally difficult. In combination with an inefficient logistical system, this friction often deprived the Wehrmacht of the replacement weapons, ammunition, and fuel necessary for maneuver warfare. Finally, the transportation campaign acted synergistically with oil attacks to produce several vital but often unanticipated effects, including, among other things, severe ammunition and heavy weapons shortages after fall 1944.  In view of these impacts, we might be tempted to say this final transportation offensive, and the associated intelligence effort, equaled the oil offensive’s successes. Four things argue against such an assertion. First was the inherent complexity of transportation attacks, which involved militarystrategic attacks on movements of coal and hence on the German war economy, deep interdiction of marshaling yards and bridges, and direct support of ground troops, all designed to hamper movement of reinforcements, weapons, ammunition, and fuel. The interplay of demands for these three types of attacks, itself a product of the vicissitudes of ground campaigns in the west and east, had a whipsaw effect that pulled heavy bombers from one kind of attack to another as the situation demanded. Second, bureaucratic infighting among intelligence agencies and their operational masters, who favored either transportation attacks (and, by extension, either a militarystrategic or op- erational-tactical focus for them) or oil raids, caused constant friction. The institutional preference for oil was the third issue affecting the degree of effort and focus brought to transportation attacks. The fourth was Harris’s continuing city bombing, which represented an increasingly contested use of bombers. Most senior commanders and advisors saw oil attacks as the best means for undermin- ing the German war effort and ending the war quickly.
