opellants. The cumbersome manufacturing process in which ammunition components such as shell casings, fuses, explosives, and propellants were produced in different areas and then shipped to over 100 army ordnance depots for final assembly was also seriously disrupted. In short, the combined effects of the oil and transportation offensives produced a catastrophic drop in both ammunition production and deliveries.2  Map 16 Greater German lransport Stettin . .

Tedder and Zuckerman designed the transportation offensive against the Reich to collapse the German war economy by disrupting the movement of coal and every conceivable item of  military utility through concerted attacks on marshaling yards and canals. The Ruhr was the focal point for many of these attacks, allowing Harris to bomb cities while also destroying transportation infrastructure. (Richard G. Davis,  Carl A. Spaatz and the Air War in Europe [Washington, D.C.: Center for Air Force History, 1993], 509)  It was within this milieu of strategic, operational, and bureaucratic factors that the transportation campaign against the Reich’s railroads and inland waterways was conceived, debated, and carried through to a successful, if less than optimal, conclusion.
