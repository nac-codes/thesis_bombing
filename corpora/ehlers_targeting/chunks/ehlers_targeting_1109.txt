uate earlier efforts with the impending attack on German transportation assets. “In Germany,” he noted, “all loss of traffic is a dead loss to the war effort.”2 He further noted that manpower and materials for repairs were in short supply. Tedder recommended simultaneous attacks on rail centers, oil targets, and canal systems. Heavy and me- dium bombers and fighter-bombers eventually carried out this coordinated campaign, as had occurred in France.12  Tedder and Zuckerman produced their paper the day after a contentious meeting at the Air Ministry in which operations and intelligence officers discussed the possibility of forcing a German collapse within ninety days by conducting heavy transportation raids. Mr. Brant of the Railway Research Service was adamant such a plan could not succeed, given approaching bad weather and short winter days. He and other experts recommended concentrating on lines of communication west of the Rhine to cause maximum delay and disruption.14 Eisenhower pressed for an effort producing a German defeat by year’s end. Airmen convinced him that a continued emphasis on oil would pay the biggest dividends—an argument he accepted while still insisting on a more modest transporta- tion effort.  Tedder and Zuckerman were dissatisfied with these decisions, which placed emphasis on oil attacks while relegating transportation attacks to a subordinate and operational role focused on impeding the movement of German troops and supplies west of the Rhine, rather than the superior and military-strategic role they thought such attacks should play. Indeed, they pushed from the out- set for a transportation campaign to destroy railroads and canals, undermining the German army’s ability to concentrate and maneuver, but more importantly destroying the German war economy.  There is one important caution in order as we consider these developments. Too much has been made of the differences between Tedder’s position and that taken by CSTC members, who held that
