omy.  There is one important caution in order as we consider these developments. Too much has been made of the differences between Tedder’s position and that taken by CSTC members, who held that oil should continue to have primacy. Tedder never approached the problem from an either-or perspective. As he noted in his draft transportation campaign plan, the oil offensive was undermining German mobility at the fighting fronts. Further, he said, complementarities between oil and transportation attacks demanded the Allies press forward with both. He simply believed transportation attacks had the potential to undermine the German war effort at its sources of supply—the coalfields of the Ruhr and the arms factories depending on them—and thus at the fighting fronts. Oil attacks, he said, would make this process more effective but should not proceed on their own.42  The upshot was Bottomley’s decision on 29 October, with Spaatz’s concurrence, to set up a new CSTC Working Committee (Communications) to provide target priorities and a weekly target list for attacks on key transportation assets. The committee included experts from the Railway Research Service, Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), War Office, Air Ministry (A.I.3.e), Ministry of Economic Warfare, and Enemy Objectives Unit. Aside from issuing weekly prioritized target lists and reports on the campaign’s progress, the working committee (a direct descendant of the Railway Targets Committee set up to support OVERLORD) was to work up a draft transportation plan and list of targets under Mr. Brant’s direction.12  The three key developments growing out of the 24 October meeting to discuss the latest transportation offensive were Eisenhower's approval of a continued emphasis on oil attacks, Tedder’s dissenting opinion, and the formation of anew CSTC Working Committee (Communications) to address issues surrounding transportation attacks.  Tedder and Zuckerman knew such attacks in France and Belgium had
