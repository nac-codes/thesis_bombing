g priorities they gave bombers from fall 1944 to VE Day, once again limited its effectiveness. “The crucial factor,” he said, “in determining exploitation of this intelligence was not its content but the preconceived notion brought to it by the analysts and the ability of intelligence organizations to function effectively in the highly bureaucratic-political environment surrounding the air decision makers.”/5 Despite this statement’s basic accuracy for the transportation offensive, it flies in the face of all evidence for oil, which the Allies had watched closely for years. Indeed, what is most striking about the air intelligence effort is not the infighting, which was de rigueur among intelligence agencies, but rather the con- vergence of opinions on oil and, to a more modest degree, on transportation attacks during 1944.  Ultra and Transportation Attacks  Ultra decrypts once again gave air intelligence officers useful insights on bomb damage even before systematic attacks began. On 19 October, Army Group B made an urgent request for a greater use of Rhine River ferries because bombing had destroyed most road and rail bridges.1® The following day, the Reich minister for equipment and war production said destruction of rail centers and power plants had brought 30 to 35 percent of war industry to a standstill.12 Headquarters, Commander in Chief West, confirmed the road suspension bridge at Cologne-Mihlheim, raided 14 October, had fallen into the Rhine, blocking all traffic.18 An attack on the Mittelland canal near Minden on 26 October destroyed a 100-foot section, bringing canal traffic there to a standstill.
