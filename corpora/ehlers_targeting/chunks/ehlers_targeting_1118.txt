The ensuing flood des- troyed two factories and froze rail traffic at the key Bielefeld junction for two days.12 The intercepts provided utterly reliable indicators that a systematic campaign would do grievous harm.  There is an important caveat regarding this vital intelligence source. Mierzejewski claimed the CSTC not only ignored but actively suppressed Ultra intercepts.22 Available evidence indicates that his accusations are wide of the mark. The CSTC viewed oil as the most important target and transportation as secondary, but there is equally clear evidence CSTC representatives arrived at these con- clusions on the basis of the dramatic impact of the oil offensive.
