Raids would breach key portions of the Dortmund-Ems-Mittelland canal, sever the connection between the Mittelland canal and the Elbe River, and destroy the Minden aqueduct to cut off the Mittelland canal from the Weser River. An aerial-mining plan focused on the Rhine and Elbe.22  The CSTC plan was appropriate and effective; it was predicated on oil attacks continuing as the top priority. The only problem was a habit among CSTC members of slighting the transportation offensive whenever they felt it threatened the oil campaign. They also proved less capable of determining the effects of transportation attacks than of oil attacks. Thus, while they generally appreciated the effects of attacks on transportation assets, the CSTC, Allied Central Interpretation Unit (ACIU), and other intelligence organizations failed fully to appreciate their overall effectiveness until Febru- ary 1945.28  Nevertheless, the plan was based on accurate intelligence that Germany’s transportation networks had reached a state of crisis. A CSTC report produced in November referred to an address by the Reich transport minister to Reichsbahn directors on 18 October, which said if the railways were stopped, it would mean the end of the Reich. “The point seems to have been reached,” he said, “when the extent of the present operating difficulties may eventually overwhelm the reserves of the Reichsbahn.”2® Key factors, he said, were damage to and disorganization of rail centers by air attack; increasingly acute coal and lubricant shortages; the rapid dwindling of locomotive reserves; reassignment of skilled workers to the army in the wake of dual operational cataclysms in the east and west; low morale among remaining workers; and the reduction of road and water transport by bombing, which placed an even greater strain on the railroads.  By November 1944, the situation was approaching crisis: 42 percent of locomotives were unserviceable; repair shops were not keeping up; and the Germans were cannibali
