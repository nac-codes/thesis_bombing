greater strain on the railroads.  By November 1944, the situation was approaching crisis: 42 percent of locomotives were unserviceable; repair shops were not keeping up; and the Germans were cannibalizing many locomotives for parts. Operating difficulties also increased sharply with attacks on other targets, including Reichsbahn Divisional Directorate headquarters and railroad telecommunications systems.22 The CSTC asserted, on the basis of these insights and others provided by damage reports and Ultra intercepts, that the key problems facing the Reichsbahn were major locomotive shortages, the related scarcity of repair facilities, and a severe shortage of skilled and loyal personnel (over half were now foreigners).  As the full extent of this disastrous situation became clearer, Spaatz cabled Eaker to say the CSTC’s transportation plan, although focused on the area between the Rhine and the line of longitude 10 degrees east, also called for attacks against marshaling yards in central and eastern Germany. “It so happens,” Spaatz stated, “that the attack of transportation objectives in the two latter areas [central and eastern Germany] is particularly suitable for the support of military operations on the Eastern Front.”24 Spaatz’s cable was a show of support for the CSTC’s decision to increase the number of rail targets to sixty-five and expand the number of zones to be attacked from five to nine.22  On 23 November, when airmen reached agreement on the need for complementary oil and transportation attacks, Tedder, as chairman of the Allied air commanders’ conferences, directed “tactical” aircraft to attack fuel depots and dumps; benzol plants; concentrations of tank cars in storage depots, marshaling yards, and railheads; and fuel trains underway. When such attacks were not feasible, they were to attack transportation targets. These raids, he said, were highly complementary and would go far toward disorganizing and slowing German troop and supply movements. The obje
