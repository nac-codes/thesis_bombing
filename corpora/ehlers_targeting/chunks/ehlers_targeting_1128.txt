not feasible, they were to attack transportation targets. These raids, he said, were highly complementary and would go far toward disorganizing and slowing German troop and supply movements. The objective was progressive disorganization of railroad and barge traffic. Tedder concluded: “By carefully coordinating the operations of the Tactical Forces with those of the Strategic Forces, the attack on German communications can be so developed as to make a vital contribution towards the success of the land campaign and the early defeat of Germany.”22 He did all he could to give transportation targets added emphasis in order to enhance the complementary effects they produced together with oil attacks.

As the full extent of this disastrous situation became clearer, Spaatz cabled Eaker to say the CSTC’s transportation plan, although focused on the area between the Rhine and the line of longitude 10 degrees east, also called for attacks against marshaling yards in central and eastern Germany. “It so happens,” Spaatz stated, “that the attack of transportation objectives in the two latter areas [central and eastern Germany] is particularly suitable for the support of military operations on the Eastern Front.”2+ Spaatz’s cable was a show of support for the CSTC’s decision to increase the number of rail targets to sixty-five and expand the number of zones to be attacked from five to nine.#2  On 23 November, when airmen reached agreement on the need for complementary oil and transportation attacks, Tedder, as chairman of the Allied air commanders’ conferences, directed “tactical” aircraft to attack fuel depots and dumps; benzol plants; concentrations of tank cars in storage depots, marshaling yards, and railheads; and fuel trains underway. When such attacks were not feasible, they were to attack transportation targets. These raids, he said, were
