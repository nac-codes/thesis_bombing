in disarray and lamented the serious differences of opinion about its proper focus. He said it was time to determine which kinds of attacks (on the economy, on military movement, or on “close support” of the ground battle) made the most sense and ensure proper prioritization.“ Although this was a serious problem, it was largely unavoidable, despite Bufton’s efforts, because of the frequent demands placed on heavy bombers to support Allied armies.  The problem was not yet resolved three weeks later when CSTC representatives argued about whether such attacks should focus on degrading the Wehrmacht’s logistics, the German war economy, or both. The weight of bombs dropped on transportation targets was six times that dropped on oil in December 1944, but the payoff not as great. Nevertheless, these raids caused severe damage, dis- rupting coal shipments. The Dortmund-Ems canal, a vital coal-distribution conduit, had been out of action continuously for four months.**  Aweek later, the Joint Intelligence Subcommittee (JIC) entered the fray, saying attacks should support the Red Army’s advance.‘* The air minister, Sir Archibald Sinclair, sent a minute to Churchill on 26 January saying the oil campaign was doing great damage to the German war effort and benefiting both Allied and Russian efforts on the ground.42 However, he also sounded a cautiously optimistic note on the potential use of heavy bombers to attack Leipzig, Dresden, and Chemnitz in support of the Red Army’s advance whenever weather conditions prohibited oil attacks. The next day, he fur- ther elaborated his position, arguing that  available effort should be directed against Berlin, Dresden, Chemnitz and Leipzig or against other cities where severe bombing would not only destroy communications vital to the evacuation from the East but would also hamper the movement of troops from the West. The use of the night bomber forces offers the best prospects of destroying these industrial areas without detracting from our
