ather conditions prohibited oil attacks. The next day, he fur- ther elaborated his position, arguing that  available effort should be directed against Berlin, Dresden, Chemnitz and Leipzig or against other cities where severe bombing would not only destroy communications vital to the evacuation from the East but would also hamper the movement of troops from the West. The use of the night bomber forces offers the best prospects of destroying these industrial areas without detracting from our offensive on oil targets, which is now in a critical phase.4®  His latest memo, which replaced a cautionary approach with one indicating these cities would soon come under Allied air attack, was in part a response to Soviet requests for raids on key rail centers to support their winter offensive. This attack, which had already deprived German divisions of the little gasoline they had, was now churning through Upper Silesia and toward the Oder River.42  As airmen debated the optimal transportation targets, concerted raids continued destroying the last vestiges of Germany’s oil industry. As noted earlier, Spaatz, Bottomley, Bufton, and Maxwell all recognized that the oil offensive would pay its greatest dividends in the east if and when the Soviets launched a winter offensive, which the Germans did not expect. The Germans miscalculated, with disastrous results. The Red Army’s drives into Upper Silesia and toward the Oder River, beginning 12 January 1945, caught the Germans by surprise—and almost entirely out of gasoline. The Wehrmacht’s dysfunctional supply system caused severe operational problems during this surprise winter assault. This predicament came from a combination of severe fuel shortages brought on by the oil offensive; superb Red Army offensive operations; transportation attacks that hampered the movement of heavy weapons, fuel, and ammunition to the front; and the ineffective supply system. All these factors came together in early 1945 to seal the fate of the Reich’s
