ansport regiments and battalions, which carried supplies to combat divisions at the front. In reality, they had too few trucks, so combat divisions had to use their own. This in turn meant divisions were not able to build up any significant supply dumps of their own. Finally, and the thing that made German logistics particularly vulnerable to any systemic fuel shortages, was the policy on the Eastern Front of placing large fuel and ammunition depots at the field army level, about 60 miles behind the front. This put the Germans in a situation similar to the one in Normandy, where they had to send each division’s trucks on supply runs rather than use them to shift troops to key areas.>2  The irony here was that German armies in the east, unlike their counterparts in the west, did not have to do business in this fashion. The threat of air attack was much lower, and they therefore had the ability to place large supply dumps—or a large number of smaller ones—closer to the front, where truck convoys from combat divisions could load up and be back within hours rather than days. But placement of large depots 60 or more miles behind the front was the rule.  There were three disadvantages here. The first was that divisions would be forced to fight too far from their field army’s supply depot. The second was that they might lack the trucks and gasoline (yet another irony) to retrieve supplies. The third and most significant was the possibility that Soviet armored spearheads would penetrate the front to a depth sufficient to cut off divisions from their supply depots. When any of these situations developed, serious fuel and ammunition shortages resulted. When a division’s fuel consumption increments were used up or captured, resupply became extremely difficult or impossible. The east’s huge expanses also meant trucks were in most cases the only means for getting supplies from army-level depots to the front. When depots were overrun and the fuel pipeline disrupted, combat units
