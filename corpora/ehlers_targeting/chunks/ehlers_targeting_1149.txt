st’s huge expanses also meant trucks were in most cases the only means for getting supplies from army-level depots to the front. When depots were overrun and the fuel pipeline disrupted, combat units had to rely on fuel they already had or retreat sufficient distances to receive fuel supplies at the railheads. In most cases, Hitler forbade such withdrawals, insisting that army units hold their ground.*3  The result of these conditions by summer 1944—German logistical weaknesses, Russian operational expertise, Hitler’s hold-fast orders, an increasingly severe fuel shortage, and the mounting chaos within the German logistical system caused by Allied bombing—robbed the Germans of their greatest operational strength: the maneuver expertise of their armored formations. The war had long been going against them, but oil and transportation attacks speeded the process. When oil raids got into high gear and fuel stocks at the division and army levels were exhausted or overrun, there was often little to no fuel available. This was the result of an absolute shortage of fuel and the logistical system’s inability to deliver it quickly to the railheads and from there to combat units. Albert Speer said, “Fuel was only obtainable by chance and not at the place where it would be needed.”=4 In summer and fall 1944, field armies and divisions began experiencing systemic and serious fuel shortages.  These shortages made German counterattacks difficult or impossible. Even after the front stabilized as the Russians experienced logistical problems of their own in fall 1944, the Germans could not rebuild their fuel stocks, as they had done in previous lulls in the fighting, because bombing had destroyed too much fuel-production capacity. In addition, Hitler’s decision to launch the Ardennes offensive meant even less fuel went to replenish supplies in the east.+2 Efforts to counter the Red Army’s advance were stymied by fuel shortages, which manifested themselves in the much-reduced fuel inc
