and final bombing directive. It again placed emphasis on the destruction of oil plants and of depots known to store large quantities of fuel.62 This order coincided with two weeks of good weather, which heralded the doom of what remained of Germany’s oil industry. Pélitz was raided the night of 13-14 January and Leuna the following night. In the attack on Politz, 218 Lancaster heavy bombers dropped 813 tons of munitions, while the attack on Leuna, carried out by 573 Lancasters, delivered 2,190 tons. On the basis of strike photos and poststrike reconnaissance, the British declared that Politz “had been reduced to a shambles” and Leuna just as severely damaged. These were night preci- sion raids.©3  Albert Speer said the Pélitz and Leuna raids were some of the “most damaging” made on oil plants. His 19 January memo to Hitler conveyed a growing sense of despair:  My Fiihrer, Since 13 January 1945 anew series of heavy attacks on the oil industry has been introduced, which has already led to prolonged shutdown of the great hydrogenation plants of Pélitz, Leuna, Briix, Blechhammer, and Zeitz, in addition to the complete shutdown during the last quarter of 1944 of all Western plants, especially Scholven, Wesseling, [Bottrop]-Welheim, and Gel- senberg [Gelsenkirchen]. The repair of the plants after each attack has become more difficult owing to the use or destruction of reserves of machines and equipment; in addition, repairs take a longer time. It must also be stated that the now frequent night attacks are more effective than the day raids as heavier bombs are being used and an extraordinary accuracy achieved; therefore, even if the repair and production during the first quarter of 1945 were to proceed undisturbed, the planned production, which during the final quarter of last year seemed possible, can no longer be achieved.*4  Just as significant was proof that work crews were cannibalizing the wrecked oil plant at Wesseling for parts.
