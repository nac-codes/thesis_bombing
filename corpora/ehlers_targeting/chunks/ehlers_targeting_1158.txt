ers dropping 856 tons of bombs, the latter with 328 Lancasters dropping 1,304 tons. Both caused serious damage, with Speer again mentioning that the attack on Briix was a particularly severe setback to oil production. Both were night precision raids.®8 Neither plant produced any more oil or fuel. Spaatz was so impressed with these attacks that he asked the Air Ministry for details on tactics used during the Briix raid. The reply said the 231 Lancasters had dropped 189 of the huge 4,000-pound high-capacity bombs, 1,305 500-pound mediumcapacity munitions, 624 500-pound general-purpose bombs, and 392 incendiaries. A total of 202 500-pound bombs had delay fuses of between 6 and 144 hours.£2 No. 5 Group Lancasters, navigating with H2S Mark III radar sets, dropped green target indicators followed by flares to illuminate the target area. Low-flying Mosquitoes then acquired the target visually and marked it with red 1,000-pound target-marking flares deployed at altitudes between 400 and 1,400 feet. To do this, they flew under the solid cloud cover obscuring the target. The master bomber in the lead aircraft controlled the attack from start to finish, ordering crews to drop their bombs on the glow of the target indicators, which were visible through the clouds covering the target. The Lancaster crews bombed individually from altitudes between 12,000 and 18,000 feet.2° These tactics indicated a high degree of proficiency. This stunning feat of airmanship, repeated a number of times against large Bergius plants between December 1944 and March 1945, indi- cated just how good Bomber Command’s elite formations, and even the main-force units, had become by this time.  There were notable differences between RAF and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) raids. The former delivered larger payloads and bombs, including 4,000-pound munitions whose blast effect severely damaged the vital aboveground pipelines that delivered steam pressure, coal sludge, oil, and fuel to the various parts
