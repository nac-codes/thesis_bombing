ntroduced, which has already led to prolonged shutdown of the great hydrogenation plants of Pélitz, Leuna, Briix, Blechhammer, and Zeitz, in addition to the complete shutdown during the last quarter of 1944 of all Western plants, especially Scholven, Wesseling, [Bottrop]-Welheim, and Gel- senberg [Gelsenkirchen]. The repair of the plants after each attack has become more difficult owing to the use or destruction of reserves of machines and equipment; in addition, repairs take a longer time. It must also be stated that the now frequent night attacks are more effective than the day raids as heavier bombs are being used and an extraordinary accuracy achieved; therefore, even if the repair and production during the first quarter of 1945 were to proceed undisturbed, the planned production, which during the final quarter of last year seemed possible, can no longer be achieved.  Just as significant was proof that work crews were cannibalizing the wrecked oil plant at Wesseling for parts. Also, ACIU photointerpreters noted “Gelsenkirchen-Nordstern and Ludwigshafen were abandoned.”® Even more important was the Soviet winter offensive, which, the CSTC said,  is of great significance to the oil offensive. In the first place it will inevitably increase the enemy’s minimum requirements of POL [petroleum, oil, and lubricants] by a substantial percentage at a time when his production has suffered fresh blows and may make it impossible for the enemy again to build up reserves from his current production for offensive purposes, as in the autumn. In the second place it promises to deprive the enemy of important sources of production. The remaining Polish refineries and the Hungarian oilfields are imminently threatened and, having regard to the speed of the advance, the position of the Silesian Synthetic Plants is beginning to look precarious. In this situation, the immobilization of the remaining large synthetic plants takes on a greater significance than ever before and demands the
