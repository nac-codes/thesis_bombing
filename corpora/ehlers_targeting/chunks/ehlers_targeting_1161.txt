lesian Synthetic Plants is beginning to look precarious. In this situation, the immobilization of the remaining large synthetic plants takes on a greater significance than ever before and demands the highest priority. At the same time the target value, on a lower priority, of Benzol Plants has been enhanced.®*  The synthetic oil industry’s output was now only 110,000 tons per month, of which 65,000 tons were gasoline and aviation fuel. In addition, the Red Army was poised to capture Blechhammer North and South. Between continuing oil attacks and the Red Army advance, oil production was being hounded to the point of complete collapse.®2  Another period of good weather the following week led to more devastating attacks by Bomber Command heavies, this time against Briix and Zeitz. The former attack was made with 231 Lancasters dropping 856 tons of bombs, the latter with 328 Lancasters dropping 1,304 tons. Both caused serious damage, with Speer again mentioning that the attack on Briix was a particularly severe setback to oil production. Both were night precision raids.®8 Neither plant produced any more oil or fuel. Spaatz was so impressed with these attacks that he asked the Air Ministry for details on tactics used during the Briix raid. The reply said the 231 Lancasters had dropped 189 of the huge 4,000-pound high-capacity bombs, 1,305 500-pound mediumcapacity munitions, 624 500-pound general-purpose bombs, and 392 incendiaries. A total of 202 500-pound bombs had delay fuses of between 6 and 144 hours.£2 No. 5 Group Lancasters, navigating with H2S Mark III radar sets, dropped green target indicators followed by flares to illuminate the target area. Low-flying Mosquitoes then acquired the target visually and marked it with red 1,000-pound target-marking flares deployed at altitudes between 400 and 1,400 feet. To do this, they flew under the solid cloud cover obscuring the target. The master bomber in the lead aircraft controlled the attack from start to finish, orderin
