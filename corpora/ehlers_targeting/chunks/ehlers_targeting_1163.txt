chhammer North and South in early February. The Allies also carried out heavy attacks on benzol plants, which were now producing the majority of German fuel. A measure of overwhelming Allied air strength was a Bomber Command attack, by 286 Lancasters, against the Bruckhausen benzol plant in Duisburg, which was obliterated by the 1,291 tons of bombs dropped on it—a huge figure, given the nature of the target.2  Bomber Command's oil attacks in the Ruhr also placated Harris, who continued his city bombing while at the same time engaging oil facilities with both “precision” and area attacks. In fact, the second battle of the Ruhr proved to be a winner for all parties: it met Tedder’s obiective for smashing German marshaling vards (which Harris had made his aircrews’ aim points for all citv attacks),  Page 314 of 423 74%  FALLUETIOL POLIUU UL BUUU WEALTICL LLIS LUMUW IIE, WEEK LOU LU TULLE ULV ASLALIIIE ALLARD UY DULIUCL VULIIITIALIIU LAV IES, Lillo Lite de dillol DIMA AIM GEIS, LIE LULIICL ALLALR Wate 1AM Wilil Zod Ldlitaolllo dropping 856 tons of bombs, the latter with 328 Lancasters dropping 1,304 tons. Both caused serious damage, with Speer again mentioning that the attack on Briix was a particularly severe setback to oil production. Both were night precision raids.®8 Neither plant produced any more oil or fuel. Spaatz was so impressed with these attacks that he asked the Air Ministry for details on tactics used during the Briix raid. The reply said the 231 Lancasters had dropped 189 of the huge 4,000-pound high-capacity bombs, 1,305 500-pound mediumcapacity munitions, 624 500-pound general-purpose bombs, and 392 incendiaries. A total of 202 500-pound bombs had delay fuses of between 6 and 144 hours.£2 No. 5 Group Lancasters, navigating with H2S Mark III radar sets, dropped green target indicators followed by flares to illuminate the target area. Low-flying Mosquitoes then acquired the target visually and marked it with red 1,000-pound target-marking flares deployed
