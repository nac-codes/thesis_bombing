ral impressive ones carried out by 8th and 15th Air Forces, reduced gasoline production for January to 97,000 tons—18 percent of the preattack level, an all-time low.4  Meanwhile, the Russians overran Blechhammer North and South in early February. The Allies also carried out heavy attacks on benzol plants, which were now producing the majority of German fuel. A measure of overwhelming Allied air strength was a Bomber Command attack, by 286 Lancasters, against the Bruckhausen benzol plant in Duisburg, which was obliterated by the 1,291 tons of bombs dropped on it—a huge figure, given the nature of the target.2  Bomber Command's oil attacks in the Ruhr also placated Harris, who continued his city bombing while at the same time engaging oil facilities with both “precision” and area attacks. In fact, the second battle of the Ruhr proved to be a winner for all parties: it met Tedder’s objective for smashing German marshaling yards (which Harris had made his aircrews’ aim points for all city attacks), Spaatz’s and Portal’s preference for oil, and Harris’s focus on cities. These late-war city raids also put the finishing touches on natural gas mains, electrical grids, and other key infrastructural assets laboriously rebuilt after the first battle of the Ruhr. The three-way argument senior airmen engaged in regarding the relative importance of transportation, oil, and city raids thus becomes even more interesting in view of the major effects of Bomber Command’s huge late-war city bombing. Despite what some scholars have said about these raids simply “making the rubble bounce,” they were the death knell of a partially reconstituted and vital element of the German war economy.  The Bitter End for German Operational Mobility  Results of Allied oil attacks were becoming clearer by the day. In the west, supply returns for the 5th Panzer Army, 7-10 January, showed a drop of 210 tons (41 percent) in fuel stocks because there were no new allocations at all the week of 7 January. Th
