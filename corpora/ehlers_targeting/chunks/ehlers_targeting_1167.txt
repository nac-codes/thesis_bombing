visions opposite Russian areas of concentration. Fuel returns from the 2nd Army on the Eastern Front, and the 1st Parachute, 19th, and 25th Armies in the west, all showed fuel supplies well below one consumption unit. In Italy, Kesselring said fuel shortages were undermining defensive efforts.8+  As grim as the situation was for army units, it paled in comparison to the Luftwaffe’s difficulties. German flying training hours for pilot candidates were ten to thirty hours in combat types from July 1944 to the end of the war, compared with 360 for the USAAF and 340 for the RAF.22 By December 1944, the Germans were turning out only one-third of the required pilots.22 With an average of 4,345 operational aircraft in January 1945, the Luftwaffe averaged only 740 sorties per day.*4 During the same month, only 13,000 tons of aviation fuel was released from the nearly exhausted strategic reserve for pilot training.®* In addition, there was almost no new aviation fuel being produced. By February, Luftflotte 6 reported from the Eastern Front that its units were seriously hampered by fuel shortages.®* The Russian winter offensive forced the Luftwaffe to use its last reserves, while an order further restricted flying operations in the west owing to increased consumption of fuel in the east.&2 A week later, cryptographers intercepted an OKW order to limit ruthlessly all Luftwaffe operations. In a postwar interrogation, Goring noted that there was a drastic reduction in aviation fuel supplies from 160,000 tons per month in March 1944 to between 15,000 and 20,000 in January 1945, an instrumental factor in the Luftwaffe’s rapid operational decline. By March 1945, sorties in the  Page 315 of 423 74%  Meanwhile, the Russians overran Blechhammer North and South in early February.“ The Allies also carried out heavy attacks on benzol plants, which were now producing the majority of German fuel. A measure of overwhelming Allied air strength was a Bomber Command attack, by 286 Lancasters, a
