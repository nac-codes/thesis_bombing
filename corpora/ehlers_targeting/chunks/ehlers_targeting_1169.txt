to allow for a move of 24 miles on good roads in fair weather and 8 miles on muddy or snowy roads.2 Two weeks later, 9th Panzer Division made an urgent request for fuel. Only 5 tons of 11 allocated had arrived, and this had already been used towing tanks—themselves out of gas—to the front. On the same day, Army Group G reported the offensive strength of its divisions was undermined by an artillery ammunition shortage and the abandonment of almost all self-propelled and towed artillery owing to fuel shortages.2® The 116th Panzer and 15th Panzer Grenadier Divisions reported enough fuel to travel 21 and 36 miles, respectively.“ A month later, the range of the 116th Panzer was 10 miles.28  Things were even worse in the east, given the mobile operations there as opposed to more static operations in the west. In a clear reference to the Russian winter offensive, a SHAEF G-2 report said German fuel production had collapsed “at a moment when operational fuel requirements are higher than at any time in the last six months.” In the east, the Ninth Army reported on 21 January that one of its Panzer corps was unable to cover its flanks by mobile operations in the Lodz area because of a lack of fuel. The fuel shortage forced Panzer Corps Grossdeutschland and several other units to withdraw to keep vehicles from completely running out of fuel.22 A 14 February report from Army Group Vistula said the entire army group would be partially immobile for the day, given recent increases in fuel consumption resulting from positioning several divisions opposite Russian areas of concentration.
