put the finishing touches on natural gas mains, electrical grids, and other key infrastructural assets laboriously rebuilt after the first battle of the Ruhr. The three-way argument senior airmen engaged in regarding the relative importance of transportation, oil, and city raids thus becomes even more interesting in view of the major effects of Bomber Command's huge late-war city bombing. Despite what some scholars have said about these raids simply “making the rubble bounce,” they were the death knell of a partially reconstituted and vital element of the German war economy.”  The Bitter End for German Operational Mobility  Results of Allied oil attacks were becoming clearer by the day. In the west, supply returns for the 5th Panzer Army, 7-10 January, showed a drop of 210 tons (41 percent) in fuel stocks because there were no new allocations at all the week of 7 January. This left armored units with 0.38 consumption units, enough to allow for a move of 24 miles on good roads in fair weather and 8 miles on muddy or snowy roads.2 Two weeks later, 9th Panzer Division made an urgent request for fuel. Only 5 tons of 11 allocated had arrived, and this had already been used towing tanks—themselves out of gas—to the front. On the same day, Army Group G reported the offensive strength of its divisions was undermined by an artillery ammunition shortage and the abandonment of almost all self-propelled and towed artillery owing to fuel shortages.2® The 116th Panzer and 15th Panzer Grenadier Divisions reported enough fuel to travel 21 and 36 miles, respectively.2“ A month later, the range of the 116th Panzer was 10 miles.28  Things were even worse in the east, given the mobile operations there as opposed to more static operations in the west. In a clear reference to the Russian winter offensive, a SHAEF G-2 report said German fuel production had collapsed “at a moment when operational fuel requirements are higher than at any time in the last six months.” In the east, the Ninth
