ter offensive, a SHAEF G-2 report said German fuel production had collapsed “at a moment when operational fuel requirements are higher than at any time in the last six months.” In the east, the Ninth Army reported on 21 January that one of its Panzer corps was unable to cover its flanks by mobile operations in the Lodz area because of a lack of fuel. The fuel shortage forced Panzer Corps Grossdeutschland and several other units to withdraw to keep vehicles from completely running out of fuel.22 A 14 February report from Army Group Vistula said the entire army group would be partially immobile for the day, given recent increases in fuel consumption resulting from positioning several divisions opposite Russian areas of concentration. Fuel returns from the 2nd Army on the Eastern Front, and the 1st Parachute, 19th, and 25th Armies in the west, all showed fuel supplies well below one consumption unit. In Italy, Kesselring said fuel shortages were undermining defensive efforts.8+  As grim as the situation was for army units, it paled in comparison to the Luftwaffe’s difficulties. German flying training hours for pilot candidates were ten to thirty hours in combat types from July 1944 to the end of the war, compared with 360 for the USAAF and 340 for the RAF.22 By December 1944, the Germans were turning out only one-third of the required pilots.83 With an average of 4,345 operational aircraft in January 1945, the Luftwaffe averaged only 740 sorties per day.*4 During the same month, only 13,000 tons of aviation fuel was released from the nearly exhausted strategic reserve for pilot training.®* In addition, there was almost no new aviation fuel being produced. By February, Luftflotte 6 reported from the Eastern Front that its units were seriously hampered by fuel shortages.®° The Russian winter offensive forced the Luftwaffe to use its last reserves, while an order further restricted flying operations in the west owing to increased consumption of fuel in the east.£2 A week
