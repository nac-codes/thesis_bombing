he Russian winter offensive forced the Luftwaffe to use its last reserves, while an order further restricted flying operations in the west owing to increased consumption of fuel in the east.£2 A week later, cryptographers intercepted an OKW order to limit ruthlessly all Luftwaffe operations.£8 In a postwar interrogation, Goring noted that there was a drastic reduction in aviation fuel supplies from 160,000 tons per month in March 1944 to between 15,000 and 20,000 in January 1945, an instrumental factor in the Luftwaffe’s rapid operational decline. By March 1945, sorties in the east dropped from 3,000 per day the previous summer to between 600 and 800, with a surge capability of 1,200 for major operational requirements.®2  On 22 February, the CSTC noted with satisfaction, “The bulk of Germany’s supplies of fuel for the next 4 to 6 weeks—at what may be a critical phase of the battle for Germany—will consist of the past production in transit through the distribution system.”2° This was crucial. Although the Germans still had fuel in their distribution pipeline, it was so obstructed by raids on rail centers and bridges that most units received only enough fuel to conduct a static defense. Accordingly, the CSTC recommended attacks on fuel depots take precedence. The last vestiges of German tactical mobility disap- peared when air attacks destroyed the depots.2+  Support of the Red Army: The Road to Dresden  The key now was to give all possible support to the Red Army. Putting the last four Bergius plants out of action would, along with the imminent Russian capture of Upper Silesia’s synthetic oil plants and coalfields, collapse German oil production. Airmen also went after marshaling yards through which German divisions moving to the east travelled, including those at Leipzig, Chemnitz, and Dresden.  Ultra intelligence confirmed that 6th SS Panzer Army, composed of four (later six) SS Panzer divisions, was moving from west to east with routing along the Berlin-Magdeburg-
