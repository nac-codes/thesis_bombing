Ultra intelligence confirmed that 6th SS Panzer Army, composed of four (later six) SS Panzer divisions, was moving from west to east with routing along the Berlin-Magdeburg-Leipzig-Dresden- Cottbus railways. Its orders were to stop the Red Army’s advance into Upper Silesia and toward the Oder. The Russians were calling for raids on marshaling yards along 6th Panzer’s route of travel.
