In theory, I suppose it was also argued that whatever aided the Soviets at the time indirectly aided us. Yet knowing se- nior American air commanders as I did, 1am confident that Spaatz, Fred Anderson, and Eaker—and indeed other senior operational air commanders—would never have attacked Dresden on their own initiative. We would not have sacrificed the lives of young Americans and our aircraft against a target of limited military significance to the major responsibility of the American Air Force.22  In his masterful work on the bombing, Frederick Taylor agreed in essence with Powell's conclusions. Although a number of East German and other scholars sought to turn Dresden into a simple case of terror bombing, Taylor argues it was far from such a thing.

Creating greater friction was key: “The attack of these cities had been ordered, not merely because of their communications value or for any other single specific object, but because any additional chaos which we could cause at this juncture would make the Ger- man administrative and mil
