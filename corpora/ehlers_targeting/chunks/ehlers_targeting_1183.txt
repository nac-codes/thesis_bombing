een much higher. Dresden, Cox concluded, was indeed a vital military target, and the bombing must be viewed in this context and with an understanding that the Grand Alliance wanted the war to end as quickly as pos- sible, before the German “wonder weapons” or some other reverse dragged it out even further.1%  The debate continues today—and it will likely not end anytime soon.  Collapse of Germany’s Military Operations and War Economy  As these raids developed, aircrews knew their efforts had already reduced production of finished POL products for January to 365,000 tons (27 percent of preattack capacity), and of gasoline and aviation fuel to 100,000 tons (19 percent of preattack total).1 For the week ending 12 February, there were sixteen major raids, including five on oil plants, seven on refineries, and four on depots. A last Bomber Command night precision raid, on Pélitz by 475 Lancasters dropping 1,657 tons of bombs, demolished what was left of it.12  Page 318 of 423 75%  destroyed, as were hundreds of railcars.22 Brigadier General McDonald, the United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF) A-2, summed up the reasons for these raids:  The chief current target importance of these towns lies in their railway facilities. The Russian offensive has necessitated a tremendous movement of troops and supplies to the line of the Oder. At the same time the panic evacuation of civilians from the areas threatened by the Russians and the attempts by the enemy to rescue industrial equipment and machinery from the threatened areas had created a heavy traffic demand movement in the opposite direction. As a result rail activity in the whole area behind the front is intense.22  McDonald noted the importance of Dresden and Chemnitz in particular as waypoints for the movement of German reinforcements to the east. They also housed fuel and ammunition. From the standpoint of military necessity, these raids, although brutal, appeared justified to a number of Allied airmen. Howe
