German reinforcements to the east. They also housed fuel and ammunition. From the standpoint of military necessity, these raids, although brutal, appeared justified to a number of Allied airmen. However, Churchill, the War Cabinet, Stimson, and Arnold all voiced concerns about the raids, wondering aloud whether their brutal effects could outweigh the real but limited military results thus obtained. Lieutenant Colonel Powell also said:  I have a correspondence file on Dresden, containing letters from some Americans who were in a position to know about the attacks: General Eaker, Robert Lovett, and John McCloy. All of these understood that the Allies simply bowed to persistent Soviet pressure. In theory, I suppose it was also argued that whatever aided the Soviets at the time indirectly aided us. Yet knowing se- nior American air commanders as I did, 1am confident that Spaatz, Fred Anderson, and Eaker—and indeed other senior operational air commanders—would never have attacked Dresden on their own initiative. We would not have sacrificed the lives of young Americans and our aircraft against a target of limited military significance to the major responsibility of the American Air Force.22  In his masterful work on the bombing, Frederick Taylor agreed in essence with Powell's conclusions. Although a number of East German and other scholars sought to turn Dresden into a simple case of terror bombing, Taylor argues it was far from such a thing. It was a major administrative area and the largest unbombed city in Germany, and its rail and electrical grids made it vital to German defensive efforts given the city’s proximity to the front. The reality, he says, was messy and complex, but the Allied aim was simple: to do whatever was necessary to end the war quickly and reduce Allied casualties to the greatest possible degree. There were 21,271 registered civilian burials according to German records—a horrendous figure in its own right, but nothing approaching those pro- vided
