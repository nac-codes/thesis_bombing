ied casualties to the greatest possible degree. There were 21,271 registered civilian burials according to German records—a horrendous figure in its own right, but nothing approaching those pro- vided in many postwar works.122  Sebastian Cox has also made clear how important Dresden was to the German war effort. By 1944, it was a major industrial, logistical, and administrative center whose importance grew as the Red Army drew nearer. Cox’s examination of Bomber Command intelligence for Dresden is particularly revealing. The city dossier’s intelligence proved woefully outdated, showing only 13 major factories when there were in fact 127. How Bomber Command’s Intelligence Directorate missed this buildup between 1941 and 1945 is difficult to understand given Dresden’s 1941 ranking as 20th of Germany’s 100 major industrial towns. By 1945, had intelligence kept up and in view of the city’s vital position astride the Red Army line of advance, its position would have been much higher. Dresden, Cox concluded, was indeed a vital military target, and the bombing must be viewed in this context and with an understanding that the Grand Alliance wanted the war to end as quickly as pos- sible, before the German “wonder weapons” or some other reverse dragged it out even further.1%  The debate continues today—and it will likely not end anytime soon.  Collapse of Germany’s Military Operations and War Economy  As these raids developed, aircrews knew their efforts had already reduced production of finished POL products for January to 365,000 tons (27 percent of preattack capacity), and of gasoline and aviation fuel to 100,000 tons (19 percent of preattack total).1° For the week ending 12 February, there were sixteen major raids, including five on oil plants, seven on refineries, and four on depots. A last Bomber Command night precision raid, on Pélitz by 475 Lancasters dropping 1,657 tons of bombs, demolished what was left of it.1°  Recent intelligence based on analysis of fuel in cap
