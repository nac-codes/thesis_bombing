A last Bomber Command night precision raid, on Pélitz by 475 Lancasters dropping 1,657 tons of bombs, demolished what was left of it.  Recent intelligence based on analysis of fuel in captured vehicles on the Western Front showed a heavy use of benzol as a motor fuel and a 15 percent alcohol blend in gasoline. Indeed, German gasoline now contained nearly 70 percent benzol. A SHAEF G-2 report, calling for a relentless attack on benzol plants and fuel depots now that key gasoline producers were out of commission, noted:  Despite the fact that we are now nearing the end of winter it cannot be said that the enemy’s fuel situation has been allowed to recover; instead the overall position is worse now than at any time previously. ...In fact the situation is currently worse than it has ever been; and it is no exaggeration to say that were operations to become mobile, the enemy would be helpless; being saved only by terrain and mud.1%  At the end of February, the CSTC added another twenty small benzol producers in western Germany to its target list.4° Because fuel production was not likely to top 40,000 to 50,000 tons per month after January, attacks on benzol plants were vital because they were now the Germans’ last source of fuel.1% Another study showed even a small benzol plant producing 500 tons (120,000 gallons) per month provided enough fu
