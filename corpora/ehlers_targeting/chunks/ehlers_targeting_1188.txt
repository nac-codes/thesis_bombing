s on benzol plants were vital because they were now the Germans’ last source of fuel.1% Another study showed even a small benzol plant producing 500 tons (120,000 gallons) per month provided enough fuel to move a fullstrength Panzer Grenadier division 247 miles. Benzol resisted freezing to 0 degrees Fahrenheit, worked well with up to 40 percent alcohol content, had excellent antiknock characteristics, and did not require the addition of tetraethyl lead, a rare commodity in the Reich. Another report confirmed the Germans could use 100 percent raw benzol as a motor fuel if necessary.12%  As attacks on benzol plants went into high gear, the CSTC concluded definitively that transportation attacks designed to interdict the movement of coal were having a disastrous impact on Germany’s war economy—something it could have confirmed four months earlier, had it paid closer attention to available intelligence. In late January, it turned Allied energies in this direction. Heavy attacks on transportation targets, they said, would make more difficult “the immense task of re-orienting hard coal supplies from the Ruhr following the loss of the only other substantial source in Upper Silesia.”192  As had been the case all along, SHAEF G-2 pushed the hardest for transportation attacks specifically to impede the movement of coal. A 19 February report said:  Present evidence clearly indicates that the enemy’s overall transportation situation is rapidly worsening as a result of bombing, loss of Silesian hard coal and the dislocation caused by the eco- nomic readjustment necessary as a result of the loss of Silesian industry, the biggest single blow to the German economy since the war began. ... There seems to be little doubt therefore that the entire enemy industrial output is in grave jeopardy as a result of increasing inability of the enemy’s communications, especially those leading to the Ruhr, to meet the demands made upon them. It seems, therefore, all the more urgent that as much e
