rdy as a result of increasing inability of the enemy’s communications, especially those leading to the Ruhr, to meet the demands made upon them. It seems, therefore, all the more urgent that as much effort as possible should be directed as soon as possible against the Ruhr communications.42  Because Ruhr railways, canals, and coal mines were now more vital than ever, the CSTC recommended, and Bottomley and Spaatz approved, giving the attack of Ruhr transportation targets higher priority than any other targets except oil 144  The CSTC, in accord with SHAEF G-2, built target lists to disrupt coal shipments. Significantly, the minutes of a 21 February meeting noted, “Mr. Lawrence [of the Ministry of Economic Warfare] considered that the whole economic situation had changed recently in view of the loss to the Germans of Silesian industries, oil and coal. If we could prevent the transportation of coal from the Ruhr, all organized rail operations elsewhere in Germany might be rendered impossible in a few weeks’ time.”12 By the following week, the CSTC concluded it might be possible to reduce traffic between the Ruhr and the rest of Germany to 25 percent of preattack levels.11# Ironically, disruption of coal shipments was already severe because of the long-standing focus on targets in the Ruhr, whether as part of the oil offensive, the transportation campaign, or city bombing (another crucial impact of city bombing rarely mentioned in scholarly works). Also, and of central importance, by this point the Ger- man fuel position was so bad that it no longer mattered how many tanks, trucks, and aircraft German factories turned out.  Transportation attacks accelerated in late winter and early spring. Ruhr coal exports dropped from 2,500,000 tons per month in March 1944 to at most 1,000,000—and probably only 500,000—by March 1945. Bomber Command's elite groups had again knocked out the Dortmund-Ems canal. In the meantime, the 11th Panzer Division started a move from Trier to Colo
