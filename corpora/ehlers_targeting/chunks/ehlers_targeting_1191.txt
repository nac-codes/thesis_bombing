Despite the fact that we are now nearing the end of winter it cannot be said that the enemy’s fuel situation has been allowed to recover; instead the overall position is worse now than at any time previously. ...In fact the situation is currently worse than it has ever been; and it is no exaggeration to say that were operations to become mobile, the enemy would be helpless; being saved only by terrain and mud.12  At the end of February, the CSTC added another twenty small benzol producers in western Germany to its target list.12 Because fuel production was not likely to top 40,000 to 50,000 tons per month after January, attacks on benzol plants were vital because they were now the Germans’ last source of fuel.4°? Another study showed even a small benzol plant producing 500 tons (120,000 gallons) per month provided enough fuel to move a fullstrength Panzer Grenadier division 247 miles. Benzol resisted freezing to 0 degrees Fahrenheit, worked well with up to 40 percent alcohol content, had excellent antiknock characteristics, and did not require the addition of tetraethyl lead, a rare commodity in the Reich. Another report confirmed the Germans could use 100 percent raw benzol as a motor fuel if necessary.1°%  As attacks on benzol plants went into high gear, the CSTC concluded definitively that transportation attacks designed to interdict the movement of coal were having a disastrous impact on Germany’s war economy—something it could have confirmed four months earlier, had it paid closer attention to available intelligence. In late January, it turned Allied energies in this direction. Heavy attacks on transportation targets, they said, would make more difficu
