rlier, had it paid closer attention to available intelligence. In late January, it turned Allied energies in this direction. Heavy attacks on transportation targets, they said, would make more difficult “the immense task of re-orienting hard coal supplies from the Ruhr following the loss of the only other substantial source in Upper Silesia.”102  As had been the case all along, SHAEF G-2 pushed the hardest for transportation attacks specifically to impede the movement of coal. A 19 February report said:  Present evidence clearly indicates that the enemy’s overall transportation situation is rapidly worsening as a result of bombing, loss of Silesian hard coal and the dislocation caused by the eco- nomic readjustment necessary as a result of the loss of Silesian industry, the biggest single blow to the German economy since the war began. ... There seems to be little doubt therefore that the entire enemy industrial output is in grave jeopardy as a result of increasing inability of the enemy’s communications, especially those leading to the Ruhr, to meet the demands made upon them. It seems, therefore, all the more urgent that as much effort as possible should be directed as soon as possible against the Ruhr communications.U2 Because Ruhr railways, canals, and coal mines were now more vital than ever, the CSTC recommended, and Bottomley and Spaatz approved, giving the attack of Ruhr transportation targets higher priority than any other targets except oil 144  The CSTC, in accord with SHAEF G-2, built target lists to disrupt coal shipments. Significantly, the minutes of a 21 February meeting noted, “Mr. Lawrence [of the Ministry of Economic Warfare] considered that the whole economic situation had changed recently in view of the loss to the Germans of Silesian industries, oil and coal. If we could prevent the transportation of coal from the Ruhr, all organized rail operations elsewhere in Germany might be rendered impossible in a few weeks’ time.”142 By the following wee
