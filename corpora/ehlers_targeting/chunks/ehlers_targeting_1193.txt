l and coal. If we could prevent the transportation of coal from the Ruhr, all organized rail operations elsewhere in Germany might be rendered impossible in a few weeks’ time.”142 By the following week, the CSTC concluded it might be possible to reduce traffic between the Ruhr and the rest of Germany to 25 percent of preattack levels.11# Ironically, disruption of coal shipments was already severe because of the long-standing focus on targets in the Ruhr, whether as part of the oil offensive, the transportation campaign, or city bombing (another crucial impact of city bombing rarely mentioned in scholarly works). Also, and of central importance, by this point the Ger- man fuel position was so bad that it no longer mattered how many tanks, trucks, and aircraft German factories turned out.  Transportation attacks accelerated in late winter and early spring. Ruhr coal exports dropped from 2,500,000 tons per month in March 1944 to at most 1,000,000—and probably only 500,000—by March 1945. Bomber Command's elite groups had again knocked out the Dortmund-Ems canal. In the meantime, the 11th Panzer Division started a move from Trier to Cologne, a distance of less than 100 miles, on 13 February. Because of heavy attacks on rail centers in both cities, it did not begin arriving until 27 February and was then committed piecemeal. Transportation attacks also contributed to serious ammunition shortages. And after nearly a year of concerted effort, heavy bombers destroyed the huge railroad viaduct at Bielefeld, over which much of the Ruhr’s coal and steel passed. The Germans built a single-track bypass, but the Allies kept it out of action.114  As the CSTC determined damage to transportation networks, German POWs added their insights. They confirmed the effectiveness of these raids and related numerous instances of long delays in rail movement. One said his unit’s move from the Sudetenland to Cologne (normally a two-day trip) took ten days. Another said trains from Heidelberg to
