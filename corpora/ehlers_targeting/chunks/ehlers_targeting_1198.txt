tever can be squeezed out of distributional stocks. Recent cover shows that efforts are being made to mobilize all such stocks. Experience of past attacks indicates that damage to the loading facilities at depots and to attendant pumping installations and pipe lines may effectively deny use of POL contained in them for some days or even a few weeks irrespective of the oil destroyed in tanks and loaded wagons.442  The final phase of the oil offensive thus focused on denying German armies remaining distributional stocks of gasoline at depots, which further accelerated the already rapid German collapse. One indication of this collapse was the 2 March supply report of the Seventh Army’s quartermaster general, which said the army’s three operational corps had 0.15 fuel consumption units, enough to travel 7 miles. This was the fuel position as the U.S. Third Army made its breakthrough to and across the Rhine. A SHAEF report said, “Immobility through lack of fuel was undoubtedly a big factor in the de- feat of the Seventh Army” as German units were surrounded and forced to surrender once they ran out of fuel in the offensive’s opening days.122  By April, with the capture of the Ruhr, benzol production collapsed, and with it went the last vestiges of the German army’s mobility. A JIC report said the lack of fuel was now the driver in German army operations:  The effects of the fuel shortages which have been imposed upon the enemy’s land forces, while somewhat obscure when the western front was stable, have emerged as a major factor in the present phase of mobile warfare. The success of the Allied advances on the western front must be attributed largely to the enemy’s lack of fuel which has not only prevented him competing in mobility and achieving any coordinated resistance, but has practically denied him the use against our spearheads of the considerable air forces still at his disposal.424  Page 323 of 423 76%  next week brougnit oll output to an all-time low.
