Froduction estimates ror March were 25U,0U00 tons of renned products (16.5 percent of preattack), Of wnicn only 50,00U tons was gasoline (9.5 percent of preattack).142 The CSTC said,  In view of the success of the attack on [fuel] production the bulk of the enemy’s inadequate supplies in the critical phase of mobile warfare now commencing will consist of whatever can be squeezed out of distributional stocks. Recent cover shows that efforts are being made to mobilize all such stocks. Experience of past attacks indicates that damage to the loading facilities at depots and to attendant pumping installations and pipe lines may effectively deny use of POL contained in them for some days or even a few weeks irrespective of the oil destroyed in tanks and loaded wagons.142  The final phase of the oil offensive thus focused on denying German armies remaining distributional stocks of gasoline at depots, which further accelerated the already rapid German collapse. One indication of this collapse was the 2 March supply report of the Seventh Army’s quartermaster general, which said the army’s three operational corps had 0.15 fuel consumption units, enough to travel 7 miles. This was the fuel position as the U.S. Third Army made its breakthrough to and across the Rhine. A SHAEF report said, “Immobility through lack of fuel was undoubtedly a big factor in the de- feat of the Seventh Army” as German units were surrounded and forced to surrender once they ran out of fuel in the offensive’s opening days.122  By April, with the capture of the Ruhr, benzol production collapsed, and with it went the last vestiges of the German army’s mobility. A JIC report said the lack of fuel was now the driver in German army operations:  The effects of the fuel shortages which have been imposed upon the enemy’s lan
