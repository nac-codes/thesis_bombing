vestiges of the German army’s mobility. A JIC report said the lack of fuel was now the driver in German army operations:  The effects of the fuel shortages which have been imposed upon the enemy’s land forces, while somewhat obscure when the western front was stable, have emerged as a major factor in the present phase of mobile warfare. The success of the Allied advances on the western front must be attributed largely to the enemy’s lack of fuel which has not only prevented him competing in mobility and achieving any coordinated resistance, but has practically denied him the use against our spearheads of the considerable air forces still at his disposal.124  This same problem had existed on the Eastern Front since July 1944. The war there was mobile, with few exceptions, and from that point forward the lack of fuel was disastrous.  Intelligence Analyses: Determining Bombing’s Results  By 17 April, the CSTC estimated German production of finished POL products for the month would be no more than 100,000 tons (7.5 percent of preattack total), of which only 20,000 tons would be fuel (4 percent of pre-attack total). Its weekly report closed with the statement that “the strategic attack of oil has been virtually completed.”122 By the CSTC’s 2 May meeting, enough German records, POWs, and oil plant managers had surfaced to confirm that the damage-assessment process had been exceptionally accurate. German records varied for only one installation: the Eurotank crude oil refinery.122  This note of triumphant closure was absent for the transportation offensive. The key problem here was the intelligence organization’s failure to grasp fully the devastation inflicted on railroads and waterways. The whipsaw effect caused by bombers attacking three classifications of transportation targets (tactical, operational, and military-strategic) also complicated intelligence analyses. Thus, bomber crews were never able to focus exclusively on targets chosen specifically to collapse German
