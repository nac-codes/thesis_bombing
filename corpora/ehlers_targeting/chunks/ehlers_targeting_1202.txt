ce produced a report entitled “Air Attack on the German Inland Communications System.” Although it incorporated a few German sources, it was based largely on what intelligence specialists knew during the campaign. It thus provides a useful analytical tool. It confirmed that the transport situation in Germany deteriorated rapidly from spring 1944, as locomotives and rolling stock were lost in large numbers in the west and east due to Allied bombing and the Russian advance. Concerted raids on Ruhr transportation networks began in May 1944 and continued with increasing ferocity until April 1945. These complemented attacks in support of OVERLORD. By July, raids on French and Belgian marshaling yards caused a 10 percent decrease in circulation of rolling stock in western Germany. Monthly allocation of rolling stock in Saarbriicken fell from 169,000 wagons in July to 51,000 in October, and the number of wagons for the Saar coal trade dropped from 5,000 to 1,100. As attacks continued into October, allocations of rolling stock to the Cologne rail district fell 66 percent, from 205,000 wagons in August to 69,000 in October. These results, duplicated at most rail centers in western Germany, played havoc with coal shipments.124  Attacke an inland wratarurave hacinnina in lata Cantamhar nradiucad tha cama raculte urhich hacama avidant immadiataly tn intalliaanca enarialicte Tha Nartmiund_Eme and Mittalland eanale urara  Page 323 of 423 76%  ———_— a ea ee ee ae oe eee ee ee a Oe ee ee ee eee ee eee ee  7 miles. This was the fuel position as the U.S. Third Army made its breakthrough to and across the Rhine. A SHAEF report said, “Immobility through lack of fuel was undoubtedly a big factor in the de- feat of the Seventh Army” as German units were surrounded and forced to surrender once they ran out of fuel in the offensive’s opening days.122 By April, with the capture of the Ruhr, benzol production collapsed, and with it went the last vestiges of the German army’s mobility.
