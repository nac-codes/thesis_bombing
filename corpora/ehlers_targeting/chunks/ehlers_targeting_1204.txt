grasp fully the devastation inflicted on railroads and waterways. The whipsaw effect caused by bombers attacking three classifications of transportation targets (tactical, operational, and military-strategic) also complicated intelligence analyses. Thus, bomber crews were never able to focus exclusively on targets chosen specifically to collapse German coal shipments. The demands of the ground war precluded the kind of focus in this transportation plan as had existed in the attack on oil.  During one of their final meetings, CSTC members finally seemed to grasp the enormity of the problem they had faced in assessing the effectiveness of transportation attacks. “Transportation,” they said, “was a target system of a special type; the results of attacks upon this system were particularly difficult to measure quantitatively.”24 This realization does not exonerate the CSTC’s failure to gauge the effectiveness of transportation attacks and to keep those attacks focused on disrupting coal shipments. It does, however, reflect the underlying realities of the broader demands that were necessar- ily placed on transportation attacks.  Nevertheless, transportation attacks, especially against rail centers and canals, almost always resulted in reduced coal shipments and war production. Although this was somewhat clear to intelli- gence specialists, the success of the transportation campaign against the Reich, unlike the oil offensive, became entirely clear only after VE Day.  Although intelligence analysts had a general idea of the damage done to railroads and waterways, they did not perceive several developments that would have revealed the full extent of the catastrophe befalling German transportation networks by late 1944. To understand how shortcomings in the intelligence effort concealed the extent of the damage, we must look at what the Allies knew—or did not know—they had accomplished.  Just after VE Day, the British foreign office produced a report entitled “Air Attack on
