extent of the damage, we must look at what the Allies knew—or did not know—they had accomplished.  Just after VE Day, the British foreign office produced a report entitled “Air Attack on the German Inland Communications System.” Although it incorporated a few German sources, it was based largely on what intelligence specialists knew during the campaign. It thus provides a useful analytical tool. It confirmed that the transport situation in Germany deteriorated rapidly from spring 1944, as locomotives and rolling stock were lost in large numbers in the west and east due to Allied bombing and the Russian advance. Concerted raids on Ruhr transportation networks began in May 1944 and continued with increasing ferocity until April 1945. These complemented attacks in support of OVERLORD. By July, raids on French and Belgian marshaling yards caused a 10 percent decrease in circulation of rolling stock in western Germany. Monthly allocation of rolling stock in Saarbriicken fell from 169,000 wagons in July to 51,000 in October, and the number of wagons for the Saar coal trade dropped from 5,000 to 1,100. As attacks continued into October, allocations of rolling stock to the Cologne rail district fell 66 percent, from 205,000 wagons in August to 69,000 in October. These results, duplicated at most rail centers in western Germany, played havoc with coal shipments.125  Attacks on inland waterways, beginning in late September, produced the same results, which became evident immediately to intelligence specialists. The Dortmund-Ems and Mittelland canals were rendered unusable until early November, after which the Germans could only move a few days’ worth of raw materials and supplies by water before the next round of attacks closed them again. At- tacks on canal locks and aqueducts kept river traffic at a low level after September. Barge traffic dropped from 24,000 tons per day in the preattack period to an average of 4,500 tons.12®  Heavy attacks on transportation networks bega
