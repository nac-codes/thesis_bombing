kept river traffic at a low level after September. Barge traffic dropped from 24,000 tons per day in the preattack period to an average of 4,500 tons.12®  Heavy attacks on transportation networks began in November. Before this, most damage to railroads in western Germany was caused by missions flown for operational and tactical purposes. Then, attacks on railroads and inland waterways for military-strategic purposes began in earnest. Speer’s 11 November report to Hitler heralded the transportation crisis in the Ruhr. He said coal could no longer be moved, produced, or stockpiled at factories in sufficient quantities.122  The first month’s attacks reduced circulation of rolling stock in western Germany from 549,228 wagons in November to 394,802 in December, even though poor weather forced bomber crews to release all but 1,200 tons of the 18,000 dropped on marshaling yards using H2X.128 However, in December, the whipsaw effects discussed earlier reemerged as the Ardennes offensive absorbed most bombing sorties until mid-January 1945. Nevertheless, these further reduced rail traffic. In fact, attacks east of the Rhine ended organized rail shipments from the Saar and Cologne areas.122  As a result of transportation attacks, first in support of ground forces and once again for strategic purposes in January, wagon circulation in western German rail districts fell 67 percent, from 183,018 in November to 83,658 in December. For the Saarbriicken district, a crucial coal transshipment area, the figures were 53,822 and 17,223 tons. Consequently, coal production dropped from 290,000 to 45,000 tons. It plunged in early 1945, culminating by March in the collapse of Germany’s war economy. Too few trains arrived at the mines to cart away coal, so there was nowhere to store the mountains of ore piling up. This had a catastrophic effect on weapons production and movement of finished weapons, ammunition, fuel, and components.122 Intelligence specialists tracked these developments.  Th
