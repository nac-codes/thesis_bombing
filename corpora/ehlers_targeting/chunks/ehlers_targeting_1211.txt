Nevertheless, these further reduced rail traffic. In fact, attacks east of the Rhine ended organized rail shipments from the Saar and Cologne areas.122  As a result of transportation attacks, first in support of ground forces and once again for strategic purposes in January, wagon circulation in western German rail districts fell 67 percent, from 183,018 in November to 83,658 in December. For the Saarbriicken district, a crucial coal transshipment area, the figures were 53,822 and 17,223 tons. Consequently, coal production dropped from 290,000 to 45,000 tons. It plunged in early 1945, culminating by March in the collapse of Germany’s war economy. Too few trains arrived at the mines to cart away coal, so there was nowhere to store the mountains of ore piling up. This had a catastrophic effect on weapons production and movement of finished weapons, ammunition, fuel, and components.#“2 Intelligence specialists tracked these developments.  This disastrous turn of events extended to inland waterways. Destruction of the Miihlheim bridge over the Rhine at Cologne in early October rendered the river unusable to barge traffic for three months. Traffic passing through the Munster Locks on the Dortmund-Ems canal declined from 1,430,000 tons per month until September 1944 to 66,000 tons in February 1945, a decrease of 95.4 percent.421  By March, the wagon supply had fallen to one-eighth that of July 1944, deliveries of hard coal to one-f
