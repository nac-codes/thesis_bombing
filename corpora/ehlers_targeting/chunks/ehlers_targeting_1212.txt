per month until September 1944 to 66,000 tons in February 1945, a decrease of 95.4 percent.421  By March, the wagon supply had fallen to one-eighth that of July 1944, deliveries of hard coal to one-fifth, of brown coal to one-half, and of steel production to one-fifth. This led to failures in delivery of components for final weapons assembly and severe disruptions in the movements of weapons, ammunition, and fuel.1#2 The air intelligence organization clearly recognized these developments.  German records, some of which became available during the war via Ultra intercepts, also underscored the extent of economic and military catastrophes caused by transportation attacks. In fact, they indicated transportation attacks harmed the war effort even more seriously than either wartime damage assessments or early postwar studies indicated. Albert Speer’s wartime correspondence confirmed this.  Speer, who placed the transportation offensive second only to oil attacks in its effects on the German war effort, bombarded Hitler and other Nazi leaders with memos detailing damage inflicted and consequences for war production. In a note to Hitler on 5 October 1944, Speer noted that in September 1943, 19,900 coal wagons moved daily in the Ruhr area. The figures for 3 and 4 October 1944 were 8,700 and 7,700 wagons, respectively. This was due entirely to air attacks and meant coal stocks at industrial plants would run out in eight to twelve weeks. The result by winter would be “an extraordinarily severe coal and consequently a production crisis.”144 A month later, Speer warned Reichsleiter Martin Bormann that “continued successful attacks on the transport system will result in a production catastrophe, which is of decisive importance to the continuance of the war.”424 Less than a week later, he told Hitler, “We are faced with the beginning of the most severe crisis in coal sup- ply since the beginning of the war.”125  Insufficient deliveries reduced the Reichsbahn’s coal stocks by 40,
