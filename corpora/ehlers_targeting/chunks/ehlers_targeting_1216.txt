fact, they indicated transportation attacks harmed the war effort even more seriously than either wartime damage assessments or early postwar studies indicated. Albert Speer’s wartime correspondence confirmed this.  Speer, who placed the transportation offensive second only to oil attacks in its effects on the German war effort, bombarded Hitler and other Nazi leaders with memos detailing damage inflicted and consequences for war production. In a note to Hitler on 5 October 1944, Speer noted that in September 1943, 19,900 coal wagons moved daily in the Ruhr area. The figures for 3 and 4 October 1944 were 8,700 and 7,700 wagons, respectively. This was due entirely to air attacks and meant coal stocks at industrial plants would run out in eight to twelve weeks. The result by winter would be “an extraordinarily severe coal and consequently a production crisis.”122 A month later, Speer warned Reichsleiter Martin Bormann that “continued successful attacks on the transport system will result in a production catastrophe, which is of decisive importance to the continuance of the war.”124 Less than a week later, he told Hitler, “We are faced with the beginning of the most severe crisis in coal sup- ply since the beginning of the war.”35  Insufficient deliveries reduced the Reichsbahn’s coal stocks by 40,000 tons per day. Electric power plants also saw a dramatic decrease, from 1,237,000 tons on 1 September to 865,000 tons on 28 September. Gasworks in the Ruhr had less than ten days’ supply, key ironworking plants were down to a three days’ supply, and many armament and food factories were on the point of stoppage. Speer warned: “For more than six weeks now the Ruhr has been virtually sealed off, to an increasing extent, from its markets through transport difficulties” while industrial coal stocks “will be exhausted by the end of November, unless a decided improvement in deliveries has been possible.”13&  Why, then, did coal shipments and the Reich’s war economy not collapse
