October 1944, at least 60 percent from November 1944 to January 1945, and 90 percent from February to April 1945. He concluded: “The extensive dispersal of industry had a definitely unfavorable effect on the transport situation, especially in consequence of the decline in the marshal- ling facilities.”444  Something similar happened with the movement of ammunition from factory to front, but the Allies also missed this. The root of the problem, disastrous by late 1944, lay in the tripartite division of ammunition production into components (for example, casings and fuses), explosives and propellants, and the processing of these goods into completed ammunition. Items were shipped to more than 100 army assembly and storage depots for processing, which was dependent on rail movement. As the transportation offensive went into high gear, this inefficient and vulnerable process began to fail. Dietrich Stahl, industrial director of Speer’s technical department, said the system, aside from extreme vulnerability to disruption by air attack, “only made more difficult the overall control, the introduction of rationalized working methods and uniform responsibility.”445 These organizational inefficiencies made bombing even more effective.145  General Buhle, OKW quartermaster general, said ammunition supplies deteriorated rapidly after June 1944 as a result of dramatically increased consumption, reduced production, and transporta- tion difficulties. He further noted that only 70 to 80 percent of components reached depots, and completed ammunition often failed to reach the front as a result of destruction or delay. Because of transportation attacks, ammunition trains often sat for weeks on railroad sidings after summer 1944. “The whole ammunition production,” Buhle concluded, “was seriously hit and crippled to such an extent that the armed forces could maintain only a very inadequate supply of ammunition.”142  A similar set of woes, also overlooked by intelligence specialists, aff
