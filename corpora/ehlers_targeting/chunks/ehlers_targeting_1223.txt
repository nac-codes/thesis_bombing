iously hit and crippled to such an extent that the armed forces could maintain only a very inadequate supply of ammunition.”142  A similar set of woes, also overlooked by intelligence specialists, affected the armaments industry. Again, a combination of heavy-bomber attacks and substandard production methods created severe problems moving finished heavy weapons to the front. Incredibly, they went by train to four locations: first to the ordnance depot for inspection and acceptance, then to the firing range for sighting, from there to the modifications depot for final improvements, and finally to the front. Transportation attacks played havoc with this process.1#8 The Germans finally streamlined this system, along with ammunition transport, in January 1945; but by then it was too late.142  The final indicator intelligence personnel missed was the German practice of giving 90 percent of new heavy weapons to newly formed units, which were appearing in droves by late 1944, mostly in the form of Volksgrenadier divisions. The remaining 10 percent went to veteran divisions at the front—in other words, to the most capable soldiers and the ones in greatest need. This ill-considered practice was a significant cause of decreasing combat effectiveness among Wehrmacht units after August 1944 and one exacerbated by transportation attacks. It was another example of friction brought on by logistical and policy failures: high-intensitv ground combat. which destroved heavy weapons at a prodigious pace: and bombing, which hindered deliverv of replacement weapons.422 In  Page 328 of 423 77%  up each item. There is, however, no indication that intelligence or British foreign office personnel ever recognized these important effects of transportation attacks.  Nor did they realize how significantly transportation attacks affected the Reich’s dispersed war industries. Postwar interrogations, however, made this clear. As we have seen, Bomber Command's city raids and 8th Air Force precision
