cantly transportation attacks affected the Reich’s dispersed war industries. Postwar interrogations, however, made this clear. As we have seen, Bomber Command's city raids and 8th Air Force precision attacks made a significant contribution to victory because they forced dispersal of industries in 1943 and 1944. Dr. Karl Otto Saur, who headed up Speer’s technical office, said this was the single most major impact of bombing in 1943 143 Hans Kehrl, head of Speer’s raw materials and planning departments, said unfulfilled production due to lack of transportation of raw materials and components for final assembly at centralized factories was about 25 percent from June to October 1944, at least 60 percent from November 1944 to January 1945, and 90 percent from February to April 1945. He concluded: “The extensive dispersal of industry had a definitely unfavorable effect on the transport situation, especially in consequence of the decline in the marshal- ling facilities.”144  Something similar happened with the movement of ammunition from factory to front, but the Allies also missed this. The root of the problem, disastrous by late 1944, lay in the tripartite division of ammunition production into components (for example, casings and fuses), explosives and propellants, and the processing of these goods into completed ammunition. Items were shipped to more than 100 army assembly and storage depots for processing, which was dependent on rail movement. As the transportation offensive went into high gear, this inefficient and vulnerable process began to fail. Dietrich Stahl, industrial director of Speer’s technical department, said the system, aside from extreme vulnerability to disruption by air attack, “only made more difficult the overall control, the introduction of rationalized working methods and uniform responsibility.”145 These organizational inefficiencies made bombing even more effective.14*  General Buhle, OKW quartermaster general, said ammunition supplies deteriora
