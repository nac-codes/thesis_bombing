have however been aimed at specific objectives on the outskirts of the city and much more concentrated destruction could have been achieved if an aiming point in the heart of the ‘Government quarter’ had been chosen.”+52 As originally conceived, THUNDERCLAP was designed to influence “the minds of high German political and military authorities to propose organised surrender rather than a prolongation of the war.”1*4 Inexplicably, everyone involved seemed to be out of touch with recent experience and reality. At the very least, they forgot three things: the Nazis were utterly fanatical, most of Berlin was built of stone and concrete (not the most combustible materials), and the city had numerous bunkers and air raid shelters.  In areasoned rebuttal on 1 August 1944, Bufton, always pushing for precision bombing, took the air staff paper to task, concluding that even with an all-out effort, the chances of forcing the govern- ment to capitulate were slim at best. Anyone who read existing damage reports—and Bufton did so, very carefully—could see many uncertainties and disappointments regarding morale bombing.4=2  Similarly, although he initially accepted THUNDERCLAP in concept, Spaatz later argued it was part of a British plan to implicate the USAAF in the morale issues surrounding city bombing. Berlin, he said, was a legitimate target under the right circumstances, but as he noted, “I personally believe that any deviation from our present policy, even for an exceptional case, will be unfortunate. There is no doubt in my mind that the RAF want very much to have the U.S. tarred with the morale bombing aftermath which we feel will be terrific.”4*5  Eisenhower proved more pragmatic. He was “always prepared to take part in anything that gives real promise to ending the war quickly.”1£2 On his orders, therefore, Spaatz told Doolittle to prepare 8th Air Force for a THUNDERCLAP attack on Berlin.448 He ultimately told Spaatz to hold the plan in reserve, apparently as a last-dit
