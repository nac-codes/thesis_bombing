Spaatz made his volte-face in January 1945, by which time he was an ardent supporter of THUNDERCLAP’s Berlin variant.1® Doolittle now had to apply common sense and question the need to bomb a city with no military targets anywhere near the aim point, which happened to be the city center. He reminded Spaatz: “The chances of terrorizing into submission, by merely an increased concentration  Page 331 of 423 78%  quarter’ had been chosen.”152 As originally conceived, THUNDERCLAP was designed to influence “the minds of high German political and military authorities to propose organised surrender rather than a prolongation of the war.”1*4 Inexplicably, everyone involved seemed to be out of touch with recent experience and reality. At the very least, they forgot three things: the Nazis were utterly fanatical, most of Berlin was built of stone and concrete (not the most combustible materials), and the city had numerous bunkers and air raid shelters.  In areasoned rebuttal on 1 August 1944, Bufton, always pushing for precision bombing, took the air staff paper to task, concluding that even with an all-out effort, the chances of forcing the govern- ment to capitulate were slim at best. Anyone who read existing damage reports—and Bufton did so, very carefully—could see many uncertainties and disappointments regarding morale bombing.15=  Similarly, although he initially accepted THUNDERCLAP in concept, Spaatz later argued it was part of a British plan to implicate the USAAF in the morale issues surrounding city bombing. Berlin, he said, was a legitimate target under the right circumstances, but as he noted, “I personally believe that any deviation from our present policy, even for an exceptional case, will be unfortunate.
