y also approved of the focus on oil. The most bizarre thing about HURRICANE I and II was the idea that using raids even more heavily concentrated in time and space would cause a German collapse. The Allies eventually canceled the little-used HURRICANE I and II directives on 19 January 1945. Why the planning, and even the notion underlying the plans themselves, ever went forward in the first place is perplexing 168  Even before CLARION, the last of the four all-out plans, morale bombing’s siren song continued. With the war dragging on into 1945 and casualties mounting at an alarming rate, the Allies looked once more at reviving THUNDERCLAP. Morley said, “That this operation is an attack on enemy morale needs no apology.”+® The following day Bufton relayed this appeal to Bottomley on the basis of the Russian advance and the possibility that combining that with an intensive bombardment of key cities could cause the German war effort to collapse. Bufton thought a heavy attack on Berlin, supple- mented by attacks on Breslau and Munich by 15th Air Force bombers, “would greatly increase the moral effect of both operations.” The Allies, he said, had to seize the psychological moment.122  Portal, who at this point appeared to be just about the last person in the chain of command with a steady hand on the tiller, demurred. “It is certainly not worth while,” he argued, “to undertake large  Page 331 of 423 78%  eeeEeEeeeeeeeEEeEeee—E———— eee ee eee —E—E——_eeEeEEeEeeEeEeEEEE eee ee ee ee eeeEeEeEeeEeeEee—eeee ee eeeeeeEeeeE— eee  Ina reasoned rebuttal on 1 August 1944, Bufton, always pushing for precision bombing, took the air staff paper to task, concluding that even with an all-out effort, the chances of forcing the govern- ment to capitulate were slim at best. Anyone who read existing damage reports—and Bufton did so, very carefully—could see many uncertainties and disappointments regarding morale bombing.1=*  Similarly, although he initially accepted THUNDERCLAP in concept,
