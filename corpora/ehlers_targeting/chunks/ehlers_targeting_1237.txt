sting damage reports—and Bufton did so, very carefully—could see many uncertainties and disappointments regarding morale bombing.1=*  Similarly, although he initially accepted THUNDERCLAP in concept, Spaatz later argued it was part of a British plan to implicate the USAAF in the morale issues surrounding city bombing. Berlin, he said, was a legitimate target under the right circumstances, but as he noted, “I personally believe that any deviation from our present policy, even for an exceptional case, will be unfortunate. There is no doubt in my mind that the RAF want very much to have the U.S. tarred with the morale bombing aftermath which we feel will be terrific.”42°  Eisenhower proved more pragmatic. He was “always prepared to take part in anything that gives real promise to ending the war quickly.” On his orders, therefore, Spaatz told Doolittle to prepare 8th Air Force for a THUNDERCLAP attack on Berlin.*8 He ultimately told Spaatz to hold the plan in reserve, apparently as a last-ditch effort to bring about Nazi surrender should Operation MARKET-GARDEN fail, but the plan went unexecuted until February 1945, and then in truncated form.1*2  Yet Spaatz and Bufton changed their minds about THUNDERCLAP despite sound reasons for their earlier opposition. In August, Bufton came out in support, arguing that if the operation shortened the war by even a few weeks, it would save thousands of soldiers.1®° This was a major departure from his long-held view that the destruction of precision targets was the path to victory. Morley gives us in-  sight into Bufton’s thinking when he noted in October 1944:  You will no doubt be surprised to hear Sydney B and myself proposing area bombing, but we believe the stage if [sic] set “just right.” Things are bad inside Germany and we are proposing true morale bombing, that is 2,000 tons of H.E. per square mile not 100 to 200 tons as of old containing 50% or more of incendiaries. . . . If we do not win this war in the next 60 or so days
