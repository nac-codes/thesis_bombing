ppeared to be just about the last person in the chain of command with a steady hand on the tiller, demurred. “It is certainly not worth while,” he argued, “to undertake large scale bombing of communications in the hope of delaying the West-East passage of German reinforcements to the Eastern Front.”121 However, he did agree that, subject to the proviso that oil and other key target systems continued to receive the required weight of effort, a major series of raids should strike Berlin, Dresden, Leipzig, and Chemnitz. Additional raids should also target “any other cities  uurhara a cavara hlit? urill nat any eareca canfician in tha avacuatian fram thea Pact hut urill alen hamnar tha mavamant af tranne Fram tha Wact "172  Page 334 of 423 79%  ene ee ee eee en ne en nee nee ene eee ee en eee eee ne ee ee ee en ne eee eee ene ee eee ee eee een ee ee nn nse ee nm een a ene nee ee ee eee Een eee ee I EN IIL DIE LILI OID  Ina reasoned rebuttal on 1 August 1944, Bufton, always pushing for precision bombing, took the air staff paper to task, concluding that even with an all-out effort, the chances of forcing the govern- ment to capitulate were slim at best. Anyone who read existing damage reports—and Bufton did so, very carefully—could see many uncertainties and disappointments regarding morale bombing.1=*  Similarly, although he initially accepted THUNDERCLAP in concept, Spaatz later argued it was part of a British plan to implicate the USAAF in the morale issues surrounding city bombing. Berlin, he said, was a legitimate target under the right circumstances, but as he noted, “I personally believe that any deviation from our present policy, even for an exceptional case, will be unfortunate. There is no doubt in my mind that the RAF want very much to have the U.S. tarred with the morale bombing aftermath which we feel will be terrific.”12®  Eisenhower proved more pragmatic. He was “always prepared to take part in anything that gives real promise to ending the war quickly.”1=
