USSTAF heavies would attack Ruhr oil plants while Bomber Command concentrated on “selected fully built-up areas in the Ruhr cities which had not as yet been appreciably damaged.”16° The aim was to bring Germany to collapse with massive doses of airpower. Again, morale was clearly a target.  On 13 October 1944, Spaatz and Harris received a directive to plan for HURRICANE I and II.1& A circumscribed version of HURRICANE I went forward against Duisburg on 14 and 15 October, and against Essen on 23 and 26 October. Although Bottomley pushed hard to have it called off, Spaatz became a strong supporter—ironic given his resistance to THUNDERCLAP until its final stages. Of course, Spaatz, Arnold, and other true believers were already thinking ahead to air force independence, so this may have been another case of political considerations trumping intelligence. However, Spaatz probably also approved of the focus on oil. The most bizarre thing about HURRICANE I and II was the idea that using raids even more heavily concentrated in time and space would cause a German collapse. The Allies eventually canceled the little-used HURRICANE I and II directives on 19 January 1945. Why the planning, and even the notion underlying the plans themselves, ever went forward in the first place is perplexing.168  Even before CLARION, the last of the four all-out plans, morale bombing’s siren song continued. With the war dragging on into 1945 and casualties mounting at an alarming rate, the Allies looked once more at reviving THUNDERCLAP. Morley said, “That this operation is an attack on enemy morale needs no apology.”1® The following day Bufton relayed this appeal to Bottomley on the basis of the Russian advance and the possibility that combining that with an intensive bombardment of key cities could cause the German war effort to collapse. Bufton thought a heavy attack on Berlin, supple- mented by attacks on Breslau and Munich by 15th Air Force bombers, “would greatly increase the moral effect
