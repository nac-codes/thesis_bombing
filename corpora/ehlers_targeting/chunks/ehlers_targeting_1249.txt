d cause the German war effort to collapse. Bufton thought a heavy attack on Berlin, supple- mented by attacks on Breslau and Munich by 15th Air Force bombers, “would greatly increase the moral effect of both operations.” The Allies, he said, had to seize the psychological moment.122  Portal, who at this point appeared to be just about the last person in the chain of command with a steady hand on the tiller, demurred. “It is certainly not worth while,” he argued, “to undertake large scale bombing of communications in the hope of delaying the West-East passage of German reinforcements to the Eastern Front.”121 However, he did agree that, subject to the proviso that oil and other key target systems continued to receive the required weight of effort, a major series of raids should strike Berlin, Dresden, Leipzig, and Chemnitz. Additional raids should also target “any other cities where a severe blitz will not only cause confusion in the evacuation from the East but will also hamper the movement of troops from the West.”122  The JIC supported Bufton’s view that the right moment had come for THUNDERCLAP, but not for morale reasons. Siding with Portal, it said the operation would assist the Russian offensive by creating confusion, interfering with reinforcement of the Eastern Front, and confounding the German military and administrative machinery. This was the one instance when intelligence specialists made a clear recommendation, and in this case it was sound. The raids went forward, with the primary aim being to assist the Russian advance, but there was no association with THUNDERCLAP, which faded into obscurity after this last great debate.  CLARION proceeded on 22-23 February 1945 to destroy huge numbers of smaller transportation targets all over Germany, increasing the general level of chaos and bringing about a railroad work stoppage. Eisenhower had originally asked for the operation to support ground forces, and Spaatz was a proponent, but he cautioned Arnold that h
