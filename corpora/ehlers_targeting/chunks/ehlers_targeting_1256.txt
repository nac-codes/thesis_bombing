CLARION became nothing more than an attack on transportation, concentrated in time, with over 1,000 heavy bombers and thousands of smaller aircraft wreaking havoc on the German railroad network. The operation worked as well as could be ex- pected, delaying rail movements toward the American advance around Cologne, but it was no war ender.

Of this total, the United States Army Air Forces dropped 1,461,864 (54.2 percent) and the RAF 1,235,609 (45.8 percent).+ Bomber crews flew more than 1,400,000 sorties escorted by fighter pilots flying another 2,680,000. At its peak, the air armada carrying the war to the Reich comprised more than 28,000 aircraft. The costs for Germany were staggering: 3,600,000 dwellings—20 percent of the total—were destroyed. Over 300,000 civilians were killed and another 780,000 wounded. The numbe
