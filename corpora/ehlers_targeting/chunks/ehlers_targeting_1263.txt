effort paid huge dividends in discerning, targeting, and assessing damage to oil and transportation assets, the Reich's most vital target sets. Air intelligence produced insights required to facilitate increasingly effective bombing. To use a biological analogy, if heavy bombers, aerial munitions, and aircrews provided the muscle, bone, and tendons, and if the airmen commanding them represented the brain, then air intelligence provided the senses—sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste—upon which brain and body depended. Without effective air intelligence, bombing would have been notably less effective. The thousands of air intelligence personnel and the intellectual infrastructure within which they worked played an integral role in the transportation and oil campaigns and in the earlier effort to gain air supremacy in Europe. Without them, these campaigns could not have been brought to such success- ful conclusions.  Only a small percentage of total bomb tonnage hit vital components within oil and transportation target sets, but it was enough to destroy both in the fourteen months from the start of the transportation offensive in France and Belgium to VE Day. This pummeling undermined the German war effort at the tactical, operational, and military-strategic levels by making it increasingly difficult, and ultimately impossible, for the Wehrmacht to mass and maneuver. Nevertheless, the air intelligence effort was far from perfect. But we cannot help but be impressed by the effectiveness of air intelligence in the aggregate. It achieved its highest resolution in assessing the attack on oil, a bounded target set extremely well suited to concerted heavy-bomber attacks. The damage-assessment process for transportation attacks on French and Belgian railroads and canals was somewhat less effective. Here again, the nature of the target set proved crucial. It was more diverse than the German oil industry but more bounded than the Reich’s extremely complex transportation networ
