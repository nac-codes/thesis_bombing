intel’s proudest moment.  But taken as a whole, these agencies performed well, and they contributed much more than assessments of bombing’s effects and effectiveness. They also helped plan air campaigns and, through the Combined Strategic Targets Committee (CSTC) and its predecessors, made targeting recommendations that were based on damage reports. This ability to make reasoned and, on the whole, accurate judgments was at the core of the organizational, technological, and procedural prowess comprising the mature air intelligence organization. This capability, born of necessity but built on Anglo-Ameri- can rationalist, scientific, capitalist, and ideological foundations, gave airmen the insights required to direct heavy bombers to lucrative targets.  This ability to engage those targets most likely to undermine the German war effort became clear with the assault on the Luftwaffe—Operation ARGUMENT—which continued without letup until VE Day. It came into sharper focus with the transportation campaign against French and Belgian targets. The influence of expert advisors such as Professor Zuckerman and Mr. Brant, and of particularly capable airmen such as Tedder and Spaatz, on campaign planning and execution was obvious.  Several strengths become evident when we look at this campaign. The first was the dual role played by targeting and damage assessments. Had either one been found wanting, the offensive might have failed. The Germans exploited loopholes created by occasional weaknesses in the Allied targeting effort, most notably the failure to attack canals and barge traffic from the outset. Despite the time- consuming process involved in marching combat divisions to the canals, loading equipment and troops on barges, and then unloading and marching to the front once they were across the Seine and Loire, the Germans moved many men and supplies into Normandy this way. It took Special Air Service and Maquis teams on the ground to recognize what was happening, and the i
