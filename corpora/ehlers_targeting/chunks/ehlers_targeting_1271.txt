owder production peaked at 26,000 tons in April 1944 and declined steeply from there, just as consumption reached nearly 40,000 tons per month in summer and fall. If the precipitous decrease in nitrogen production was a second-order effect of oil attacks, the rapid drop in powder, which relied on nitrogen production, was a third-order effect, and ammunition shortages, which grew steadily worse after summer 1944, were a fourth-order effect also attributable to increasing transportation woes.2 Total explosives production also dropped precipitously, from 55,000 tons in June 1944 to 20,000 by February 1945.2  Despite the complementary relationship among oil raids, reductions in explosives and ammunition production, and the disruption in deliveries due to transportation attacks, the Allies arguably should have targeted the powder and explosives industry in addition to oil, rather than as an adjunct. There were thirty-five large explosives and propellant plants, seven of which produced 70 percent of Germany’s output. Attacking them in conjunction with oil plants would have robbed the Germans of raw materials and productive capacity to convert them into explosives and propellants. Had anybody at the Air Ministry read Tiverton’s plan for the destruction of such assets during the Great War, things might have been different. A postwar investigation showed these explosives and propellant plants were vulnerable to air attack and that it would have taken between six and nine months to restore badly damaged plants to full production.2 Speer emphasized after the war that such  Page 339 of 423 80%  outside civilian expertise to assist with targeting and damage assessment.  Finally, the transportation campaigns benefited immensely from the learning process forged by Zuckerman and Tedder. This institutional maturation allowed intelligence personnel to enhance damage assessments used during successive campaigns by comparing them with captured records, POW interrogations, and testimony
