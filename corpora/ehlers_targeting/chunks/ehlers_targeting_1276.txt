rn Germany.12  Given the Allies’ determination to destroy Germany’s oil industry, and with it the Wehrmacht’s ability to fight a war of maneuver, they put more than enough bombs on target. The results were catastrophic for aviation fuel production, which averaged 170,000 tons per month until April 1944. In June, it was 52,000 tons, in December 26,000, and in March 1945 zero. The figures were nearly as grim for gasoline production: 121,000 tons up to April 1944, 75,000 in June, 50,000 in December, and 39,000 in March 1945. As a result of the oil offensive and major combat operations, total stocks of finished petroleum, oil, and lubricants products dropped from 1,372,000 tons in April 1944 to 436,000 tons by January 1945. Gasoline made up only 120,000 tons of this, and there was  + fs,  Page 339 of 423 80%  Bombing Survey Oil Report concluded, “Bombing of the nitrogen industry was effective and decisive. It was a byproduct of the bombing of synthetic oil.”4 In a 30 August memo to the Fiihrer, Speer warned, “The effect on the entire chemical sector has become formidable as a result of these renewed [bomber] attacks, as the most severe shortages are becoming evident, not only in fuels, but also in various important fields of chemicals,” including methanol and nitrogen for ammunition production.*  Nitrogen production dropped from 80,000 tons in April 1944 to 19,000 tons in December and to nearly nothing by April 1945.6 Powder production peaked at 26,000 tons in April 1944 and declined steeply from there, just as consumption reached nearly 40,000 tons per month in summer and fall. If the precipitous decrease in nitrogen production was a second-order effect of oil attacks, the rapid drop in powder, which relied on nitrogen production, was a third-order effect, and ammunition shortages, which grew steadily worse after summer 1944, were a fourth-order effect also attributable to increasing transportation woes.? Total explosives production also dropped precipitously, from 55,
