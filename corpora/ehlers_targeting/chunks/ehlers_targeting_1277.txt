hortages, which grew steadily worse after summer 1944, were a fourth-order effect also attributable to increasing transportation woes.? Total explosives production also dropped precipitously, from 55,000 tons in June 1944 to 20,000 by February 1945.8  Despite the complementary relationship among oil raids, reductions in explosives and ammunition production, and the disruption in deliveries due to transportation attacks, the Allies arguably should have targeted the powder and explosives industry in addition to oil, rather than as an adjunct. There were thirty-five large explosives and propellant plants, seven of which produced 70 percent of Germany’s output. Attacking them in conjunction with oil plants would have robbed the Germans of raw materials and productive capacity to convert them into explosives and propellants. Had anybody at the Air Ministry read Tiverton’s plan for the destruction of such assets during the Great War, things might have been different. A postwar investigation showed these explosives and propellant plants were vulnerable to air attack and that it would have taken between six and nine months to restore badly damaged plants to full production.2 Speer emphasized after the war that such attacks would have produced “a standstill in powder and explosives manufacture.”12  Another oversight in the oil offensive was the failure to attack the only three plants making ethyl fluid, which was an indispensable component in aviation fuel. There was no substitute for these materials, the factories were highly vulnerable, and the Germans could not build new ones quickly because they were as complex and nearly as large as synthetic oil plants. None of the plants was ever bombed.#! The oil offensive knocked out aviation fuel production quickly but could have done so faster with raids on these plants.  Albert Speer noted another shortcoming in oil attacks during a postwar interview: “It was our good luck that you always gave us a little [more] time between atta
