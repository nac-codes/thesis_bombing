y dropped 191,256 tons on eighty-seven German oil-producing targets (sixteen hydrogenation plants, nine Fischer-Tropsch plants, forty refineries, and twenty-two benzol plants). They made a total of 273 raids comprising 61,712 sorties on synthetic oil plants alone between May 1944 and April 1945. It is also significant that Bomber Command crews flew 109 of these raids. Given the much greater bomb tonnage they delivered, the British deserve at least equal credit for the oil offensive’s success. The vital importance of Bomber Command’s contribution becomes even clearer when we consider accuracy. When bombing visually, 8th Air Force crews put 26.8 percent of their bombs within the grounds of oil plants and refineries. The figure dropped to 12.4 percent for part-visual and part-instrument bombing, and from there to 5.4 percent for blind bombing with H2X. Bomber Command crews placed 15.8 percent of their bombs on target using night precision techniques. Given the navigational instruments of the day, and considering the long distances to targets and the requirement for Pathfinder Force aircraft to mark them in overcast conditions, this was incredible accuracy, the effects of which were multiplied by the superior destructive capacities of British bombs. Finally, the short days and bad weather of fall and winter 1944-1945 meant only Bomber Command could destroy Bergius plants in central and eastern Germany.1=  Given the Allies’ determination to destroy Germany’s oil industry, and with it the Wehrmacht’s ability to fight a war of maneuver, they put more than enough bombs on target. The results were catastrophic for aviation fuel production, which averaged 170,000 tons per month until April 1944. In June, it was 52,000 tons, in December 26,000, and in March 1945 zero. The figures were nearly as grim for gasoline production: 121,000 tons up to April 1944, 75,000 in June, 50,000 in December, and 39,000 in March 1945. As a result of the oil offensive and major combat operations,
