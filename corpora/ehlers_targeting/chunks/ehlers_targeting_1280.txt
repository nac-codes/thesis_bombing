were nearly as grim for gasoline production: 121,000 tons up to April 1944, 75,000 in June, 50,000 in December, and 39,000 in March 1945. As a result of the oil offensive and major combat operations, total stocks of finished petroleum, oil, and lubricants products dropped from 1,372,000 tons in April 1944 to 436,000 tons by January 1945. Gasoline made up only 120,000 tons of this, and there was almost no aviation fuel.4® The importance of these drastically reduced production figures becomes clearer when we consider Speer’s comment that “the possible German production in 1944, excluding Roumania, would have been adequate to cover requirements. It would have guaranteed the mobility of the Army and Air Force.”/2 Combined with the 245,400 tons of lost production from Rumania, total losses from 1 April 1944 to 31 December 1944 were 2,489,000 tons, a quantity that, said Speer, would have met all German requirements for 1944. Viewed in this light, air intelligence specialists played a central role in speeding Germany’s defeat.  As for the effectiveness of transportation attacks against the Reich, any criticisms must take into account an issue of fundamental importance: until February 1945, and again from late March to VE Day, they were often focused on assisting the Allied ground advance, and appropriately so. CSTC minutes from an 8 November 1944 meeting noted that transportation attacks against the Reich from September to the start of the Ardennes offensive were designed to do this. They were also intended to provide the greatest possible assistance to ground operations on all fronts. Third in importance was exerting maximum pressure on German war production by attacking railroads and inland waterways. By 10 February 1945, the CSTC had developed a detailed plan for attacks on transportation  Page 342 of 423 81%  ee  hydrogenation plants were so extensive that our troops on the front could not be supplied with the necessary amount of fuel. Even without the supply from Ruma
