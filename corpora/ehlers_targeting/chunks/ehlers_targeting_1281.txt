Even without the supply from Rumania we would have been ina position to keep the troops supplied with fuel, possibly this material would have been a little scarce. Without the attacks we could have maintained a constant flow of fuel to the front.44  gf ee  Speer’s meaning here was clear and crucial. When oil attacks reduced fuel production and transportation attacks disrupted the distribution pipeline in late summer 1944, fuel supplies became unreliable and insufficient.4 Although Speer’s postwar comments were often self-serving, this one and the others in this chapter merely confirm what Allied air intelligence personnel already under- stood to be the case—a fact made abundantly clear in previous chapters.  Up to May 1944, heavy-bomber crews had dropped 509,206 tons of bombs on enemy targets, but only 5,670 (1.1 percent) on oil targets. From 12 May 1944 to 8 May 1945, they dropped 191,256 tons on eighty-seven German oil-producing targets (sixteen hydrogenation plants, nine Fischer-Tropsch plants, forty refineries, and twenty-two benzol plants). They made a total of 273 raids comprising 61,712 sorties on synthetic oil plants alone between May 1944 and April 1945. It is also significant that Bomber Command crews flew 109 of these raids. Given the much greater bomb tonnage they delivered, the British deserve at least equal credit for the oil offensive’s success. The vital importance of Bomber Command’s contribution becomes even clearer when we consider accuracy. When bombing visually, 8th Air Force crews put 26.8 percent of their bombs within the grounds of oil plants and refineries. The figure dropped to 12.4 percent for part-visual and part-instrument bombing, and from there to 5.4 percent for blind bombing with H2X. Bomber Command crews placed 15.8 percent of their bombs on target using night precisio
