.4 percent for part-visual and part-instrument bombing, and from there to 5.4 percent for blind bombing with H2X. Bomber Command crews placed 15.8 percent of their bombs on target using night precision techniques. Given the navigational instruments of the day, and considering the long distances to targets and the requirement for Pathfinder Force aircraft to mark them in overcast conditions, this was incredible accuracy, the effects of which were multiplied by the superior destructive capacities of British bombs. Finally, the short days and bad weather of fall and winter 1944-1945 meant only Bomber Command could destroy Bergius plants in central and eastern Germany.=  Given the Allies’ determination to destroy Germany’s oil industry, and with it the Wehrmacht’s ability to fight a war of maneuver, they put more than enough bombs on target. The results were catastrophic for aviation fuel production, which averaged 170,000 tons per month until April 1944. In June, it was 52,000 tons, in December 26,000, and in March 1945 zero. The figures were nearly as grim for gasoline production: 121,000 tons up to April 1944, 75,000 in June, 50,000 in December, and 39,000 in March 1945. As a result of the oil offensive and major combat operations, total stocks of finished petroleum, oil, and lubricants products dropped from 1,372,000 tons in April 1944 to 436,000 tons by January 1945. Gasoline made up only 120,000 tons of this, and there was almost no aviation fuel.® The importance of these drastically reduced production figures becomes clearer when we consider Speer’s comment that “the possible German production in 1944, excluding Roumania, would have been adequate to cover requirements. It would have guaranteed the mobility of the Army and Air Force.” Combined with the 245,400 tons of lost production from Rumania, total losses from 1 April 1944 to 31 December 1944 were 2,489,000 tons, a quantity that, said Speer, would have met all German requirements for 1944.
