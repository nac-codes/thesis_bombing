lost production from Rumania, total losses from 1 April 1944 to 31 December 1944 were 2,489,000 tons, a quantity that, said Speer, would have met all German requirements for 1944. Viewed in this light, air intelligence specialists played a central role in speeding Germany’s defeat.  As for the effectiveness of transportation attacks against the Reich, any criticisms must take into account an issue of fundamental importance: until February 1945, and again from late March to VE Day, they were often focused on assisting the Allied ground advance, and appropriately so. CSTC minutes from an 8 November 1944 meeting noted that transportation attacks against the Reich from September to the start of the Ardennes offensive were designed to do this. They were also intended to provide the greatest possible assistance to ground operations on all fronts. Third in importance was exerting maximum pressure on German war production by attacking railroads and inland waterways. By 10 February 1945, the CSTC had developed a detailed plan for attacks on transportation assets leading to and from the Ruhr.1£ The plan was approved at the air commanders’ conference on 18 February, largely as a result of Tedder’s efforts. This was perhaps late, as Mierzejewski has argued. However, this delay was in part the result of two unforeseen developments: the diversion of heavy bombers to interdiction attacks during the Ardennes offensive, and the subsequent effort to delay the movement of 6th SS Panzer Army from west to east. Again, one confronts the almost unbounded nature of the Reich’s transportation network as a target set.  Most German officers and civilians interrogated after the war said destruction of railroads and canals was the most important factor in Germany’s defeat. Only Albert Speer and Hermann Goring thought oil more important.12 However, several officials, including Generalfeldmarschall Erhard Milch and Speer himself, recognized that making such a choice was senseless in view of the
