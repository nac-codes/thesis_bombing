rmann Goring thought oil more important.12 However, several officials, including Generalfeldmarschall Erhard Milch and Speer himself, recognized that making such a choice was senseless in view of the degree to which transportation and oil raids were intertwined and complementary. Milch observed that “the decisive moment was relatively late; it happened when you started large-scale attacks on our synthetic oil plants simultaneously with attacks on our communications.”22 Synergy of effects between the two, appearing in vital and often unlooked-for effects on the German war effort, proved extremely sig- nificant in undermining it.  So, too, did Ultra—or its absence. Before the attacks on the Luftwaffe, oil, and transportation, only the former used Enigma regularly to communicate. However, when oil attacks began, and when bomb damage denied the Germans reliable alternate forms of communication, a relative trickle of Ultra intercepts regarding heavy-bomber effects turned into a torrent. Although this was slightly less so for transportation attacks, even the Reichsbahn’s leadership turned to Ultra, and the German army was constantly discussing transportation attacks via the Enigma cipher. However, Ultra absolutely could not have provided a comprehensive damage-assessment picture on its own. Only when combined with photointelligence-based products and technical-expert intelligence did it yield the kind of fidelity that came to be the norm by spring 1944.  Heavy Bombers and the War in Europe: A Counterfactual Analysis  Although we cannot know exactly how much these important intelligence and operations efforts shortened the war and Allied casualty lists, it is worthwhile to pose a counterfactual question. How much more difficult would it have been to defeat a Wehrmacht with adequate supplies of fuel, ammunition, and heavy weapons, able to concentrate and maneuver on a large scale, still ideologically  motivated, operating along much shorter front lines with good rail and ro
