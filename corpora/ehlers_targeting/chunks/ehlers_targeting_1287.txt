ically motivated, operating along much shorter front lines with good rail and road networks, and fighting to keep Allied armies from entering the Reich? The Allies would have prevailed, but the battle would have been longer and the costs much greater. Any effort to arrive at exact figures for numbers of Allied soldiers spared as a result of the transportation and oil campaigns, or the number of months by which bombing shortened the war, is fraught with imponderables. Yet we can engage in informal speculation based on what we know about the course of major campaigns during the war’s final year. In Normandy, the Allies and Germans each suffered about 200,000 casualties—a 1:1 loss ratio. In addition, the Germans had about 65,000 men captured before the Allied breakout. However, when they began running out of gasoline and the Allied breakout from Normandy followed, the Germans lost another 135,000 men captured between 25 July and 25 August.2! The final ratio was therefore 2:1.  When fuel shortages became pervasive and severe in the west, casualty ratios shifted dramatically in the Allies’ favor. During the Rhineland campaign, 8 February to 21 March 1945, 60,000 German men were killed and wounded, and another 290,000 were taken prisoner. The Allies suffered just over 60,000 casualties—a 5.8:1 casualty ratio. By this time, German heavy divisions in the west had between 0.15 and 0.35 fuel consumption units, enough to move perhaps 10 miles in dry terrain and 4 in mud. The encirclement of the Ruhr from 22 March to 18 April, in which fuel shortages were even more severe, resulted in nearly 400,000 German casualties, with 317,000 of those captured, while the Allies lost about 50,000 killed and wounded. The casualty ratio was thus 8:1. The majority of German losses were POWs compelled to give in when gasoline and ammunition ran out. Even without gasoline, however, the Germans exacted a heavy toll. Some 10,677 Americans died in action in Europe during April 1945, reminding us th
