the west, casualty ratios shifted dramatically in the Allies’ favor. During the Rhineland campaign, 8 February to 21 March 1945, 60,000 German men were killed and wounded, and another 290,000 were taken prisoner. The Allies suffered just over 60,000 casualties—a 5.8:1 casualty ratio. By this time, German heavy divisions in the west had between 0.15 and 0.35 fuel consumption units, enough to move perhaps 10 miles in dry terrain and 4 in mud. The encirclement of the Ruhr from 22 March to 18 April, in which fuel shortages were even more severe, resulted in nearly 400,000 German casualties, with 317,000 of those captured, while the Allies lost about 50,000 killed and wounded. The casualty ratio was thus 8:1. The majority of German losses were POWs compelled to give in when gasoline and ammunition ran out. Even without gasoline, however, the Germans exacted a heavy toll. Some 10,677 Americans died in action in Europe during April 1945, reminding us that a German army with gasoline and more ammunition would have been an extraordinarily dangerous foe even in 1945.22  A similar shift in casualty ratios occurred in the east, as German units, forced to fight too far forward and with too little gasoline as a result of Hitler’s stand-fast orders, the oil and transportation offensives, and poor logistical practices, were captured in much larger numbers from June 1944 to VE Day. Until June 1944, casualty ratios for major campaigns in the east were over 2:1 in the Germans’ favor. However, when the Red Army’s summer offensive began in June 1944, loss ratios began drawing even. They moved to about 1.4:1 and stayed there.? In the east, as in the west, casualty ratios shifted dramatically once the Germans began running out of gasoline and ammunition. German casualties also soared each time the Allies and the Red Army achieved breakouts that ended periods of static warfare and replaced them with fluid battles that used up the Wehrmacht’s increasingly limited supplies.  Despite these s
