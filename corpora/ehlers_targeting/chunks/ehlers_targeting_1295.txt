in France and Belgium, and the one against the Reich, were the most important of their kind. Planned and executed with the advance of Allied armies in mind, the latter was also designed to enhance the speed of the Red Army’s advance. Spaatz and Bufton championed bomber support to the Red Army in every bombing effort from early 1944 to VE Day. This was clearest in Spaatz’s efforts to gain Eisenhower’s approval for the oil offensive. When we recall that nearly all oil and fuel produced at Ploesti went to the Eastern Front, it becomes easier to understand how much the Red Army benefited from these attacks. What has remained hidden in the historical record, however, is the extent to which airmen sought to undermine transportation infrastructures in the Balkans specifically to aid the Red Army’s advance. As we have seen, by April 1944, Mediterranean Allied Air Forces planners had developed, at Spaatz’s behest, a transportation plan to assist the Red Army, and it proved very effective.  The success of the oil and transportation offensives made clear the vital role of air intelligence in allowing airmen to discern the importance of target sets, attack them with great effect, and assess with a high degree of accuracy bombing effectiveness. This targeting-bombing-assessment feedback loop rested on a variety of developments stretching back through the interwar period to the Great War. More than anything else, however, it relied on the emergence of a mature air intelligence organization during World War II. Despite occasional failures, this organization worked exceptionally well. Its major elements included a structure within which intelligence organizations, including Bletchley Park, routinely exchanged information and shared expertise; highly trained specialists; and superb reconnaissance aircraft, cameras, and film. Most important, however, were the experience and judgment that grew out of a long war in which intelligence personnel engaged in an iterative learning process.
