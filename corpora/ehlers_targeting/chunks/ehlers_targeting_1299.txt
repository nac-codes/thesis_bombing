See chapter 7, “The Aircraft Economies,” and chapter 8, “Science, Research and Intelligence.” The Allied ability to read Enigma messages also proved crucial for air intelligence. The best sources here include Lewin, Ultra Goes to War, and Kreis, Piercing the Fog.  8. The only other intelligence success of greater importance was the Allies’ breaking and exploitation of Enigma.  9. Keegan, “View from Kitty Hawk,” 3, 13.  Page 345 of 423 82%  WV CAL.

Its major elements included a structure within which intelligence organizations, including Bletchley Park, routinely exchanged information and shared expertise; highly trained specialists; and superb reconnaissance aircraft, cameras, and film. Most important, however, were the experience and judgment that grew out of a long war in which intelligence personnel engaged in an iterative learning process.  These qualities developed fully only within a mature interagency process in which all players worked, individually and institutionally, to place grand strategy and the greater good above partisan objectives.
