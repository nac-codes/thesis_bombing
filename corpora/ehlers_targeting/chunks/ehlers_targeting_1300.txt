cross agencies and organizations, and to deliver effectively coordinated analyses as a result. The most notable failures in this process, as we have seen, occurred precisely when Allied politicians, senior operational commanders, and intelligence specialists forgot or chose to ignore these truisms. There is a great deal for us to ponder in this. Nevertheless, the evidence presented in this study clearly demonstrates that air intelligence was the leading edge of the heavy-bomber cam- paigns that contributed so extensively to the defeat of Nazi Germany.

General Omar N. Bradley recognized the symbiosis among air, land, and naval forces, and also made clear his view—shared by the vast majority of Allied ground and air commanders—that airpower was not decisive in its own right, when he stated, “It is considered most significant for the course of the war that American military authorities consistently held the opinion that air attack was not of itself sufficient [to defeat Germany], and that air forces were only part of a rounded team.” See Bradley and Air Effects Committee, 12th Army Group, Effect of Air Power on Military Operations, 15 July 1945, 1, RG243/ E36/B191, NARA. Similarly, Air Chief Marshal Lord Tedder asserted, “In my view, air power . . . is interlocked with sea and land power, and all three are interdependent.” See Tedder, Air Power in War, 29-32.  4.
