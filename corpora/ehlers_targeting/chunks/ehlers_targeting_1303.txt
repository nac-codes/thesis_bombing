Chapter 2. The Great War and the Beginnings of Air Intelligence  1. Exceptions include the German Naval Air Service zeppelin campaign, 1915-1918, a minor French effort against industrial targets in Alsace-Lorraine in 1915, German bombing raids on London in 1917, and the Italian bombing of Vienna. The differences between strategic and tactical bombing are worth defining. Strategic bombing sought to weaken or undermine the enemy’s war effort by degrading its war industry, undermining morale, or both. Tactical bombing included attacks on targets both in and beyond the range of friendly artillery fire. The former is now known as close air support and the lat- ter as interdiction.  2. The Handley Page V/1500, of which three were in service by November 1918, had a range of 1,300 miles and a maximum bomb load of 7,500 pounds. See Barnes, Handley Page Aircraft since 1907, 47.  3.
