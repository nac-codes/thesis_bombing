bing sought to weaken or undermine the enemy’s war effort by degrading its war industry, undermining morale, or both. Tactical bombing included attacks on targets both in and beyond the range of friendly artillery fire. The former is now known as close air support and the lat- ter as interdiction.  2. The Handley Page V/1500, of which three were in service by November 1918, had a range of 1,300 miles and a maximum bomb load of 7,500 pounds. See Barnes, Handley Page Aircraft since 1907, 47.  3. The U.S. Air Force currently uses the term “operational assessment” to encompass bomb damage assessment and munitions effectiveness assessment. However, during World War II, “bomb damage assessment” (BDA) encompassed both. There was no consistent terminology during World War I.  4. Kennett, First Air War, 1914-1918, 47.  5.

Neither became widely available until 1918.  7.

One of the conundrums raised by the employment of bombers as long-range artillery was their greatly inferior accuracy. Bombers carried increasingly large munitions, but it was only with the deve
