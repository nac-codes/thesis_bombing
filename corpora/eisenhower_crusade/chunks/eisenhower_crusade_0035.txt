No better assignment than mine could have been asked by a professional soldier at a time when much of the world was already at war and the eventual involvement of the United statelMaily became more probable. In large part the troops of the 15th were either seasoned veterans who had been with the regiment in China before its 1938 return to the States, or volunteers who had recently enlisted; the officers were all professionals.  In case of war such outfits would be the bulwark of American defense and the spearhead of our retaliation, should there be a sudden attack on us.
