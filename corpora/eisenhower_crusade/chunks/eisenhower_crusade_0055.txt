These planes enabled our heavy and long-range artillery to gain an accuracy and quickness of adjustment previously restricted to the light guns within eyeshot of the target; and field commanders could get a grasp of the tactical situation—terrain, avenues of movement, concentrations of troops and artillery—almost as complete as in the eighteenth century, when the opposing commanders, from horseback or a hillock, could view all the regiments committed to battle.  At the end of the maneuvers I was promoted to the temporary grade of brigadier general.  October and November were as busy as the months preceding maneuvers. Measures to correct defects revealed in Louisiana were begun at the unit level; in many cases the return movement offered  Page 11 of 669 2%  nition from raulhead and depot to a constantly shifting front line. Advance planning, consequently, was thorough and intensive; as 1s always the case, it paid off.  “The essential effectiveness of supply,” General McNair, expert in the conduct and assessment of maneuvers, told the assembled staffs in a critique of the operations, “was an outstanding feature of the maneuvers. The magnitude of the problem alone was sufficient to warrant apprehension as to whether the troops would be supplied adequately.

His brilliance in this type of work was to bring him, long before the end of this war, the three stars of a lieutenant general.  Many of the military faults revealed in the maneuvers, General McNair believed, had their root
