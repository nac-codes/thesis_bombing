ps twenty minutes to describe all this, and then abruptly asked, “What should be our general line of action?”  I thought a second and, hoping I was showing a poker face, answered, “Give me a few hours.”  “All right,” he said, and I was dismissed.  Significantly and characteristically, he did not even hint at one of the most important factors in the problem: the psychological effects of the Philippine battle upon people in the United States and throughout the Pacific. Clearly he felt that anyone stupid enough to overlook this consideration had no business wearing the star of a brigadier general.
