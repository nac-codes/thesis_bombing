w Caledonia, and we had to make certain of the safety of Australia itself.  It seemed possible, though not probable, that the Netherlands Indies, in some respects the richest area in the world in natural resources, could be denied to the Japanese invader, who would soon be desperately in need of Indies oil to continue his offensives. Unless this could be done short-range fighter planes could not be flown into the Philippines; and fighter planes were vital to successful defense.  In spite of difficulties, risks, and fierce competition for every asset we had, a great nation such as ours, no matter how unprepared for war, could not afford cold-bloodedly to turn its back upon our Filipino wards and the many thousand Americans, troops and civilians, in the archipelago. We had to do whatever was remotely possible for the hapless islands, particularly by air support and by pro- viding vital supplies, although the end result might be no more than postponement of disaster. And we simply had to save the air life line through Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and Hawaii.  With these bleak conclusions I marched back to the Chief of Staff. “General,” I said, “it will be a long time before major reinforcements can go to the Philippines, longer than the garrison can hold out with any driblet assistance, if the enemy commits major forces to their reduction. But we must do everything for them that is humanly possible. The people of China, of the Philippines, of the Dutch East Indies will be watching us. They may excuse failure but they will not excuse abandonment. Their trust and friendship are important to us. Our base must be Australia, and we must start at once to expand it and to secure our communications to it. In this last we dare not fail. We must take great risks and spend any amount of money required.”  He merely replied, “I agree with you.” His tone implied that I had been given the problem as a check to an answer he had already reached. He added, “Do your best to save them.”
