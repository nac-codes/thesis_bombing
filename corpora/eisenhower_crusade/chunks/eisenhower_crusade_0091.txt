On the day of the Pearl Harbor attack numbers of our ships were en route to the Philippines with troops, planes, and supplies. The Navy counseled that they be ordered to return to the United States or seek refuge in Hawaii, since no one could be sure that the Japanese would not set up an interceptive net for them; those only a few days out of port did return. But the War Department insisted that one convoy of five ships— the Holbrook and the Republic, with 5,000 troops aboard, and the Meigs, Holstead, and Bloemfontein, loaded with equipment and supplies—be ordered to proceed with all possible speed to Australia./21 This was the beginning of the great base that was eventually to be General MacArthur’s launching platform for the liberation of the Philippines.  Reinforcement of this Australian base and the island steppingstones to it was a continuous process throughout the winter. By February 21 our overseas strength in officers and men exceeded 245,000, the largest concentrations being in the Pacific, where there were on that date 115,877, exclusive of 29,566 in Alaska and the Aleutians. In the Caribbean the garrisons by then numbered 79,095. In the European theater there were as yet only 3,785 officers and men, but two divisions were en route. The overseas garrisons of the Eastern Defense Command numbered 15,876, most of whom were in Iceland.l10!  Although at that time American forces were fighting only in the Philippines, there was literally almost no spot throughout the length and breadth of the continents and the oceans that did not present at least one problem for the planning staff of the War Department. In Alaska we were wide open to attack and there existed the definite possibility that the enemy might succeed in establishing himself in an Alaskan airfield, from which he could
