Fortunately for me, at this hectic time my youngest brother, Milton, and his wife, Helen, were living just outside Washington at Falls Church. During the weeks following my arrival in the War  Page 24 of 669 4%  On December 22, when the Pensacola Convoy arrived at Brisbane, we began the establishment of our Australian base.l8] This quick start was largely the result of accident.

The Navy counseled that they be ordered to return to the United States or seek refuge in Hawaii, since no one could be sure that the Japanese would not set up an interceptive net for them; those only a few days out of port did return.
