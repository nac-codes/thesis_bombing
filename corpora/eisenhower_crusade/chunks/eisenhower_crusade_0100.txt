We sent officers to Australia with money to hire, at no matter what fantastic prices, the men and ships needed to carry supplies into the islands and to smuggle them into the beleaguered garrison.[131  The man we sent to Australia to head up this particular effort was a former Secretary of War, Colonel, soon Brigadier General, Patrick J.

They went to Hawaii, the Fiji Islands, New
