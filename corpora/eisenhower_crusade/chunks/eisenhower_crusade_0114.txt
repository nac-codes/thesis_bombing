invasion had to take its initial form.  Plans for the future could not take priority over the needs of the day. In a desperate attempt to save the Netherlands Indies and Singapore, General Sir Archibald P. Wavell, in late December 1941, was sent to Java from India to become the first Allied commander in chief.|22| The directive for his organization was laboriously written in Washington by the Combined Chiefs of Staff, in the hope that out of unified effort might spring a miracle.

We found it necessary to go painstakingly into rights of appeal and scope of authority in operations and service organizations. Procedures to be followed if major differences should be encountered were a matter of concern. We had not yet come to appreciate fully the nature of an allied command.  No written agreement for the establishment of an allied command can hold up against nationalistic considerations should any of the contracting powers face disaster through support of the supreme commander’s decisions.
