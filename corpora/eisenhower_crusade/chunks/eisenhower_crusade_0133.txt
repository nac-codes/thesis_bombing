s an extremely energetic officer, one of our better attachés. After Rumania joined the Axis in November 1940, he had been interned and eventually transferred through a neutral port to the United States.  The Operations Division learned of his arrival and immediately called upon him for such information as he could provide. He was thoroughly convinced that the German military power had not yet been fully exerted and was so great that Russia and Great Britain would most certainly be defeated before the United States could intervene effectively. He believed that the Germans then had 40,000 combat airplanes in reserve, ready with trained crews to operate at any moment.

In the Operations Division we refused to give credence to Ratay’s information concerning the 40,000 operational airplanes. The German Army had just been halted in front of Moscow and we were convinced that no army possessing a weapon of this overwhelming strength would have withheld it merely because of a future plan for its use, particularly when its employment would have insured the destruction and capture of such an important objective as Moscow.

Postwar reports from Germany/2! show that, in the summer of 1941, Hitler was planning to employ only sixty divisions as an occupation force for conquered Russia. He planned to use a portion of the larg
