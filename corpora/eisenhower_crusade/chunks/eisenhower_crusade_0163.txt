paration would be overlooked. Always, in war, whether problems of tactics, strategy, or logistics are involved, concentration for positive, offensive purposes must be calculated in the light of minimum needs in areas where the enemy might damage us decisively. This meant that during January, February, and March 1942 basic strategic plans had to be drawn in cognizance of the irreducible requirements of the Southwest Pacific.  Among the United Nations, only America could produce great amounts of disposable reserves. Great Britain’s air force and, to a lesser extent, her ground and sea forces were largely pinned down to the defense of her home country, a base that had to be protected at all costs if ever any offensive action was to be undertaken across northern Europe. Britain’s war effort was already creating a definite strain on her manpower, and only by resorting to the conscription of women was she able to meet her commitments and to maintain herself precariously in the Middle East, Persia, and India. The So- viet forces, though vast in numbers, were committed against an enemy that was threatening Russia’s very existence.  The question before the War Department resolved itself into the selection of the exact line of operations along which the potential power of the United States would be best directed against the European Axis. This decision, once reached, would be the guiding principle of the war until Germany was defeated; all other operations and efforts would necessarily be considered as auxiliary or sec- ondarv to the main thrust. and would he desisned either to defend vital links in aur defensive structure or to sunnort the nrincinal effart when ance the main attacking forces should he readv.
