The Operations Division gave the snap judgment that neither would prove decisive in the war effort, but those who made the positive decision had the advice of experts in the particular problem of petrol- eum supply.  In the development of a concrete plan to implement the approved Allied policy of defeating the European Axis first, we attempted to study and analyze each step and each important factor so thoroughly that no opportunity, risk, or needed preparation would be overlooked. Always, in war, whether problems of tactics, strategy, or logistics are involved, concentration for positive, offensive purposes must be calculated in the light of minimum needs in areas where the enemy might damage us decisively. This meant that during January, February, and March 1942 basic strategic plans had to be drawn in cognizance of the irreducible requirements of the Southwest Pacific.  Among the United Nations, only America could produce great amounts of disposable reserves. Great Britain's air force and, to a lesser extent, her ground and sea forces were largely pinned down to the defense of her home country, a base that had to be protected at all costs if ever any offensive action was to be undertaken across northern Europe.
