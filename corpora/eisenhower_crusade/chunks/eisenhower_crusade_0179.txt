g ashore of a great army through an initial breach—then the assault against the Atlantic wall was not only practicable but would lead to the definite defeat of Germany. Moreover, this tiny group solidly held that no other operation could do more than peck at the outer perimeter of the German defense; that unless this particular cam- paign were undertaken the prospect of defeating Germany on land was completely black.  We felt we were bringing a new concept, almost a new faith, to strategic thinking, one which envisioned the air co-ordinated with ground operations to the extent that a ground-air team would be developed, tending to multiply the effectiveness of both.  Many ground soldiers belittled the potentialities of the airplane against ground formations. Curiously enough, quite a number of Air Force officers were also antagonistic to the idea, thinking they saw an attempt to shackle the air to the ground and therefore a failure to realize the full capabilities of air attack. It was patiently explained over and over again that, on the contrary, the results of co- ordination would constantly advance the air bases and would articulate strategic bombing effects with ground strategy, so that as the air constantly assisted the advance of the ground forces its long- range work would not only be facilitated but destruction of its selected targets would contribute more effectively and directly to Nazi defeat. All this—so easy now to see—was then the subject of pro- longed and earnest argument, extending over days and weeks.  These reasons and supporting arguments, coupled with a great number of technical papers, were finally drawn up in a tentative strategic outline for presentation to the Chief of Staff.112] He had been aware, of course, of its preparation.  With his usual receptiveness and open-mindedness, General Marshall invited a full explanation of the scheme. The burden of proof was on us, but the critical point, the very basis of the whole plan, had to be taken al
