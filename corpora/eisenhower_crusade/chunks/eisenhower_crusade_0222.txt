arginal ground under intensive cultivation, while, to save fuel and power, all unnecessary transportation and power facilities had been eliminated. Our friendly invasion would vastly increase the strain on the population. The whole of the British Isles is only slightly larger than Colorado. Certain portions were either unusable or unsuited to our purpose. Southern Ireland was neutral, while Scotland was short of suitable areas for training. Almost the entire burden was thrown onto the crowded sections of middle and southern England, with some troops stationed in North Ireland.
