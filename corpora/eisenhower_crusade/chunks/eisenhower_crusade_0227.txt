f subjects. I began the practice of holding short, informal conferences with the press, for the purpose of discussing our mutual prob- lems and finding common solutions for them. I insisted that they occupy positions as quasi-staff officers on my staff, and I respected their collective responsibilities in the war as they did mine.  My first press conference had a curious result. Prior to my arrival in England censorship had been established by American headquarters on stories involving minor difficulties between Negro troops and other soldiers, or civilians. These incidents frequently involved social contacts between our Negro soldiers and British girls.

When I learned at the press conference that stories of this kind were on the censored list I at once revoked the order and told the pressmen to write as they pleasedâ€”urging them only not to lose their perspective.
