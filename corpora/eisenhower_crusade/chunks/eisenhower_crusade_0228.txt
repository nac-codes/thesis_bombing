remember.  Progress in these matters of administration, preparation, training, planning, had to go forward simultaneously. An early deficiency in our wartime Army involved a dismaying lack of compre- hension on the part of our soldiers as to fundamental causes of the war. Differences between democracy and totalitarianism were matters of academic rather than personal interest; soldiers saw no apparent reason why conflict between the two was any concern of America. No matter what clash of opinion had existed on the point before the war began, a clear, simple, and commonly held understanding was now essential among our troops. An attendant deficiency was a similar lack of comprehension as to the need for battle discipline and for incessant training in teamwork and in the employment of weapons.  Both subjects evoked frequent comment by observant press representatives. The matter could not be dismissed—as some commanders tried to do—with the complacent statembit that all of this came about because the troops were not yet “blooded.” There has always existed a curious notion that instant perfection in these matters comes about with the first whistle of a hostile bullet. Admittedly there are certain things to be learned from battle experience that can be absorbed in no other way. On the other hand, any commander who permits a unit to enter battle lacking any advan- tage, any needed instruction, or any useful understanding that could be imparted to that unit beforehand, is guilty of a grave crime against the soldiers he leads.  That a soldier should understand why he is fighting would not seem to be an arguable point. Yet I have heard commanders attempt to oversimplify this psychological problem with the assertion that soldiers fight for only a few simple and essentially local reasons. Among these they include pride in a unit, respect for the opinion of comrades, and blind devotion to an immediate leader. These things are important and the wise commander will neglect none o
