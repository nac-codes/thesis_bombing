ely around the one point of feasibility. General Spaatz and I were supported in our position by the United States Chiefs of Staff and we insisted that our system should first be thoroughly and completely tested before anything could lead us to deviate from it.  In the final outcome, months later, both sides were proved to be partially right. When our heavy bombers first began operating in formation outside fighter range, the volume of their defensive fire so astonished the enemy that for a period we enjoyed a considerable degree of immunity. Gradually, however, the German devised new tactics and methods and began to use his fighters in large concentrations against our units. Our percentage of losses began to mount rapidly. On June 13, 1943, the U.S. Eighth Air Force attacked Kiel with 76 planes, without fighter support, and lost 22.[20| A later raid by 291 planes suffered a loss of 60. With each plane shot down went also a minimum of ten officers and men. In the face of such percentage losses it became certain that but for the mass pro- duction of the long-range efficient fighter we would have had to modify our bombing program and could have proceeded into Germany itself only under cover of darkness or bad weather.  But in the initial arguments these experiences still belonged to the future. A great factor in my own calculations was the degree of dependence I placed upon the operation of the precision bomber in preparing the way for a ground invasion of France.  This was the keynote of the invasion plan. Unless accurate daylight bombing was feasible, I believed, large-scale invasion of the Continent would be exceedingly risky. Therefore I maintained that even if we could carry on precision bombing only to the extreme range of our fighters we must continue to develop the United States forces on that basis, so as to have available the great force that would be needed to carry out the preparatory work in the areas selected for invasion.  The upshot was that the United
