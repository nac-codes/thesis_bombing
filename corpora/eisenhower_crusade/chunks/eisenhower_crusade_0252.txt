Any expression of defeatism or any fail- ure to push ahead in confidence was instant cause for relief from duty, and all officers knew it.

Requirements in troops, airplanes, supplies, and equipment were all yet to be determined. In general terms I was thinking of an assault to be launched early in 1943, conducted during its initial stages by British troops supported by possibly ten or twelve American divisions.
