ng a major invasion of Europe until America could produce the necessary land, sea, anbsair power to participate in the initial operation on at least an equal basis and be prepared, thereafter, to provide the great bulk of the ground and air units that would be needed. Moreover, the attack could not take place until American industry could largely supply the vast amount of special equipment and supplies that would be necessary.  It became increasingly doubtful to the American headquarters that a full-out attack could be launched in the early spring of 1943, and because it would be extremely hazardous to begin a major operation across the English Channel in the fall of the year, we began to realize that a large-scale invasion might not be possible before the spring of 1944.  This was a bitter possibility to contemplate. It was bitter for ourselves, for our Chiefs of Staff, and far more so for the political heads of the two countries: they not only had the burden of directing the industrial effort to produce the ships and guns and tanks and planes and of mobilizing millions of men, but they had also to maintain civilian morale during the period of preparation. Moreover, most of these delays could not be explained to the public. To do so would be to expose our own current weaknesses, with the danger of intensifying the gloom and despondency that were then so heavy, owing to the rapidity of the Japanese conquest and the misfortunes which had overtaken the British forces in the desert during the early summer.!241  At the very least it was clear to the Chiefs of Staff that no significant invasion of western Europe was possible in 1942. We kept General Marshall informed of our developing conclusions, primarily through verbal communications carried by trusted staff officers. In mid-July 1942, General Marshall and Admiral King came to London to meet with the British Chiefs of Staff.l251 They were to discuss problems arising out of realization that a very considerable period m
