different ideas affecting strategy, tactics, organization, and supply were discussed. interminably. These discussions were complicated by service and personal prejudices and by varying convictions regarding the usefulness of the air in ground operations.  But through these studies and conferences the Americans became more fully acquainted with the details of the strategic, tactical, and logistic problems involved in an invasion of Europe on a decisive scale. We gained access to all the British intelligence and learned the exact strength and commitments of British land, sea, and air forces. Further mobilization of British power, in any signifi- cant amount, was impossible; they had already organized their full strength, including women between the ages of eighteen and fifty-two.  We learned a number of things that caused us to revise radically our earlier general ideas of the operation. The first of these was that the British Air Force was not equipped either in types and numbers of planes or in training of personnel to carry out the intensive preparatory work by air that we deemed a prerequisite to successful invasion. The second was that the British fleet, necessarily holding itself in reserve at all times to meet any threat of a sortie by the German surface fleet, could not provide the amount of direct support and the intensity of naval bombardment that would be required for successful landings.  In land forces, also, the British were badly stretched. Considering their commitments in India, the Middle East, and their precarious position in the Western Desert, they could not possibly provide for the new invasion more than some fifteen divisions.!23! Finally, we found that in the matter of landing craft, special equipment, and the great stores of material reserves that would be necessary the British were not much better off than we. All this meant that there was no hope of beginning a major invasion of Europe until America could produce the necessary land, sea, and
