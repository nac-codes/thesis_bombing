They had to reckon with these factors:  The agreed-upon major strategical operation to be carried out jointly by Great Britain and the United States could not be put into effect, because of lack of forces and equipment, before late 1943 at the earliest, and, since the fall of the year would be a most unpropitious time to begin such a campaign, the prospective D-day, in the absence of some unforeseen, radical change in the situation, might be post- poned until the spring of 1944.
