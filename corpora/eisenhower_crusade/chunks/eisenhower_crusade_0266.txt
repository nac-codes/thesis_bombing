Great Britain and in all the occupied countries of Europe might be little short of disastrous if positive action of some kind were not undertaken during 1942.  Whatever was attempted in 1942 would necessarily be on a much smaller scale than the contemplated invasion of Europe and, so far as possible, it should not seriously cut into the production and preparatory program then getting under way to make possible the final major operation.  The President had specifically ordered the United States Chiefs of Staff to launch some kind of offensive ground action in the European zone in 1942.126]  In view of these circumstances there seemed to be three lines of action deserving of earnest study.  The first was the direct reinforcement of the British armies in the Middle East via the Cape of Good Hope route, in an effort to destroy Rommel and his army and, by capturing Tripolitania, to gain secure control of the central Mediterranean.  The second was to prepare amphibious forces to seize northwest Africa with the idea of undertaking later operations to the eastward to catch Rommel in a giant vise and eventually open the entire Mediterranean for use by the United Nations. K  The third was to undertake a limited operation on the northwest coast of France with a relatively small force but with objectives limited to the capture of an area that could be held against German attack and which would later form a bridgehead for use in the large-scale invasion agreed upon as the ultimate objective. The places indicated were the Cotentin Peninsula or the Brittany Peninsula. This proposed operation was called Sledgehammer.  No other course of action seemed feasible at the moment. The discussions were long and exhaustive. A major factor in all American thinking of that time was a lively suspicion that the British contemplated the agreed-upon cross-Channel concept with distaste and with considerable mental reservations concerning the practicability of ever conducting a major invasion of n
