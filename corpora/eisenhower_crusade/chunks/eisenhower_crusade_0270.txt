unequivocal reaffirmation of the cross-Channel strategy.  Influenced by these considerations, I personally favored, at that time, the third course of action; that is, the attempt to seize a small bridgehead on the northwest coast of France. However, I told General Marshall that the project was a hazardous one and that my only real reason for favoring it was the fear of becoming so deeply involved elsewhere that the major cross-Channel attack would be indefinitely postponed, possibly even canceled. Almost certainly any 1942 operation in the Mediterranean would eliminate the possibility of a major cross-Channel venture in 1943.  Later developments have convinced me that those who held the Sledgehammer operation to be unwise at the moment were correct in their evaluation of the problem. Our limited-range fighter craft of 1942 could not have provided sufficiently effective air cover over the Cotentin or Brittany peninsulas, against the German air strength as it then existed. At least, the operation would have been very costly. Another reason is that out of the northwest African operation flowed benefits to the Allied nations that were felt all through the war and materially helped to achieve the great victory when the invasion actually took place in 1944. Only meager advantages would have followed capture of Cherbourg; the desirable features of that project were merely that it would have initiated a small “second front” at once and would have launched our first offensive effort in the direction and along the same line that would later be taken by our full-out assault.  In any event the Combined Chiefs of Staff first concluded that it would be unprofitable and uneconomical to attempt direct reinforcement of the British Eighth Army then in Egypt. On this there was unanimous agreement. The British and American Chiefs of Staff had therefore to decide, in late July 1942, between the northwest African invasion and the seizing of a bridgehead in northwest France.  As far as I
