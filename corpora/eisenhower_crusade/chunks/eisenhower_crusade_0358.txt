nst Malta convoys, would keep his air, submarine, and surface forces concentrated to the eastward around Sicily, in antici- pation of making a devastating attack as ships approached the narrow passage between that island and the African mainland.  In the original planning the probability of encountering impossible conditions at Casablanca was one of the factors that made me reluctant to commit the largest of our contingents to this particular operation.|1] The danger of last-minute postponement at Casablanca was a lively one, and if this should happen there were only two alternatives.  The first was merely to direct that great convoy to delay its landing and to steam in circles through the adjacent sea areas, awaiting a favorable moment. The disadvantages of this scheme were several. All surprise in the western attack would be lost; secondly, the ships would remain exposed to the attacks of hostile submarines which swarmed in the Bay of Biscay and southward; thirdly, the appearance of overwhelming power resulting from simultaneous assault of all three ports would be greatly diminished. Finally, there is a limit to the fuel capacity of ships.  The alternative was to bring the entire western convoy inside the Mediterranean to cluster about the already crowded port of Gibraltar. Here it could save fuel and be ready to return to Casablanca for the landing as originally planned, or the troops could follow in the assault at Oran and push backward down the railway toward the northwest coast. Neither alternative was attractive, since each required hasty revision and adjustment of plans already in execution. But the law of probabilities indicated that we would have to adopt one of them.  Even as late as the afternoon before the attack the weather reports from one of our submarines in the Casablanca region were gloomy, and I tentatively decided, unless conditions should improve, to divert the expedition into Gibraltar. All our plans would thus be badly upset, but this seemed
