In the original planning the probability of encountering impossible conditions at Casablanca was one of the factors that made me reluctant to commit the largest of our contingents to this particular operation.|1] The danger of last-minute postponement at Casablanca was a lively one, and if this should happen there were only two alternatives.  The first was merely to direct that great convoy to delay its landing and to steam in circles through the adjacent sea areas, awaiting a favorable moment.
