Finally, I explained that the campaign on which we were embarking was backed up by such intricate and detailed maintenance arrangements that the change he proposed was completely impossible.  He could not see the need of North Africa as a baseâ€”the need for establishing ourselves firmly and strongly in that region before we could successfully invade the southern portion of Europe.  He was not aware of the lessons the war had brought out as to the effect of land-based aviation upon unprotected seaborne craft.
