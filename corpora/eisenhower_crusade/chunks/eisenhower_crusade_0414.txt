s line of communications we could assure that the brilliant tactical victory of the Eighth Army would result in even greater strategic gain.  British air and sea forces based in Egypt and Malta denied the Axis any practicable and dependable line of communications crossing the Mediterranean east of Tripoli.  Our own position, occupying French North Africa west of Bone, imposed a western limit upon the sea areas that the Axis could use. Thus there were available to Hitler and Mussolini only the ports lying between Bone in Tunisia and Tripoli in northwest Libya, from which to support Rommel. Every advance by the Allies from either flank would tend to squeeze the Axis channel of supplies and with continuation of this process eventual strangulation would result.  The air power of the Axis in Sicily, Pantelleria, and southern Italy was still so strong as to preclude the possibility of Allied naval advance into that region; final success in cutting the Axis commu- nications would demand land advance, with continuous build-up of forward air bases and air power.  By far the most important of the African ports then available to the Axis were Bizerte and Tunis, with the secondary ones of Sfax and Gab√©s lying farther to the southward. Tripoli itself, while a good enough port, required Axis vessels to pass almost under the guns of Malta, where the British air forces were growing sufficiently strong to inflict severe loss. Obviously, if the ports of Tunis and Bizerte could be taken quickly further reinforcements of the Axis armies in Africa would be almost impossible and their destruction would be expedited.

The successful action of the first few days assured attainment of the minimum object and
