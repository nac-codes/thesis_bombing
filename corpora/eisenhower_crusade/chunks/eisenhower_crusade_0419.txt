November while we were still in Algiers urging Darlan to order the French to cease fighting our troops and to co-operate with us. General Anderson’s British First Army had been organized for the specific purpose of undertaking the campaign to the eastward, using Algiers as an initial base.!2!

The third major problem was the weather. Unseasonable rains soon overtook us, and since none of the scattered air strips that we had hoped to use boasted of a paved runway, our small air forces were handicapped and for days at a stretch were rendered almost completely helpless.
