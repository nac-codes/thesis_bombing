llied forces could turn over Tunis to our people as a New Year's present!  The gamble was great but the prize was such a glittering one that we abandoned caution in an effort to bring up to General Anderson every available fighting man in the theater. There still existed the fear that the German might thrust air forces down across the Pyrenees into Spain, to attack us from the rear. Nevertheless, as a beginning, the American air forces were directed to move as far to the eastward as possible to join in the air battle in support of General Anderson and to assist in cutting Axis sea communications between Tunis and Italy.|8| This was a definite change from the preconceived plan to retain the United States air forces in the western end of the Mediterranean.

Because of the critical nature of the day-by-day fighting and the lack of transport we could not wait to bring up any large unit as an entity nor could we wait to assemble such units before committing them to action.
