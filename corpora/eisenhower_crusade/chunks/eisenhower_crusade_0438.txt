nature of the day-by-day fighting and the lack of transport we could not wait to bring up any large unit as an entity nor could we wait to assemble such units before committing them to action. If we should fail to take Tunis we would suffer severely for this procedure, but General Anderson was given positive orders to use everything possible to gain his objective before the increasingly bad weather and the Ais reinforce- ments should compel us to settle down to a long winter campaign in such uninviting and inhospitable circumstances.  From Oran we brought up elements of the U.S. 1st Armored Division and part of the 1st Infantry Division. The U.S. 34th Division was distributed along the line of communication to protect critical points and to make sure of the security of the vast areas in which we were otherwise completely defenseless. We could use Allied troops for this purpose only on the most vital points, and as the enemy quickly resorted to a system of sabotage by night landing of paratroopers we were forced to rely on French contingents to protect hundreds of culverts, bridges, tunnels, and similar places where a few determined men could have inflicted almost decisive damage upon our lines of communication.  Courage, resourcefulness, and endurance, though daily displayed in overwhelming measure, could not completely overcome the combination of enemy, weather, and terrain. In early December the enemy was strong enough in mechanized units to begin local but sharp counterattacks and we were forced back from our most forward positions in front of Tunis.  As soon as we ceased attacking, the situation in northern Tunisia turned bleak for us, even from a defensive standpoint. Through a blunder during a local withdrawal we had lost the bulk of the equipment of Combat Command B, of the U.S. 1st Armored Division.|2! The 18th Infantry of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division took severe losses, and practically an entire battalion of a fine British regiment was wiped out.l10l Gen
