estimate that if the Moroccans should grow antagonistic to us it would require 60,000 fully equipped Ameri- cans to keep order in that region alone. We could not afford—and did not have—any such force. Patton strongly counseled us to let Nogués alone!  One complication in the Arab tangle was the age-old antagonism existing between the Arab and the Jew.

The country was ridden, almost ruled, by rumor. One rumor was to the effect that I was a Jew, sent into the country by the Jew, Roosevelt, to grind down the Arabs and turn over North Africa to Jewish rule. The political staff was so concerned about this one that they published material on me in newspapers and in special leaflets to establish evidence of my ancestry.
