I was still concerned that both Anderson and Fredendall should clearly understand that my intentions in southern Tunisia were, temporarily, defensive and that our dispositions were made so as to insure our own safety and to secure the forward airfields. On January 18, I flew to Constantine, where I held a conference with Generals Anderson, Fredendall, and Juin, and a number of staff officers. 121] again instructed Anderson to hold as much of the II Corps as possible in mobile reserve, especially the U.S. 1st Armored Division.!131I reiterated, also, that defenses in the southern sector should be perfected.
