Instructions for the general nature of the defense were positive in this regard but local fears, and again faulty intelligence, led to a dispersion of the mobile reserves that rendered them ineffective when the attack came.!231  A fourth cause was greenness, particularly among commanders. The American divisions involved had not had the benefit of the intensive training programs instituted in the United States following the actual outbreak of the war. They were mainly divisions that had been quickly shipped to the United Kingdom, and since transportation facilities had not yet acquired their later efficiency, they had been separated from their organic equipment for long periods. Training, during a major part of 1942, was for them a practical impossibility. Commanders and troops showed the effects of this, and although there was no lack of gallantry and fortitude, their initial effectiveness did not compare with that of the American divisions later brought into action after a full year’s intensive training.

Moreover, pending the closer approach of Montgomery’s army from the desert, I should have
