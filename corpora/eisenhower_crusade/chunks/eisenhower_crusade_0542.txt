y, under General Montgomery, was able to continue its advance to the westward with the purpose of making junction with the right of our forces in Tunisia. It was foreseen that General Montgomery’s principal battle to achieve this result would take place on the Mareth Line, a defensive position that had previously been constructed by the French along the Tunisian border and in which we now expected the Axis to make a determined defense.!34!

The left flank of the Eighth Army soon joined up with Patton’s II Corps, which had pushed aggressively to the east- ward. At last all our troops were connected up in one single battle line.
