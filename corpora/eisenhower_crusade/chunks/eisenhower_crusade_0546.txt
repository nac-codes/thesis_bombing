Although the outcome of this particular attack was disappointing, the rapid retreat of the Germans had the effect of shrinking the circumference of the enemy line, thus pinching outhhe American II Corps for employment elsewhere on the battle line.  Some discussion arose as to the suitability of the corps for participating effectively in the final battle. Alexander’s staff felt that a large portion should be sent back to the Constantine area for additional training. Admittedly some of the troops were still relatively green. However, both Patton and I were confident that the corps was now ready to act aggressively and to take an important sector in the battle line.

The soldiers themselves were entitled to engage in an operation where
