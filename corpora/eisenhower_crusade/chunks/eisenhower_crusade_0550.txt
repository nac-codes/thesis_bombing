Alexander’s staff felt that a large training. Admittedly some of the troops were still relatively green. However, both Patton and I were confident that the corps was now ready to act aggressively and to take an important he battle line. For one thing the troops were at last angry—not only because of the rough handling they had received, but more so because of insulting and slighting comments concerning he fighting qualities of Americans, originated by German prisoners and given some circulation within the theater.  I had a personal interview with Alexander to insist upon the employment of the entire II Corps, as a unit./391 For this I had several reasons by the Allies to defeat Germany would have to come from the United States. The need for battle training on a large scale was evident. Second.  he American II Corps was involved in this attack, but the entire operation was commanded by a British corps commander.!27! The only American division available for participation was one that had ketchy training and had been involved for many weeks in protection of our line of communications, thus missing the opportunity to work together as a unit. The task assigned the American difficult one and the attack failed. A break-through was finally accomplished by British formations, but it was not particularly effective because the Germans had made good their retreat to he northward. General Sir John Crocker, the British corps commander, severely criticized to press representatives the failure of the American division, and for almost the only time during the African erations definite British-American recrimination resulted.!38! It was disturbing, the more so because it was so unnecessary. With the help of Alexander, we quickly took steps to stop it.
