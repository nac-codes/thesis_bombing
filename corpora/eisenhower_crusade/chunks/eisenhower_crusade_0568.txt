The outcome of the Tunisian campaign was of course eminently satisfactory, but the high command was so busily engaged in preparation for the Sicilian attack that little opportunity was available for celebration. However, a Victory Parade was held in Tunis on the twentieth to mark the end of the Axis Empire in Africa.  The very magnitude of our victory, at least of our captures, served to intensify our difficulties in preparing for the Sicilian affair.
