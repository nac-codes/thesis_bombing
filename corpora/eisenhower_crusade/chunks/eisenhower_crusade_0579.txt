the illusion that a few big planes could win a war.|6!  Development of the Sicilian plan, assigned the code name Husky, began in February. The major points to be decided were the strength of the attack, its timing, and its exact location. Manifestly we could not depend entirely upon the employment of troops that were then engaged in the Tunisian battle. To do this would force us to defer decisions respecting timing until after the final battle in Af- rica, and since this date could not be accurately predetermined, all other planning would have been indecisive and commanders and staffs could not have proceeded with confidence.  Considering the strength of the enemy garrison, we felt that some five or six divisions should be deployed in the initial landing.

In addition we had the 3d, which we did not plan to use in the Tunisian battle. Moreover, our plans called for the release of the U.S. 1st Division from the Tunisian battle area as quickly as success was sure.

On the British side it was determined to bring into the assault a Canadian division from England, while the Eighth Army was able, some time before the end of the Tunisian campaign, to detach part {Xits strength to prepare for the Sicilian assault.l8] These forces were to attack Sicily in early July, and all prep
