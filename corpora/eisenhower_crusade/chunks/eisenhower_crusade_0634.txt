On the cliffs facing the sea just to the eastward of Mount Etna, I saw an almost incredible feat of field engineering. The road, completely blown away through a gap of two hundred yards, presented nothing but a sheer cliff hundreds of feet in height. Across this gap the engineers built a trestle capable of supporting the heaviest army loads; it was another example of what troops in the  fiald can da when thew ara faced writh ctark necaccitw  Pag  OS, STEFANQ- 1 Ze Us Y l 4 EN j 5 A Ly Ye Ney, MISTRETTAP ZR Dh GGG  0 Lp Mug de FRANCAVILLA CESARO RANDAZZO  (i CIREALE ££: _ FINAL STAGE  SICILIAN CAMPAIGN @ PATERNO : TO FALLOF MESSINA-AUG.17,1943  =] U.S. SEVENTH ARMY (53 BRITISH EIGHTH ARMY  fe] 5 10 MILES 20 _ $$  Early on August 17 the U.S. 3d Division pushed into the town of Messina./10! A detachment from the Eighth Army soon after arrived and on that date the last r on the island was eliminated.  In the original study of the Sicilian operation Alexander had faintly hoped that the forces landing on the east of the island would quickly push to the northward, close to Messina. There they could effectively block the easy avenue for enemy evacuation, and would also be in a position to make a possible surprise landing across the narrow strait and thus assist in a speedy transfer of our troops to the Italian mainland later on.  erations on the east coast had begun auspiciously, and for a few days it looked as if Alexander’s hope might be realized. But by the time Montgomery was ready to assault the natural defensive barriers running from Mount Etna to the sea the enemy had brought up too much strength. The chance for a coup de main passed, if it ever had existed. Thereafter the northward path of the Eighth Army was fully as difficult from the terrain viewpoint as was the eastward advance on the left of the Seventh
