We were planning to use only three with some reinforcing units, aside from the two that were to dash across the Messina strait.[21]  These negotiations were still proceeding when, according to plan, Montgomery slipped two divisions across the Strait of Messina one night against no resistance and the Allied invasion of the continent of Europe was an accomplished fact.!22] This was on September 3—a date ten days later than I had hoped it could be done. Preparation for amphibious attack is time-consuming, but if we could have saved a few days in this instance our Salerno problem would have been much easier to solve. Nevertheless the timing was sufficiently good to permit us to use for the later main assault some of the landing craft that Montgomery had employed to get across the strait. He immediately started an advance up the toe of the boot with enemy forces cautiously delaying him and anxiously watch- ing for our major move.  For a brief period following upon the expulsion of Mussolini we had ceased the intensity of our bombing raids against Italy. We publicized this as an opportunity for the new government to avoid further destruction in the country by accepting without delay our demands for unconditional surrender of their entire armed forces. This evoked an angry protest from London—again reminding us that a modern commander in the field is never more than an hour away from home capitals and public opinion. Actually the bombing delay was caused by the necessity of transferring air units and the bringing up of supplies; we were attempting to make a virtue out of a necessity. As quickly as we were again in position for using our air force at maximum effectiveness, we resumed our air campaign.
