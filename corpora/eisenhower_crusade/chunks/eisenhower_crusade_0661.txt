One group held that our safest, even if less decisive, means of advancing into Italy was to follow along through the toe of the boot, after Montgomery had made the initial beachhead, and to work our way laboriously up the narrow winding roads toward the heart of the country. This scheme was safe, but it could offer no worth-while results.

The greatest disadvantage of this plan was that its logic was obvious to the enemy as well as to us. Most of our pursuit planes were still handicapped by short range and Salerno Bay lay at about the extreme limit of their effective support for the landings. Besides, between the bay and the toe of the boot there were no other particularly favorable landing beaches, so we went into the operation with no illusions of surprising the opposition.  Inthe meantime negotiations for the Italian surrender had been dragging along. They were very intricate.
