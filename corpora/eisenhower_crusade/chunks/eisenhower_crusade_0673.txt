was carried out as planned on September 9, but with the loss of one fine British cruiser and more than two hundred men she was carrying.!31] She was sunk by a mine in the harbor of Taranto.  A dramatic incident during the operation is told in the official report:  On the afternoon of 9th September the battleship Howe with four cruisers in company, carrying elements of the 1st British Airborne Division, steamed up the swept channel towards Taranto. Shortly before, the Taranto Division of the Italian Battle Fleet had emerged from the harbor. As the two fleets passed each other, there was a moment of tension.

But the final challenge by Admiral Cunningham, delivered with the same cold nerve that had characterised all the actions of that great sailor, went unanswered. The Italian Fleet passed out of sight on its way to surrender.|221  With this landing we were ashore on the Italian mainland in three places, Salerno, Taranto, and Reggio Calabria.  The fierce fighting in Salerno drew off enemy forces from in front of Montgomery and his advance to the northward speeded up. By the sixteenth his left made contact with Clark’s right just south of Salerno Bay. Montgomery’s right moved forward to join up with the airborne division which was pushing its way toward Foggia. Within a few days that great prize fell to us. Clark continued his bat- tling toward Naples and on October 1, 1943, his forces triumphantly entered that city.[331 The combination of engineers and sea salvage experts who had constantly amazed us with their exploits in the rehabilitation of harbors immediately went to work. All of their prior successes at Casablanca, Algiers, Oran, Bizerte, and Palermo were as nothing compared to the speed and efficiency with which they repaired the seemingly destroyed and useless harbor facilities at Naples. With the establishment of this base and with Fogg
