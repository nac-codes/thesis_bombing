So far as there was discernible any difference between the professional views of the British and American groups it appeared to me and to my associates at the Cairo Conference that the British still favored a vigorous and all-out prosecution of the Mediterranean campaign even, if necessary, at the expense of additional delay in launching Overlord; while the Americans declined to approve any- thing that would detract from the strength of the attack to be delivered across the Channel early in the following summer.

Had we encountered there a disastrous reverse, those who now criticiz
