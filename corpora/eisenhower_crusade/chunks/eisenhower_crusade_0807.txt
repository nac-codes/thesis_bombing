plus those introduced through the south of France for other operations along the long line from Wesel on the Rhine all the way south to Switzerland.[15| Consequently, unless we could eliminate the Siegfried, we would be able to do little more than to defend along the front south of the Ruhr. With all the advantages the enemy would thus enjoy, he could concentrate almost at will for strong counterattack.  However, this prospect would be completely changed provided we could gain the line of the Rhine substantially throughout its entire length. Once this was done we would enjoy a comparative degree of safety throughout the theater that would permit the assignment of offensive roles to practically our entire force instead of only to the thirty-five divisions that could be sustained along the one route north of the Ruhr.  There were other considerations dictating the wisdom of gaining the whole length of the Rhine before launching a final assault on interior Germanv. Our obiective was the destruction of the  71 of 669  fw 2 =n,  -f ¢ VIENNA  \ aN a~™ND  Vr~n, AUSTRIA  ‘ ~  MUNICH @  oy —\  If all these movements should prove successful, we next had to look forward to the final destruction of the enemy, who would then, presumably, be defending the Siegfried Line and the Rhine River.  In May 1944 we calculated that with the ports of entry upon which we were counting we would probably have sixty-eight strong divisions available to us, not including divisions from the Mediter- ranean, when the time came to make our decisive thrusts across the Rhine. Allotting thirty-five of these to the advance on the axis, Amiens-Maubeuge-Liége-Ruhr, which, according to administrative estimates, was the maximum number that could be sustained along that channel of invasion, would leave us some thirty-three plus those introduced through the south of France for other operations along the long line from Wesel on the Rhine all the way south to Switzerland.115| Consequently, unless we could elim
