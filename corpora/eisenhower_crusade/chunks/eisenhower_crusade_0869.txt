Lawton Collins’ corps, after landing on Utah, was to make its principal objective the early capture of Cherbourg.|32/ Because large German forces were located in the Calais area it seemed probable that to preserve communications between that region and Normandy the enemy would concentrate heavily in the Caen area. It was certain also that he would make desperate efforts to hold Cherbourg and so deny us the use of that port. Nevertheless, we hoped that speed and surprise would gain for us early possession of the open ground outside Caen, while Bradley esti- mated that the Americans would take Cherbourg in from ten to thirty days, depending upon the degree of luck we might enjoy.  Montgomery’s detailed plan also indicated the areas that he estimated we would probably be holding in successive periods following the assault. These estimates are shown on map “Overlord Forecast.”  The anticipated development pictured in the phase lines was not, of course, an essential feature of the landing plan, since the first and great objective was to assault and capture a satisfactory and indestructible beachhead which we could build up as rapidly as possible for the later decisive battle for France. But progress predictions are always helpful to the supply staffs in order that they may plan their own operations according to a concept that gives some idea of the scope of responsibilities they will be called upon to meet.
