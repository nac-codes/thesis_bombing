England.  It seemed likely that, if the German had succeeded in perfecting and using these new weapons six months earlier than he did, our invasion of Europe would have proved exceedingly difficult, perhaps impossible. I feel sure that if he had succeeded in using these weapons over a six-month period, and particularly if he had made the Portsmouth-Southampton area one of his principal targets, Overlord might have been written off.  Defensive measures against the V-1 soon attained a very high degree of efficiency, but even so, the threat of their arrival was always present at all hours of the day and night and in all kinds of weather. We in the field wanted to capture the areas from which these weapons were fired against southern England. However, it must be said to the credit of the British leaders that never once did one of them urge me to vary any detail of my planned operations merely for the purpose of eliminating this scourge.  On June 18, Montgomery still felt that conditions permitted the early capture of Caen. His directive of that date stated: “It is clear that we must now capture Caen and Cherbourg, as the first step in the full development of our plans. Caen is really the key to Cherbourg....” In the same directive he gave the following instructions to the British Army: “The immediate task of this Army will be to cap- ture Caen.” The final sentence of that order was: “I shall hope to see both Caen and Cherbourg captured by June 24.”  On the left the German armor and defensive strength continued to defeat our intentions, but the port of Cherbourg fell on June 26, just twenty days after the landing. General Collins had conducted against it a relentless offensive and as a result of the operation justified his nickname, “Lightning Joe.” The final assault was materially assisted by heavy and accurate naval gunfire.  In the matter of luck we had enjoyed a rough medium between Bradley’s minimum and maximum estimates of the influence of this imponderable factor
