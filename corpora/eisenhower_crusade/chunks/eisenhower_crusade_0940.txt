The steady arrival of fresh troops made it possible to keep up the offensive, but under unfavorable conditions of terrain and weather. On the east our purpose was now to contain the maximum amount of the German forces, on the west to make sufficient progress so that the final and co-ordinated drive to break out of the restricted beachhead could be delivered.[11)  Late June was a difficult period for all of us.
