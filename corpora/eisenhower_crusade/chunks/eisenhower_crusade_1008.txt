to allow little time for demolition.  The distance from Brest to the Metz region was greater than the distance from Marseille to Metz. The railway lines connecting the two former points were much more tortuous and were more easily damaged than was the case with regard to the lines up the Rhone River.  Unless Marseille were captured, we would be unable to speed up the arrival of American divisions from the homeland.  The entry of a sizable force into southern France provided definite tactical and strategic support to our own operation.  First, it would protect and support the right flank as we continued our advance toward the heart of the German resistance. Secondly, by joining it to our own right flank we would automatically cut off all regions westward of that point, capture the enemy troops remaining back of the point of junction, and free all of France to assist us both passively and actively.  Without the Dragoon attack we would have to protect our right flank all the way from the base of the Brittany Peninsula to the most forward point of our attacking spearheads. This would have  meant the immobilization of large numbers of divisions, stationed along the right merely to insure our own safety against raids by small mobile forces. These defending divisions could scarcely have participated in later aggressive action.

Troops in America could come in via Brittany.  The attack through the south of France was so far removed geographically from the troops in northern France that there was no tactical connection between them.  The troops to be used under General Devers in the southern invasion would have more effect in winning the war by driving
