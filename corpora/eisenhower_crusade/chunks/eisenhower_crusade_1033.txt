emy began to obtain a clearer view of the situation; we quickly knew this. Identification of hostile units on the front is one of the continuous objectives of all battlefield Intelligence activities. From this information we daily constructed, normally with remarkable accuracy, the “Enemy Order of Battle,” which revealed in late July that the German had started the divisions of the Fifteenth Army across the Seine to join in the battle.
