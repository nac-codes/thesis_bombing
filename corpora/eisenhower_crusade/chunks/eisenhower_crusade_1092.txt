Caught in a sudden storm, we found it impossible to return to our own little landing strip near headquarters and had no place to land except on a neighboring beach. It was one of the beaches that the Germans had fortified before D-day, had at one time been mined. This did not add to the comfort of our position but we tried to pull the plane far enough away from the waterâ€™s edge to prevent its inundation by the rising tide.

For two days I was confined to bed and thereafter was forced, for a time, to carry a plaster cast on my leg. Press representatives noted my absence from headquarters and surmised that I was ill, possibly because of overwork. When a story to this effe
