from there were delivered in one hand- ling directly against the enemy.  The air can be employed in a variety of ways to forward the progress of the land battle. Its most common functions are to prevent interference with our ground forces by enemy airplanes, to render tactical assistance to attacking troops by fighter-bomber effort against selected targets on the front, and to facilitate capture of strongly defended points by heavy bombardment. In these close-support activities it has, of course, certain limitations. In Europe bad weather was the worst enemy of the air, and the unexpected advent of rain, fog, or cloud often badly disarranged a battle plan. In the middle of December bad weather prevented the air from discerning the concentration of unused German strength in the Ardennes, and made the air force of little use to us in the first week of that battle. Moreover, by its nature, the air cannot stay constantly at the front; each plane must return periodically to its base for refueling and servicing. This limited the number present at the front to a fraction of the total numbers available. Occasionally enemy planes could therefore strafe our front lines, even though in over-all numbers our air strength was relatively overwhelming.  The air force had other important uses. One of these was to attack the enemy’s supply lines. Still another was that of increasing the decisiveness of the ground battle. Every ground commander seeks  the battle of annihilation; so far as conditions permit, he tries to duplicate in modern war the classic example of Cannae. In the beginning of a great campaign, battles of annihilation are possible only against same isolated nartion of the enemv’s entire farce Nestruction of hridges culverts railwavs roads and canals hv the air force tends to isolate the farce under attack even if the severance of its  Page 387 of 669 56%  ee ee ee ee eee ee OE ny See ERR AA Ee SA Se SSS ES aie Se) Se eee SEU Se A ee BA ae Ne CE ee Ss AE Wee OE Se Sees
