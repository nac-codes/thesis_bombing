ion of bridges, culverts, railways, roads, and canals by the air force tends to isolate the force under attack, even if the severance of its communications is not complete.  In the fall of 1944 our air strength, in operational units, including the associated bomber strength, was approximately 4,700 fighters, 6,000 light, medium, and heavy bombers, and 4,000 recon- naissance, transport, and other types.|41  While this build-up was proceeding during the fall months there was, as originally planned, much to be done operationally. In the north, besides capturing the approaches to Antwerp, it was desirable to make progress toward closing the Rhine, because it was from this region that our heaviest attacks would be launched in the crossing of that river. Farther south, on Bradleyâ€™s front, it was advantageous to conduct vreliminarv overations looking toward the final destruction of all German forces remaining west of the Rhine. Thus we would not onlv devlete the forces available for the  Page 387 of 669 56%  NN NN I NN ED ABN Ee ARNE RNIN OO  For the delivery, in a single blow, of a vast tonnage of explosives upon a given area, the power of the air force is unique. Employment of large bombers in this role has the advantage of imposing no strain upon the forward lines of communication. Every round of ammunition that is fired from an artillery shell is unloaded at a main base and from there progresses to the front over crowded rail and road lines. After several handlings it is finally available for use at the gun site. The big bombers are stationed far in the rear; in our case they were in the United Kingdom. The bombs they used were either manufactured in that country or brought over from the United States in cargo ships. From factories or ports they went to appropriate airfields, and from there were delivered in one hand- ling directly against the enemy.  The air can be employed in a variety of ways to forward the progress of the land battle. Its most common functions are
