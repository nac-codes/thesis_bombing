In the fall fighting we again encountered our old enemy, the weather. The June storm on the beaches had established a forty-year record for severity. Again in the autumn the floods broke another meteorological record extending back over decades. By November 1 many of the rivers were out of their banks and weather conditions along the whole front slowed up our attacks. In spite of these conditions we proceeded with the general plan of building up great bases and communications to the borders of Germany, closing the Rhine with initial emphasis on the left, preparing for the destruc- tion of the German forces west of the river, throughout its length, and getting ready to launch the final assaults toward the heart of Germany.

The Scheldt Estuary was heavily mined, and the German forces on Walcheren Island and South Beveland Island completely domin- ated the water routes leading to the city.

Montgomery gave General Crerar of the Canadian First Army responsibility for developing and executing the plans. Preparatory work was started shortly after the city fell into our hands on September 4. The only land approach to the hostile positions was by a narrow neck connecting South Beveland with the mainland, and the operation was worked out to include an attack westward along this
