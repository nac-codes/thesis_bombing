Montgomery gave General Crerar of the Canadian First Army responsibility for developing and executing the plans. Preparatory work was started shortly after the city fell into our hands on September 4.  The only land approach to the hostile positions was by a narrow neck connecting South Beveland with the mainland, and the operation was worked out
