These weapons we countered by energetic naval and air action. In spite of all difficulties, Antwerp quickly became the northern bulwark of our entire logistical system.  While this spectacular and gratifying operation was in progress on the northern flank, the rest of the front was far from quiet.

Winter conditions were now approaching and his ad- vances were made over difficult country, but by December 4 he had cleared out the last German pocket west of the Maas, the same river which, farther south in Belgium and France, is called the Meuse.
