aft was still so strong and so efficient that low-flying bombing was far too expensive. Consequently the only method we could employ against the bridges was blind bombing, through the clouds. The Air Staff calculated that destruction of the bulk of the bridges would require vastly more time and bomb tonnage than we could afford to divert from other vitally important purposes.|121  One of the greatest of these other purposes was to deplete Germany’s reserves of fuel oil. By this time the enemy was getting into precarious position with respect to this vital item of supply. The orders to the heavy bombers were to keep pounding all sources of oil, refineries, and distribution systems to the limit of their ability. This tactic had a great effect not only generally upon the entire warmaking power of Germany but also directly upon the front. Every German commander had always to calculate his plans in terms of availability of fuel, and it was to our advantage to keep pound-  Page 400 of 669 58%  eee ee ee ee ee ee eee eee ee eeeeeeeEeeeeeeeEeeEeeeeEeeE eee Eee eee Oe eeEeeE—_EeEeee—e—e——E—E—_EEeEeeE—eEEEEeE—e——— OOOO eee eee OO eee eee eee eee e———ee—_—EeE—E—EEOEEOEOEEESEEEEEETee doughnut wagons; it sent visitors to hospitals, wrote letters, furnished friendly counsel; and all in all was as successful in providing an occasional hour of homelike atmosphere for the fighting men as was possible in an area thousands of miles from America.  In the same way the USO succeeded in giving the soldier an occasional hour or two of entertainment which he never failed to appreciate. I have seen entertainers carrying on their work in forward and exposed positions, sometimes under actual bombing attack. In rest areas, in camps, in bases, and in every type of hospital they brought to soldiers a moment of forgetfulness which in war is al- ways a boon.  In the late fall, as we approached the borders of Germany, we studied the desirability of committing our air force to the destruction of the
