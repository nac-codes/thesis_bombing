The orders to the heavy bombers were to keep pounding all sources of oil, refineries, and distribution systems to the limit of their ability. This tactic had a great effect not only generally upon the entire warmaking power of Germany but also directly upon the front. Every German commander had always to calculate his plans in terms of availability of fuel, and it was to our advantage to keep pound- ing away to increase the enemy’s embarrassment.  @ MUNSTER  DORTMUND e@  pUHR R.  7 MUNCHEN- (C @ .IGLADBACH  REMAGEN  BONN \ i  Page 403 of 669 59%  RUEIMLELULLS LELE LAK VUE SOULS A PLULULIB EM ALI LISA Y UULALU As CALULL.

Consequently the only method we could employ against the bridges was blind bombing, through the clouds. The Air Staff calculated that destruction of the bulk of the bridges would require vastly more time and bomb tonnage than we could afford to divert from other vitally important purposes.  One of the greatest of these other purposes was to deplete Germany’s reserves of fuel oil. By this time the enemy was getting into precarious position with respect to this vital item of supply.
