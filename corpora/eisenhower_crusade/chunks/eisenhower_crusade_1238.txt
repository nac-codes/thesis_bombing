The troops then had to occupy the line while under pressure, and ready themselves to receive heavy assaults. All this the division succeeded in doing, in the meantime gaining some added strength from portions of neighboring units, which were partially assimilated within the ranks of the 2d.[111  Page 411 of 669 60%  TEMAVILILALEU.

On the other hand, it would be necessary to assist the VIII Corps rapidly with sufficient f
