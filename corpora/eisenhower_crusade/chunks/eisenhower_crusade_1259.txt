ary, some ground in order to shorten our line and collect a strong reserve for the purpose of destroying the enemy in Belgium.”/19]  I had already determined that it was not essential for our counterattack to begin on both flanks simultaneously. In the north, where the weight of the German attack was falling, we would be on the defensive for some days. But on the south we could help the situation by beginning a northward advance at the earliest possible moment. My immediate purpose at the Verdun meeting on the nine- teenth was to make arrangements for the beginning of the southern assault.  It was Bradley’s responsibility to outline the exact unit sectors, together with other local details of direction and co-operation. But because Devers’ forces would have to extend their left in order to take over a part of Bradley’s front and therefore allow him a greater opportunity for concentration, I had to make appropriate decisions, including those of general strength and timing.  We first determined the point to which we believed Devers could stretch his left without exposing the southern flank injudiciously. The next problem was to determine the amount of force Patton could gather up for a counterattack and the approximate time that it could begin. I did not want him to start until he was in sufficient force so that, once committed, he could continue gradually to crush in the southern flank of the developing salient. Once this was done, the German troops west of our point of attack would be effectively stopped, because east-west communications through the region were relatively meager. We estimated that Patton could begin a three-division attack by the morning of December 23, possibly by the twenty-second.  I issued verbal orders for these arrangements to be undertaken instantly, with the understanding that Patton’s attack, under Bradley, was to begin no earlier than the twenty-second and no later than the twenty-third. It was agreed further that when Patton’s forces had
