He sat in with us as we talked but offered no word of comment. After De Gaulle left he quietly remarked to me, “I think you’ve done the wise and proper thing.”  During the battle the Luftwaffe attempted to operate on a more intensive scale than at any time since the early days of the campaign. On January 1 the German Air Force came out in the strongest attack it had attempted against us in months. Its principal targets were Allied airfields, particularly those lying near the Bulge and to the northward thereof. During the course of the dayhe Germans destroyed many of our planes, most of them on the ground.
