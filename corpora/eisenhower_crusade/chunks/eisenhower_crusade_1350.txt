Roer into the path of the Canadian advance. Montgomery was not too dis- pleased by this transfer of German weight because of the promise it held that, once the American attack began, it would advance with great speed.|171  I visited General Simpson’s Ninth Army during this period and found it keyed up and well prepared for the attack. If Simpson ever made a mistake as an army commander, it never came to my attention.

Preceded by a violent bombardment, the Ninth Army got off as scheduled and succeeded in crossing
