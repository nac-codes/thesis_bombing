However, some of the local enemy detachments stubbornly defended themselves and we saw sporadic fighting throughout the day.  General Pattonâ€™s army had overrun and discovered Nazi treasure, hidden away in the lower levels of a deep salt mine./6! A group of us descended the shaft, almost a half mile under the surface of the earth.

There was also a great amount of minted gold from the different countries of Europe and even a few millions of gold coins from the United States.

The safe door was so formidable that heavy explosive charges would certainly have been necessary for its demolition. However, to an American soldier who inspected it the surrounding brick wall did not look particularly
