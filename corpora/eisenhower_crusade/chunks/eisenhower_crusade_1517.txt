American soldiers, both individually and in groups up to the size of a division. But on that occasion I was momentarily at aloss for something to say. Every one of those present had undergone privation beyond the imagination of the normal human. It seemed futile to attempt, out of my own experience, to say anything that could possibly appeal to such an enormous accumulation of knowledge of suffering.  Then I had a happy thought.
