One of the prominent military figures in Great Britain, he was the immediate associate of Mr. Churchill in the latter’s capacity as Defense Minister. Ismay’s position as head of the secretarial staff to the War Cabinet and the British Chiefs of Staff was, from the American point of view, a critical one because it was through him that any subject could at any moment be brought to the attention of the Prime Minister and his principal assistants.
