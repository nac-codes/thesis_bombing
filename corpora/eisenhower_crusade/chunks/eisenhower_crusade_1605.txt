sions and four airborne divisions, a mountain division, four seaborne brigades for the operation of landing craft, besides amphibious and combat engineer units, brigades, and separate battalions of anti-aircraft units, field artillery and tank destroyer battalions by the score. Equally stupendous was the growth of American air strength in those two theaters; between our entry into the war and the German surrender our fighter planes had won superiority over the Luftwaffe and our bombers had penetrated every defense which the German had raised against them.  Intercontinental communications, transport and administrative systems were established and a military government structure was built to control millions of enemy nationals. Conduct of operations required co-ordination with the civil ministries of foreign nations organized differently from our own, combined staff work with Allied armies, new methods of strategic command within our own military establishment, and diplomatic negotiations seldom entrusted to a combat force. No prewar definition of the Armyâ€™s mission could adequately have forecast the scope or ramifications of its job against the European Axis. From study of both achievements and mistakes much could be learned.  Purely military operations constituted a vast and continuous offensive, prolonged over many months, that required assessment and evaluation of its lessons. The task set for the Allied Force was one of the most difficult ever to confront an army in the field. From North Africa through Sicily and Italy and the assault against Festung Europa, our units had to land on beaches, fight many days with- out the support of even a mediocre port, make good their positions against superior ground forces, and finally build up a strength that could accomplish the complete destruction of the enemy.  In all the campaigns, and particularly in western Europe, our guiding principle was to avoid at any cost the freezing of battle lines that might bog down our troop
