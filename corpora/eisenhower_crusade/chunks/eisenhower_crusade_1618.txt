nd both its tactical achievements and errors were subject to direct scrutiny, we could add an immense store of factual knowledge to the science of warfare—the speedy attainment of military victory at minimum expense in lives.  For this purpose we organized immediately after the cessation of hostilities a large board of the most experienced and at the same time most progressive officers we could find. The board was originally headed by General Gerow, who was later replaced by General Patton.111  In order that the War Department might have permanently available all the facts, so far as we could unearth them, and the opinions of the men most experienced in the actual business of fighting and of battlefield maintenance and administration, the board was provided with every possible facility and was given all the time it desired for the completion of its task.  Foremost among the military lessons was the extraordinary and growing influence of the airplane in the waging of war. The European campaign almost daily developed new and valuable uses for air power. Its effect in the weakening of German capacity was decisively felt on both fronts, the Allied and the Russian. Beyond this, the airplane was a valuable logistics agent, particularly during our speedy dashes across France in the fall of 1944 and across Germany in the spring of 1945; without it those pursuits could never have proceeded with such speed nor could they have accomplished such remarkable results.  The important road center of Bastogne could not have been held by the 101st Division during the German counteroffensive in December 1944 except for the airplanes that delivered 800,000 pounds of supplies to the division during the critical days between the twenty-third and twenty-seventh of December.!2l During our largest airborne operation, known as Varsity, in support of Montgomery’s crossing of the Rhine River on March 24, 1945, 1,625 airplane and 1,348 glider sorties carried into battle more than 22,000 troops a
