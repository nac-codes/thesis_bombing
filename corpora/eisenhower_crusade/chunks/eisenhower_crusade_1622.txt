airplane in the waging of war. The European campaign almost daily developed new and valtvable uses for air power. Its effect in the weakening of German capacity was decisively felt on both fronts, the Allied and the Russian. Beyond this, the airplane was a valuable logistics agent, particularly during our speedy dashes across France in the fall of 1944 and across Germany in the spring of 1945; without it those pursuits could never have proceeded with such speed nor could they have accomplished such remarkable results.  The important road center of Bastogne could not have been held by the 101st Division during the German counteroffensive in December 1944 except for the airplanes that delivered 800,000 pounds of supplies to the division during the critical days between the twenty-third and twenty-seventh of December.!21 During our largest airborne operation, known as Varsity, in support of Montgomery’s crossing of the Rhine River on March 24, 1945, 1,625 airplane and 1,348 glider sorties carried into battle more than 22,000 troops and almost 5,000,000 pounds of equipment.!3! The airplane became also a most valuable means of obtaining information of the enemy, not only at his major bases but along the actual battle front. Airplane photography searched out even minute details of defensive and offensive organization and our techniques were developed to the point that information so derived was available to our troops within a matter of hours.  The combination of an overwhelming air force and the great mobility provided by the vehicular equipment of the Army enabled us to strike at any chosen point along a front of hundreds of miles. [4] Our flexibility was nowhere better illustrated than during the German counteroffensive in the Ardennes when Patton’s army ceased its preparations for an eastward attack, changed front, and undertook a movement extending over sixty to seventy miles at right angles to its former direction of advance. In less than seventy-two hours from the
