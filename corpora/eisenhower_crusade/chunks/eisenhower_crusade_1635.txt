Regardless of any progress made in the country’s educational institutions, the Army’s business is success in war—and the Army cannot safely neglect any subject that experience has shown to be important to that success.  All the developments in method, equipment, and destructive power that we were studying seemed minor innovations compared to the revolutionary impact of the atom bomb. None was used in the European theater and none was ever planned for use there.
