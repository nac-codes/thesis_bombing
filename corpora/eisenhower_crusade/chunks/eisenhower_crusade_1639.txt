This fact affected every detail of American official routine in conquered Germany, for any prolonged struggle between the two powers would hopelessly complicate our local problems and might even nullify our costly victory. But there was involved far more than efficiency in German ad- ministration or political control.  What permanence the new-won peace might have; what stature the United Nations could attain; even what the future course of civilization would beâ€”the answers to these questions now clearly involved, as an important factor, the ability of East and West to work together and live together in one world.

Except for a short period, their diplomatic relations had been continuous. Both were free from the stigma of colonial empire building by force. The transfer between them of the rich Alaskan territory was an unmatched international episode, devoid of threat at the time and of any recrimination after the exchange.

Out of this cleavage between the governmental systems of two great powers there might develop in the world two hostile camps whose d
