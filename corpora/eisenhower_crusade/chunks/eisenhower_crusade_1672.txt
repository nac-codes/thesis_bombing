for a young lieutenant to remind us “who really won the war.”  The return trip from Leningrad to Berlin became unpleasant when the weather turned bad. During our flights through Russia our agreements required us to use a Russian navigator. Their navigators seemed quite skillful in orienting themselves by terrain features in the countryside, with which they were very familiar. Apparently, they were not so proficient in celestial navigation and would never give us authority to fly at a greater height than would permit them to see the ground.
