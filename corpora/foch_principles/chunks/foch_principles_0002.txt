As a help to all who are taking part in the struggle against autocracy and to their friends at home, these lec- tures of the great leader of our allied armies have been translated into English. They were given before this war began, yet General Foch seems to have foreseen it, and from his first brilliant work at the Battle of the Marne until now he has consistently lived up to every principle which he had laid down at that time. It will be apparent that he considers the present period, long and costly as it has been, as but one of preparation for the decisive battle to come. His calm confidence is explained, and the reader will understand what method makes him willing, meanwhile, to sacrifice important ground in order to save the reserve which, he tells us, must be kept intact for that decisive battle. General Foch uses historical examples in explaining his theories, but he does not indulge in highly technical lan- guage, so that this work requires of the reader no pre- liminary knowledge whatever of the science of war.
