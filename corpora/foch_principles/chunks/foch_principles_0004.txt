methods to follow and to foresee pos- sible results. The teaching of war goes back to the most ancient times, but it is not until 1882-1883 that we find in France any efficient and practical instruction in warfare. Where was the difficulty? Was it to be found in the nature of the matter taught, in the true theory of war, or was it in the manner of teaching this theory after it was ascertained? The difficulty was due to both causes. The theories prevailing among us until that time were incorrect. They truly listed the different factors which affect the result of war: superiority of morale, of knowl- edge, of command, of armament, of supplies, of defense, etc. They truly explained that the result depended on such factors, but they divided them all into two classes: 1. The first were the moral advantages: quality of the troops, of the command, amount of energy shown, pas- sions displayed, etc., which cannot be figured exactly as to quantity; all of these were systematically left out of a reasoned study and of a theory which it was desired to make a scientific one of war; or rather, all of these were presumed to be equal on either side. 2. The second class comprised all material factors which influence results: armament, commissary, nature of the ground, numbers, etc., but which are far from being everything. At the same time that moral factors were eliminated as   ## p. 9 (#15) ###############################################  THE TEACHING OF WAR 9 causes they were also eliminated as results. Defeat thus became the product of material factors, whereas we shall find it later to really be a purely moral result, the result of a state of mind, of discouragement, of fear brought on the vanquished by a combined use of moral and material factors employed simultaneously by the victor. The theory was therefore that to be victorious one must have numbers, better armament, bases of supplies, the advantage of terrain. The armies of the Revolution, Napoleon in particular, later answ
