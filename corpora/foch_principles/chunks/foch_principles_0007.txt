As a matter of fact, there is no studying on the battle- field. It is then simply a case of doing what is possible to make use of what one knows.

"The more an army lacks war experience," wrote Gen- eral de Peucker, "the more it needs to make use of the history of war for its instruction. Although the history of war is no substitute for actual experience it can be a foundation for such experience. In peace times it be- comes the true method of learning war an
