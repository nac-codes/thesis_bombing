In peace times it be- comes the true method of learning war and of determin- ing the invariable principles of the art of war." This education sprung from the teachings of history has resulted in a theory of war which can be taught and which will be taught further, and in a doctrine which can be practiced. In other words, there exist a certain num- ber of invariable principles, of which the application varies according to circumstances. Dragomirow explained the same idea in the following words: "Science and theory are two entirely different things, for every form of art can and should have its theory, but it cannot be made into a science. . . .

Recipes for creating masterpieces such as Austerlitz, Friedland, Wagram, for conducting such campaigns as that of 1799 in Switzer- land or for winning battles such as that of Koeniggr√§tz, we cannot obtain from theory. But it does explain these models as types for study, not
