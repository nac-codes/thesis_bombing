How can sound judgment and decision be trained in a school? Marshal von Moltke explains it thus: "The teaching of military facts is especially intended to cause the pupil to use his knowledge (that is, the theory which has been taught him). But a result of this nature cannot be obtained if the instructor merely lec- tures and the pupil merely listens. It can be obtained, however, quite naturally when the teacher adds to his technical instruction some forms of practice in the course of which the matters taught are applied to specific cases."   ## p. 15 (#21) ##############################################  THE TEACHING OF WAR 15 Such is the method used: first learn the rules, then apply them to specific cases. It will be shown later what is meant by "specific cases.' Writing along the same lines, General de Peucker adds: "Officers must be trained constantly to act independently, in order to develop in them the power of using their theoretical knowledge in the practical questions of life. To dimly realize some scientific truth does not necessarily mean that it can be found again later by reasoning. It is a long way from conception to the precious ability of turning acquired military knowledge into the foundation of our decisions. "Between these two things: scientific conception and art of command there is an enormous step which the method of teaching must enable a pupil to take if it is to be an efficient method." Thus appear both the method to be used and the goal to be reached: to pass from scientific conception on to the art of command, from a truth known and understood on to the practical application
