hod." Thus appear both the method to be used and the goal to be reached: to pass from scientific conception on to the art of command, from a truth known and understood on to the practical application of such truth. This enor- mous step was successfully taken by the Prussians, as shown by the chiefs of their advance guards who in 1866, recently graduated from their schools, undertook the operations of that campaign with an assurance, and there- fore an energy of execution, believed until then to belong only to men who had fought much and well. Let us do as they did, and for that purpose make use of practical teaching embodying the application to specific cases of invariable principles gleaned from history. In this manner can experience be prepared, the art of com- mand learnt, and finally the habit acquired of acting correctly without having to reason.   ## p. 16 (#22) ##############################################  16 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR I have spoken of specific cases because in war there are none but specific cases; everything is individual, and there is no duplication. The elements of a war problem, to begin with, are only seldom certain, they are never definite. Everything is in a constant state of change. These elements have there- fore only a relative value instead of the absolute values used in a problem of mathematics. Where only one company of men has been sighted at a certain hour a battalion is found when attacking shortly later. A regiment of 3,000 rifles properly handled means, after a few days of campaigning, 2,800 rifles; with a smaller amount of care it may mean only 2,000 rifles. Variations in morale are at least equivalent. How can we then compare two regiments? They represent under a same name two bodies absolutely different. Sickness, fatigue, strain of every kind influence different units in different ways. Some of them soon cease to have any fighting value and become mere groups of starving, sick, worn-out men. The same applies to the tactica
