in of every kind influence different units in different ways. Some of them soon cease to have any fighting value and become mere groups of starving, sick, worn-out men. The same applies to the tactical situa- tion which varies correspondingly; the advantage of one of the opponents is not always the opposite of the advan- tage of the other. Suppose a convoy is to be escorted by one, attacked by the other; evidently the method of com- bat will not be the same for both sides. On the same ground, under the same conditions of time and space it will be necessary to proceed along different lines in either. case. The same regiment, the same battalion, will not fight in the same manner when pursuing a beaten enemy or engaging a fresh opponent, although in both cases they   ## p. 17 (#23) ##############################################  THE TEACHING OF WAR 17 employ the same men, the same rifles, the same supplies. Again, the same thing applies to two advance guard engagements: one can never be quite similar to the other as regards dispositions to be taken, because while they are both governed by similar considerations the ground varies in either case and there are differences in time. and space. Each case is therefore individual and has distinctive factors to be considered: ground, condition of the troops, tactical situation, etc., which make it a special problem. Certain considerations acquire unusual importance, others lose some. From this lack of similarity in different problems re- sults the impossibility of working them out from memory alone, and the only correct answer can be found in the correct use of invariable principles adapted to the special circumstances. Invariable principles adapted to the special circum- stances of every problem, does not that method take us back to the anarchy of ideas which it had been thought to replace by one general formula, a universal theory? As a matter of fact it does not take us back to such a condition because a similarity is bound
