to the anarchy of ideas which it had been thought to replace by one general formula, a universal theory? As a matter of fact it does not take us back to such a condition because a similarity is bound to come in the adaptation of invariable principles to different cases, as the result of a similar manner of considering the question: in a manner that is purely objective. From a similar manner of considering questions will come a similar manner of understanding them, and from the similar manner of understanding comes a similar manner of action. The latter soon becomes instinctive. In war there is but one manner of considering every question, that is the objective manner.

The object in every case is the answer to the question which faced Verdy du Vernois as he reached the field of battle at Nachod. Realizing the difficulties to be overcome he seeks in vain through his memory for an example or a principle which will show him what to do. No inspiration comes. "To the devil," says he, "with history and principles ! after all, what is my objective?" And his mind is imme- diately made up. Such is the objective manner of han- dling a problem. A move is considered in relation to the objective in the widest sense of the word: WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE? This similar manner of considering questions and of understanding them causes a similar manner of action. But what follows is an unrestricted application of every means to the objective sought. The habit once formed of thus studying and acting on many specific cases, it will be instinctively and alm
