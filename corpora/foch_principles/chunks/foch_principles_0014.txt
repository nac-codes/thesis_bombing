tion. But what follows is an unrestricted application of every means to the objective sought. The habit once formed of thus studying and acting on many specific cases, it will be instinctively and almost unconsciously that the work is done. Verdy du Vernois is an instance. "To the devil," says he, "with history and principles," yet he makes use of his knowledge of history and principles; without train- ing along such lines, without the acquired habit of rea- soning and deciding he would have been unable to face a difficult situation.

To add to our studies we shall consider (also in the light of history) the higher branches of war. Teaching may here be less didactic but it will not be less profitable. "The roads which lead to knowledge are the road of history and that of philosophy; both can and must com- plete one another to promote knowledge of war and to prepare power which, perfected by instruction in peace time, must finally as the art of leading troops bring in war such results as come from the wisest counsel, the strongest will" (Von Scherf). Napoleon said: "One may teach tactics, military engi- neering, artillery work about as one teaches geometry. But knowledge of the higher branches of war is only acquired by experience and by a study of the history of the wars of great generals. It is not in a grammar that one learns to compose a great poem, to write a tragedy." Which does not mean that grammar must not be learnt, but that in every art a knowledge of the principles is not synonymous of a power to create. After having learnt our grammar and seen how it is applied we shall examine some masterpieces to see how the human mind works in the higher branches of the art, in strategy especially. Y
