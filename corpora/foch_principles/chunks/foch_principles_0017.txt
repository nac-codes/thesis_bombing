echnical means of war: railroads, aeroplanes, telegraphy have increased so that: "To-day the General- in-chief can no longer direct everything. Even a genius requires a staff of helpers filled with initiative and thor- oughly trained. How much more will a general not of unusual merit need to be assisted. The command of an army is too complex for a single man. At the same time, certain technical questions require special knowledge " (Von der Goltz).   ## p. 22 (#28) ##############################################  22 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR And so, lacking a sufficient genius, where can we find the means of efficiently carrying through the undertaking, war with such masses of men, unless it be in a body of officers rendered efficient by method, by work, by science, guided by a similar spirit, obeying the same mental discipline, and numerous enough to handle and guide the heavy machinery of modern armies? We must first understand truths, and therefore have an open mind, without prejudice, ready-made ideas, or theories blindly accepted merely because they rest on tradition. One standard alone, that of reason. Then we must apply these truths to specific cases, on the map at first, on the ground later, the battlefield ultimately. Let us not look for similarities, let us not appeal to our memory, it would desert us at the first cannon shot, and let us avoid all charts or formulae. We wish to reach the field with a trained power of judgment; it only needs to have us train it, to have us begin training it to-day. Let us for that purpose seek the reason of things; that will show us how to use them. It is necessary, finally, to employ unconsciously some truths. For that purpose they must be so familiar to us as to have entered into our bones, to be a component part of ourselves. Those are happy who are born believers, but they are not numerous. Neither is a man born learned or born muscular. Each one of us must build up his faith, his beliefs, his knowledge, his muscles. Results
