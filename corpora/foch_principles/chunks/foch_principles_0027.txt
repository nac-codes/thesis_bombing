All those principles and methods are founded on ma- terial things in times of peace, on the material element which keeps all its importance in peace training as op- posed to the moral element which cannot then be shown. or considered. For instance: the battle of the Alma, a duplication of which in peace maneuvers would be a victory for the Russians, a defeat for the French, the nature of the ground makes it inevitable. And the peace tactician concludes that scarpments similar to those of the Alma being insurmountable they need not be protected. The scores made in target practice, the effects of artil- lery fire on the ranges, are found to make any attack impossible.
