In this manner, if the teaching of history is neglected, the practices of peace times bring us back slowly but inevitably to the old style of fencing through the undue importance attached to material means.   ## p. 35 (#41) ##############################################  MODERN WARFARE 35 The French generals of 1870 prove that fact, as did the Prussians of 1806. On either side, as Von der Goltz says, "when the enemy threatens, the strategists study the ground, draw up imaginary plans of cam- paign and seek positions which they may or may not find." Such is the brief history of our sad experience of 1870. First, as regards positions, we find Cadenbronn, Froeschwiller, the forest of Haye, each one of which in turn is to assure the safety of the nation. Secondly, there are imaginary plans. We shall cross the Rhine: where, when, how, by what means? that mat- ters little. A junction with the Austrians is to be made in Bohemia. Combinations are believed valuable in them- selves, without regard to time, to space, to the aim sought.
