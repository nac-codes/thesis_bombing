We cannot neglect either the aims of war, its purpose or the means it offers, because it is from the study of all these that we must decide on what use to make of such means, what tactics to employ and what objective to keep in mind. War receives its impetus and its form from the ideas and emotions which prevail when it breaks out.

He could no longer
