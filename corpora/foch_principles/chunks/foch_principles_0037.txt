itself, since it has value only by tactics, since tactical results are every- thing, let us see what these tactical results are made of. Here again"modern war is based on the ideas of Napoleon who was the first to show the importance of preparation and the power of mass multiplied by impul sion to shatter, in a battle sought from the beginning of the war, the moral and material resources of the ad- versary (Clausewitz). "" Later on, when we study the action of force, we shall conclude by reasoning to this method of understanding battle, the necessity of striking a powerful and decisive blow. Let us, for the time being, keep to that outline drawn from history, and characterized by: Preparation; Mass;   ## p. 44 (#50) ##############################################  44 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR Impulsion. Preparation in modern war is more necessary, and needs to be pushed further, than in the past. Unless that principle is accepted one is handicapped in comparison to the opponent. No longer are preparations estimated in months or weeks, but in days, hours and sometimes minutes. "" An advance of three days in the French mobiliza- tion," says Von der Goltz, "would allow the French to besiege Metz and Thionville, to sever communications with Strasburg, and to reach the Sarre before the Ger- mans could prevent it. The latter would be obliged to concentrate back on the ground where they concentrated in 1870, that is on the Rhine." The same applies to the point of assembly, chosen as near as possible to the frontier. It is certain that Château- Salins is 27 kilometers away from Nancy, that Nancy is occupied by a powerful French garrison, and that round Château-Salins we should see, at the very start of war, considerable mobilization of German troops. That necessity of preparation pushed as far as possible is found in every tactical action which you will study, in order not to give the advantage to the opponent, and in order to avoid on the field mistakes which always entail grea
