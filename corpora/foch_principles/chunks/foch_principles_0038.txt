shed as far as possible is found in every tactical action which you will study, in order not to give the advantage to the opponent, and in order to avoid on the field mistakes which always entail great sacrifices, considering the terrible power of modern weapons. Let us consider the tactical action itself. Of what does it consist? We have found only one way of dealing with the opponent, which is to beat him, and therefore to knock him down. From which we gather the idea of shock made up of two things, mass and impulsion.   ## p. 45 (#51) ##############################################  MODERN WARFARE 45 We have spoken of the mass; it absorbs for war all the physical and moral resources of the nation.

The tactics of battle must tend to movement, and the theory which seeks the hardest possible shock entails as a primary condition of strategy to bring for- ward all the troops. It is then by movement that troops assemble, prepare for battle. Movement is the rule of strategy. But the shock could be awaited?
