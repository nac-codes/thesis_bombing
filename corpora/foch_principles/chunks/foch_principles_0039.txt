This law, combined with the idea of shock, makes the leadership of troops a problem of force in time and in space, and when we remember that the movements to seek, prepare and execute battle are carried out against an opponent who is also moving, the problem becomes one of dynamics of which only one factor is known to us. We know the position and approximate power of our   ## p. 46 (#52) ##############################################  46 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR own forces, but we have only a vague idea of the power and position of the enemy. The moving and unknown enemy must be therefore discovered and immobilized so that we may strike him: that necessitates a certain number of detached troops, having special missions and obliged to maneuver in order to fulfill these missions. But any unbeaten opponent is also free to move. The meeting of forces at which we aim must therefore have protection against attacks which would otherwise prevent our marching, our assembling, our striking. That neces- sitates a service of protection, detached troops com- pelled also to maneuver. At the same time as we seek to concentrate we seek to prevent the concentration of our opponent; at the same time as we seek to preserve our liberty of action to carry out our plan we seek to destroy his in order to strike him. Hence the need for still more detached troops. From which we find that the primary idea of reaching the battle with the greater part of one's forces entails: (1) The necessity of having always that greater part ready, and of maneuvering it; (2) Also, and first of all, the need of detaching numer- ous bodies all destined to facilitate the work of the main body, having thereby a subordinate mission, and also com- pelled to maneuver. Apparently this entails dispersion instead of the concentration desired. We shall see in the next lecture how the principle of economy of forces enables us to conciliate these contra- dictory conditions: to strike with a concentrated whole after having
