As S has been seen previously, modern war knows only of one argument: the tactical fact, the battle, for which it requires all the forces, relying on strategy to bring them there, and engaging all these forces with tactical impulsion to arrive to shock. That theory compels movements and maneuvering. But at the same time as it aims at battle, it recognizes the nec- cessity of detaching troops to discover the enemy; ascertain his strength; immobilize him; cover and protect the concentration of its own side; maintain the dispersion of the enemy; and prevent his concentration. In opposition therefore to the theory which prescribes concentration arises the execution which prescribes dis- persion, or at least much detaching of troops. Does not that show the theory to be inapplicable? The theory appears much more inapplicable still if we remember the forces that are moved, 48   ## p. 49 (#55) ##############################################  THE ECONOMY OF FORCES 49 One readily conceives how could be brought to the same battle, on the same spot, at the same time, an army like that of Turenne or of Frederick, provided with tents and stores, which advanced as a whole, whose every com- ponent part-and they were comparatively few-lived, marched and arrived easily together in sight of an enemy holding certain positions, whose immobility was an ele- ment of strength, who therefore allowed time to assem- ble the troops and to deploy them with proper method. But to-day, with numbers running into the millions, the armies are compelled to stretch out in order to advance, to live, to camp. They are divided into a number of columns, and each column is lengthy. The space occupied in width and depth is immense. Two of our French army corps marching on the same road, one behind the other, with only their fighting ele- ments, occupy approximately 40 miles. To concentrate them
