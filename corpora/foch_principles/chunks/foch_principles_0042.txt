ied in width and depth is immense. Two of our French army corps marching on the same road, one behind the other, with only their fighting ele- ments, occupy approximately 40 miles. To concentrate them at the head of the column would take nearly three days. The same applies to the extent of front which can extend conceivably over a hundred miles. Is there any way of conducting an action which entails such forces, which is carried on over such spaces? Our lecture of to-day seeks to show the existence of a dominating principle which enables us to carry out that theoretical play of forces, even with considerable num- bers, even against an enemy who maneuvers; to spread them in time and in space, and to employ them in two different manners so as to finally apply them as desired, strategically and tactically: concentration at one point in unity of time and unity of space. This dominating principle, known as the principle of   ## p. 50 (#56) ##############################################  50 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR the economy of forces, sprang from the revolutionary period, like the difficulties which it overcame.

But that is not all. If you said that it is the art of not spending one's forces, of not dispersing one's forces, you would only say a part of the truth. You might come n
