recently— The application of the whole on one point, and for that purpose the organization of the mass into a system of attack, joined as interchangeable parts, operating separately but aiming always at the same positive result, at a same objective to be mastered by differ- ent means. It is to Carnot that we first owe this manner of under- standing war, of organizing it, of directing it.

To assemble and to employ together troops apparently dispersed, that is the first result which he has sought and obtained. And in the same manner at Wattignies, one of the early battles of the Revolution in which he took part, one sees the birth of the idea of attack by superior forces at one point of the line.
