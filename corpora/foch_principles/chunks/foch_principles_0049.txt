With his main body. In everything, therefore, whether it concern the direc- tion of the mass or the leadership of a detachment, the commander of the mass, like the commander of the de- tachment, must: Determine the main purpose to be served (that appears from the duty assigned); Employ to that end the main part of his forces; Organize the auxiliaries, supply the detachments neces- sary to the success of the main body; Maintain communications between the main body and the auxiliaries, that is organize the forces in such fashion that they may eventually be used as a whole. ADVANCE GUARDS The simplest form of protection is that supplied by Advance Guards. Let us, for instance, suppose a body of troops at rest in the position a, b, c, to be guarding along DE against an enemy expected from the north, and a regiment ordered to furnish the Outposts. The first idea will consist in extending the men uni- formly along DE. If DE is 4,000 meters in length, that will allow one man per meter; that would permit resistance, but very weak resistance. The enemy will appear, throw his advance guard along the whole front, hold the defenders along the line DE and, bringing his main body to bear against one point, L for instance, he will easily overcome what resistance   ## p. 58 (#64) ##############################################  58 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR he encounters there. Against one or two hundred men he will have been able to employ three thousand. The principle of the economy of forces applied here will make use of the capacity of resistance of the troops, of their power of shock; two factors as against one. It will say to us: Instead of holding evenly DE it is sufficient to consider along the distance DE the direc- K .b M .c E tions K, L, M, N, by which the ene
