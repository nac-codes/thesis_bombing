It will say to us: Instead of holding evenly DE it is sufficient to consider along the distance DE the direc- K .b M .c E tions K, L, M, N, by which the enemy may present him- self, and to hold them with troops detached at points K, L, M, N, which by their nature allow of serious resistance; locate these detachments on strong positions. These positions being held, the whole line is held be- cause the enemy can no longer, in view of the range of modern weapons, pass between the positions. He is therefore compelled to attack them. Behind these detachments (Pickets) destined to resist on their positions will be located a Reserve capable of being brought to the point attacked, within the time its resistance can last, and capable of action at that point. Because every Picket needs to be warned in time of   ## p. 59 (#65) ##############################################  THE ECONOMY OF FORCES 59 the enemy's arrival, it will post some watchers, Sentries, which, because they need themselves to be supported and relieved, will necessitate Sentry Posts. When the enemy appears: The Sentries give the alarm; The alarm reaches the Pickets and the Reserve; The Pickets prepare to resist; The Reserve prepares to advance. While continuing to advance, the enemy must push home his attack in order to overcome resistance at the point which he wishes to seize. The Reserve moves to that point while it is resisting. A regiment of 4,000 men, having four companies for outpost duty along the distance DE, for instance, will thus offer at the point of attack: 3,000 men (reserve) + 250 men (picket at point at- tacked) 3,250 men as against an approximate hundred in the case of uniform distribution. = But in order to make the maneuver possible, the forces must be grouped in one system, comprising: Pickets capable of resistance, located therefore on strong positions or on positions allowing by day good fields of fire; Mobile Reserve, capable of maneuver withi
