e grouped in one system, comprising: Pickets capable of resistance, located therefore on strong positions or on positions allowing by day good fields of fire; Mobile Reserve, capable of maneuver within the de- sired space and time, having for that purpose the neces- sary roads; assembled; protected against the enemy's blows; Sentries who can watch. The same considerations apply to the defense of a stream: To occupy on the dangerous roads strong positions (usually on the stream, because positions are found there   ## p. 60 (#66) ##############################################  60 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR and certain crossings only possible for the enemy) capable of a resistance which allows the reserve R to reach the point attacked, M for instance, and to employ all its forces in that direction. The same also applies to the siege of fortified towns, which can be carried out with forces equal to the forces besieged (Metz, Paris). A siege under these circumstances is carried out by means of a Picket line, held permanently and allowing the besieging troops to occupy, in case of attack, a First Line of Resistance organized in advance. When the at- tack occurs, the alarm is given by the Pickets, the First Line of Resistance is occupied, the reserves get ready. The attackers, after having fairly easily overcome the Picket Line, must, in order to continue their advance, break the First Line of Resistance; to that end they are compelled to concentrate their efforts and expose their chosen direction. The reserves and unattacked besieging troops nearest to that direction take up positions, while the resistance of the first line holds, on a Main Line of Resistance organized in advance. They offer there a resistance which gives the whole besieging army time to concentrate at some point, in the direction chosen by the attackers, and to fight there with all its resources. Again, the same principle is followed in every attack. Then also, in order to obtain maximum results, economy of f
