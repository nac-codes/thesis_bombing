in the direction chosen by the attackers, and to fight there with all its resources. Again, the same principle is followed in every attack. Then also, in order to obtain maximum results, economy of forces is used, and the troops are employed as an organized whole. Attack could not be efficiently carried out in several directions at one time. That would divide the forces into several parts. If the enemy appears in two direc- tions, the offensive is organized in one direction, the most   ## p. 61 (#67) ##############################################  THE ECONOMY OF FORCES 61 favorable one; in the other direction he can be merely held. In consequence, the reserves, that is the Main Body, are so placed and used as to push home the attack planned by the commander, and to reinforce the protecting troops if that should become necessary. As the decisive moment approaches, all these reserves move to the attack which will decide matters, and which must therefore dispose of all available forces. Again the same principle applies to every action of the existence of troops, characterized by movement. The detachments formed for the necessary purposes which we have discussed are never more than the eyes, the fingers, the arms of one body (the Main Body) for which they work. That decides the form they should take and their close relationship with the Main Body. They keep a relative independence, their own tactical plans, while carrying out their duties, just as my arm can protect my body, strike forward, to the right or to the left at the same time as I continue to advance. But they must remain by the body in whose movement they have a part, from whom they draw their existence, in close enough relationship so that the body may always, in whatever direction the opponent appears, make use of all its weight. The whole system must therefore include: Eyes turned toward the interesting directions; Arms stretched towards the dangerous directions; A body keeping its freedom of movement for
