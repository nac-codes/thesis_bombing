The Directoire undertakes, therefore, to have the Repub- lic of Genoa furnish, willingly or otherwise, the most nec- essary help. Schérer, overwhelmed by such a task and by sc bold a plan, asks to be relieved of his command in favor of a younger and bolder chief. Salicetti then appears as the government's representa- tive at the Army of Italy; his efforts are at first in vain; he vainly endeavors to have Schérer alter his decision; he vainly asks the Senate of Genoa to lend a few millions to France. He is compelled to resort to threats. Accord- ing to his plans, a body of French troops will occupy Voltri, and by the Bochetta it will seize the Genoese fortified place of Gavi. Schérer partly agrees with the idea, organizes an expeditionary force from the three divisions of Augereau, Laharpe, Meynier, 9,000 men al- together, and gives the command to Masséna with special instructions. The latter is to move to Savone, and to throw on March 26th at Voltri under Pijon an advance guard (3,000 men), the patrols of which will reach San Pier d'Arena, a suburb of Genoa. As for the Gavi ex- pedition, it can wait until the arrival of Bonaparte who has just been appointed in command of the Army of Italy. On March 26th Bonaparte reaches Nice to assume his duties. He finds there Berthier, previously requested by Schérer as Chief of Staff, attached to the new Army Com- mander. Already were felt the results of the impulse given by Salicetti to all the services.
