the obstacles to entering Piedmont along the heights of the Alps, Carnot in his notes of June 30th, 1794, said: "" If one should wish therefore to attack Pied- mont, it should be through the Department of the Alpes Maritimes, taking first Oneille. "Those reasons should decide the Committee of Pub- lic Safety to order the attack of Oneille, from where it will later be easy for us to enter Piedmont, taking Saorge in the rear and besieging Coni." Bonaparte has a better plan. He has waged in that region the campaign of 1794 (battle of Dego). He has seen the neighborhood of Altare, Carcare, Cairo, a deep depression, 6 to 10 miles wide, giving access to the Italian valleys. "From Vado to Ceva, first frontier post of Sardinia on the Tanaro, there is somewhat over 20 miles, without any great height. "" Snow never prevents passage there; the higher places are covered with it in winter, but in no great quantity. "Savone, a seaport and fortified town, was in a favor- able location to be used as a base. From that city to the   ## p. 66 (#72) ##############################################  66 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR Madona the distance is 3 miles; a metal road joined them, and from the Madona to Carcare there are 6 miles which could be made practicable for artillery in a few days. In Carcare are found roads leading to the interior of Pied- mont and Montferrat; that point was the only one at which one could enter Italy without encountering moun- tains" (Napoleon). Napoleon has therefore found a passage of low height, with easy slopes and good roads from which one can easily rush at the enemy, cross the gates of Piedmont, in short assume the offensive under favorable tactical circumstances. But there is still another advantage to marching on Carcare: At Carcare the roads meet which (1) By Acqui lead to Alexandria in Lombardy; (2) By Ceva lead to Cherasco in Piedmont. To the north of Carcare is a height of 2,000 to 2,600 feet which, over nearly 50 miles, as far as the road from Cher
