By Acqui lead to Alexandria in Lombardy; (2) By Ceva lead to Cherasco in Piedmont. To the north of Carcare is a height of 2,000 to 2,600 feet which, over nearly 50 miles, as far as the road from Cherasco to Alexandria, prevents all communication be- tween both provinces.

The claim is denied. The Aus- trian Emperor himself has
