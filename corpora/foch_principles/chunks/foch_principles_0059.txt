ed in protecting Turin, the Aus- trians in protecting Milan" (Napoleon). The separation being accomplished, what was the first objective to seize? The Austrian army or the Pied- montese army? Two theories are in presence: that of Carnot and that of Bonaparte. The former, filled with his mechanical conception of forces, will push it to the degree of absurdity, neglecting to consider a special geographical and political condition which will not escape Bonaparte. So much is it true that in war there is no universal system; the most assured of principles need to be applied according to circumstances.   ## p. 69 (#75) ##############################################  THE ECONOMY OF FORCES 69 The theory of Carnot is: " After having mastered Ceva and approached the left of the Italian Army of Coni... the General in Chief will direct his forces against the Milanese and especially against the Aus- trians. . .; he will not forget that the Austrians are the principal enemy to defeat. . . "" To march against the main army, to defeat it, was to end the war according to Carnot because there was the center of gravity of the resistance to be overcome. That theory would have been true if both armies had formed a system, that is one whole of forces joined to operate together, whereas they represented two distinct unities, with different interests, two separate masses, each having its own center of gravity and its own attractions. It meant two opponents to defeat separately, two ques- tions to handle differently; one could not end the war by striking one of the armies, even the stronger one. On the other hand, if one chose the stronger one as first objective, one could not neglect the weaker one which maneuvered independently. It was necessary to see to what extent it might oppose the action undertaken. The geographical position of Piedmont and the condition of the Sardinian army appear here distinctly. As Bonaparte points out, the French, in order to con- tinue to act against the Austr
