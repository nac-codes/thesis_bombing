As Bonaparte points out, the French, in order to con- tinue to act against the Austrians with such a precarious line of communications as that of the River, destined to stretch into Lombardy and Venetia, had to protect them- selves efficiently against the Sardinians; they must em- ploy, therefore, for the protection of that line some forces of which the absence would, in their condition of numerical weakness, be doubly felt on the principal   ## p. 70 (#76) ##############################################  70 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR theater of operations, preventing there any decisive result. The necessity was therefore imperative of settling first the Sardinian question. One could only attack the Aus- trians after having beaten and destroyed the Sardinian army; the road to the invasion of Lombardy and Venetia ran through Piedmont. The case was a peculiar one, as every case is.

He will dare everything. Opposite him, Beaulieu has just assumed command of the Austrian army (he no longer commands the Sar- dinians); he is seventy-two years old, has a position and reputation which must not be compromised.
