mps. From the 2nd to the 9th he makes no move; he com- pletes the preparation of his plan, confers with the Eng- lish about preparing a trap for the Laharpe division and destroying it by a treble attack. Finally, about the 5th or 6th, he settles his plans and gives his orders.   ## p. 72 (#78) ##############################################  72 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR A central body under Argenteau, made up of 4 Pied- montese battalions and 12 Austrian battalions of which part will gather at Acqui, will march by Montenotte against Savone, in order to seize at that point the road of the Corniche. A left body (10 battalions) assembled at Novi will proceed toward Voltri and attack it. The English fleet will assist in the operation to the best of its ability, by the fire of its guns or by landing men. The army of Sardinia is no longer under the orders of the Austrian general, but good relations are maintained with General Colli who commands it. Communication is less stiff but more rare than in the past. The two Generals should have con- ferred before acting, but since the end of March, when Colli has carried out against Sérurier some important reconnaissances, communication has been interrupted be- tween both Generals in Chief; an appointment has been made for April 14th; by that time, events will have pro- gressed. The Sardinian army ignores what is going on; it continues to occupy Ceva and to guard the Tanaro. It has only received from Beaulieu a request for 4 bat- talions to be sent to Dego under the orders of Argenteau. While his opponents have this advantage of earlier offensive, what is Bonaparte doing? To the first operations of the enemy, stirred by the unfortunate attempt against Genoa and the expedition to Voltri, he will answer by parades which allow him to carry out his plan. The Sardinians are worrying Sérurier's division by raids. He reinforces that division by the Rusca brigade pushed to Bardinetto.   ## p. 73 (#79) ##########################################
