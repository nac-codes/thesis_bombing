t his plan. The Sardinians are worrying Sérurier's division by raids. He reinforces that division by the Rusca brigade pushed to Bardinetto.   ## p. 73 (#79) ##############################################  THE ECONOMY OF FORCES 73 The system of outposts of Schérer is carefully in- spected and improved. Masséna disposes in Savone of the 3,000 men of the Laharpe division and Ménard brigade, but in front of him, besides Cervoni at Voltri, extends a line of outposts strongly established on fortified points: these are the outposts of Stella, Montenegino, Altare, Monte Barac- cone, San Giacomo, Madona della Neve, Medogno. The last four are held by the Joubert and Dommartin brigades which connect at Tanaro with the Rusca brigade. Further back are some strong supports, near Stella, at the Madone of Savone, at Cadibone, at Quiliano. Strong reconnaissances are in contact with the enemy as soon as he maneuvers. Finally, Bonaparte has issued his orders himself; they entail, particularly, that Sérurier and Rusca shall remain strictly on the defensive, in order not to draw the enemy's attention towards Bardinetto, through which it is intended to reach Millesimo. They provide for Cervoni, who has taken Pijon's place at the head of the Voltri detachment, a special mis- sion. The Austrians seem inclined to action towards Genoa (concentration of their forces and General Head- quarters at Novi). Cervoni is to draw them in that direction and hold them there; he is given for that pur- pose an additional half-brigade; he will carry out some reconnaissances toward San Pier d'Arena but is not to let himself be crushed by Beaulieu, withdrawing in time on Varazze, where he will be protected by the troops of Stella. Here is a good example of an army in defensive strategy, in ambush so to speak, but capable of assuming   ## p. 74 (#80) ##############################################  74 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR the offensive.
