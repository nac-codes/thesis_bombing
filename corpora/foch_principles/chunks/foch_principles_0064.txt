Should it wish to assume the offensive, in any direc- tion at all, the facilities for concentration are the same, and moreover the important outlets are held. Thanks to that organization as a body (the main body) and arms (the advance guards), and to the zone of maneuver resulting therefrom, it is always able to strike with all its mass at one point. We shall see, on the other hand, the three corps of Beaulieu working independently of one another, in three directions which do not connect, with three separate geographical objectives; with absolutely rigid plans more- over.
