Then, after having lit some big fires, he retires, according to orders at ten o'clock on Arenzano which he has already had occupied. His movement is protected by three companies of grenadiers which fight for some time in the convent of the Capucins at Voltri and aban- don the locality at midnight in order to retire on Aren- zano, where they are gathered up by a rear guard (a battalion of the 99th). The retreat continues in the same manner on Varazze, which Cervoni reaches with- out being pursued, having lost only between 100 and 200 men, and from where he connects with the outpost of Stella.

But he can in that way become a danger to the troops of Argenteau from whom one has no news. Anxiety seizes Beaulieu; he perc
