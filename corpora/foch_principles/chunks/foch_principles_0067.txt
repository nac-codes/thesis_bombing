Anxiety seizes Beaulieu; he perceives that he has perhaps only compromised his army; he drives off at two o'clock that afternoon in a carriage from Voltri to Novi and Acqui, where it is undoubtedly neces- sary to concentrate his forces. For Argenteau immediate assistance must be prepared; Beaulieu sends Wukas- sowitch with three battalions to support him without delay.
