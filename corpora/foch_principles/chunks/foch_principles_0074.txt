ht Infantry to Biestro. The distribution of forces, on the evening of the 12th, is therefore as follows: Laharpe at Montenotte Inférieur, pushing patrols towards Sassello; Cairo (Headquarters), { Biestro; Joubert at San Donato (between Carcare and Cairo) with outposts towards Casseria and Santa Margherita ; Augereau at Carcare; Dommartin at Monteffredo, very late; Bonaparte at Carcare.

To that end, he sends towards Montezemolo: Sérurier, having Rusca on his right, who will join Augereau about Murialdo; Augereau following the main road; Joubert advancing on Castelnovo by San Giovanni; Dommartin who, if he has passed Monteffredo, will act as reserve
