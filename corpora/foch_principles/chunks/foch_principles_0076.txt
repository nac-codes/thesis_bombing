only troops in flight. Laharpe and Dommartin were coming to Cairo to re- organize a mass capable of maneuvering. But the 4 battalions which Colli has sent to Dego at Beaulieu's request have reached it on the 12th. Learn- ing there the event of the day, they remain with the remnants of the Rukavina column throughout the 13th. Masséna, arriving in the morning with approximately 2,000 men, learns of the situation from the inhabitants and from deserters; he realizes the insufficiency of his troops for attack.
