But one attacks with the intention of not pushing the struggle; each column will therefore send forward only patrols, scouts who advance, retire, disengage themselves easily when necessary. As means: chiefly long-range action for the same purpose of acting on the enemy with- out allowing oneself to be grasped, snipers, artillery. Behind these first-line troops must be main bodies as   ## p. 91 (#97) ##############################################  THE ECONOMY OF FORCES 91 supports. The lines of communication and assembly places in the rear are also held (crossing of Bormida, village of Rochetta). Anyway, the day of the 13th has been lost for the progress of Bonaparte's plan to march on Ceva, and that loss is due to the resistance of Casseria (owing to the late- ness of Augereau) and the resistance of Dego.
