At 3 o'clock only, seeing the progress made by Lasalcette, communication established, Masséna rapidly ascends, with his reserve in hand, the slope of Castello, deploys, carries and crosses the locality, deploys again before Costa, and   ## p. 93 (#99) ##############################################  THE ECONOMY OF FORCES 93 with Lasalcette assaults Mount Gerolo, the defenders of which fall back on Majani, where they meet the right of the Piedmontese, thrown back also by Laharpe. Laharpe has maneuvered with the 70th and 99th half- brigades along the left bank of the Bormida which he has crossed at Rochetta. He is accompanied by 200 cavalry. He proceeds towards Sopravia, leaving 1 bat- talion to occupy Bormida in order to surround the enemy and protect the artillery which takes up position to the west of Bormida, preparing at long distance the attack of Castello by Masséna. Continuing its progress by Sopravia, the division again crosses the Bormida at the Pra Marenco ford, where it drops 1 battalion, and forms into three columns for the attack of the Casan redoubt, namely: To the right, under General Causse, 1,500 to 1,600 men by Piano; To the center, under Cervoni, 900 men by the Bric Rosso; In echelons in under Adj.-Gen. the rear to the Boyer, Chief of Staff of the Divi- left sion 800 infantry and 200 cavalry. The Piedmontese retire from the Casan redoubt on Majani, whence they soon escape by the valley of Cas- sinelles, seeking to reach the road of Spigno but finding it held by the advance guard of Rondeau who shoot them down from the Bric del Caret. Pursued at the same time by the 200 horse of Laharpe, the enemy's 8 battalions are compelled to lay down their arms; their artillery had not left its positions.   ## p. 94 (#100) #############################################  94 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR In spite of the urgent need of proceeding to Monte- zemolo, note what thought and method have been em- ployed in (1) The use of numerical
