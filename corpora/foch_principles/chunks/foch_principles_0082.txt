####################################  94 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR In spite of the urgent need of proceeding to Monte- zemolo, note what thought and method have been em- ployed in (1) The use of numerical superiority to obtain a definite result; (2) The gradual surrounding of the position with a minimum of forces, by the use of such favorable ground as at Bormida, etc. (3) The decisive blow, prepared patiently, slowly, economically all day, promptly struck between 3 and 4 P.M. by almost all the forces acting simultaneously. Those will be the constant characteristics of the opera- tions conducted by Bonaparte, Masséna, Lannes. At the moment when the affair ends, Bonaparte, having already ordered the Ménard and Dommartin brigades to Montezemolo, orders Laharpe to immediately start again for Cairo. Masséna will hold Dego.

Bonaparte resumes the direction of Dego with all his forces, but only takes the place in the evening, after a fairly lively engagement.
