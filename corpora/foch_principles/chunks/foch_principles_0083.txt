he seizes Dego and throws back Mas- séna, whom Laharpe supports. Bonaparte resumes the direction of Dego with all his forces, but only takes the place in the evening, after a fairly lively engagement. Beaulieu, in spite of the advice and request of Wukas- sowitch, has sent no reinforcement to the latter. The only battalions he has intact are those of Voltri. He cannot have them before some time. But that new affair at Dego worries Bonaparte. He fears for the 16th a vigorous counter-attack by the Aus- trians; reports received make him consider it possible. He orders Masséna to remain on guard for that day at Dego; Laharpe to take up position on Mioglio and Sas- sello, and to carry out reconnaissances towards Acqui. Headquarters will remain at Carcare. That means two more days lost, the 15th and 16th, for the execution of the proposed maneuver against Ceva.

The latter, coming for that purpose to Monbarcaro, whence he maintains the separation of the Piedmontese and Austrians, attacks the enemy's left. At the same time, the army is protected by Laharpe who holds Dego and pushes pushes reconnaissances towards Acqui. On the 17th, the French army finds the camp of Ceva evacuated. Thus appears, in its execution, the new theory of war, born of the principle of economy of forc
