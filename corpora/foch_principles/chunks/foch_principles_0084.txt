Thus appears, in its execution, the new theory of war, born of the principle of economy of forces and charac- terized to the highest degree by initiative, attack, action well understood. (1) Action in one direction, that one which is necessi- tated by the strategic plan, through tactics, that is by the most favorable use of military resources. Therefore, the direction of Voltri being abandoned, one aims at Mon- tenotte, then Dego; Dego being abandoned, Millesimo; Millesimo being dealt with, one returns to Dego, etc. (2) In each of these directions successively adopted, victory expected from all the forces, or at least nearly all; in other directions, safety assured by troops as weak as possible, intended not to defeat the enemy, but to slow him up, to paralyze him, to reconnoiter him: Cervoni in presence of Beaulieu, Masséna at Dego, Sérurier in presence of Colli.

As soon as a breach is made, equilibrium is upset and everything else is useless, the place is taken. . . attacks must not be dispersed, but concentrated." To that end, the f
