#########################################  100 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR Armed forces are primarily intended and commanded for the purpose of obedience. The general commanding in chief can indulge in art, in strategy, all others only carry out tactics, prose. He conducts the orchestra, and they each play their part. Whether it be a question, therefore, of advance guards or front-line units, of armies, army corps, divisions, brigades or smaller units, every one is a subordinate unit. Every chief of every unit must therefore think of obey- ing at the same time as he thinks of commanding. Before dictating his orders, he must be inspired by those he has received. To what extent and how? That is what we shall examine. In war, to obey is a difficult thing. For the obedience. must be in the presence of the enemy, and in spite of the enemy, in the midst of danger, of varied and unforeseen circumstances, of a menacing unknown, in spite of fatigue from many causes. "While dispositions taken in peace times can be weighted at length, and infallibly lead to the result de- sired, such is not the case with the use of forces in war, with operations. In war, once hostilities are begun, our will soon encounters the independent will of the enemy. Our dispositions strike against the freely-made disposi- tions of the enemy." (Moltke.) Then how should we carry out the execution of an order received, unless we preserve our freedom of action in spite of the enemy? The art of war is the art of preserving one's freedom of action.
