A leader must not only be a man of character, but also a man capable of understanding and planning for the purpose of obeying. To the strict, passive obedience of former centuries we shall therefore always oppose active obedience, necessary consequence of the appeal made always to initiative, and of the tactical use of small, independent masses. And that notion of freedom of action which we find appearing as a protection to our spirit of active discipline, which comes from the necessity of assuring the action of the whole through the combined actions of all partici- pants, we find it also becoming, like the principle of econ- omy of forces, one of the fundamental rules of war. For in every military operation we have seen that our constant preoccupation is to preserve that freedom: free- dom to go to Montenotte, to remain there, to act against Ceva. And, at the end of war, when there are a victor and a vanquished, how will their positions differ except that the one will be free to act and to exact what he wishes from the other, while the latter will be compelled to do and to concede what the victor may decide? We must be constantly inspired by this idea of freedom to be preserved, if we wish at the end of an operation, and still more therefore at the end of a series of opera-   ## p. 103 (#111) ############################################  INTELLECTUAL DISCIPLINE 103 tions, to find ourselves free, that is victors, and not domi- nated, that is vanquished. A constant care, at the same time as we prepare or execute an action against the enemy, must be to escape his will, to parry any enterprise by which he might pre- vent our freedom of action. Every military idea, every plan, must therefore be accompanied by plans for protec- tion. We must, as in fencing, attack without
