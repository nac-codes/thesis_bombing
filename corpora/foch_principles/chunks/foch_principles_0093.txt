gade of Maussion (which was still to proceed to Bitche) did not think it possible to leave Rohrbach. It remained there, noti- fying General de Failly, who approved the decision taken. In the reports of the chiefs of the 5th Corps we find the reappearance, with all their hollow importance, of big words, such as the opening of Rohrbach, remain- ders of old-fashioned methods resuscitated by a senseless geography. An opening, a valley, are not particularly dangerous; there are roads outside the valleys, there are some on the highest plateaus, there are some wherever needed for commerce or the requirements of communication.
