vision and reserve artillery at Rohrbach; Lapasset Brigade and transport at Sarreguemines. All along the way, instead of the concentration to be carried out reign false theories. Instead of military spirit, of intellectual discipline, we find personal opinions, ignorance of protection. As a result, on the evening of the 5th, the army corps which should and could have been assembled at Bitche spreads out over the 35 kilometers which separate that city from Sarreguemines.
