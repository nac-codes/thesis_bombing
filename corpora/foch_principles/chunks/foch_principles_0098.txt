On the opposite side, Clausewitz had done away with any inclination to antique methods of fencing; he had preached that battle was the sole argument, and all his disciples had moved to it of their own accord. On our side, we had missed the battle in order to guard strategic points. The commander of the 5th French Corps was not an isolated case in our army; he was only an example of his time and of his surroundings. Ignorance of protection! Nothing should have pre- vented the execution of the very simple orders received: "Move to Froeschwiller with all your forces." It could not have been prevented by distance: there are 55 kilometers from Sarreguemines to Reichshoffen, and three days were available, the 4th, 5th and 6th. Neither did the enemy prevent it: the 5th Corps has found no trace of the adversary on its way; but every- thing has been done as though the enemy were every- where. The Corps should have proceeded in spite of the enemy, it did not even proceed in the absence of the enemy. False information is accepted without verifica- tion even; no scouts are employed; no protection used. It is through ignorance that the 5th Corps has failed.

And that division, through lack of reliable information, starts at 7.30 instead of starting at dawn (say 4 A.M. on August 6th); it takes nine-and-a-half hours to cover 22 kilo- meters which it should have done in five-and-a-half hours. Starting at 4 o'clock, it would have been at Niederbronn about 9; but starting at 7.30, it was there at I o'clock in the afternoon.

And if it arrived, that is because the enemy did not show himself. Suppose on the road an enemy of whatever kind, a battalion attack- ing at some cross-roads. An
