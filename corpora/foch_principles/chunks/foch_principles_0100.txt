? With the pur- pose of being artistic or scientific? Not in the least, sim- ply of obeying, of doing what is expected of us, and with a firm intention of finding in our mind the means of doing it if it be humanly possible. What is our objective? We are to move to Bitche with the whole 5th Corps, and later to Reichshoffen; that is all. Nothing must sway us from the carrying-out of that order. Let us not speak, therefore, of facing the Prussian troops which threaten General Frossard; of guarding Sarreguemines, Rohrbach, Bitche; those points have no importance for us to-day except as they assist or hinder the advance of the 5th Corps. The first condition to obeying is, therefore, to vis- ualize above all the order received, and nothing else; then to find the means of complying with it, irrespective of personal opinions and geographical or topographical considerations.

The first is dangerous, the last is long; it is the second which we must follow with the main part of the army corps, and as it will be a hard one to finish without a stop we must start on it the eve
