The first is dangerous, the last is long; it is the second which we must follow with the main part of the army corps, and as it will be a hard one to finish without a stop we must start on it the evening of the 4th. In order not to lengthen the column, we shall send by the 3rd route the transport, which is of no combatant value. The army corps, starting on the evening of the 4th by the Zetting and Diding route, will bivouac at the end of the first day's march in Wittring and Achen. The next day it will reach Bitche without difficulty. But we must also be sure that the enemy will not in- terfere with the move. That result can only be attained if, during these days of the 4th and 5th, he does not appear (which depends on himself), or if, appearing he is kept at a distance (which depends on us). The first thing to do is, therefore, to know if he ap- pears, if he shows himself in the territory which we shall cross, or on the flank of the route which we intend to follow. That necessitates information, a service of infor- mation by the cavalry. And where shall we seek the in- formation? In every direction by which the enemy may arrive to reach our route, on every dangerous road. Such information, sent from a sufficient distance, from 20 kilometers for instance, affords ample protection if it be negative. But can information be obtained at such   ## p. 116 (#124) ############################################  116 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR distances? Not in this case, for a safe margin of 20 kilometers would have our cavalry operating towards Bliescastel and Deux-Ponts, right in enemy country. Moreover, the information may be affirmative. In- stead of verifying the absence of the enemy, it may estab- lish his presence within a radius of less than 20 kilo- meters, and it may be too late to parry it unless, through previous dispositions, the case has been foreseen. From all this we see that at the same time as we organize the service of information by cavalry we must foresee the
