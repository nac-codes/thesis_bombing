be done with- out fatigue. If the column starts at 5 A.M. (it is the 5th of August), its head is at Bitche six hours later, that is at 11.15; the tail-end (16 kilometers behind) reaches there four hours later, at 3.15; allowing for a long rest, the whole column is assembled in Bitche at 4.15. But that necessitates not being interfered with by the enemy. To that end, the flank guard must successively occupy dangerous roads as the column progresses. The flank guard must be in Rohrbach, therefore, when the column passes Rahling, at Petit-Rederching when the column passes Enchenberg. How long shall the flank guard remain in Rohrbach, considering that the column is not one point, but has a length of 16 kilometers? As there are 8 kilometers from Rohrbach to Rahling, the flank guard can leave Rohrbach when there only re- main to pass through Rahling 8 kilometers of the length of the column. It is evident that any enemy who, after   ## p. 118 (#126) ############################################  118 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR that time, passes Rohrbach will strike nothing at Rah- ling. As to the column, its head leaves Kalhausen at 5 o'clock, arriving in Rahling at 6.30 and at Enchenberg at 9.30, while the tail passes these points four hours later. The flank guard must then be in Rohrbach at 6.30, leaving Woelfling for that purpose at 4.30. But, as we have seen, two hours later, namely at 8.30, half the column has passed Rahling; there only remains the other half, 8 kilometers long, and Rohrbach can therefore be abandoned without danger. As a matter of fact, the flank guard can abandon it an hour sooner, thanks to its service of information by the cavalry. If, for instance, at 7.30 the cavalry sends from Bett- willer the information that "there is no enemy at Bett- willer," we are sure that there can be none in Rohrbach at 8.30, since there are 4 kilometers between these two points; we can therefore abandon Rohrbach at 7.30. The flank guard will then move to Petit-Rederching and
