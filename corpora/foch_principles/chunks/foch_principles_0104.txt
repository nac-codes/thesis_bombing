re that there can be none in Rohrbach at 8.30, since there are 4 kilometers between these two points; we can therefore abandon Rohrbach at 7.30. The flank guard will then move to Petit-Rederching and Halbach, holding the dangerous roads which lead to Enchenberg, until there only remains to pass at that point a length of column equal to the distance which separates Enchenberg from the point occupied by the cavalry. In order that the flank guard may maneuver in such manner, it must reach in good time the defensive positions, that is the crossings of dangerous roads, and to that end it must be closer to them than the enemy. It will reach Rohrbach if, on leaving Woelfling, it has information that the enemy is not in Rimling, because the distance from Rohrbach to Rimling equals that from Woelfling to Rohrbach. In the same way, after leaving Rohrbach it will reach   ## p. 119 (#127) ############################################  INTELLECTUAL DISCIPLINE 119 the next cross-roads if it has information that the enemy is not in Bettwiller, and the next cross-roads again if the enemy has not reached the height of Hottwiller. As can be seen, the work of the flank guard will be guaranteed by a service of information reconnoitering along its route, and operating at distances equal to those of the roads to be reached. To-day, therefore, the main body of the flank guard's cavalry will pass through Rim- ling, Bettwiller, Hottwiller, etc., and an advance guard of one battalion with a troop of cavalry will precede the column. With such dispositions we are assured of marching without a pause our main body. If the enemy appears, he will always find on the route some force to interpose and capable of serious resistance, capable at least of lasting, and thus absorbing the enemy's activity at a considerable distance from the main body, whose advance is thus protected. In reality, on August 5th, 1870, there was no enemy in the region; the 5th French Corps has seen no sign of any. Its head wou
