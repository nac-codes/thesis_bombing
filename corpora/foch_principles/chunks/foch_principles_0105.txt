considerable distance from the main body, whose advance is thus protected. In reality, on August 5th, 1870, there was no enemy in the region; the 5th French Corps has seen no sign of any. Its head would, therefore, have reached Bitche at 11.30, its tail at 4.30. The marshal's order would have found the head of the column (one regiment) in a condition to march further-it had only covered 25 kilometers. It would have been pushed on to Engelsberg, 6 kilometers from Bitche, but still in advance of that point would have been pushed the Lespart Division which had done no march- ing all day. It would have proceeded to Philippsbourg (14 kilometers), throwing out a flank guard of 1 regi- ment, I battery and I squadron towards Sturzelbronn and Main-du-Prince.   ## p. 120 (#128) ############################################  120 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR The advance would have continued the next day, August 6th, without difficulty; there is only one danger- ous route in the morning, that of Sturzelbronn; it was held by a force capable of holding out a long time, dis- posing of 8 kilometers over which to retire into a defile of mountains and woods. The march, resumed at 6 o'clock from Philippsbourg and at 5 o'clock from Bitche, would bring the head to Reichshoffen (10 kilometers) at 8.30, the tail at 1.30. The arrival of the 5th Army Corps at Reichshoffen in good time was therefore possible; it could have been accomplished even if the enemy had interfered on the flank of the route followed, but on condition of using: Activity of mind, to understand the purposes of the Higher Command and to observe the spirit of these purposes; Activity of mind, to discover the material means of fulfilling them; Activity of mind, to fulfill them in spite of the enemy's efforts to preserve his freedom of action. On condition, in brief, of displaying proper discipline.   ## p. 121 (#129) ############################################  V PROTECTION D RAGOMIROW has written: "The principles of the art of wa
