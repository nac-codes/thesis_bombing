Instruction would therefore be useless which merely pointed out these prin- ciples without going into their application. For that reason we propose to now study in detail the work of the 5th Corps' flank guard. We have seen how forces were divided into a main body and protective troops, in order to allow the army corps to reach Bitche in spite of the enemy; how it was intended to thus carry out the order given, by opposing any intentions of the enemy.

Let us see how the same army corps,
