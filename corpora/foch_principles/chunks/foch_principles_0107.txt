under these circumstances, with an enemy attack, the 5th French Army Corps of 1870 could not have arrived, that it could have brought none of its forces to Bitche. Let us see how the same army corps, protected as we have planned, could have arrived. In order that it may have evacuated Enchenberg, it needs (at 4 kilometers per hour): hours' marching. 61316_35k 4 9 hours' marching. 4 4 22k From Alt-Altheim to Enchenberg, there are =5 hours' marching. Without protective troops, therefore, there would surely be an engagement at Enchenberg. The enemy division, the head of whose column has left Alt-Altheim at 5 o'clock, reaches Bettwiller (12) kilometers distant) at 8 o'clock, if nothing has stopped it. The flank guard, on the other hand, has reached Rohrbach at 6.30. Already then, its cavalry regiment is in Rimling, with pickets at Erching, Guiderkirch, Epping. The picket of Guiderkirch, soon pushed back by enemy squadrons, is reinforced by the cavalry regi- ment, which opposed the enemy's advance on Guider- kirch and Moulin de Rimling; it warns the commander of the flank guard, and covers the direction of Bettwiller.   ## p. 123 (#131) ############################################  PROTECTION 123 The presence of this cavalry regiment compels the enemy, who has no greater cavalry, to call on his in- fantry advance guard to clear the way. It is necessary to start maneuvering. That advance guard, to reach Bett- willer, needed 12k 4 -- 3 hours' march (8 A.M.), without enemy encounter. The hostile cavalry interfering, it will only reach that point after 8 o'clock. What has the flank guard done meanwhile? The flank guard started from Woelfling at 4.30, its head has reached Rohrbach at 6.30. On arrival, it has protected the occupation of the ground by pushing 2 battalions to Hill 376; it has re- tained at the same time the possibility of acting further, of continuing its advance to the east, by means of an advance guard (1 battalion) pushed to the station of Rohrbach.
