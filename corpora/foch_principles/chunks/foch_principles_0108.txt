376; it has re- tained at the same time the possibility of acting further, of continuing its advance to the east, by means of an advance guard (1 battalion) pushed to the station of Rohrbach. These precautionary measures would allow it to make a long stay in Rohrbach without inconveni- ence. But, as we have seen, Rohrbach can be evacuated at 7.30, if by that time the enemy has not reached Bett- willer, which we shall know by our cavalry. On the other hand, the brigade takes an hour to pass by: the head arriving at 6.30, the tail will pass at 7.30; Rohr- bach would be held, therefore, until 7.30 even without halting the column. But let us suppose that for the sake of greater safety a half-hour's halt is made there. The column will assemble to the north of the locality, its head arriving at 6.30 and leaving at 7, while its tail' arrives at 7.30 and leaves at 8. From the officer in command of the cavalry regiment information is received between 6.45 and 7 o'clock that   ## p. 124 (#132) ############################################  124 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR the enemy (cavalry first, infantry later) has been seen on the Peppenkumm-Guiderkirch road, and that he him- self, if compelled to retire with his squadrons, will retire on Bettwiller. That information confirms the necessity of blocking without delay the Bettwiller-Petit Rederching- Enchenberg road. On the other hand, as time goes by, the occupation of Rohrbach becomes less imperative; its evacuation can be prepared. Because of this double reason, as early as 7 o'clock, the brigade is moved from Rohrbach to 800 meters southwest of the station, on the main road (at the cross- ing of the path which leads up Hill 376); the assembled troops march in mass formation, the troops in column of route formation retain it. The artillery is on the road, covered by the 2nd Battalion kept at Hill 376, by the 1st pushed to Petit-Rederching (occupied at 7.15), that is by two advance guards maintaining until further orders the possib
