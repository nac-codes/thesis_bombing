llery is on the road, covered by the 2nd Battalion kept at Hill 376, by the 1st pushed to Petit-Rederching (occupied at 7.15), that is by two advance guards maintaining until further orders the possibility of acting in one or the other direction. At 7.45 the whole brigade has reached the objective. The 2nd Battalion, on Hill 376, receives the order to rejoin. But meanwhile, the commander of the 1st Battalion, arrived as advance guard in Petit-Rederching at 7.45, has prepared his plan. What is his mission, as advance guard commander for the brigade? To prepare the entry into action of that brigade against an enemy appearing from Bettwiller. What is necessary to the brigade for that purpose?
