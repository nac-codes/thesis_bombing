his column, to watch over the roads east of Hottwiller, etc. The brigade assembles to the south of the Petit- Rederching cross-roads. Information accompanies it there. About 7.30 an officer's patrol has seen a column of infantry and artillery entering Guiderkirch on the way to Bettwiller. Also, after 8 o'clock infantry has been seen to occupy Bett- willer. The hour shows us that now (after 8 o'clock) the road of Rohrbach is of no interest, while on the other hand we must at once close that of Petit-Rederching, and later on those further east. How shall we close the first road, how shall we halt the enemy? Carnot has already answered that question:   ## p. 126 (#134) ############################################  126 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR "The enemy will not fail to detach some troops on your flank to stop you. You must place opposite these troops a division which, whether by its strength or by a commanding position, will disperse them or stop them." Therefore, use force and, lacking force, use position, which is sufficient for we are not asked for victory, but merely to hold the enemy while the column goes by. Let us estimate that time: The head of the army corps will reach Enchenberg at 9 o'clock; four hours for pass- ing; the tail will leave it at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. From Enchenberg to Petit-Rederching there are 6 kilometers, or an hour and a half of marching. To let the enemy be there at I o'clock he should leave Petit-Rederching at 11.30, so that he will not get there if he be kept at Rederching until 11.30, or at points. nearer Enchenberg until later. The commander of the flank guard must find means, therefore, of holding out until 11.30 at Petit-Rederching, or until 12.30 at Heili- genbronn. It is now after 8 o'clock. How to hold out? If the enemy be not in strength, the question is not difficult to answer. If the enemy is more powerful, use strong positions. Impregnable positions do not exist, for any position used merely for passive defense falls by
