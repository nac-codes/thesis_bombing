n strength, the question is not difficult to answer. If the enemy is more powerful, use strong positions. Impregnable positions do not exist, for any position used merely for passive defense falls by maneuver. It is like a fencer who merely parries; sooner or later he is hit. It is like a warrior placing all his trust in his armor: there is the defect in the cuirasse which is always found eventually. But, lacking impregnable positions which do not exist, there are, especially with modern weapons, many strong positions. Because of their power, modern weapons forbid any   ## p. 127 (#135) ############################################  PROTECTION 127 maneuver under fire; because of their range, they compel assuming at long distance battle formations, deploying far away; because of their rapidity of fire these neces- sities may be enforced even by troops comparatively weak. A position occupied delays, therefore, the enemy, on condition that it be a real position. What is needed to that end? What is understood by a position, in the modern sense of the word? It is ground suitable to defense based on fire and strength; it is a place which offers: Positions from which one sees far and can shoot far- clear fields of fire; Obstacles to enemy advance. When these conditions are met, the enemy is compelled to maneuver from afar, until the last moment (arrival on the obstacles), to engage all his resources, artillery and infantry, which means advancing painfully, wasting time while he would wish to proceed. The points to be occupied are here Hills 349 and 353, and Petit-Reder- ching. But such a position will finally fall after a certain time which may not suffice for the passing of the army corps. Whatever additional time is necessary must be obtained from a second position. While organizing the first posi- tion, we shall have sought and prepared a second one. The result is to organize the action in depth, to pre- pare a series of successive encounters, in each of which decision w
