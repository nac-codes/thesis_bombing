anizing the first posi- tion, we shall have sought and prepared a second one. The result is to organize the action in depth, to pre- pare a series of successive encounters, in each of which decision will be avoided, so that only a part of the troops will be engaged. We get the use of forces gov- erned by the special circumstances in which we find ourselves.   ## p. 128 (#136) ############################################  128 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR On the first position what shall we put? No prema- ture deployment; it might be unjustified, the enemy hav- ing given no indication yet of the point which he intends to strike. The greater part of our forces would fail us if we used deployment too early. What we must do, is to occupy the position with troops which allow of bringing there all or part of the main body, as may be deemed necessary, when the time comes, when the attack has shown the point it seeks to overcome. Occupation by what kind of troops? By such troops as can use fire at long range, for our intention is to com- pel the enemy to as long a maneuver, over as long a distance, as possible. In the first line we shall therefore place some infantry and all the artillery. Following that idea, we shall support the advance guard with 1 Regiment having I Battalion at Petit- Rederching, having: I Battalion at the northwest point of the wood, with 2 companies on Plateau 353. I Battalion in reserve to the south of Petit-Rederching. Northern edge of Petit- Rederching: I company; Hill 349: 1 company. That position will not be attacked to the same extent from all sides. The blow will probably be aimed at its extremities, or at least at one of its extremities. A reserve must prevent this: the reserve of the 1st Regi- ment will keep itself in readiness to support the flank attacked. If it be the right flank, the 1st Regiment will   ## p. 129 (#137) ############################################  PROTECTION 129 occupy the northeastern edge of the wood. If it be the left flank,
