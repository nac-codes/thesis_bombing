ked. If it be the right flank, the 1st Regiment will   ## p. 129 (#137) ############################################  PROTECTION 129 occupy the northeastern edge of the wood. If it be the left flank, the Tuilerie and station can be occupied. The artillery is ready to take up positions on 353, appearing only to open fire, endeavoring to control as far as possible the Bettwiller road, in order to prevent its use by the enemy. The remainder of the brigade is assembled to the south of 356. The cavalry is exploring the east, where some danger- ous roads remain, and for that reason it occupies the ravine of Nonante. The front of the position measures 1,500 to 1,800 meters, which, for one regiment reinforced by artil- lery, is very acceptable under present defensive con- ditions. Should this first position be lost, a second will be needed, commanding the Petit-Rederching-Enchenberg road. The station, 356, the northern edge of the wood and Halbach offer a second position, the reserve being to the west of Siersthal. A front of 3,000 meters would evidently be a great deal, if we intended to resist firmly with our one brigade, but the position includes 1,500 meters of a wood which can easily be held with small forces. Moreover, there is a great need of holding Halbach, through which the enemy might take the direct road to Bitche, or the road to Enchenberg via Siersthal. Again, a frontal attack against the northern edge of the wood can give no results; the enemy will seek to extend to the right or left of the wood, and we can then oppose to that attack the greater part of the forces (the reserve) if we have at first held the position but lightly.   ## p. 130 (#138) ############################################  130 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR At the proper time, this occupation of the position might be as follows: 2nd Regiment Ist Regiment (leaving 2 companies at the station) reforming as General Re- serve west of Siersthal, at the crossing of roads lead- ing to Halbach, The wood, Hil
