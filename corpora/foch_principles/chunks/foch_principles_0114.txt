ition might be as follows: 2nd Regiment Ist Regiment (leaving 2 companies at the station) reforming as General Re- serve west of Siersthal, at the crossing of roads lead- ing to Halbach, The wood, Hill 356; Hill 356, Halbach, Siersthal; 3 directions in which it may have to act; Artillery south of Hill 356; Cavalry searching always east on the Hottwiller road; but as cavalry would be handicapped in fighting there because of the wooded nature of the ground, the greater part of the regiment can be moved to the left, where is found more open ground. As we see, a front line on: Station, 356, Wood. No more than on the previous line (349, Petit-Rederching, 353) do we engage on principle all the troops, because we are not at this time seeking any decisive engagement. None is necessary, and it might be beyond our power. We are merely seeking to delay the enemy by com- pelling him to maneuver. To what extent shall the forces affected to each line of defense be used up there? It depends on circum- stances. It is evident that if, against a lightly held line, the enemy stops, reassembles, slows up, maneuvers cautiously, we do not engage the whole of the 1st Regiment on the   ## p. 131 (#139) ############################################  PROTECTION 131 first line; its 3rd Battalion can be sufficient for holding, in that case, the Station, 356, the Wood, when the time comes. If, on the other hand, the enemy at once deploys important forces and begins a vigorous attack, the whole 1st Regiment may be used up in retarding it; the 2nd Regiment will undertake to occupy the second position. If we wish to figure in hours, certain results appear inevitable. The enemy column, bringing its advance party to Bettwiller at 8.30, comes under fire of the guns at 353; it can only keep advancing under natural cover of the ground. The hostile advance guard, beginning to maneuver, seizes and occupies 353 (Kleinmuhle), Hielling and Bett- willer, its reserve being held at the last-named place. From th
