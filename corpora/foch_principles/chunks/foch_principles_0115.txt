natural cover of the ground. The hostile advance guard, beginning to maneuver, seizes and occupies 353 (Kleinmuhle), Hielling and Bett- willer, its reserve being held at the last-named place. From there it undertakes a reconnaissance which will show it an extended front and artillery; from there also it will protect the column while it arrives and assembles. As a division in column takes about two hours to pass a given point, it is not till 10.30 that the last man arrives. Until now, the assembly has been east of Bettwiller. It is to be presumed, therefore, that the line Petit- Rederching-353, even if feebly held, cannot be carried before 11.30. The Station will be carried about 12.30. If the enemy, continuing to maneuver along his right, advances along the Petit-Rederching-Enchenberg road, the reserve regiment deploys and occupies Heiligen- bronner Wald, the Heiligenbronn Farm and the south- ern point of the wood. The artillery is at 372, behind which position is assembled the 2nd Regiment (south of 372, for instance). But there are 6 kilometers from Bettwiller to this   ## p. 132 (#140) ############################################  132 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR position; the enemy, once he has extended, will have spent over two hours to cover them. The attack can only occur after 1 P.M. before Heiligenbronn; at that time the army corps has passed Enchenberg, so that the flank guard can give way and retire on Siersthal. If the enemy, having taken Petit-Rederching and 353, instead of continuing his movement along the Petit- Rederching-Enchenberg road, undertakes the attack of Halbach, he comes to an angle of the wood where he cannot take advantage of his superiority in numbers; his march is inevitably delayed by the broken-up nature of the ground. The 1st Regiment reinforces that point, sends to it about one battalion, and moves the remainder to the east of 377, passing through Siersthal and occupy- ing it. The artillery also comes to the east of 377. There the length
