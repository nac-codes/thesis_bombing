es that point, sends to it about one battalion, and moves the remainder to the east of 377, passing through Siersthal and occupy- ing it. The artillery also comes to the east of 377. There the length of an engagement may be great. At nightfall, the brigade can retire towards the Brique- terie, 416 and the Fremdenberg Farm. The example given shows clearly how flank guards of large bodies operate: their tactics consist in constantly maneuvering to move from one road to another, to fight a rear guard engagement, etc.; they are mobile troops, who seek and use successively the occupation of field positions. The wooded region we encountered favored direct de- fense of the roads along which the enemy appeared. Under less favorable circumstances, on open ground, he might make a feint on one road, seizing another ahead of us without thereby losing his cohesion. He must be stopped nevertheless; defense being no longer possible, there is no other resource than to attack. The case would also have occurred if the enemy, by a   ## p. 133 (#141) ############################################  PROTECTION 133 night march, reached Rohrbach for instance or Petit- Rederching ahead of the flank guard. How could he be held? Once again, by attack. This shows that a protective duty does not necessarily entail a defensive attitude; it is often by offensive that it can best be fulfilled. The duty to fulfill is a thing quite distinct from tactics. It is from the consideration merely of the objective, under existing circumstances, that we can decide on the tactics to be observed. A historical example will show this clearly: the ex- ample of Kettler's Brigade before the army of Gari- baldi. (See Map No. 3.) In the evening of January 20th, 1871, the German Southern Army's Second Corps has its advance guard at Dôle, main body at Gray, transport at Thil-Chatel. The Seventh Corps, further north, has crossed the Saône. A flank guard (half of the 4th Division) is in Esser- tenne. That same day, January
