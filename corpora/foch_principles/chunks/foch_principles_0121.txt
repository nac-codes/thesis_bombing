ally will be used, as it can last as long as ammunition holds out; besides, the Prus- sian guns are superior to the French guns, let them be used; the battery of the main body comes to reinforce the advance guard's artillery.

They fail; they seek to maneuver, to attack it from a flank. The obstacles of the strong point render all their efforts useless. The Kroseck column (right) arrives only about this time, although it has met no difficulties on the way. It carries Plombi√®res. Communications with it are estab- lished.
