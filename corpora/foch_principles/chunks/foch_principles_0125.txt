the attack of that locality is going to begin. To insure its success it will be participated in by the bat- talion returning from Epirey. The attack of Pouilly is, of course, prepared by the artillery, the two batteries. of the brigade, which advances to within good range of the place. Here again we find complete application of the prin- ciple of the economy of forces. To observe Pouilly, a start is made in that direction. The enemy is observed towards Varois and Saint- Apollinaire; protection is obtained by occupying Epirey. The fate of Epirey being settled, the attack of Pouilly is begun, but not till then. That provides, with 1 bat- talion to be moved from one point to another: 6 companies at Epirey if the enemy attacks; 8 companies at Pouilly when he is attacked. Again, here is an example of the art of providing numbers, above all and before all, by maneuver; and this   ## p. 143 (#151) ############################################  PROTECTION 143 without abandoning anything, thanks to the occupation of strong points, the strength of which provides a means for the weak troops holding them of fulfilling again their mission, and of holding out. In the same way, the attack is carried out as much as possible against one point and not against a whole front; and one point, moreover, which is generally a salient or a flank, because the attack can then make most favorable use of the numerical superiority which it possesses. By acting thus, it envelops the adversary. On its enveloping line, more extended than the line enveloped, it can place more rifles and more guns than the enemy. Also, on that long enveloping line it finds the space and ground required for approach, for safe maneuver, for the final thrust of the mass. It thus finds the means of employing with advantage the two arguments which it uses: fire and shock. One of the points of the line of resistance being car- ried, the latter falls easily. So, under the effort of the two battalions arriving be- hind a stron
