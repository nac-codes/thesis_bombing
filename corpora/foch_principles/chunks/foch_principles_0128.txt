ijon. As regards our main interest just now, the question of protection, they clearly show into what offensive tactics has developed the protective mis- sion of the Kettler Brigade. We have seen to what ex- tent its chief has carried out his duty. The result, as we know, was the great success of the German Army of the South. As to Garibaldi, those continuous attacks of January 21st and 23rd have convinced him that he is meeting important German forces. He has been content with a   ## p. 146 (#154) ############################################  146 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR cautious defense. The result: disaster for the French Army of the East.
