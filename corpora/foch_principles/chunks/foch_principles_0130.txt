Material surprise destroys material safety; it allows the enemy to shell at will our camps, our bivouacs or our columns on the march. Tactical surprise destroys tactical safety, freedom of action. That would have been the case with the 5th Corps in 1870, with the Lespart Division in par- ticular, if the enemy had appeared on the 5th or 6th of August. The troops on the march had to accept battle on the road they were following. Instead of continuing their movement, they must fight; they could not have arrived.

From what we have seen, a certain number of corol- laries can already be deducted: (1) The instrument which insures the tactical safety of a large unit, of an army corps in the example taken, is the advance guard, by which general name we mean a detachment in advance, on the flank or in the rear, of the main body. Its position is immaterial, but its duty consists in
