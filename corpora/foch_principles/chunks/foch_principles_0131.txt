in the example taken, is the advance guard, by which general name we mean a detachment in advance, on the flank or in the rear, of the main body. Its position is immaterial, but its duty consists in employing what capacity of resistance it pos- sesses for the benefit of the main body, to allow such main body to carry out the operation assigned to it, to comply with an order received. And as this operation or order vary constantly, we find that the advance guard's mode of action, the tactics it must adopt, are to be de- termined in every case by the nature of the operation to be undertaken, as well as by the conditions (time, space, ground, etc.) which govern the movements of the advance guard. (2) The advance guard surrounds itself with its own service of protection, outposts or scouts, which, with some assistance from the main guard (occupying Singling in the example given) will suffice to insure the material safety of the unit protected. (3) In every case, and whatever the conditions, we have seen, by the example of Rohrbach, that protection rests on two factors: time and space. It employs a third factor: the capacity of resistance of the troops. The advance guard in that case was to guarantee to the advancing army corps, throughout the length of its advance, a radius of 3 kilometers at least inaccessible to   ## p. 150 (#158) ############################################  150 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR the enemy for the whole length of the column, or rather for the time that the column passed a given point, four hours in the same instance. But the commander of the advance guard also re- quired time to reflect, to issue his orders, transmit them and have them carried out. He also needed space to move his troops before the enemy's arrival to such or such cross-roads and to deploy them there, providing for their retirement if they were swept back. One more problem of protection to be solved for the good working of the main guard. In either case, if these conditions of ti
