deploy them there, providing for their retirement if they were swept back. One more problem of protection to be solved for the good working of the main guard. In either case, if these conditions of time and space were assured by the protective troops, by the advance guard, the problem was solved. (4) In any event, and chiefly as regards space, it is an essential principle of protection that a body of troops must always be master of the ground surrounding it up to the extreme range of modern arms, if it does not wish to be enveloped, surrounded, exposed to intense fire and destroyed before it is able to fight. To this point, protection as we have seen it has only enabled us to avoid the enemy. The theory of war, however, allows of but one argument, battle; it is neces- sary to defeat the enemy, or nothing has been accom- plished. Let us therefore consider the use of forces for the battle and in the battle. Shall we depend on protec- tion? What shall we expect from it? To what extent and how can protection supply it? We are dealing with troops gathered for battle; they are no longer forces to be grouped, they are forces to be applied. The hammer is ready, we wish to strike. But the hammer is not yet   ## p. 151 (#159) ############################################  THE ADVANCE GUARD 151 in hand; ceaselessly our mass changes its form to ad- vance, and up to the last moment it must keep moving. At the same time, the point to be struck must be pointed out to the mass, and for that purpose we must recognize it. That point is not merely any point; sometimes it is a salient in the enemy's line, sometimes a flank, and in order to find it we must seek it first and reach it later. The action of our forces would be quite uncertain, therefore, if it were undertaken without preliminary realization of two conditions: (1) Determining the objective at which to strike; (2) Handling and disposing properly the forces op- posite such objective. As long as this is not accomplished, we must
