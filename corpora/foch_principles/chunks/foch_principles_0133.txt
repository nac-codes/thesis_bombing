realization of two conditions: (1) Determining the objective at which to strike; (2) Handling and disposing properly the forces op- posite such objective. As long as this is not accomplished, we must retain entire freedom of action and protect the troops against enemy attempts; such troops would not be able to foil them efficiently. On reaching the field of battle, at the moment of action, we are therefore obliged to solve the same constant problems of war: determining where and how to act, where and how to strike. When that has been decided, we must still re- tain the means of striking even in presence of the enemy. Protection is therefore still necessary, for it alone provides the possibility of avoiding surprise, of being safe, the possibility of seeing conditions clearly and of obtaining results in spite of the enemy, the possibility, in other words, of acting with safety. Let us return to the instance of the 5th Corps, march- ing on August 6th.   ## p. 152 (#160) ############################################  152 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR With the dispositions we have suggested, it has been able to keep up a good rate of speed. The enemy has not appeared on the way; there has been no actual diffi- culty; but if the enemy had appeared he could not have prevented the movement or halted the column in its ad- vance. In fact it arrives in good time on the field. With the formation adopted, the head appears at Reichshoffen at 9 o'clock, and the tail at I o'clock. Are we going to thrust the forces into the raging bat- tle gradually as they come up, drop by drop so to speak? Certainly not. It would be wasting them without serious results. Let us remember our principle of the economy of forces. We cannot win everywhere: it is sufficient that we win at one point. We must fight everywhere with a minimum of forces in order to be overwhelming at that point. We must know how to economize every- where in order to spend lavishly at the point where we seek a decision; there we shal
