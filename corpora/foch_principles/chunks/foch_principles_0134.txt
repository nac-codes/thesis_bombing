verywhere with a minimum of forces in order to be overwhelming at that point. We must know how to economize every- where in order to spend lavishly at the point where we seek a decision; there we shall need mass, and we must therefore prepare a mass and keep it in reserve. The 5th Corps, carefully economized, will therefore have to first mass, to then move, possessing necessary information, opposite the point of attack and to deploy there.

Quite different would have been on that same day the mission of an advance guard to the 1st Corps, intelli- gently
