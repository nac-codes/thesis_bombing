nt of its appearance on the ground, the conditions were known, and the enemy located. Quite different would have been on that same day the mission of an advance guard to the 1st Corps, intelli- gently organized. It would have had at the beginning of the day to (1) Inform the commander of the actions of the ad- versary; (2) Protect the moves by which the commander par- ried such actions. Quite different again was the mission, two days earlier, of the Douai Division, advance guard for the Army of Alsace at Wissembourg. As such, it must: (1) Reconnoiter the German forces entering Alsace; (2) Protect the concentration of French troops des- tined to engage them.

Once more we find that to bring the forces to the battlefield is not all; that protection which, by preserving our freedom of action, has allowed us to bring them there, must be continued by more protection allowing of their free disposal and of their employment wherever desired, whenever desired. To that end, it must: (1) Supply information as to the point or points to attack; (2) Guarantee the possibility of bringing and deploy- ing the main body opposite the chosen objectives; (3) Protect the main body during all the preliminary operations. Let us now take up the problem from a more general point of view: whether we deal with the 5th Corps arriving at Froeschwiller, the Army of Alsace in course of concentration, the Kettler Brigade reaching Changey or the Valmy Farm, the commander always has some maneuvering to plan, to prepare, to carry out. The problem to be solved is no simple one: It is in presence of the enemy that a decision must be taken; It is with dispersed troop
