strike, it is against the main body we must guard, it is about the main body that we need information. We must know where it is, and for that reason we must pierce the protective troops which evidently cover it. Our instrument of informa- tion must therefore be possessed of force. Yet that is not all: we must know what the main body consists of, and how much it is worth. The advance guard must therefore, in order to compel the main body of the opponent to show itself, force it to deploy; that requires attack, which means artillery and infantry. To that extent must an advance guard carry out its mission of reconnaissance, and inversely that mission is carried out when such first duty, the obtaining of in- formation as to the enemy's main body, is completed. But there is another condition unfavorable to our maneuver, namely dispersion. We arrive in column of route, or even in several col- umns: an army corps, 22 to 24 kilometers long, requires five or six hours to pass a given point, to enable its tail to join the head. During these five or six hours it dis- poses only of a part of its forces. The commander of the army corps cannot contemplate, however, pouring his troops drop by drop into even an action already directed. He must therefore assemble his troops, and then deploy them and place them facing their objective. Under different circumstances, a different form of assembly must be assured. The Army of Alsace in 1870 had to concentrate its Ist, 5th and 7th Army Corps before accepting any battle;   ## p. 158 (#166) ############################################  158 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR its advance guard, the Douai Division, could enable it to do so. The operation, which takes a long time, needs to be protected under penalty of being compromised. That is protection, and therefore the business of the advance guard. It must insure the arrival in place of all the battle troops in spite of the presence of the enemy. To cover the assembly of the forces, later their em- p
