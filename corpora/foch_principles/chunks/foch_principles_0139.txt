therefore the business of the advance guard. It must insure the arrival in place of all the battle troops in spite of the presence of the enemy. To cover the assembly of the forces, later their em- ployment, such is the second duty pertaining to the ad- vance guard. It implies especially time; resistance must be offered with weak forces over an extended front. How can that be done? By strong positions, according to Carnot; By maneuver when there is space enough. The position which suffices for the desired result is, as we have seen, that which provides obstacles and a clear field of fire. Tactics will consist in hastening to such positions, in order to there begin the battle at long range by fire, to delay the decision. It is the Kettler Brigade arriving before Talant and thrusting its advance guard companies on the two spurs north and south of the main road, and later at Daix; it protects, by that immediate precaution, the arrival of the main column and of the Turcey column (main body), holding a strong enough position to halt until further orders, with a small amount of troops (1 battalion, 2 batteries and 2 companies), the attack of far superior troops (several brigades of Garibaldi). It is the advance guard of the Prussian Guard, on August 18th, hastening to Saint-Ail, then attacking Sainte- Marie-aux-ChÃªnes.

What is that ground, how much space is necessary? We must evidently cover the place of assembly, but we must also cover the entry of the troops into action, cover therefore space enough for the deployment of the main body. The ground occupied by an advance guard may, for that reason, equal the length of the front. A regiment acting as advance guard to a division can, in that manner, have to stretch over 1,500, 1,800, 2,000 meters or even more to cover the whole
