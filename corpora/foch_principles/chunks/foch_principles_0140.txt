, for that reason, equal the length of the front. A regiment acting as advance guard to a division can, in that manner, have to stretch over 1,500, 1,800, 2,000 meters or even more to cover the whole space required by the division. It can do so in safety through the use of ground under the conditions which we have examined. That is not in contradiction with the limits prescribed by Regulations, with frontages determined there, be- cause for the advance guard it is not a question of battle to defeat the enemy, and therefore not a question of battle formation. The purpose is different: we propose to discover the enemy and to guard against him, over a certain space and during a certain time. When we study the battle, we shall see what frontages to give to troops in order to obtain the result sought, the defeat of the enemy. To-day the result sought is different. We must provide for the main body not only the ground necessary for maneuver, but also all the outlets which it may need for its deployment. To insure possession, means to allow of carrying out in safety movement and deployment. The advance guard must consequently hold any positions controlling the outlet or controlling points from which the enemy   ## p. 160 (#168) ############################################  160 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR might bring fire to bear on such outlets or on the place of deployment. An example is provided by the advance guards of the 2nd German Army, establishing themselves, the 3rd of August, on the right bank of the Lauter, because on the following day the army is to cross the river: tactical protection. Another example is that of the Fran√ßois Brigade of the Kamecke Division reaching Sarrebruck on August 6th. The bridges are intact, it immediately seizes them. In that way it controls, for its army corps, the means of crossing the Sarre. But that only insures the actual ground; it must still guarantee its free use, the right of crossing the bridges. That can only be done by seizing the
