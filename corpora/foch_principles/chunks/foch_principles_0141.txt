That can only be done by seizing the heights on the left bank of the Sarre; they are a tactical necessity, and are accordingly seized. The function of the advance guard is then not only one of protection, of material safety; it is also one of prepa- ration, of tactical safety. But as long as we have not beaten, or at least attacked, him, the enemy has his freedom of action, and can accord- ingly alter his dispositions or avoid the maneuver which we plan. The first two results obtained by the advance guard, reconnaissance of the enemy and safety for the move- ment of our troops, would be of no use to us if the ad- vance guard went no further.
