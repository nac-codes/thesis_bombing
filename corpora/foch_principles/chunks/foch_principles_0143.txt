necessary to our protective duties. or our preparative duties. These are offensive missions which need to be carefully planned. To hold the ground necessary for protection and for preparation when we have it and need only keep it, the action will be defensive. It is the case of the Kettler Brigade arrived and established on the heights to the east of the Changey Farm, and at Daix. Under that form, advance guard tactics require capac- ity of resistance and power of endurance. They employ for that purpose everything that can develop these ad- vantages: positions, strong points, clear fields of fire, rear guard actions.   ## p. 163 (#171) ############################################  THE ADVANCE GUARD 163 How can we fulfill simultaneously those three tasks which may require different means? How can we at the same time be on the offensive and on the defensive? It is evidently attack which we must employ, but keeping always the assurance of recurring efficiently to defensive if the necessity arises. While we are conducting a systematic offensive with part of the forces, we shall keep the remainder for the occupation and organization of strong points in the rear; we shall take care, of course, to advance that line of resistance as the offensive progresses. From this rough outline we can get an idea of the varied forms assumed by an advance guard engagement, according to the degree of progress and to the difficulties presented by each of the three questions to be solved, and according also to the special conditions of time, place, space, under which it is developed. There can be no one form, no one type of advance guard engagement; there can be no one formula cover- ing it always. The same is true of the composition of the advance guard. It is determined by the treble duty to be fulfilled: To reconnoiter, we naturally need cavalry; but we also need infantry and artillery to overcome the enemy's first resistance, to reach his main body and compel it to deploy; To protect a
