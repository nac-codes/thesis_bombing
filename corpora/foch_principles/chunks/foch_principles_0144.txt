be fulfilled: To reconnoiter, we naturally need cavalry; but we also need infantry and artillery to overcome the enemy's first resistance, to reach his main body and compel it to deploy; To protect and to hold out, we need the means of fire at long range; troops capable of resistance, of firmly holding ground: infantry and artillery; To immobilize the enemy, we must of course resort to the offensive, conduct it far enough to threaten the enemy   ## p. 164 (#172) ############################################  164 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR with assault, or otherwise he can escape: we need in- fantry. To such an advance guard of infantry, cavalry and artillery there has been opposed sometimes an advance guard of cavalry exclusively. We have already seen how, even from the point of view of information, cavalry alone is insufficient. That insufficiency is more apparent still if we consider the two other duties of the advance guard. Cavalry, shock troops par excellence and therefore suitable for immediate results, fulfills by no manner of means the condition of prolonged resistance which we seek. Similarly, it assures only imperfectly space, because it does not hold the ground. Reinforced by artillery, it offers a great power of action and of resistance, yet it is difficult for it to con- quer and to keep. Moreover, if beaten only partially, it risks very much to lose its artillery. The latter, in order to work efficiently, requires to be guarded closely and strongly; it needs the help of infantry. The advance guard must therefore have each kind of arm, and as it acts independently it must also have one sole commander. That theory of the advance guard which we have sought to establish by reasoning is a true characteristic of the tactics of Napoleon. I will prove it. Napoleon wrote: (( An army must every day, every night and every hour be ready to oppose all the resistance of which it is capable. It necessitates that the army's various divisions   ## p. 165 (#173) ############
