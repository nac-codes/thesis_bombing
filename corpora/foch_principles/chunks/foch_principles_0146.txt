One cannot camp, halt or march in battle formation. How can the necessity clearly stated by Napoleon be reconciled with the absolute impossibility, evident in practice, unless it be by the use of that property recognized and developed in the troops, capacity of resist ance, which allows a certain portion, the advance guard specially organized and disposed for the purpose, to re- ceive in any case the adversary and to stop him long enough for the main body to assume battle forma- tion? Moreover, every effort which troops can and must make to overcome the enemy need not occur at the same instant. The commander of an army corps, if he dis- pose of eight infantry regiments, will not engage them all simultaneously, even if he has them assembled at hand. Unity of time does not imply unity of instant. When we undertake the study of battle, of the action of force, we shall see the battle to be divided into a series of operations, into a succession of efforts aimed: (1) Some at directing the command; (2) Others at absorbing the enemy's activity, at wear- ing him out; (3) Others, finally, at breaking by violent shock the equilibrium established between the pressure of the assailant and the resistance of the defender. Sound employment of the forces, even if aimed at complete decision, entails the idea therefore of progress, of succession in the supply of forces. The first forces engaged must have produced their effect in order that the others may benefit by it. That idea of succession, once again, is not contrary to unity of time; it is neces-   ## p. 167 (#175) ############################################  THE ADVANCE GUARD 167 sary that time intervene to allow the troops and the armament to produce all the results of which they are capable.
