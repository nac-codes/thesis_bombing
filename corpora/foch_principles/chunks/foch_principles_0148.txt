y the readiness for battle of the troops protected, there is then a second duty, the duty of obtaining information through: Certain reports, which pierce for that purpose the apparent line of the enemy's service of protection and bear on his main body; True reports, reliable to the last moment, which neces- sitates that the source of information, the advance guard, preserve contact with the enemy, once he has been met, up to the last moment. From that double necessity of preserving always for the troops their ability to battle, of supplying certain and true information up to the last moment, we again find the advance guard with its duty to: Provide information; Afford protection; Engage and hold the enemy. All this means that the advance guard is needed up to the moment when the main body becomes engaged by deployment and first action on the enemy. I insist on that point because one readily admits, in practice, the need of an advance guard in front of a column of route; one admits it less before an assembled body; one often rejects it before troops extended. As though, because we are assembled or deployed, we   ## p. 169 (#177) ############################################  THE ADVANCE GUARD 169 had the right to fly from one surprise to another, to maneuver in danger, to come suddenly under the hail of murderous projectiles which infantry sends as far as 2,000 meters, artillery as far as 4,000 meters; under a fire so brutal that it demoralizes any formation (espe- cially in mass), unless the danger has been previously foreseen by the advance guard, and unless that instru- ment has been maintained till the last moment. As though we could reasonably draw up plans accord- ing to reports which are uncertain, or which even if true at the moment of deployment cease to be so at the time of approaching the enemy, that is a long time later, con- sidering the great distance at which deployment must now be carried out. To deprive oneself of the advance guard before engaging the
