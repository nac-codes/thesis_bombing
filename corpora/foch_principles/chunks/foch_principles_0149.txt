To deprive oneself of the advance guard before engaging the enemy is to interrupt contact at the moment it is most needed, it is to permit modification by the enemy of a situation which has caused us to take some dispositions which will no longer accord with real conditions. We accordingly find again the necessity, before any troop not engaged, of an advance guard (whose form and use vary) constantly facing the enemy, in condition to deal with him if he appears, never losing sight of him, compelling him to display himself and his intentions; allowing also the commander of the main body to avoid battle if battle be not in accordance with his wishes, or to accept battle under favorable conditions, that is after re- flection and suitable distribution of the troops in accord- ance with information obtained.
