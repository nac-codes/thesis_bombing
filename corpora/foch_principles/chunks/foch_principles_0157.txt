t the offensive was the hardest thing to organize, because of the nature of the ground. The commander of the 6th Austrian Corps might understand his mission in two ways, because he was free to either take up a position near Skalitz, or, if the enemy appeared, to attack him with the utmost energy. In both cases results were easily obtained. If he de- cided to take up positions near Skalitz, he would find near Kleny a ground with a clear field of fire, and he could reach that ground on the 27th without material difficulty, because of the distances, and without tactical difficulty on condition of taking the most elementary pre- cautions, for the enemy needed the whole day to place on Nachod the equivalent of an army corps. The position having been reached, he had time to occupy it and organize it during the evening of the 27th and morning of the 28th. But he must at least have conceived the idea and sought to realize it. Should he, on the other hand, adopt the offensive, he had ground favorable to maneuver, allowing a whole army corps to be offered, free of its movements, able to fight against forces which were in echelons within a long defile, which they could only leave through one exit. Yet, in order to obtain results, it was necessary to foresee such offensive, to prepare and carry out its logical accom- plishment. A comparison of the hours at which, as the result of chance, the movements began, shows that in this respect   ## p. 180 (#188) ############################################  180 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR also fortune was keeping a precious advantage for the Austrian commander. For the Prussian Corps, we have seen that nothing is accomplished so long as it has not obtained strong pos- session of the plateau west of Nachod, a plateau marked by Wenzelsberg, Wysokow and the heights of Nachod. Any enemy occupying these points endangered the whole scheme. But these indispensable strong points must be sought 24 kilometers away. If the Austrians adopted the idea of
