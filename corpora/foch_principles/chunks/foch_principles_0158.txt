and the heights of Nachod. Any enemy occupying these points endangered the whole scheme. But these indispensable strong points must be sought 24 kilometers away. If the Austrians adopted the idea of an offensive for the purpose of throwing the Prussians back into the de- file, they must first seize Wenzelsberg and Wysokow and use them as strong points and starting points for all their movements to that end. If, on the other hand, they followed the plan of taking up positions near Kleny while preserving the right to further action against the defile, it was still the posses- sion of Wysokow and Wenzelsberg which they must obtain. These points were not more than 13 kilometers from the two Jonack and Hertweck Brigades, which could moreover receive prompt assistance, and therefore spend themselves lavishly. Thirteen kilometers as against twenty-four. If the Prussians and Austrians started at the same hour the Austrians could therefore fight during three or four hours with an undeniable superiority of numbers. But in reality, the Prussian plans for the 27th were two hours behind those of the Austrians. At 5 o'clock in one case, at 3 o'clock in the other, the start was to be made. Altogether there would be an advantage of five or six hours in favor of the Austrian brigades.

They also had a cavalry divi- sion. Such were the particularly difficult conditions (they could be partly foreseen, that is why I mention them) under which the Prussian general had to bring his column out of a long defile, and then deploy it. To insure the success of these operations was the duty of his advance guard, a very heavy duty if we remember the numerical advantage which it must overcome, and the length of resistance it must provide. We shall now see how the advance guard succeeded. THE EVENING OF JUNE 26T
