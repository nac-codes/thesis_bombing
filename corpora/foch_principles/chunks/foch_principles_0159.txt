a very heavy duty if we remember the numerical advantage which it must overcome, and the length of resistance it must provide. We shall now see how the advance guard succeeded. THE EVENING OF JUNE 26TH IN THE TWO HEADQUARTERS On the Prussian side, we already know that the ad- vance guard of General Loewenfeld had advanced on its own initiative from the Mettau to Nachod.
