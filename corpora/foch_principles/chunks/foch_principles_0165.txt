e. Certain units even received it only after the time when its execu- tion should have begun. As we see, General Raming decides neither to take with his army corps a position from which to stop the enemy if he issues from the mountains, nor to throw him back by an offensive if the opportunity occurs. He states neither of these results to be accomplished.   ## p. 188 (#196) ############################################  188 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR He even renders himself unable to attain either if, later on, he should come to a decision. If the enemy does not interfere in the movement, he will finally at the end of the day have a situation full of weakness: I brigade at Wysokow; I brigade at Kleny; I on the right bank of the Aupa, north of Skalitz; I between Spila and Skalitz; The artillery reserve at Kikow. Each of these brigades is to take up positions on the ground assigned to it, facing the east: that disposition can only result in four successive and distinct brigade en- gagements, if we reckon the distances (7 kilometers from Wysokow to Skalitz, 4 from Wysokow to Kleny) and re- member obstacles like the Aupa which separate the brigades.

But if the enemy appears during the march to Skalitz, the same impossibilities appear: one cannot possibly op- pose to him an army corps, but only four brigades and an artillery reserve, all acting independently, not to men- tion the other elements which are dispersed in various directions.
