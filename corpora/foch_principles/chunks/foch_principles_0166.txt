The alarm of the Jonack and Hertweck Brigades during the evening of the 26th confirmed that forecast. The right column of the Austrians, most exposed to attack, should have been well provided with cavalry and artil- lery.

Lack of time probably prevents giving it sounder em- ployment. In the same way, the Hertweck Brigade disposes of one battery only, which is insufficient; the other brigades have one also, and they do not need it. (2) The left column is followed by all the artillery reserve. It evidently does not need it. If it needs to be withdrawn and moved elsewhere, the movement will be a long one, entailing much delay. (3) We find the characteristic faults of a fixed and symmetrical disposition of the forces. The threatened flank is always too weak, the flank that is not threatened is always too strong.
