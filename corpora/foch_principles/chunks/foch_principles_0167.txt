############################################  190 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR pare a maneuver, to conceal it and to carry it out. The thing is impossible if the enemy attacks; the four brigades will almost immediately be engaged. It will not be pos- sible to dispose of them. (4) Even before the army corps comes into contact with the enemy, its dispositions make any maneuver diffi- cult because of the length of its front (10 to 12 kilo- meters); any change of direction by the heads of columns is a very slow operation; a change of direction by the flank is impossible; there is no depth. Let us now examine the problem for our own account; let us presume we are at Opocno, having received an order which repeats the information received and tells us, for the purpose of protecting the army's concentra- tion in Josephstadt, to move the army corps to Skalitz where it must guard the Nachod and Kosteletz roads. If we do not encounter the enemy on that march we must take up near Skalitz a position from which we can take action on all the dangerous roads. Such dispositions being once taken, if the enemy appear by Nachod, for example, the army corps must keep him from debouching out of the defile; if necessary it must throw him back into it by an energetic offensive. In view of that possi- bility, the army corps must assure to itself the possession of the plateau which commands the defile of Nachod. An advance guard will be pushed in that direction to- wards Wysokow. For similar reasons, another will be pushed north. To obtain information concerning the enemy's movements, to hold every issue by which he may appear: such are the tactics to be followed after our arrival.   ## p. 191 (#199) ############################################  THE ADVANCE GUARD AT NACHOD 191 If, however, during the march our army corps en- counters the enemy debouching from Nachod, no hesi- tation is possible; we must attack him, throw him back into the defile, guaranteeing to ourselves at the same time a future
