march our army corps en- counters the enemy debouching from Nachod, no hesi- tation is possible; we must attack him, throw him back into the defile, guaranteeing to ourselves at the same time a future occupation of Skalitz. The army corps will then proceed in a formation enabling it to seek and under- take battle with all its forces, instead of being drawn into it gradually. In either case we will not pursue further than Nachod the retreating enemy. If we should not succeed in throwing the enemy back into the defile, we must nevertheless seek to reach the position of Skalitz; we must maneuver with that purpose in view. These elements of the problem being known, how shall we execute the move? We have four roads, are we to use them all? A division marching by itself on a road has a length of about 15 kilometers. A second division, following the first, oc- cupies hardly more than 9 kilometers. If the two divisions march separately by two roads divided by the distance d we need, in order to assemble them at a point a on the first road, the necessary time for the last portion of the second column to arrive, that is to cover 15 kilo- meters+d. If the two divisions march one behind the other, the time necessary for assembly is the time necessary to cover 15+9=24 kilometers. 15A ✔ 15K 8°d" lidiv" | TITE 728k   ## p. 192 (#200) ############################################  192 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR In proportion then as d > 9, there is an advantage in taking one road or two. If we divide the corps into four brigades over four roads, the time necessary for assembly is the time neces- sary to cover 8+d+d+d"; and if therefore ddd"> 24— 8, or 16, it is a loss of time to use four roads. But other considerations of a tactical nature appear, and limit more closely the choice of roads to follow. While moving to Skalitz we wish to be prepared to meet the enemy, and to attack him even under favorable conditions if he appears. We need the power to maneu- ver up to the last moment, so w
