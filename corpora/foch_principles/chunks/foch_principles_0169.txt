o follow. While moving to Skalitz we wish to be prepared to meet the enemy, and to attack him even under favorable conditions if he appears. We need the power to maneu- ver up to the last moment, so we must be assembled. We must be able to change the distribution, to economize our forces, to advance them under cover. To meet these conditions we must organize in depth. For these various reasons, we will only use two roads, that of Dobruschka-Neustadt-Wrchowin, and that of Pohor-Bohuslawitz-Cerncie-Nahoran-Lhota. The average distance between them is only 4 or 5 kilometers. The main body of the army corps will move by these two roads.

On the other hand, the Prussian dispositions are not above criticism: To move the advance guard to the frontier, a short day's march from Reinerz, was evidently not without danger, but it was justified by the general situa
