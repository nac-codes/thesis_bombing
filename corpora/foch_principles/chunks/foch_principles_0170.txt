Prussian dispositions are not above criticism: To move the advance guard to the frontier, a short day's march from Reinerz, was evidently not without danger, but it was justified by the general situation and also by the nature of the ground which compelled echelon formation. But to push that advance guard any further, as far as Nachod, as General Loewenfeld did on the evening of the 26th, was to undertake an act of temerity full of serious danger. It was difficult to expect an advance guard composed of 6 battalions, 4 squadrons and 12 guns to resist five or six hours on the space necessary to the army corps' deployment, in advance of a defile, in presence of superior forces. The presence of such superior forces in the neighbor- hood of Nachod was known. One knew an Austrian army corps to have been concentrated on the 26th at Opocno; one knew that other columns were assembling at Skalitz.   ## p. 194 (#204) ############################################  194 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR A violent attack should have been expected therefore for the 27th, when debouching, in the direction of Opocno or of Skalitz. One could not hope to debouch and deploy in the presence of such superior forces unless special dispositions were taken that would overcome the difficult conditions which would occur. These disposi- tions must consist in: (1) Reducing the distance between the advance guard and main body, in order to support the advance guard as promptly as possible; (2) Increasing the artillery of the advance guard; (3) Marching in as solid and concentrated formation as possible, also for the purpose of shortening the crisis; (4) Undertaking the march so as to arrive early on the 27th at Nachod. Instead of starting at 5 o'clock, starting at 3 o'clock. To these prudent dispositions it can be objected that, as a matter of fact, the bold leap of the evening of the 26th made the Prussian Corps master of the bridge and crossing of the Mettau. Such an advantage was insuffi- cient to compensa
