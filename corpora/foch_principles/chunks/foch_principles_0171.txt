e objected that, as a matter of fact, the bold leap of the evening of the 26th made the Prussian Corps master of the bridge and crossing of the Mettau. Such an advantage was insuffi- cient to compensate the dangers of the enterprise; for in view of the weak occupation of the bridge, the small im- portance of the river, things which were known, it was enough to push forward during the night the battalion of pioneers, to carry the enemy posts, to repair the bridge and establish additional crossings near the bridge so that the main body might carry out its march without suffer- ing any delay. But this risky action was also a very inconvenient one. The entry into Bohemia of the Second Army was to be undertaken at several points simultaneously and by sur- prise. That character of the operation was to be re-   ## p. 195 (#205) ############################################  THE ADVANCE GUARD AT NACHOD 195 spected in every army corps.

In fact, as we know, the Austrian general-in-chief re- ceived at 8.50, in Josephstadt, the news that the post of Nachod had been attacked by much superior forces, and that it had consequently fallen back on Skalitz. It could not be expected that after receiving such news he would fail to take proper measures. At the time of giving to the Austrian commander such clear warning, one could not foresee on his part such lack of resolution. A study of the campaign of 1806, which offers a simi- lar case, would be most instructive. We should see Napoleon proceeding in a quite different manner to seize the crossing of the mountains, to prevent the enemy from defending promptly enough the points threatened. Thus, on the e
