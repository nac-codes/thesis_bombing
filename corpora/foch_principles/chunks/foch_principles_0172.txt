ructive. We should see Napoleon proceeding in a quite different manner to seize the crossing of the mountains, to prevent the enemy from defending promptly enough the points threatened. Thus, on the evening of the 25th, he would still have kept his forces in echelons, a fair distance from the frontier, giving thereby no indication as to the passages he pro- posed to employ. On the 26th, he would have brought his army corps to the frontier after a long march; the head of the 5th Corps would have reached Schlaney, and the whole corps would have assembled solidly between Schlaney and Lewin, forming what the Emperor called a Mass of War. On the 27th, the head of the army corps starting at 3 A.M. would have reached Nachod at 4 A.M.

On the evening of the 26th they become evident every- where, and the Austrian command decides on measures for counteracting them. On the 27th, these measures are carried out, but too late to bring the Austrian forces to Nachod before the enemy. Napoleon tells us his methods himself, when he writes to Marshal Lannes, commanding the 5th Corps, one of the advance guard corps in October, 1806: "C On the 7th, you will camp between Hassfurt and Coburg (march of approach). "On the 8th you will enter Coburg (or suppose Nachod) so as to reach it with your whole army corps, and so that an hour before the arrival of your grena- diers there be no suspicion in Coburg of the beginning of hostilities. Arrived in Coburg, you will take up a posi- tion in advance of that city, arranging so as to be on the 10th in Grafenthal, and you will prepare to support us." And again, he writes to Marshal Sou
