ies. Arrived in Coburg, you will take up a posi- tion in advance of that city, arranging so as to be on the 10th in Grafenthal, and you will prepare to support us." And again, he writes to Marshal Soult: "" The Emperor orders that you prepare to enter Baireuth on the 8th, as early as possible. You will enter it in mass, so that an hour after the entrance of the first of your Hussars your whole army corps will be in Baireuth, and able to cover a few leagues more. • 99   ## p. 197 (#207) ############################################  THE ADVANCE GUARD AT NACHOD 197 DEVELOPMENT of the BATTLE FROM 3 O'CLOCK TILL 8.30 (See Map No. 5) On June 27th, 1866, the 5th Prussian Corps starts at 5 o'clock from Nachod. The advance guard, which was far ahead, starts at 6 o'clock only. At 8 o'clock the advance party of 2 battalions infantry, 2 companies chausseurs, 2 squadrons dragoons and I battery reaches Branka, in front of Nachod. It sends without delay as reconnaissances: on the road of Neustadt, I squadron dragoons and ½ company chasseurs; to the uneven ground north of Branka, to- wards Kramolna where enemy cavalry has been seen, it sends I company chasseurs; on the road of Skalitz it pushes I squadron and 1 battalion (incomplete through the delay of a ½ battalion) which are to occupy Wyso- kow. Steinmetz arrives about 8 o'clock at Nachod; he is informed there that the advance guard has debouched without meeting the enemy. Expecting the day to go by without difficulties, he advises the 2nd Division of the Guard that he does not propose to use the assistance which it offered to him at Kronow. The commander of the advance guard is busy issuing his outpost orders when the squadron pushed along the Neustadt road advises him, at 8.30, of the enemy's ap- proach. When the squadron reached the plateau it had seen strong columns of all arms marching along the Neustadt road in the direction of Skalitz. They had already reached Schonow, Provodow and Domkow.
