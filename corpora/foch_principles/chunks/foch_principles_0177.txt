Before seeing how the advance guard acts, let us examine the ground. POSITION OF THE PLATEAU OF WENZELSBERG The Neustadt road follows a cutting, Branka-Schlucht then the western edge of the forest of Branka, approxi- mately on the crest of the plateau. This forest ends on the east in steep and rugged slopes which extend to the Mettau. The crest of the plateau rises with the road, passes later east of the road which still provides, however, with the edge of the forest a powerful line of resistance.   ## p. 202 (#212) ############################################  202 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR There is found the last strong point for troops which fight facing west, without possibility however of employ- ing much cavalry or artillery, because of the woods and steep slopes which extend to the Mettau. The plateau of Wenzelsberg dominates all the ground stretching west, especially the heights of Kleny. But sight is interfered with by covered ground, both in the Prowodow and Schonow direction, and in that of Neu- stadt and Wrchowin. Assaulting troops coming from these directions find in the bushes and cuttings protection against fire and against sight of the defenders; such pro- tection was doubly great on the day of the battle, be- cause of the advanced condition of the harvest. Thus, the line of defense of the plateau of Wenzels- berg facing west is not on the crest but halfway down the slope. It can be traced by the western edge of Wysokow, the southwestern edge of the small wood (Wäldchen), the Eglise Evangélique of Wenzelsberg, the Maison For- tière and groups of trees that surround it on the east and on the south as far as Sochors. From that line runs a slope with an inclination of 5 to 10 degrees, entirely open, allowing powerful artil- lery and infantry fire. Moreover, the line of defense is high enough to dominate
