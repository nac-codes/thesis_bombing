as Sochors. From that line runs a slope with an inclination of 5 to 10 degrees, entirely open, allowing powerful artil- lery and infantry fire. Moreover, the line of defense is high enough to dominate the heights of Kleny. Its length is about 4,000 meters. It provides a good defensive position for an army corps. The distribution of the forces would then include: The occupation of the localities by infantry supported by a few batteries; the massing of the cavalry and artil- lery between Wysokow and the WÃ¤ldchen wood to the south. The massing of all the infantry reserve on the plateau   ## p. 203 (#213) ############################################  THE ADVANCE GUARD AT NACHOD 203 east of that wood; a detachment of infantry with artillery to be moved to the plateau, north of Wysokow. The disadvantage of the position is evidently its lack of depth, and consequently the difficulty of moving, in the rear, any artillery or cavalry. It is easy to see, however, that if it be occupied as I have suggested it would be difficult to envelop by its left, on account of the wooded nature of the ground. At- tacked on its right by troops pointed at Nachod, there would be time enough, thanks to the detachment holding the plateau north of Wysokow, to take counter-disposi- tions capable of stopping the enveloping movement which could only be slowly carried out. On the other hand, in front of the position are found Prowodow and Schonow, behind which the enemy can assemble and dispose his troops, and in case of necessity employ them as points on which to retire. The stream which runs from Wysokow to northwest of Prowodow is absolutely negligible; it has numerous crossings, and is nowhere an obstacle; the meadows along its banks were dry and firm. These particularities of the position became especially evident when the Austrians, thrust back on Schonow and Prowodow sought, in a violent effort, to envelop the right flank of the position; it was too late. Considering the nature of the ground,
