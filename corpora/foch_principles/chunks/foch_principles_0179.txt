pecially evident when the Austrians, thrust back on Schonow and Prowodow sought, in a violent effort, to envelop the right flank of the position; it was too late. Considering the nature of the ground, what use would be made of it, and what could be expected of it on the 27th? The Austrians, because of their position and over- whelming superiority, could and should evidently seize as quickly as possible the line of defense mentioned pre-   ## p. 204 (#214) ############################################  204 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR viously, and in that case the fate of the 5th Prussian Corps was already half sealed: Its existence became at least very difficult, for the Austrians, starting from these points, had every facility for ejecting any Prussians who reached the Neustadt road. The objectives to aim at were, therefore, the Branka wood and Branka height. The Prussians, on the other hand, must seek to occupy the position of Wenzelsberg and woods surrounding it, or- ganizing there a first line of resistance, the second being formed by the Branka cut and western edge of the Branka wood. As to the resources which that second line would offer, there are, however, some remarks to be made: (1) On the Branka-Schlucht and Branka Wood front, infantry only could be employed; the ground on the east was not practical for artillery, and sight was very limited. On the left, artillery would meet with difficulty in moving or retiring. On the right, south of Wysokow, there were a few artillery positions, but it would soon have been exposed to fire from the little WÃ¤ldchen wood. (2) On this front effective fire could very easily be had up to 500 meters. There was little cover: the ditches of the road were in- significant, the woods cut, only a few large ones offering any cover. (3) Retirement from the position was difficult be- cause of the steepness of the slopes and thickness of the undergrowth. Retreat might be cut from Nachod by an enemy march- ing on Altstadt. On the other hand, be
