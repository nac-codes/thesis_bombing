nt from the position was difficult be- cause of the steepness of the slopes and thickness of the undergrowth. Retreat might be cut from Nachod by an enemy march- ing on Altstadt. On the other hand, behind this position was found   ## p. 205 (#215) ############################################  THE ADVANCE GUARD AT NACHOD 205 Hill 1113, which the Austrians might find profitable to occupy, because from there they swept the whole Alt- stadt-Nachod road. Having superficially studied these two principal posi- tions, let us examine more carefully the strong points which constitute the former, so that we may later under- stand what occurred there. The wood north of Wenzelsberg (WÃ¤ldchen on the German maps) has a northeasterly edge of 300 meters, with a depth of 1,300 to 1,400 meters. It consists of a number of groups of young trees, of undergrowth and of clearings: a mixture destined to mix up the battle in the same manner. It is framed on its northeastern and south- eastern edges by a sort of embankment. The inside contains some ravines, the beds of dried-up torrents. The most important of these ravines leads near the northern edge. The battle was destined to reveal all its tactical importance. It has, almost from its begin- ning, a depth of 10 to 15 meters, about the same width, very steep banks. It is an obstacle to the movement of infantry. That part of the ravine which ends at the southern edge of the wood offers good cover for infan- try, which finds there an excellent field of fire on the opposite slope, facing the Skalitz road. The southwestern border is not clearly defined. Wenzelsberg possesses, at its two northeastern and southwestern extremities, two solid buildings, the Evan- gelical Chapel and the church. The Evangelical Chapel offers a very good strong point facing Meierhof, with a good glacis opposite that locality, which it dominates by 50 meters. It can easily be forti-   ## p. 206 (#216) ############################################  206 THE PRINCIPLES OF
