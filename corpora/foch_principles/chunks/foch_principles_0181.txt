On the other hand, two hollow paths run parallel to it and provide an excellent approach for assault. Orchards run from there right and left, along Wenzelsberg, a small village of low houses, especially in its southern part. In the northern portion, the houses are more numerous, better grouped, more important, there is a better view from the gardens. The Wenzelsberg Church is a solid construction, with- out any opening towards Branka but with an opening towards Wenzelsberg, a few windows right and left. To provide good protection it required a few improve- ments in the church itself and in the surrounding wall. Between Wenzelsberg and the Maison Forestière we find an important ravine which is an impassable obstacle to artillery, cavalry or infantry under fire. At its two extremities it is more easily crossed. It provides an open- ing and means of approach to small detachments. The Maison Forestière is a solid construction with annexes, having no surrounding wall, inappropriate to defense, easy to assault because of the cover which the assailant finds up to quite near the house. The little triangular wood east of the Evangelical Chapel has no tactical value. It interferes with sight. Against an enemy coming from Branka the Wäldchen or the church of Wenzelsberg, the surrounding woods provide good strong points; but the efficacy of the fire which they permit is limited, the advance of the enemy being partly concealed from the defense by the heights and woods of Branka. On the other hand, any debouch- ing of the enemy from these heights and woods is always problematical. He cannot support his attack with artil- lery and cavalry.   ## p. 207 (#217) ############################################  THE ADVANCE GUARD AT NACHOD 207 Against an en
