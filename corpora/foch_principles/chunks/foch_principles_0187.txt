battalion of the 3rd of the 37th, which had supplied the outposts at Nachod, arrives late for that reason; it is placed in reserve on the edge of the Branka wood, north of Wäldchen; 护 ​(3) The main body's 2 companies of chasseurs are in the direction of Bracez, holding the Neustadt road. The distribution of Prussian forces at that moment is therefore: At Wysokow: ½ battalion (Kurowski) with 1 com- pany chasseurs.

We find I battalion, 1 battery and 4 squadrons resisting 1 brigade (7 battalions) and 8 guns. What course has the battalion followed? It would have been simple and logical to meet the su- periority of the attack by the cover and resistance to be obtained from the ground, by the occupation of Wenzels- berg Church, Wenzelsberg Village, and some of the most suitable houses. These cautious tactics would have had the disadvantage of breaking up th
