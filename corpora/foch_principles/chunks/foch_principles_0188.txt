obtained from the ground, by the occupation of Wenzels- berg Church, Wenzelsberg Village, and some of the most suitable houses. These cautious tactics would have had the disadvantage of breaking up the troops, of making their control, particularly as regards fire, very difficult.

Moreover, the half-battalions are intermixed, the regi- ments no longer exist; barely can the half-battalions be reorganized on the ground. There is for sole reserve I half-battalion. The circumstances explain and justify nevertheless the dispositions taken. If all the ground be not held, the army corps on its arrival will not have the space necessa
