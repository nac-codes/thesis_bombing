s fire should be individual or by volleys, rapid or deliberate, who also knows by experi ence in what measure and within what time his men can obtain the result desired, keeping their self-control and discipline. He also knows when nervousness and physi- cal fatigue will become apparent, how the men can then be taken in hand again, who realizes moreover that fire   ## p. 217 (#227) ############################################  THE ADVANCE GUARD AT NACHOD 217 alone cannot give a decision, who combines it therefore with the advance by sound discipline, interrupting it to march on the enemy, resuming it, if necessary, more vio- lent than before to clinch by bullets the demoralization caused by his advance. The same preoccupation of giving to fire all its power is constantly evidenced by the Prussian infantry of 1870, although its armament is then inferior to the French "chassepot." One seeks first of all to reach a position from which the enemy can be held, crushed by fire, while behind this position is being organized the assault, which by its ad- vance uses and develops the acquired superiority. The position is reached by small units, extended in any possible way, taking advantage of all natural cover, the primary consideration being to reach there without suffer- ing from the enemy's fire. Once that position is occupied, the battle for superiority of fire is begun, every effort being made to maintain both fire control and fire direction (objectives and ranges). This lasts as long as may be necessary to prepare the attack, which is normally carried out chiefly by troops ad- vanced in echelons from the rear, reinforcing the units in the firing line. To-day we find the same preoccupation of efficient fire control appear in the German maneuvers. Von der Goltz writes: "Another phenomenon which does not lack importance has also been observed since the war of 1870. I refer to that new principle concerning infantry, principle in accordance with which that branch of the serv
