Its formations at that range, the use it makes of its forces, must aim therefore at the preparation of the first act, the battle for supe- riority of fire, considering its possibilities in the same way as they consider the possibilities of the later assault with the bayonet. Thus we find in the infantry battle, more or less altered by modern conditions: (1) A period of marching to attain a position allowing fire of assured efficiency, or the nearest position that can be reached in safety. During this period the troops cause little harm to the enemy, and are exposed to heavy casual- ties unless they avoid them by: (a) Formation; a poor help in view of present arma- ment; the least vulnerable formations are still too much so to allow of marching; (b) Some limited fire, able in spite of its small efficiency to maintain a certain confusion among the enemy and to a certain extent paralyze his means; (c) Ground and the cover it affords; that is the only real protection against enemy fire, and it therefore de- cides what formations to employ; they must allow the use of cover, but also in view of the battle for supremacy of fire to be soon undertaken, these formations must avoid dispersing the troops, losing their cohesion and letting them waste their ammunition.
