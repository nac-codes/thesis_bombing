hey have to deal. First of all, the objective of the attack must be de- termined. The same considerations as to space to be covered under enemy fire and as to the effects sought result in the choice, as first objective, of that enemy point which is nearest at hand, and on which can be em- ployed a numerical superiority guaranteeing a superiority of results. In this case, we start from the triangular wood and the northern part of the ravine to attack the wood east of Wenzelsberg: objective close at hand, weakly held, forming a salient, easy to envelop and to assault with superior forces. The 3rd Battalion extends (covered by the 1st Bat- talion of the advance guard, which abandons to the 2nd Regiment the total or partial occupation of Wenzels- berg) in the northern part of the ravine, and begins at these points the battle for superiority of fire. It prepares, at the same time, to carry the wood, and for that purpose to march without losing its superiority of fire. It will proceed in extended formation supported by columns of companies or by troops in line. Once the wood is reached, as the decision inside may be delayed, it is sought simultaneously outside by troops operating outside its fringe. To enter the wood and conquer it (because of the length of its fringe and of the distance to cross before reaching it) is a possible task for the 3rd Battalion; it will debouch from the northern part of the ravine, or- ganized: (a) To first strike the salient aimed at, which will   ## p. 224 (#234) ############################################  224 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR probably require 2 companies in extended formation, a third one supporting in the rear; (b) To maneuver along the fringe, overcome if neces- sary all resistance inside the wood, which will require the fourth company in reserve, forming echelons to the right. This attack is supported as to its front by the 1st Bat- talion, employing part of its forces along the northern fringe of the wood, insuring at least the o
