This attack is supported as to its front by the 1st Bat- talion, employing part of its forces along the northern fringe of the wood, insuring at least the occupation of that wood. Yet the attack may be powerless, stop when insuffi- ciently pushed: the 4th Battalion moves forward in regi- mental reserve inside the ravine, ready to interfere, either to support the exhausted attack or to follow it up once it has succeeded. But in order also that the attack may succeed, it must be protected against any surprise from the enemy, counter- attacks or powerful fire, especially on its outer flank. That duty belongs to the 2nd Battalion (previously of the advance guard) which, in order to carry it out, occupies the northern fringe of the wood northeast of the Maison Forestière with I company, afterwards occupy- ing with another company the northern end of the ravine and the little wood touching it; it thus covers the flank of the attack, advancing constantly without abandoning the strong points in the rear.

In such a series of successive actions is a battle transformed with modern weapons: an effort to advance on the right when no further frontal advance is possible; to maneuver by one flank when the other is stopped; keeping always the freedom to maneuver by preliminary measures of
