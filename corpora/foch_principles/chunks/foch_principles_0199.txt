s: an effort to advance on the right when no further frontal advance is possible; to maneuver by one flank when the other is stopped; keeping always the freedom to maneuver by preliminary measures of safety; preserving always, at the point of attack, the possibility, allowed by the nature of the ground, of applying numerical superiority obtained by careful planning. In order to be sure of getting the wood, our point of attack, we shall use there all the forces we have, all the rifles and all the guns. We must ask the artillery to prepare the attack, and for that purpose to place itself where it can observe (or obtain indirect observation). But the hostile artillery will observe it also and interfere with it, so that it should take a position from which it can observe without being observed, or else obtain a superiority over that enemy artillery. For that purpose it also requires numbers. The Wenzelsberg wood being seized, the plateau can- not any longer be held by the Prussian advance guard. The attack of the second position could then be under- taken. From what precedes, we find in an operation the following characteristics: The idea of action, coming from the mission assigned to us or from the situation known to us; in this case an idea of attack;   ## p. 226 (#236) ############################################  226 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR The idea of attack being adopted, its direction must be sought, it must be prepared, carried out, protected. The direction depends, as we have seen, on the most favorable ground, the one that offers best cover and from which we can use our rifles and guns together and against the same objective. As to the three conditions of preparation, execution and protection, we have seen what they implied. In any case, there is but one offensive to be undertaken at a given time, with but one objective. All the forces employed for that operation, infantry, artillery, cavalry, engineers, are detached only to the extent absolutely necessary for p
