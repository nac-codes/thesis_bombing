The half-company Chasseurs, at that moment in the middle of the village, immediately moves to the southern edge.   ## p. 232 (#242) ############################################  232 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR The Kurowski Half-battalion has not finished its move- ment when the charge begins. It hastens to the crest, for it cannot see clearly, and it forms there a hollow square, its front and left flank firing on the mass of Austrian Cuirassiers who seek to rally at the foot of the slope. The latter are thrown into confusion, and soon pushed back. They again try to rally under cover of the hay- lofts, but come under fire of the half-company of Prus- sian Chasseurs, and finally retire.
