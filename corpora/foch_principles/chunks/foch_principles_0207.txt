12.30, the space between the Neustadt road, Wäld- chen and Wenzelsberg was abandoned by the Austrian in- fantry, and the attack of the left flank, furnished by the Jonack and Rosenzweig Brigades, and supported by part of the Hertweck Brigade, had failed.

No attempt had been made against either flank of the Prussian advance guard. The critical period was over for its army corps. The battalions of the main body were beginning to deploy on the plateau.

The most unfortunate thing pos- sible would be to make it worse. All forces are already unable to strike simultaneously, the worst thing would be to thrust them drop by drop into the action. More- over, General Raming cannot ignore what has just oc- curred. The Hertweck Brigade has suffer
