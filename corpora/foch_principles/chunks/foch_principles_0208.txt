nable to strike simultaneously, the worst thing would be to thrust them drop by drop into the action. More- over, General Raming cannot ignore what has just oc- curred. The Hertweck Brigade has suffered heavy casualties, and is in full retreat; The enemy has shown himself on a front of 3,000 meters; The Austrian artillery has displayed its inferiority; The Prussian cavalry has shown several squadrons. How then can a new action be contemplated with one brigade against an enemy whose morale has improved? Only with all his forces together, working in unison, could Raming have again undertaken action. To utilize the remnants of the Hertweck Brigade, to push forward together the Jonack and Rosenzweig Brigades, to form a reserve with the Waldstätten Brigade hastily summoned by the Skalitz road: these were in a general way the measures to be taken. But how can the troops now be thrust into the attack? We have seen the results of a battle conducted in a purely frontal manner, with no idea of combination.

All progress by the Austrians had been stopped in front of the second position through the combined work of the enemy infantry and cavalry. No attempt had been made against either flank of the Prussian advance guard. The critical period was over for its army corps. The battalions of the main body were beginning to deplo
