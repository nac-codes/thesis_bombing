as shown several squadrons. How then can a new action be contemplated with one brigade against an enemy whose morale has improved? Only with all his forces together, working in unison, could Raming have again undertaken action. To utilize the remnants of the Hertweck Brigade, to push forward together the Jonack and Rosenzweig Brigades, to form a reserve with the Waldst채tten Brigade hastily summoned by the Skalitz road: these were in a general way the measures to be taken. But how can the troops now be thrust into the attack? We have seen the results of a battle conducted in a purely frontal manner, with no idea of combination. It is evidently a flanking maneuver that should be combined with a frontal attack. On which flank should he act? On the most favorable one, the one which first enables the attack to develop to the best advantage, and which afterwards promises the most decisive results. These two conditions were found in the Wysokow-   ## p. 238 (#248) ############################################  238 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR Altstadt direction. An examination of the map, the sight of the ground, made that clear. In the region north of W채ldchen was ground prac- ticable for all arms. No other obstacle than Wysokow. This locality and the region further north could be reached under cover. As a final result: the attack north of Wysokow, on the Wysokow-Altstadt space, took the enemy in the rear, defeated all his attempts against the plateau of Wenzels- berg, and closed finally the opening of Nachod. In accordance with these ideas, the plan should have been to: Intrust to the Hertweck Brigade the occupation of Wenzelsberg and of the regions further south; Thrust the Jonack and Rosenzweig Brigades into the interval W채ldchen-Wysokow and north of Wysokow; Prepare that attack with all available artillery; Protect it on the north with a large body of cavalry; Bring the Waldst채tten Brigade in reserve to Kleny. In any case, the attack should avoid the region of Wenzelsberg, a
