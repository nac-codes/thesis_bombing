ith all available artillery; Protect it on the north with a large body of cavalry; Bring the Waldstätten Brigade in reserve to Kleny. In any case, the attack should avoid the region of Wenzelsberg, a wooded, uneven region which compelled it to break up into small detachments, to waste itself in powerless efforts, impossible to coördinate, in which no advantage could be taken of numerical superiority. To justify his attack by the plateau of Wenzelsberg, General Raming has claimed that he did not know whether the Prussian attack was taking for its objective the road of Neustadt, that of Skalitz or that of Wenzels- berg. But no maneuver should consist in merely respond- ing to the attempts of the enemy.

At the same time, the Jonack Brigade becomes engaged without reconnoitering the position of the enemy and his situation. It offers a thin extended line followed by bat- talions in close order, unable to maneuver; it advances over the ground by which flee some of the men of the Hertweck Brigade. It is not protected on its right flank. It has left its cavalry behind, and its artillery supports it only from afar. The results will soon be seen. The ex- tremities of the line are more or less dragged into the flight. To prevent a counter-attack, four battalions or so go off at an angle. Numerical advantage has dis- appeared. Not a shot has been fired, yet out of 7 bat- talions the attack has only 3 left. We must also note the coöperation of the Kellner Bat- talion and 25th Chasseurs in the attack of Wäldchen, which by abandoning Wenzelsberg, the only strong point available, exposed it to be seized by the enemy if his temporary
