For the Austrian cavalry, as for the Austrian infantry, it is in this case to reach the opening of Nachod; it did not do so. For the Prussian cavalry, as for its infantry, the aim was to cover the opening; it succeeded in doing so.

General Kirchbach, commanding the 10th Division, has preceded the column on to the field of action; he has watched the loss of Wäldchen and the cavalry engage- ment. As soon as his troops arrive, he orders the General in command of the 19th Brigade to recapture and occupy Wäldchen, while he proceeds himself towards Wysokow, which the commander of the army corps has ordered oc- cupied. A half-battalion of the F of the 46th therefore advances towards Wäldchen at the moment when the 8th Dragoons charges and when the Bojan Half-battalion resumes th
