A half-battalion of the F of the 46th therefore advances towards Wäldchen at the moment when the 8th Dragoons charges and when the Bojan Half-battalion resumes the attack. It is followed by the 2nd of the 46th which, with the Bojan Half-battalion, enters the Wäldchen, whence they both soon eject the Austrians. Under the protection of these troops advances, behind Wäldchen, what is left of the 46th, while the Division Commander sends the remainder of the 19th Brigade, nearly the whole of the 6th Regiment, towards Wysokow.   ## p. 242 (#252) ############################################  242 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR His original idea was to move there the 20th Brigade.
