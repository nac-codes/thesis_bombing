Here ceases the success of the Prussian artillery, ex- cept for the fact that the first three batteries ended later by establishing themselves between Wysokow and W채ldchen, after the Austrian artillery had been moved elsewhere.   ## p. 244 (#254) ############################################  244 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR ENVELOPMENT OF THE PRUSSIAN RIGHT BY THE WALD- STATTEN BRIGADE.

The village of Wysokow is built over a stretch of 2,000 meters, along the road which runs from Branka towards Skalitz. It extends to a fairly steep ravine, the southern slope dominating the northern. Both ends of the village contain more houses than the middle. The ground south of Wysokow is quite different from the ground on the north. Here the plateau of Wysokow dominates the whole country, commands the flank of the Wenzelsberg Plateau, and holds under its fire Nachod and Altstadt. It is easy to defend facing east.
