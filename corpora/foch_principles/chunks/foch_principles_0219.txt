One battalion, however (1st of 52nd), is employed to reinforce the occupation of Wysokow. There remain, for counter-attacking, two battalions protected by the Wnück Brigade. The ground of the plateau is little suited to infantry movements, and still less to cavalry. The Divisional Adjutant, sent to reconnoiter the ground and guide the cavalry, has advised General Wnück that it seems easy to surprise the enemy battery located on the height north of Wysokow. To carry out this idea, the 3rd and 4th Squadrons of the 1st Uhlans are detached, and seek to reach the enemy's left flank by filing behind a fold in the ground. Later, noticing that the regiment of Austrian Cuirassiers is retiring and leav- ing only two troops in support of the battery, and that the Austrian artillerymen seem ready to withdraw, they start to attack, charging the two troops left by the Cuiras- siers. The Austrian Cuirassiers are put to flight, and the Uhlans seize 3 guns and 6 gun-carriages. While this maneuver is being prepared, occurs the counter-attack from the two battalions, on two lines: F of the 47th in the front line, 2nd of the 52nd in the sec- ond line. They march to the west, utilizing the northern fringe of the village, and strike at the left flank of the attack- ing Austrian columns. But, as the counter-attack is im- mediately threatened and taken in flank by the Austrian cavalry and artillery from the plateau of Wysokow, the two half-battalions on the right, while continuing to ad- vance, face right with their flanking companies.
