victim of surprise. An instance is given by the two half-battalions of the 47th and 52nd obliged to face both the artillery and cavalry of the Austrians. (5) The distribution of troops employed in the de- fense of a locality comprises, in accordance with what I have said: a garrison, troops of occupation in as small numbers as possible; a reserve destined to counter-attack, as strong as possible and itself supplying, at the time of action, protective troops to guard it against surprises. The troops of occupation may be estimated on the fol- lowing basis: at the moment when the enemy reaches the fringe of the village, to present one rifle per meter is suf- ficient resistance. Generally he can only reach one side or one part of that fringe. It is from an estimate of that portion of the fringe and the organization of a central keep" that one must decide the number of men to be employed on the direct defense of the locality. In Wyso- kow, three battalions were employed. These estimates, however, must never entail the em- ployment in occupying the strong point of all the troops on hand. Some portion must always be kept for the counter-attack.

It costs them less to advance in the attack, or to hold their ground in the defense. Hence two leading principles of modern tactics: an attack undertaken must be carried through, and the defense must be kept up with the utmost energy; there lies true economy. These principles must inspire the execution, and at the same time they bring to   ## p. 252 (#262) ############################################  252 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR the command a greater necessity of knowing, of fore- seeing and of solving the difficulties of an attack; of undertaking none that cannot be carried through to the end, that cannot for that pur
