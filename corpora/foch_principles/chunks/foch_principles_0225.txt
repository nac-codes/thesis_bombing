(#264) ############################################  254 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR The 2nd Army, on the same morning, was continuing its advance towards the Moselle, with: The 3rd Corps to reach the Seille at Cheminot; The 12th Corps to reach it at Nomeny; The 9th Corps remaining at Peltre; The 10th Corps coming to Pont-à-Mousson, whence it was to send detachments towards the north, into the Moselle valley and on the plateau to the west. The Guard was assembling at Dieulouard, and the 4th Corps marching towards the Moselle at Custines, its ad- vance guard on Marbache. On receipt of the news of the battle of Borny, fought on the evening of the 14th, these dispositions were slightly changed about 7 A.M. The 3rd Army Corps was to halt at once, the 12th was to occupy positions between Solgne and Delme, both corps to be prepared to support the 9th Army Corps left at Peltre, in case the French should assume the offensive on the right bank of the Moselle. Then the advance was resumed, after the receipt of a telegram, sent by General Von Moltke from the Flainville height at II A.M., reading: "The French have been thrown back completely on Metz, and it is probable that by now they are already in full retreat on Verdun. The three corps on the right (3rd, 9th and 12th) are now at the entire disposal of the Commander-in-Chief. The 12th is already on its way to "" Nomeny.' Finally, in the evening, the 2nd Army was disposed as follows: 3rd Army Corps 5th Division, Novéant; advance guard, Gorze. 6th Division, Champey.   ## p. 255 (#265) ############################################  STRATEGIC SURPRISE 255 10th Army Corps Pont-à-Mousson, 19th Division at Thiaucourt. 12th 9th Guard "6 "" 66 66 66 4th Army Corps Custines, advance guard at Mar- bache.
