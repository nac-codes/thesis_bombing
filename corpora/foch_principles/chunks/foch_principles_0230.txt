We shall see later the results obtained from these de- cisions. But, in order to discuss them intelligently we must also examine the basis on which they rest, and the operations they will necessitate. As to General Von Moltke's first message at II A.M.   ## p. 260 (#270) ############################################  260 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR of the 15th that "The French have been thrown back completely on Metz, ." it is true that at II A.M. on the 15th French columns have been seen retreating along the whole front towards Metz. But to say that the French have been thrown back completely is to exagger- ate the facts accomplished, and therefore what effect they may have. • • Into the battle of the 14th, the Germans have only engaged the approximate equivalent of 3 divisions.

Under these circumstances, and with such poor tactical results, one could not describe the French as completely thrown back on Metz, nor consider their main body de- feated. If they retired, therefore, it is because they were ordered to do so, and not because they had been com- pelled.
