ready in full retreat on Verdun. 99 • That probability, foreseen at General Headquarters and resulting only in the return to the army commander of the three corps previously immobilized, would seem un- likely to have unfortunate results. But the possibility foreseen, the probability communi- cated to the Pont-à-Mousson Headquarters, becomes   ## p. 261 (#271) ############################################  STRATEGIC SURPRISE 261 there a certainty under the influence particularly of re- ports from the 3rd Corps, as we have seen. The com- mander of the 2nd Army then decides that the French Army is "hastily retreating towards the Meuse." Those reports of the 3rd Corps only announced, how- ever, some French movements from Metz to Longeville. That was still far from the Meuse. As to the 5th Cavalry Division, it could have supplied highly important information if it had been consulted; it would certainly have said that the roads of Mars-la-Tour and of Conflans were free of the French, except near Vionville, where cavalry bivouacs were to be seen. The conclusion of Prince Frederick-Charles seems, therefore, a preconceived idea; the Prince so readily joins into the hypothesis of General Von Moltke that for him it requires no proof. To make assurance doubly sure, however, he transmits this view at II o'clock to General Headquarters. The Chief of Staff, a cautious and reserved man when he has no certain information, does not answer all day. He knows the value of that hypothesis: "It is probable that the French are already in full retreat on Verdun." One can substitute for it another one, just as sound, that of Prince Frederick-Charles to the effect that "the French army is hastily retreating towards the Meuse." He there- fore allows the commander of the 2nd Army to act in accordance with his opinion and march to the Meuse, intervening only at 6.30 to say: "The advantage obtained on the 14th by the 1st Army was achieved under circumstances which preclude all idea of pursuing it.
