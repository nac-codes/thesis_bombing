e with his opinion and march to the Meuse, intervening only at 6.30 to say: "The advantage obtained on the 14th by the 1st Army was achieved under circumstances which preclude all idea of pursuing it.

The Commander-in-Chief of the 2nd Army is instructed to carry out the operation in accordance with his own inspiration, and with the help of all the means at his disposal." We note two things in that order: (1) It is a victory which is described as needing to be taken advantage of, whereas one knew, or should have known, that it was nothing of the kind. (2) The fruit of that victory is to be gathered by a vigorous offensive against the Metz-Verdun roads. Such an objective is already much more reasonable than the Meuse, because, closer to the source of the truth, Von Moltke is less inclined to exaggerate. Such an objective can be attained, he believes, by the 2nd Army. He well knows that, owing to its distribution, it cannot reach there as a whole, that it cannot, on the 16th, employ there all its forces; it needs twenty-four hours at least to concentrate without advancing, and if it crosses the Moselle more than forty-eight hours will be required to bring up the most distant corps (on the 18th, one of them, the 4th, will still be lacking). Thus its dis- persion will bring against 3 French armies, whose morale has been improved by the resistance of the 14th, 1 Ger- man army only, the 2nd, much reduced because of its dispersion. Von Moltke realizes the insufficiency of his combina- tion, and so ends his order by leaving to the commander of the 2nd Army the decision as to how the operation is to be carried out, "in accordance with his own inspira- tion." He is reduced to inspirations. It cannot be otherwise,   ## p. 263 (#273) ##########################################
