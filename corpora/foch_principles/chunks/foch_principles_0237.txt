, the meaning of the battle of the 14th, had evidently assumed two different forms in accordance with the temperament of each of these two men. Von Moltke is a Chief of Staff relying constantly on his intelligence, acting by reason, a thinker more than an executive. He determines the unknown by a hypothesis, logical enough but sprung merely from his imagination, which even he does not consider above doubt; he thus reaches a solution which he does not compel. Examining the various combinations which the enemy might adopt, he has chosen the most likely one, and it becomes the idea from which will spring his plan of maneuver. It is a probable one, but it is not going to be the true one. His lack of assurance in the merit of his reasoning will keep him from imposing it; he will advise, but not order, re- maining a Chief of Staff and not a Commander of Armies. Hence the big results of the war were only in part due to him. Such he will appear at Sedan, where he again fails to command on August 30th, where the envelopment will result from an agreement of the two armies and not from a higher decision. Such he will be seen also during the operations on the Loire. Frederick-Charles, on the other hand, is essentially a man of action; the mere thought of a possible great re- sult intoxicates him to the point of depriving him of the power to appreciate its starting point or to realize fully its extent and the dangers it entails.

He seeks, as we have seen, no information on the 16th; but, worse still, he dictates on that day at noon an order covering the arrival on the 17th of the whole 2nd Army on the Meuse. He still relies on the so-called victory of the 14th in this order which the records of the General Staff have carefully preserved although no part of it has been carri
