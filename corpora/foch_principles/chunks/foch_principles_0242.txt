From that investigation made by the 5th Cavalry Divi- sion, soon continued by the 6th Division arriving on the heels of the 3rd Corps, some knowledge of the situation will at last be obtained. We know what they discover: The 3rd Corps has put its foot on the ant-hill. The French army, instead of being in full retreat towards the Meuse, finishes the evacuation of Metz; instead of being beaten, it is of excellent morale.

The movement has been deliberately undertaken into the unknown as the result of a hypothesis (Von Moltke), of a conviction without reason or verification (Frederick- Charles). Let us therefore conclude that: (1) In strategy as in everything else, a
