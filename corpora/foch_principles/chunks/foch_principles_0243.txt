It has moved towards Leoben, thence towards Vienna, to carry out at Br√ºck on May 26th its junction with the Army of Germany, while Archduke Jean retires from Gratz into Hungary, for the purpose of either maneuver- ing on Raab or operating from there against the still dispersed forces of the Army of Italy. Macdonald arrives, via Laybach, in Gratz on the 30th. He remains there, awaiting orders from Prince Eugene and news of Marmont, who is coming independently from Istria and Carniola. (See Map No. 7.)
