Napoleon writes him: "Ebersdorf, June 5th, noon. "My son, I receive your letter of the 4th, 9 P.M. I approve the move you have made on Körmend. But the cavalry should not have gone there without the infantry. I fear that this battalion so far from the forces may be compromised. As it appears from General Macdonald's letter that the enemy is still opposite Wildon, and that the Gyulai Corps is towards Radkersburg, a strong cavalry detachment on Körmend, pushed in the rear of the enemy, might protect our communications, especially if it be sup- ported by a strong detachment from General Macdonald to the same point. Write to him in that sense. General Macdonald must not send a reconnaissance, but a strong advance guard to Fürstenfeld, and thence to Kör- mend." Napoleon does not therefore believe that the cavalry alone can fulfill the first part of the task; he asks that the cavalry be supported at Körmend by a strong advance guard coming from Fürstenfeld. It is from a body so strongly organized, and not from a number of squadrons, that he expects a real reconnaissance. But meanwhile, at Oedenburg Prince Eugene has con- ceived the idea of moving on Raab to cut off Archduke Jean from the Danube road, by which he might join Arch- duke Charles. That is a maneuver resting on a precon-   ## p. 278 (#288) ############################################  278 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR ceived idea; it may fail, or it may at least be parried.
