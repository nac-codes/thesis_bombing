s Saint-Michel for example, one cuts off an enemy column; but in Hungary, on the other hand, the enemy, as soon as he loses the race at one point, will move to another. Let us suppose that the enemy is moving on Raab, and that you reach this town ahead of him: the enemy learning of it on his way, will change his direction and move on Pesth; . . . then your movement on Raab would take you further from him, and might even give him the idea (for the enemy is not like us; being at home, he is well informed) of attacking and defeating Mac- donald. I think, therefore, that the movement first on Güns, later on Stein-am-Anger, later on Körmend, or from Güns on Sarvar, is the wisest movement, if however you have no other information than I now have here. This evening, you can march on Güns with the brigade of Colbert, the seven regiments of the Grouchy Division and much artillery (you must place your light artillery, at least twelve guns, with your cavalry), and the Seras and Durutte Divisions.

According to the information you receive, you can continue to-morrow the movement of your two columns on Sarvar or on Körmend. General Montbrun must have been last evening, 5th, at Gols, and as he is to connect with General Lauriston, you will not fail to have news." From that letter we note that in a country of easy com- munications like Hungary (and the same would be true of a great part of Europe), the enemy keeps his freedom   ## p. 280 (#290) ############################################  280 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR of movement so long as we have not immobilized him. The maneuver on Raab may therefore: (1) Either fail if he does not come there; (2) Or be parried: losing the race to that point, he moves to another; (3) Or even cause a crisis: incite the enemy to attack and defeat Macdonald. The wisest maneuver is to ma
