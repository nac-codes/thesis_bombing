For the moment, let us remember Napoleon explain- ing to Prince Eugene strategic safety, along the following lines: “... You knew nothing of the enemy's intentions, you were quite right in sending towards Körmend all your cavalry, in seeking information.

The idea of strategic safety is quite lacking, on the other hand, in the German armies
