according to the moment and the operation undertaken, but always based on a combination of time, space and force. The idea of strategic safety is quite lacking, on the other hand, in the German armies of 1870, and that fault has often placed them in very critical situations. It took all our lack of initiative to allow them to extricate them- selves sometimes without disaster. But strategic safety was known and applied by the Germans of 1813 and 1814. Instructed by the painful lessons from the Emperor, they have realized its impor- tance. They even jeer at such French generals as ig- nored its necessity. Thus, Clausewitz wrote: "Has one not seen, in spite of the methods of Emperor Napoleon, some French corps of 60,000 to 70,000 men advancing under Marshal Macdonald in Silesia and under Marshals Oudinot and Ney in the Marche, without any question of an advance guard! "" He refers by these words to our defeats of Katzbach, Donnewitz and Gross-Beeren.   ## p. 284 (#294) ############################################  284 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR EXAMPLE OF DISPOSITION OF STRATEGIC SAFETY (See Map No. 8) The beginnings of the campaign of 1815 show us clearly how, in the Army of the Lower Rhine, one knew how to organize and employ advance guard troops. When the enemy assumes the offensive, it is the concen- tration of forces which must first of all be carried out. The 1st Prussian Corps shows us the tactics to be em- ployed for that purpose by the general advance guard. During the first half of June, 1815, the army was dis- tributed as follows: 1st Corps Gen. Ziethen H. Q.: Charleroi 2nd Corps Gen. Pirch H. Q.: Namur 3rd Corps Thielmann H.
