In the Prussian general's mind, the idea of concentra- tion, and the point where it must be carried out are there- fore clearly established. There remains to be considered the possibility of carrying it out at a suitable time. "The point of Charleroi is the nearest to the place of concentration; it is only three-and-a-half miles distant. If the news of the enemy's arrival comes from Charleroi to Namur, and thence the order of concentration to Liège which is the furthest place occupied, one must figure about sixteen hours before it reaches there, and eight hours more to notify and call out the troops; a total of twenty- four hours before the 4th Corps can start on its march. "From Liège to Sombreffe there are two days' good marching; it will be a matter of three days, therefore, before the 4th Corps arrives at Sombreffe. The 3rd Corps at Cinay could arrive in thirty-six hours, the 2nd Corps at Namur in twelve hours.
