As soon, however, as any movement was noticed on the French side, on the 14th, it received the order to march towards Hanut, only 5 miles from the point of concen- tration, where it would be nearer to the 3rd Corps at Cinay. "Blücher believed he could assemble his army within thirty-six hours near Sombreffe. Although the chances were a hundred to one that the enemy's advance would be learnt more than thirty-six hours before his arrival in the neighborhood of Sombreffe, it was still very dangerous to remain so dispersed, with an advance guard so close at hand (the one at Charleroi). It would not have been done but for the constant difficulties of approvisioning due to local conditions; concentration would have been carried out first."
