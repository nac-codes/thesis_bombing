carrying-out of the order can be put off until the next day, 16th. He moreover reported accordingly. But his re- port did not find Blücher at Namur, just as the orders sent on the 15th by Blücher had not found Bülow at Hanut, although he had been ordered to be there on the evening of the 15th. These orders instructed him to continue, on the 16th, the advance with his army corps from Hanut on Sombreffe. In reality, if he had carried out the orders received, the 4th Corps could reach Hanut in the night of the 15th-16th; from there to Sombreffe the distance is 38 kilometers; he could, on the 16th, reach it with his advance guard toward noon, and with the re- mainder of his troops in the evening.

With a better exchange of communications, the con- centration of the four Prussian Army Corps would have been carried out in time, even with the dispersion neces- sitated by the special problems of provisioning the troops. In any case, it brought to the battlefield, on the 16th, three corps out of four, that is forces greater than those of the Emperor. The result was due to the use of an advance guard, the 1st Army Corps, capable of securing the time and space needed for the operation planned: concen- tration.   ## p. 291 (#303) ############################################  STRATEGIC SAFETY 291 It is through fighting a retreating engagement that this army corps succeeded, moreover, in lasting twenty-four hours without being destroyed by far superior enemy forces. Retreating engagement, two words which seem to con- tradict one another; from which we find that the more one must retreat, the less engagement there is; and the less one retreat
