uperior enemy forces. Retreating engagement, two words which seem to con- tradict one another; from which we find that the more one must retreat, the less engagement there is; and the less one retreats, the greater the engagements. The army corps could only retreat a short distance, 15 kilometers; it would have to fight several times, and we shall see how it succeeded. The order which it had received from Blücher, dated Namur the 14th, II P.M., ordered it to retire on Fleurus, in case it should have to deal with superior forces; how- ever, it must not lose sight of the enemy, but energetically dispute the ground.
