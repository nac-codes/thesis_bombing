Two battalions, five squad- rons and three guns begin the action against this locality, occupied as we have seen by a German battalion. After about an hour's fight, the Westphalians, who have de- layed at Thuin, are enveloped there. They seek to open up a way at the bayonet by the plateau of Montigny, and two squadrons of Prussian Dragoons try to support them.

Between 6 and 7 A.M., Ziethen has received reports which show the whole French army to be in movement. Especially is his 2nd Brigade threatened. It is ordered to avoid any important engagement, and with that object to establish a line of resistance on the Sambre, the cross- ings of which it must hold at Charleroi, Châtelet and Marchiennes, retiring eventually on Gilly. The outpost line of the 1st Brigade has not
