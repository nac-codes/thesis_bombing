o establish a line of resistance on the Sambre, the cross- ings of which it must hold at Charleroi, Châtelet and Marchiennes, retiring eventually on Gilly. The outpost line of the 1st Brigade has not been at- tacked, except at Thuin where it had one battalion; in spite of that fact, the Brigade is ordered to retire. It is to move on Gosselies, keeping in line with the 2nd to guard against envelopment. The 3rd and 4th Brigades, the reserve cavalry and the army corps' artillery will assemble and occupy positions at Fleurus. We shall see later what use is made of them. They form a reserve which will be drawn upon to assist the troops engaged against the enemy. These troops will successively and along the whole front organize resistance to compel the enemy to make dispositions for attack. When the attack thus prepared occurs, they will without much fighting abandon the ground, and take up further the same dispositions along a new line of resistance previously held by the echelons in the rear, towards Gosselies for the 1st Brigade, and towards Gilly for the 2nd. · 10 ין I I 1 3 • ¦ ·   ## p. 296 (#306) ############################################  296 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR The chief danger lies in being cut off from the line of retreat by enveloping movements of the enemy. The remedy is found in supports (29th Infantry, 6th Uhlans) placed in the rear to receive the retreating force (1st Brigade). The facts show the use made of such supports. They stop the Clary cavalry until the 1st Brigade has extricated itself from its dangerous position. That service being rendered, the supports immediately withdraw to occupy the important points on the line of retreat (Ransart and Ransart Wood). The retreating force should have fol- lowed that movement without any delay. It cannot think of stopping, by battle, forces far superior to its own (Clary cavalry reinforced by the 2nd French Corps). That is not the mission with which it is intrusted; on the other hand, it risks being destroy
