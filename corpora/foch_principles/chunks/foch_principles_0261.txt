of stopping, by battle, forces far superior to its own (Clary cavalry reinforced by the 2nd French Corps). That is not the mission with which it is intrusted; on the other hand, it risks being destroyed, or being cut off from its line of retreat by these superior forces. That is what happens. Steinmetz, arrived at Gosselies with his 1st Brigade, discards the assistance (29th Infantry) held out to him, which has saved him once before. Instead of continuing his retreat on Ransart, which is held by the 29th, he stands still at Gosselies and prepares for a battle in which he is defeated. He is compelled to resume his retreat on Heppignies, but he is now cut off from the army corps by the French Division of Girard which has seized Ransart; he will have trouble in joining his corps. Events of a similar nature were occurring at the same time on the road of Fleurus and Sombreffe through Gilly. It is in Gilly that General Pirch had received instruc- tions to assemble his brigade, to carry out a second recon-   ## p. 297 (#307) ############################################  STRATEGIC SAFETY 297 naissance, the one on the line of the Sambre having been broken. We have already seen how he had gradually abandoned the positions of Marchiennes and Charleroi, decreasing his holdings on the Sambre as the enemy columns came up. In the same order of ideas, he withdrew from Le Ch√¢telet the 28th Infantry which occupied it first, and substituted for it the 1st Western Prussia Dragoons. Thus he had assembled at Gilly the greater part of his brigade at the time that the French entered Charleroi. There only remained to withdraw the detachments of Marchiennes and of Charleroi. Pirch placed his brigade behind Gilly, its front protected by the muddy stream of Grand-Rieux. Four battalions and the brigade's battery are on the slope of the stream's left bank, namely: The 2nd of the 28th to the north of the road, covered by the Abbaye de Soleilmont; The F of the 1st to the south of the road, against
