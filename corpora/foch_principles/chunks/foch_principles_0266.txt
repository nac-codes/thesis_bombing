nformed the Em- peror from Fleurus that strong columns, apparently com- ing from Namur, were moving towards Brye and Saint- Amand, behind Fleurus. They consisted of the 2nd and 3rd Corps rejoining the 1st. In spite of the absence of the 4th Corps, the Prussians would be able to dispose that day of nearly 90,000 men, considerably more than the Emperor had. The Corps of Ziethen had suffered considerable losses, but obtained the very important result of retarding the battle till the 16th, thereby permitting concentration. As Clausewitz says: "One sees thereby what caution   ## p. 302 (#312) ############################################  302 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR and what slowness are inevitably imposed by circum- stances of but a slightly complicated nature even on the most resolute of Generals, Napoleon." Among the complications of which Ziethen took ad- vantage, we must include the double retreat on the Gilly and Gosselies roads, which prevents Ney's going to Quatre-Bras, making Napoleon's intervention there neces- sary and, in that way also, delaying action on the Namur road. Observe, moreover, that this double retreat does not prevent the 1st Prussian Army Corps from grouping its four divisions the next day. That example shows how advance guards fight when retiring, inspired by the double duty of observing the enemy and delaying his approach. They delay the enemy by compelling him to assume battle formations, to assemble and deploy in order to use his superiority for an enveloping movement. The nature of the ground and the distance from the body protected determine of course the length of the re- sistance; and from the resistance offered will depend the losses sustained. For that reason, rear guard actions are to be avoided when the necessary time can be obtained in another way. Normally and logically, we must only seek therefore to hold the enemy and to delay him by three methods: (1) By enforcing prudence from him, and therefore slowness of advance; (2) By prolong
