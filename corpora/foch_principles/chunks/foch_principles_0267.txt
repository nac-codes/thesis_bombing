ther way. Normally and logically, we must only seek therefore to hold the enemy and to delay him by three methods: (1) By enforcing prudence from him, and therefore slowness of advance; (2) By prolonging as long as caution permits, but never later, local resistance; (3) By retreating as slowly as possible.   ## p. 303 (#313) ############################################  STRATEGIC SAFETY 303 That retreat, as slow and deliberate as possible, must allow the troops to reorganize and take up new positions along the road. It is necessary, therefore, that the local resistance and the movement of retreat prolong one an- other, and that the struggle only cease at a given point when it can be repeated, with equal method, at a number of other points. An advance guard can delay the enemy in proportion to its own strength; the opponent, to enforce its retreat, will need more time to develop the necessary means of do- ing so. "It is less by their actual actions than by the mere fact of their presence, less by fighting than by constantly threatening to fight, that advance guards fulfill their mis- sion. They do not prevent the enemy's action, but, like a pendulum, they moderate and govern its movements, and thus permit of ascertaining its mechanism and ex- tent" (Clausewitz). We have seen the difficulties of a rear guard action: (1) Danger of being turned: once turned, the protec- tive troops no longer guard the main body; they may, moreover, be cut off; (2) Danger of letting the enemy come to close quar- ters, which makes it very difficult to disengage all the troops; (3) Necessity of battle by fire and at long range, to act on the enemy from afar. The employment of troops that fulfill these various conditions generally necessitates the occupation of each successive position by a large proportion of artillery, usu- ally all that is available.
