A good deal of cavalry is also needed to detect and parry enveloping movements. It generally constitutes the reserve at every position occupied. In this manner, protective troops consisting of 6 bat- talions, 6 batteries and 6 squadrons will generally employ on the first position their 6 batteries, 2 to 3 battalions and their 6 squadrons, while the other battalions organize the second line of resistance, where the artillery will join them at the trot when it abandons the first line. The cavalry finally protects the retreat of the last infantry units from the first position, and afterwards resumes its function of general reserve. To protective troops maneuvering in retreat to guard the main body, just as to protective troops advancing to seek and hold the enemy, much cavalry is therefore neces- sary, supported by artillery and infantry. The proportion of the various arms to be used varies, however, with the distance from the main body. An ad- vance guard at a short distance will increase its means of resistance (infantry and artillery), and decrease its cavalry; because information at close range is of little value, and because the space available allows little maneu- vering in retreat, compelling battle therefore. It is what happens with the 1st Prussian Corps in 1815. In either case, if the maneuver be ready when the enemy appears, the battle begins, and the protective troops are reinforced as much as possible by troops capable of prolonged action: masses of artillery.
