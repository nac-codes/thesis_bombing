STRATEGIC PROTECTION APPLIED TO THE SITUATION OF AUGUST 15, 1870 The 2nd German Army on August 15th, 1870, needed, as we have seen, forty-eight hours to concentrate when advancing, moving to the left bank of the Moselle. How could it, by applying sound theories, have avoided the crisis which occurred? On the morning of August 14th, 1870, the French army in its retreat has arrived by Metz: the day's battle will change nothing in that situation; it may only delay the retreat. On the other hand, the main body of the French army has not been beaten, and one must therefore beware of it. In any case, beginning on this 14th day, a direct pur- suit of the French becomes impossible, owing to the pro- tection given to them by the position of Metz. To attack again, one must act on the left bank of the Moselle, crossing first of all that river in presence of an enemy who can, during several days more, attack along either bank. The crossing itself is dangerous enough to make it nec- essary that, putting aside all thought of future action towards the Meuse, or towards the roads, or towards Metz, one should devote to it all possible protection.

(2) Move the troops on the 14th and 15th towards these crossings, protected by an advance guard on the river's right, in contact with the enemy; combine the ad- vance and
