(2) Move the troops on the 14th and 15th towards these crossings, protected by an advance guard on the river's right, in contact with the enemy; combine the ad- vance and dispersion of the forces with the resistance of the advance guard, so that, if the enemy appeared from Metz on either the 14th or 15th, the whole army might accept battle on the right bank within twenty-four hours. (3) The enemy having failed to attack, thrust by sur- prise, during the morning of the 16th, the army on the left bank of the Moselle, under protection of a new advance guard on that same left bank insuring time and space for the operation, for assembling the troops and for engaging them, even if the French attacked on that 16th of August. In accordance with that idea, three roads could be used, and allotted as follows to the 3rd Army: Cheminot, Pont-à-Mousson 3rd and 9th Corps; Nomeny, south of Pont-à- Mousson, Blénod bridge to build) Lixières, Dieulouard (1 10th, 12th and 2nd Corps; } Guard and 4th Corps.

All the forces were thus on the right bank of the Moselle, in a position that allowed them to concentrate there for battle within twenty-four hours. Any attack coming from the French would first have struck the 1st Army; the latter would have been held or would have maneuvered in retreat, according to the degree of con- centration of the 2nd Army. Battle was made possible with both armies. On t
