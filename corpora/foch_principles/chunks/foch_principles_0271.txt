On the 15th, the 1st Army, still acting as advance guard, would have reached the neighborhood of Fleury, Chesny and Courcelles. The units of the 2nd Army would have closed up their intervals. During the evening of the same day, the first line troops, which had marched but a short distance, resumed the movement about II P.M. to cross the Moselle, an operation accomplished by 6 A.M. of the 16th. The second line units, beginning their march at 5 A.M. on the 16th, towards the Moselle, would also have crossed the river by noon.

Moreover, the necessity of an advance guard on the right bank gradually ceased as the 2nd Army carried out its crossing. On the very evening of the 15th, as a mat- ter of fact, the advance guard (1st Army) at Fleury, Chesny and Courcelles was no longer needed. That army, which had marched little during the 14th and 15th, might have resumed its movement on the evening of the 15th towards the Moselle, beginning with its second line troops. It would have crossed the river below Pont-à- Mousson, near Pagny, over bridges specially
