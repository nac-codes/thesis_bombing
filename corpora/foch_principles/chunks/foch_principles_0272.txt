ve resumed its movement on the evening of the 15th towards the Moselle, beginning with its second line troops. It would have crossed the river below Pont-à- Mousson, near Pagny, over bridges specially built for it, protection being supplied by the 10th Corps at Chambley. On the morning of the 16th, it could have two corps on the left bank, the third being kept on the right bank or drawn back later without difficulty. The 10th Corps, reaching Chambley on the evening of the 15th, would naturally have sent troops (impor- tant pickets of infantry, artillery and cavalry) to occupy all the dangerous roads at Gorze, at Vionville, at Mars- la-Tour. The main body of the cavalry, kept near Xon- ville and Sponville, would have provided good sources of information on the front and further north, towards the road leading from Metz. The main body of the army corps, assembled in the region of Buxières, Chambley, Hagéville, Saint-Julien, etc., would have left a rear guard and its train on the Rupt-de-Mad towards Rembercourt.

What disposi- tions he planned on the evening of the 15th to interfere with that crossing could be realized only during the morn- ing of the 16th, too late to keep the army from crossing the river and concentrating if necessary. Should the enemy have made any plans before the eve- ning of the 15th, the movement of the 10th Corps would reveal them, and allowed of overcoming them or of meet- ing them with counter-dispositions. In any case, it would have pointed out to the army the danger which threatened it, and avoided surprise.   ## p. 310 (#320) ############################################  X THE BATTLE: DECISIVE ATTACK IN N our studies of tactics, we have come across infan- try
