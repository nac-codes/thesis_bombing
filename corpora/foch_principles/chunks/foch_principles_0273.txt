But from the glimpse we have had of various forms of action, we may have failed to deduce the logical rea- sons for them all. The battle must never be considered like a drama that succeeds through careful staging, a plot cleverly carried out or the characteristics of the persons represented. Nor is it the development of a maneuver, a methodical and successive employment of the various arms, having all proportionate shares in the ultimate result. But the battle can be described in no such way. Far from being a total of distinct and partial results, it is the one result of many efforts, some of them successful, others apparent failures, aiming all at one goal: the decision which alone gives victory. Either there must be a suc- cessful ending or the whole effort has been wasted: "In war, as long as there remains something to be done, noth- ing is accomplished," said Frederick. Every move in the battle must therefore work to that end. And, inasmuch as there is direction, combination and results, it proves that logic rules the actions, with all its privileges and pitiless severity. There is a theory of the battle. We shall therefore study that conclusion, victory, in 310   ## p. 311 (#321) ############################################  THE BATTLE: DECISIVE ATTACK 311 itself, also the method of finding it, and we shall then have learnt the general principles which must inspire the decisions of the higher command, as well as the actions of every leader of whatever importance, so that the work on hand may be well carried out. Modern war, in order to reach its purpose: to impose one's will on the enemy, knows of but one means: the destruction of the opponent's organized forces. That destruction is undertaken and prepared by b
