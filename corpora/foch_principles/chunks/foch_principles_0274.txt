dern war, in order to reach its purpose: to impose one's will on the enemy, knows of but one means: the destruction of the opponent's organized forces. That destruction is undertaken and prepared by battle, defeating the enemy, disorganizing his command, his dis- cipline, tactical unity, his troops as forces. It is realized by pursuit, in which the victor, profiting by the moral superiority which victory gives him over the vanquished, cuts up finally troops that have become de- moralized, dispersed, impossible to command, troops which are no longer troops. Such was not the case with the engagements which we have studied in the preceding chapters, advance guard, rear guard or flank guard actions, at Nachod for instance. All had only a limited purpose, determined in every case, preparing for the battle but not being the battle, although they all necessitated a considerable use of force. At Nachod, the problem was for the 5th Prussian Corps to debouch from a defile and open its doors to the 6th Corps behind; the task of the Austrians was to prevent this. Some similar problem occurs in every engagement which arises from the service of protection. In every case the tactics to be practiced depend on the particular char- acteristics of the aim in view, and of the time and place available. To-day we deal with the battle, the sole argument in   ## p. 312 (#322) ############################################  312 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR war, sole object therefore of our strategic operations; and we wish to find out whether there are any tactics of conquest, and what they are. Let us establish first that, in order to duly fulfill the double purpose of being the logical aim of strategic operations and the effective means of tactics, battle can- not be merely defensive. Under that form it may, it is true, halt the enemy in his advance; it keeps him from attaining some immediate objective; but such results are purely negative. Never will it destroy the enemy or procure the conquest o
