it may, it is true, halt the enemy in his advance; it keeps him from attaining some immediate objective; but such results are purely negative. Never will it destroy the enemy or procure the conquest of the ground he occupies, which is the visible sign of victory; it is unable, therefore, to ever create victory. A battle of this kind, purely defensive, does not, even if well conducted, make a victor and a vanquished. It is merely something to be decided again later. A purely defensive battle is like a duel in which one of the men does nothing but parry. He can never defeat his opponent, but on the contrary, and in spite of the greatest possible skill, he is bound to be hit sooner or later. Hence we find that the offensive form, whether it be immediate or as succeeding the defensive, can alone give results. It must consequently be always adopted at some stage or other. Every defensive action, then, must end by an offensive blow or successful counter-attack if any result is to be gained. It is an elementary principle, if you wish, but neglect of it has been frequent. It was not understood by the French Armies of 1870, or they would not have pictured as victories days like the 14th or 16th of August, 1870, and many others, which might have be-   ## p. 313 (#323) ############################################  THE BATTLE: DECISIVE ATTACK 313 come victories but which certainly were not victories at the stage where they were left. The French had merely held their positions, which is not synonymous of victory, and even implies future defeat if no future offensive action be undertaken. "To make war was always to attack." (Frederick.) We must always seek to create events, not merely to suffer them, we must first of all organize the attack, con- sidering everything else of secondary importance and to be planned only in respect to the advantages which may result from it for the attack. The necessity of the offensive form of battle having been admitted, is victory obtained from a
