importance and to be planned only in respect to the advantages which may result from it for the attack. The necessity of the offensive form of battle having been admitted, is victory obtained from a number of con- flicts of individuals or of small units? Will it come, rather, from an intelligent combination of forces? Napo- leon tells us that "2 Mameluks could hold out against 3 Frenchmen; 100 Frenchmen did not fear 100 Mame- luks; 300 could defeat an equal number, and 1,000 would beat 1,500, so great was the influence of tactics, of dis- cipline and of proper movements.' ." Individual quality of the men is not sufficient, therefore, to create victory. Decisive as it is in single combat, it loses of its weight as numbers increase. If Napoleon had carried his explana- tion further, he would have reminded us that at the Battle of the Pyramids a handful of Frenchmen, com- manded by himself, had defeated about thirty thousand of these valiant Orientals, individually superior to the French. There must be therefore such a thing as wise tactics and intelligent battle formations, that is a combination of forces by leadership. The influence of the leadership,   ## p. 314 (#324) ############################################  314 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR of the command, becomes considerable and decisive; it triumphs over individual quality when numbers in- crease. Where shall we find the method whose existence is now evident? Will it consist in the number of enemies killed? Is it a question of doing more harm by having more guns and more rifles, or better guns and better rifles, than the enemy? Is superiority found merely in material ad- vantages, or does it come from other causes? We must seek the answer in an analysis of the psychological phe- nomenon of battle. "A hundred thousand men," says General Cardot, "leave ten thousand of their number on the ground and acknowledge defeat: they retreat before the victors who have lost just as many men, if not more. Besides neither know,
