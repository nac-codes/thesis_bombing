Over the door is a coat-of-arms: two stags with locked horns, and for a motto: The most obstinate wins. "That is the truest source of success!" exclaims the famous general. Proofs and instances could be given indefinitely of that great importance of morale in war. Von der Goltz him- self tells us that: "It is not so much a question of destroy- ing the enemy troops as of destroying their courage.

In order that our army be victorious, its morale must be higher than that of the enemy, or it must obtain such superiority of morale from the higher command. To organize th
