his immense task of the command can rarely be car- ried out, with the size of the present armies, by one man only. It requires a number of men, with subordinates using their own initiative towards a unique purpose. But battles are not fought without reason: "Battles of which one cannot say why they were fought, and with what purpose, are the usual resource of ignorance." Yet history shows us many such battles, as around Metz in August, 1870, when we find an army fighting bravely when its chief did not desire victory. The great events of history, the disasters which appear on some of its pages, such as the collapse of French power in 1870, are never accidents. They can be traced to higher and general causes which are omissions of the most ordinary moral and intellectual truths. It is there- fore necessary, if we wish to clearly understand war, that we recognize first its main principles. 1   ## p. 318 (#328) ############################################  318 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR How can an army efficiently commanded destroy the morale of the enemy? Into what actions is war, dis- play of moral force, translated? To answer that question, we need only see how a men- tal impression is created. "Everything," says Xenophon, "pleasant or terrible, causes us the more pleasure or fear in proportion as we have least expected it. This is nowhere more evident than in war, where every surprise brings terror even to those who are most powerful." He says terror "the cold goddess Fear, but not the fear of a woman who runs away screaming. That one we can, and even must, consider as an impossibility though it be not a quite unknown phenomenon, but that other and much more terrible fear which descends on the strongest heart, chills it and persuades it that it is defeated." (J. de Maistre.) The way to destroy the enemy's morale, to show him that his cause is lost, is therefore surprise in every sense of the word, bringing into the struggle something â€œun- expected and terrible," which th
