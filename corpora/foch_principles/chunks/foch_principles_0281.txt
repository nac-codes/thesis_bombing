The way to destroy the enemy's morale, to show him that his cause is lost, is therefore surprise in every sense of the word, bringing into the struggle something â€œun- expected and terrible," which therefore has a great effect. It deprives the enemy of the power to reflect, and consequently to discuss. It may be some new engine of war, possessed of novel powers of destruction, but that cannot be created at will; ambushes and attacks in the rear are suitable to small- scale warfare, but impractical in big operations where we must resort to the sudden appearance of a danger which the enemy has no time to avoid, or which he can only partly avoid.
