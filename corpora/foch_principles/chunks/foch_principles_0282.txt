manner we find the community of char- acteristics and effects realized in the flank attacks of our predecessors, in the oblique movements of Frederick or in the operations of Napoleon. Under various forms we always find the same princi- ple of surprise, seeking to produce on the enemy the same moral result, terror; creating in him, by the sudden ap- pearance of something unexpected and overwhelming, the feeling of impotence, the assurance that he cannot win; that is, that he is beaten. To destroy the enemy's morale is therefore the first   ## p. 320 (#330) ############################################  320 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR principle we find; to destroy it through an unexpected blow of overwhelming force, such is the first consequence of that principle.

To defeat an oppo- nent, it is unnecessary to "simultaneously cut off his arms, his legs and his head while piercing his chest and stabbing him in the stomach." (General Cardot.) In the same way, to overcome an army's flank, its center, any important part of the whole, will be sufficient for the re- sult sought. The army, moreover, is a delicate being which thrives only on discipline. Discipline is the main strength of armies, but it is also the prime necessity to their exist- ence; discipline alone, thanks to hierarchic organization permitting the transmission and execution of orders, en- ables the commander to control any action. To break the chain is, therefore, to transform the tactical units into disjointed human masses; it renders the execution of orders impossible, it destroys the will of the commander, it prevents all action. And to break the chain, it is enough to spread moral or ma- terial disorder, to upset the organization at one point of the whole. All this brings us to the application of one overwhelm- ing blow at one point, which Napoleon has put into words by saying that, in order to win, it is sufficient "to be t
