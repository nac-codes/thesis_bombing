n at one point of the whole. All this brings us to the application of one overwhelm- ing blow at one point, which Napoleon has put into words by saying that, in order to win, it is sufficient "to be the stronger at a given point and a given moment." He has proved it repeatedly by his leadership in battle. "Whether we pierce, or simply raise, the veil which, in Napoleon's battles, conceals all the delays necessary for a first orientation or for the arrival of a neighboring   ## p. 321 (#331) ############################################  THE BATTLE: DECISIVE ATTACK 321 force, for some movement, we always find that the de- cisive attack of the masses is carried out with all its fury and all its tragical characteristics" (Clausewitz). That is what Napoleon meant also when he wrote to Marshal Gouvion-Saint-Cyr: "One must give preference to no one form of attack, but act in accordance with the circumstances. One must attack the enemy with all pos- sible resources. After having engaged the units nearest to the enemy, one must let them carry on without worry- ing about their good or bad fortune. But one must be careful not to comply too readily with calls for assistance from the leaders."-" He added," says the Marshal, "that only towards the close of the day, when he noticed. that a worn-out enemy had thrown in the greater part of his resources, did he gather up what reserves he might have, in order to thrust on the battlefield a strong mass of infantry, cavalry and artillery; this not having been expected by the enemy, Napoleon caused what he called an event, and in this manner he had nearly always been victorious." Napoleon knows very well that one cannot demoralize or defeat a real opponent by lines of skirmishers or even by a general attack. To overcome him, to compel him to acknowledge defeat, an unexpected effort of unknown vio- lence must be made; Napoleon obtains that effort from the mass, from masses; and to assure the effect, he dis- poses these masses in columns.
