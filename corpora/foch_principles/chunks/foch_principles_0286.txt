It is an inferior form of battle, therefore, if we com-   ## p. 324 (#334) ############################################  324 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR pare it with the battle of maneuvers, depending on the leadership of the Commander-in-Chief, on judicious and combined use of resources at hand, on the value of all these resources, true economy of forces aiming at the con- centration of efforts and of masses on one chosen point. Till the last it remains a single combination of combats differing in their intensity, but all aimed in one direction. for the purpose of accomplishing one final result: the foreseen, determined and sudden action of masses em- ploying surprise. The weakness of the battle in line lies in the fact that it is an attack which develops everywhere with equal force, resulting in uniform pressure on an enemy who opposes a resistance equally uniform, but of superior value because he disposes of special advantages, cover, fields of fire, etc., which the attacker does not possess to the same extent. But if we can perceive the weak point in the enemy structure, or a point of little resistance, the equilibrium is broken, the mass rushes through the breach, and the obstacle is carried. If we seek the weak point, or if we create one by our blows on a part of the enemy's line, we attain the same result. Mechanics and psychology lead us both to the battle of maneuvers. One recommends the application at one point of superior forces, the other urges the apparition of a danger of an attack which cannot be parried. Both therefore mean decisive attack. Such an attack is necessary, because without it nothing is accomplished, and we can depend only on luck. It is sufficient because it brings the desired result.   ## p. 325 (#335) ############################################  THE BATTLE: DECISIVE ATTACK 325 Theoretically, a battle begun
