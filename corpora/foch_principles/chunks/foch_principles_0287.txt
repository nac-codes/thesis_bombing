It is sufficient because it brings the desired result.   ## p. 325 (#335) ############################################  THE BATTLE: DECISIVE ATTACK 325 Theoretically, a battle begun is an attack determined to succeed. Theoretically also, to be the stronger on a given point at a given time, we must apply all the forces simulta- neously on that point, and in an unexpected manner. When we pass to practice, we shall find that this neces- sity entails others; the principles of protection will appear again, and compel sacrifices, absorb forces. To direct the attack, to guard it against the enemy, to prevent that enemy from carrying out a similar maneuver, we shall have to undertake and carry through many minor engagements, each one having some special pur- pose. Nevertheless, the decisive attack is the keystone of the battle, and all the other combats must only be con- sidered and organized in the measure in which they facili- tate and assure the development of the decisive attack characterized by mass, by surprise and by speed, for which we must consequently reserve the greatest possible number of forces and of troops with which to maneuver. Hence economy of forces, meaning their distribution and employment in battle. The difference between the battle of maneuvers and the battle in line does not consist merely in the difference of results: results planned and sought in the one case by a decisive attack; results hoped for in the other case from some happy occurrence on one or several unknown points of the front. There is also a complete difference of lead- ership, of execution, of economy of forces. That has to be pointed out, because though we theo- retically abandon the battle in line, we actually return to it if we have not in advance organized our combination   ## p. 326 (#336) ############################################  326 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR with a plan of battle which aims above all at decisive attack.
