TACK 327 reserves. The dogma is closely connected with the theory of progressive consumption of forces; it is considered a sacred dogma. But every reserve represents a dead force. . . . The reserves are useful only on condition of being engaged. . . . One can even imagine a case where it would be wiser to have no reserve; that is where the enemy's force would be precisely known, and when he was already fully deployed" (Von der Goltz). The difference in employment of the reserves is so great between the two kinds of battle that the other differ- ences are sometimes forgotten.

We shall, for the time being, take an example on a small scale: the Battle of Saalfeld. We can find there all the actions of battle in reduced proportions. It is the 9th of October, 1806.
