ber, 1806. The Grand Army in three columns finishes crossing the Franken-Wald to penetrate into Saxony. The army's advance guard (1st Army Corps and 3 cavalry divisions under Murat) precedes the center col- umn. It has defeated, at Saalburg and at Schleiz, the Tauenzien Division moving from Hof to Jena. Of the right column, the leading unit (4th Corps) has reached Plauen; the 6th Corps following, is at Hof.
