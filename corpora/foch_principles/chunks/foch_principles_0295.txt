In the north, a long column is observed moving from Schwarza to Saalfeld. The cavalry brigade, by a short trot, issues from the wood, followed by the picked battalion which accelerates the pace. The remainder of the column continues its march, careless and gay. The marshal reaches the outer edge of the wood. A few of the enemy's outposts are near the road, and on the heights above Saalfeld.
