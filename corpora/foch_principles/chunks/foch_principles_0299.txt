But during that long interval, the enemy may attack   ## p. 339 (#349) ############################################  THE BATTLE: HISTORICAL EXAMPLE 339 the column as it debouches; that must be prevented; it is the duty of the advance guard. To come on guard by seizing every means of halting the enemy's advance, that is then the first step in prepar- ing for battle. Hence the occupation of crests which permit the use of fire; hence the occupation and forti- fication of the points which increase the powers of re- sistance of the troops. The enemy is massed, and may also move, undertake some maneuver, change in some way the dispositions against which an attack is being prepared. How can that be prevented? By attacking him, but without risk- ing anything; with weak forces and along an extended front, to economize forces. Hence the offensive by small units moving from the points still occupied. Lines of skirmishers will move through the gardens, the orchards, the hollow roads, to threaten the enemy and extend the limited action at the outskirts of points occupied. In such manner, these points, centers of resistance at first, later become the starting points of offensive actions. In brief, positions occupied which dot the ground with strong points, connected by lines of skirmishers, with good observation from the heights, acting under cover and supplying the elements of partial offensive: such is the front line. Further back is a reserve of mobile troops. In this case, it will consist of cavalry. Then, when the first needs have been attended to, infantry will be used. In the same way, moreover, must the advance guard recon- naissance be understood.
