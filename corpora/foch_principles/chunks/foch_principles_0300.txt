In the case which we are considering, such reconnais- sance is quite unnecessary, inasmuch as the enemy is   ## p. 340 (#350) ############################################  340 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR clearly seen in the plain, his formations and numbers being visible. In the presence of a concealed and cov- ered enemy, it will have been necessary to reconnoiter, that is determine the distribution and importance of his forces, to be able to employ intelligent maneuver. How would the offensive have been carried out? Evi- dently by offensive. Such offensive, to entail no risks, would have started from the strong points occupied. It would have succes- sively developed on the enemy's front. In any case, it would have borne only on that portion of his front which could interest our attack, that is the portion which we intended to strike, and from which we might be struck. The enemy is therefore reconnoitered and immobilized on the front which concerns the action undertaken. In that way must we interpret Napoleon's saying: â€œOne engages everywhere." On that principle, a division in- tended for attack will not reconnoiter a front of 6, 7 or 8 kilometers, in which it has no interest. In the same way, when the reconnaissance has provided enough in- formation as to the part of the line intended to be struck, it stops. These considerations having been made, Marshal Lannes orders the following dispositions: (1) The picked battalion will continue to thrust back on Saalfeld the Prussian posts which hold the heights, and it will stop at Garnsdorf, occupying it firmly. The cavalry will place itself in reserve in the hollow of the small Siegenbach valley, and then: The 17th Light Infantry will occupy with its two picked companies the northeastern point of the wood, opposite   ## p. 341 (#351) ############################################  THE BATTLE: HISTORICAL EXAMPLE 341 the opening of the Saale, which they must defend; The remainder of its forces will hold Beulwitz, reach- ing it by
