At the same time, the order arrives from Prince Hohenlohe to remain at Rudolstadt and refrain from attacking, as the army is to move from Blankenhayn to the Saale. The retreat through Schwarza, in case of defeat, becomes still more important. The Prince occu- pies the Sandberg with the dismounted battery and the 1st Battalion Müfling.
