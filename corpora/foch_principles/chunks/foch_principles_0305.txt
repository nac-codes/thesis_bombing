t hand: 6 battalions out of 12 (without artillery or preparation of any kind); 4 are in the first line, 2 in second line. Hardly is this attack perceived, proceeding east of the Crösten-Beulwitz line, before the right comes under fire of the French skirmishers who fill the gardens, the or- chards, the hollow roads, ever invisible skirmishers who deluge the right with bullets. The line hesitates, stops, answers by volleys, without any result; at the same in- stant its flank is attacked by 2 battalions of the 34th which, after proceeding under cover of the slopes, appear and charge in column, with beating drums, General Suchet leading. The strain is too great. The Xavier Regiment is in full retreat, and the left of the line (Regiment of the Elector) also withdraws.

The Marshal will attack in the direction already chosen: by the region of Beulwitz and of Crösten. He will strike the enemy mass in the plain with the main body of the division's forces, the Claparède Brigade (17th and 64th) attacking on the front, and the Reille Brigade (34th and 40th) attacking on the flank. But he must first guard against the troops holding the Sandberg and Aue, and give to the division's attack suffi- cient space for its development. The Reille Brigade is intrusted with this double mis- sion. For that purpose, it starts in the directi
