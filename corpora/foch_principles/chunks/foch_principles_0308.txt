So true is it that the art of fighting, even for the most ardent and most energetic leaders disposing of the best troops, does not merely con- sist in rushing at the enemy in any sort of way. The theory adopted is evident in this case; we clearly see the lengthy maneuver (from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock), aimed solely at the overpowering ending by the main body, preceded by a preparation for which the least pos- sible forces are employed. The Battle of Saalfeld, if delivered to-day, would en- tail no different method. The advance guard would seize Garnsdorf and Beul- witz, and protect itself towards the Saale. It would be reinforced by all, or part of, the artillery, according to necessity, and it would assume either the of
