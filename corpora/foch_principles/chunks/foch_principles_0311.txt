"These principles are known to you, and have been recommended to you several times. We have often prac- ticed them in our peace maneuvers, but I remind you of them as things known are sometimes forgotten, because by their simplicity they seem evident, yet victory often depends on them. Unless care is taken and the memory refreshed daily, one tends to over-wise combinations, or else one marches into battle with no combination which is worse." As we see, after developing the theory of battle of preparation, or feint attack, and of the decisive attack which he names true attack, after having explained how it is fought, the King points out how the forces can be subdivided.

If we go back to the 18th of August, 1870, we find this idea of a decisive attack to be prepared as basis of all Von Moltke's combinations.   ## p. 353 (#363) ############################################  XII MODERN BATTLE EXECUTION I' F, from the Battle of Saalfeld previously studied, we pass to the use of modern armies, a number of fac- tors are modified: (1) Weapons have a greater range; they are more deadly, and that compels taking the dispositions for at- tack further and under better cover. In the same way, during the action, one must seek more than in the past to make full use of the power of weapons. (2) Armies maneuver easily, and are carefully pro- tected. The enemy's dispositions are therefore harder to ascertain; reconnaissance must be prolonged; immobiliz- ing the enemy is also more difficult. (3) The effectives on either side reach unknown pro- portions. It would take too long, therefore, to mass the troops for a decisive attack. Thes
