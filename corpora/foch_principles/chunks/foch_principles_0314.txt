In like manner, the strategic advance guards of Na- poleon, especially those of 1806 and 1809, supply by their information the basis for Napoleon's maneuvers, as they later, by their resistance, constitute the pivot around which the maneuver is developed. In like manner also, is the battle organized which Von Moltke sought on the Sarre about the 9th of August, 1870. He relies on the information he has concerning the French Army to attack its front with his own 1st and 2nd armies, while the 3rd, debouching from the Vosges, is to carry out a flank attack which will be the decisive phase of his combination. Preparation is begun in that case long before August 9th. At first, preparation is interwoven, as we see, with in- formation resulting from exploration; it therefore is a duty of the cavalry, assisted by the artillery. As the enemy draws nearer, information becomes a task of the protective troops. But as preparation must also assure to the commander his freedom of action until the last minute, allowing him to make up his mind only when fully informed, preparation and protection are well intrusted to the same hands. The advance guards then interfere to halt the enemy, or at least impede him. At Saalfeld, for that purpose: The picked battalion occupies Garnsdorf; The 17th Regiment occupies the southeastern edge of the woods and Beulwitz. As we have seen also, Marshal Lannes, if facing a division better concealed, would have extended his recon- naissance; the advance guard would have been more ac-   ## p. 357 (#367) ############################################  MODERN BATTLE 357 tive; it would have reconnoitered towards Saalfeld, to- wards Cr√∂sten, employed its guns against one or other of these places to compel the hostile artillery to show itself. It would have assured, in any case, the o
