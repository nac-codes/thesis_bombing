It would have assured, in any case, the occupation of strong points prepared for resistance. Besides what has been pointed out, the preparation must conceal the direction and time of the decisive attack; it must cover its organization, which entails a new duty of protection.

Garnsdorf first, Beulwitz later, would have been attacked, and possession of the interval would have resulted. All available troops would have joined
