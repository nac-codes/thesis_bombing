ed, he would have occupied Garnsdorf and Beulwitz. Garnsdorf first, Beulwitz later, would have been attacked, and possession of the interval would have resulted. All available troops would have joined hands, if necessary, to carry the former of these points. That being done, they would have held it with the smallest pos- sible forces, and would have reformed in order to carry the second point. On a modern field of battle, where resistance is gen- erally planned in depth, behind a first line of obstacles will usually be found a second one. Then the assaulting troops, extended and mixed with one another, must be constantly taken in hand again by the commanders of small units for the purpose of making new efforts against the many objectives which they must successively attack, in simultaneous time, if they are to succeed. Thus, in execution, the troops of preparation appear to us as engaged not in one action, but in several partial combats, independent one of the others, seeking to over- come the centers of hostile resistance. As the enemy, meanwhile, observes the same methods until he has been completely immobilized, or as he seeks to win back the points he has lost, there ensues a series of offensive and defensive actions for the possession of ground. This generally gives to the battle of preparation particular characteristics of perseverance, which result in wearing down the enemy.   ## p. 359 (#369) ############################################  MODERN BATTLE 359 Hence also the length of the battle of preparation, existing as a constant offensive, everywhere carried on, under difficulties; and in case of a reverse, it becomes a defensive prepared in advance and fought bitterly. As we have seen, the preparation consists of a number of partial engagements, each of which, in order to suc- ceed, to obtain a decision, entails some decisive action. Every such action is, in turn, divided into Preparation, Execution and Exploitation. At each stage, the use and the formation
