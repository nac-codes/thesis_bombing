in order to suc- ceed, to obtain a decision, entails some decisive action. Every such action is, in turn, divided into Preparation, Execution and Exploitation. At each stage, the use and the formations of the troops are governed by the same principles as prevail in battle. It is certain also that these numerous engagements can- not all be under one leader.

It is artillery which can, of course, act first because of its range, its mobility, the ease with which it goes into, or ceases, action in order to move elsewhere when necessary. For that reason, the main body's artillery, moving for the greater part near the head of the column, increases its speed. Under protection of the infantry, it reinforces the artillery of the advance guard. To assist the advance guard in its mission of recon- noitering, immobilizing and wearing out the enemy, the artillery must destroy the obstacles which impede the in- fantry: strong points and hostile artillery. As soon as progress is possible, it advances in its turn, to se
