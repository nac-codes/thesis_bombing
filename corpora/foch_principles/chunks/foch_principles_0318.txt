ng and wearing out the enemy, the artillery must destroy the obstacles which impede the in- fantry: strong points and hostile artillery. As soon as progress is possible, it advances in its turn, to settle finally the fate of the enemy's guns by a battle at short range. That is an artillery duel. It is evi- dently most important to obtain as soon as possible the superiority in such a duel of guns, capable of spraying with fire all the ground within range. For that purpose, our artillery must at once have the advantage of numbers, organize a long line of fire, bring up all its guns and keep nothing in reserve. Such is the method followed by artilleries fighting an artillery duel. Once the enemy's guns have been destroyed or silenced, we must resume the function of assistance to the infantry, by preparing the attack of such points as the latter chooses for objectives. That preparation means, as we shall see later when studying the decisive attack, the opening up of approaches to the objective, and the partial destruction of that objec- tive, to accompany the assault.   ## p. 361 (#371) ############################################  MODERN BATTLE 361 This team play between artillery duels and infantry attacks causes variations in the dispositions of batteries. In the former case (artillery duels), the divisional artil- leries must strive to join the corps artillery. All the bat- teries must, as much as possible, fight as one unit, the army corps' artillery, aiming all at one purpose. In the latter case (the infantry attack assisted by ar- tillery), the divisional artilleries remain, of course, under the orders of the division commanders; they are, more- over, reinforced by part or all of the corps artil- lery. As firearms are improved, the infantry is compelled, in order to advance, to travel under cover, at least from enemy artillery. To that end it takes advantage of every favorable means of approach for as long a time as pos- sible. The necessity of cover is increasin
