advance, to travel under cover, at least from enemy artillery. To that end it takes advantage of every favorable means of approach for as long a time as pos- sible. The necessity of cover is increasing daily. But these means of approach are easily held to-day by small units, occupying strong points and armed with re- peating rifles, machine-guns, or a few quick-firing guns for enfilading purposes. In former times, many guns were needed for such a result, while now a few are suf- ficient. Hence the covered approaches so necessary to infantry would be useless if the infantry were not closely supported by an artillery capable of destroying the enemy's means of resistance. The union of both arms be- comes more necessary, and only behind a curtain of shells that destroy obstacles and silence enemy guns will the in- fantry be able to advance. While this will sometimes necessitate dividing the ar- tillery up into groups having different missions to carry out, we must not forget that the moral effect, peculiar to artillery, increases greatly with the concentration of   ## p. 362 (#372) ############################################  362 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR fire. It is, therefore, by mass action that important de- cisive results must be sought. On the other hand, artillery possesses to a very high degree the facility for surprising: it can, as soon as it appears, follow up the threat with the blow, the appari- tion of danger with fire. It must keep for its action these characteristics, increase them if possible, and for that pur- pose destroy the enemy as rapidly as possible by intensity of fire. Infantry. Although artillery opens the fight, it cannot do so without assured protection. The infantry must, therefore, open up the battlefield for artillery, and protect it unceasingly by holding the necessary points at sufficient distance to guard the batteries against the hostile in- fantry's fire. ―――― Apart from the duty of protection, infantry has the leading part in the prepa
