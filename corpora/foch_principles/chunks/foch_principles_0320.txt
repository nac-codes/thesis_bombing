by holding the necessary points at sufficient distance to guard the batteries against the hostile in- fantry's fire. ―――― Apart from the duty of protection, infantry has the leading part in the preparation destined to wear out the enemy. That causes special development of the battle for supremacy of fire. The troops of preparation must also immobilize the opponent, which compels the infantry to attack him, to threaten him with assault after approaching within as- saulting distance. We shall deal with this double action by fire and by advance, seeking how it can be developed, with forces re- duced to the smallest necessary numbers, so as to attain the purpose sought: the threat at close range, which is not a decision, yet is difficult to carry out. It is evident, to begin with, that, to-day, fire direction and fire control have an immense importance. Fire is the supreme argument. The most ardent troops, those whose   ## p. 363 (#373) ############################################  MODERN BATTLE 363 morale has been most excited, will always wish to seize ground by successive rushes. But they will encounter great difficulties, and suffer heavy casualties, whenever their partial offensive has not been prepared by effective fire. They will be thrown back on their starting point, with still heavier losses. The superiority of fire, and therefore superiority of control and direction, becomes the most important element of an infantry's fighting value. No struggle will be possible between a body having no theory, no instruction, no discipline in the use of fire, of little value therefore in action, and another body per- fectly trained, disciplined in the use of fire, far superior on the battlefield. Training and instruction will combine with the nature of the armament in determining the points to be held. But under no circumstances must these considerations limit the offensive, which fire must, on the contrary, assist and develop. Fire is never an end, but only a means of main
