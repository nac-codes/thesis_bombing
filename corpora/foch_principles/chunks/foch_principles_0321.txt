ng the points to be held. But under no circumstances must these considerations limit the offensive, which fire must, on the contrary, assist and develop. Fire is never an end, but only a means of maintaining an advance; it is used for that purpose, and it must be ceased as soon as the result sought-possibility of resuming the march-is attained. Precede, therefore, any forward rush by a hail of shot destined to shake the enemy and keep him down.

For that purpose, preparation must expel the enemy from his cover, seizing and holding the strong points.

A series of similar ac- tions is carried out in the preparation until the last enemy lines are reached, or until the troops can go no farther.

They cannot be directed by the higher command, nor by any command acting in depth. Their success, however, requires sufficient forces, so that commanders of front line units (battalions or companies) must show initiative and good team work to combine the action of their re- spective forces against the successive objectives to be reached. To be wisely managed, this combat must grow in vigor and energy from its start till the decisive action, which necessitates successive reinforcements, and therefore the disposition of the troops in depth. This is also made un- avoidable by the need of preserving the reserves for a long time from the fire which sweeps the first l
