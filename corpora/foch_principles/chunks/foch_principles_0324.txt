All artillery groups near that point work to the same   ## p. 367 (#377) ############################################  MODERN BATTLE 367 purpose, by a sudden and violent fire in constantly in- creasing proportions. Fire must be opened up against the obstacles which may delay the infantry's advance, and the first of these is enemy artillery. It becomes the first objective assigned to the massed artillery. Once superiority is obtained in this duel, the obstacles and strong points along the road must be destroyed, or at least rendered untenable. The road being open, it has to be kept open; for that purpose, fire is kept up against that part of the enemy front which has been chosen for attack until it is reached by the assaulting infantry. Success must also be assured by shelling any troops which the enemy might wish to use: new batteries, re- serves or counter-attacks. To fulfill this third task, the massed artillery organizes battery groups as attack groups or counter-attack groups, their function being to accompany and assist the infantry columns, and to maneuver in the dangerous directions. As their movements must be very rapidly carried out, it is the duty of the commanders to foresee such movements, and to find positions suitable for each case. Such unity of action will only be possible for many bat- teries, of course, through a sole source of command, able to direct and control their fire as well as distributing among them the various duties, and co-ordinating their work with the needs of the infantry attack.
