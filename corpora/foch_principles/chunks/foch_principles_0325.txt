######  368 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR destined to execute the decisive attack have assembled opposite the objective, employing for that purpose cov- ered approaches. They are massed behind such cover as is nearest to the enemy, protected by the troops of the preparation. They are, of course, covered in every dangerous direction. When the time comes to act, artillery shakes the enemy's resistance, and infantry must destroy it. To compel the enemy's retreat one must march on him; to conquer the position, to take his place, one must go there. The most powerful of fires does not give that result, and here begins the work of the masses of infantry. They march straight to the objective, increasing their speed as they draw nearer, preceded by violent fire, in order to assault the enemy bodily and close the argument with cold steel by greater courage and determination. What formation should be taken depends, of course, on the ground and on the distance at which the infantry appears in the open. It is determined by the general con- siderations which govern the infantry battle. First the mass must be moved up to a distance where it can effectively use its weapons. Until that distance is reached, it is powerless to defend itself by fire, but it must suffer some, especially from the artillery whose rapid fire would suffice to its disorganization. At first then, we see a period during which the mass of infantry, practically unarmed, endeavors by its for- mation and speed to avoid as much as possible the enemy's fire. Hence combinations aimed at the least exposure and most movement: thin lines, extended order, irregular lines of sections or platoons, etc. However, in the presence of an enemy with full free-   ## p. 369 (#379) ############################################  MODERN BATTLE 369 dom of fire, formation, even of the most clever kind, will usually not suffice to advance over unprotected ground, or even to cross spaces of any width. Casualties will occur which break up the orga
