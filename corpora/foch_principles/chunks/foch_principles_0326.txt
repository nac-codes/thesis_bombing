9 dom of fire, formation, even of the most clever kind, will usually not suffice to advance over unprotected ground, or even to cross spaces of any width. Casualties will occur which break up the organization and especially the morale of the infantry. In the second stage, on the other hand, when close to the enemy's position, the mass is able to develop all its power of fire and of shock. The formations to be em- ployed must seek to utilize, as much as possible, these two means of action, prolonging them without pause, so that their effects overlap. The fire received has then but secondary importance; a start has been made and the goal must be reached. Moreover, there is but one way of lightening the effects of enemy fire, and that is by developing a more violent fire, capable of keeping down the opponent, at the same time advancing rapidly. To advance, and advance rapidly, preceded by a hail of shot; as the enemy is neared, to display troops ever more numerous and denser, such is the principle of the formations to take and of the conduct to adopt. An attack organized as we have seen can only act straight to its front. Abandoned to itself, it has its flanks exposed to the attacks or counter-attacks of the enemy. Yet its only chance of success is a straight, rapid and continued advance. Hence the need to protect it against all surprise, to organize in the rear another body, inde- pendent of the attack but capable of foreseeing the counter-attack and preventing it. That is the first duty of the reserve. Moreover, when the attack has carried the position,   ## p. 370 (#380) ############################################  370 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR enemy reserves will seek to appear before the attacking troops can have reorganized. These reserves must be fought immediately, especially if counter-attacking. That also necessitates maintaining until the end an important reserve, at sufficient distance to neither be engaged with the attacking troops nor suffer from the same fi
