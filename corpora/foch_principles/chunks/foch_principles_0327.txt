pecially if counter-attacking. That also necessitates maintaining until the end an important reserve, at sufficient distance to neither be engaged with the attacking troops nor suffer from the same fire. CAVALRY, EXPLOITATION Simultaneously with the infantry attack, when in the open, there suddenly appear, on the enemy's front, flank or rear, the squadrons of attack. They throw themselves against whatever resistance is still displayed by the enemy, or against any hostile cavalry seeking to charge the assaulting infantry, or against enemy reserves as they hasten up. These reserves alone can change the course of events, and for that reason they hasten. They must be stopped at any price. Whether the cavalry aims, therefore, at the enemy's threatening squadrons, or at the main position, or at the hostile reserves, it can always find, at a time when the strain is greatest, an opportunity to do some good work. For cavalry as for the other arms, there is then a need and possibility of action towards assisting the decisive attack, a victory for all resulting sometimes from even apparently unsuccessful efforts of a few. CHOICE OF THE POINT OF ATTACK The decisive attack is the employment of the mass, bringing moral and material superiority. Moral superiority, resulting from numbers, formations,   ## p. 371 (#381) ############################################  MODERN BATTLE 371 etc., is no longer sufficient to-day with modern weapons: their effects are too demoralizing. We must also develop material superiority, employing to good purpose the many guns and small arms supplied by the mass; this requires space. Hence the preference, in modern tactics, for flank at- tacks which permit of developing against one chosen point the desired superiority of fire; of carrying out flank and reverse fires of undeniable moral effect; allow- ing by an unlimited space the possibility of always maneuvering the mass. Hence the abandonment of the central attack so often practiced by the Emperor. He
