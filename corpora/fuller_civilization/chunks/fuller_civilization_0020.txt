flintlock musket, with an effective range of about 100 yards and a maximum range of 300. It could be fired twice a minute, and each man carried with him into battle 60 rounds of ammunition. His field gun was the twelve-pounder with a round-shot range of 1,500 yards and a case-shot range of 500. His other weapons, bayonet, sword and lance were much as they are to-day. His fundamental principle of attack was to take his opponent in flank or rear, and to prepare this manœuvre he first attacked his enemy in front in order to draw in his reserves and so fix him. He was not pre-eminently a great tactician, but his amazing strategy, the rapidity of his marches, the masses of men he used, and above all the unity of command which he exercised, normally forced him to assume the aggressive rôle. In his early campaigns shortage of artillery compelled him, as General Duhesme says, to hurl his battalions against his enemy " like a battering ram." Again he did so at Waterloo, but this time he did not understand how to meet Wellington's tactics. He believed in the attack, but he did not believe in it blindly, and, consequently, he believed in numerical superiority, yet again with his eyes wide open, for he says : " An army of 10,000 men that can move twenty miles a day is superior for war to one of 20,000 whose average speed does not exceed ten miles a day." It is curious that, believing as he did in quickness of movement, he never appears to have paid much attention to quickness of fire. For instance, in 1800, on the day before crossing the St. Bernard, we find Berthier ordering that all conscripts should fire a few shots " that they may know which eye to aim with and how to load their muskets." (82) And not until 1811 do we hear of Napoleon approving target practice for recruits, and then only if inferior powder is fired. (28) His use of cavalry in reconnaissance and pursuit was frequently superb, but it is in his employment of artillery 31 that he stands second to none, except
