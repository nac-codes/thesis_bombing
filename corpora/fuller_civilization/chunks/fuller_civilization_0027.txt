her total machinery was under 10,000 horse-power, and in 1846 not more than 22,000. In France, in this last-mentioned year, more than half the French pig-iron was still smelted by charcoal, and there was very little steam-power in the country. Nevertheless, such steam- power as did exist in Europe began to make it possible for military inventions to be manufactured at an increasingly economical price. Many of these inventions were centuries old in conception, but on account of the rudimentary conditions of engineering it had been either impossible to make them, or too costly to do so. Thus, for instance, rifles had been known in the fifteenth century ; and in 1742, in his book New Principles of Gunnery, Benjamin Robins had pointed out that ". . . . whatever State shall thoroughly comprehend the nature and advantage of rifled barrel pieces, and having facilitated and completed their construction, shall introduce into their armies their general use, with a dexterity in the management of them, will by this means acquire a superiority which will almost equal anything that has been done at any time by the particular excellence of any one kind of arms, and will perhaps fall but little short of the wonderful effect which historians relate to have been formerly produced by the first invention of firearms." (5) The trouble here was not only one of manufacture, but of producing a powder which would not foul the barrel, and this was impossible until an advance in chemistry had been made. In 1805 the Rev. Alexander John Forsyth devised the percussion system, and offered it to the Army but with no results. In 1814 copper percussion caps were first manufactured, but they were not adapted for the " Brown Bess " until 1842. In 1824 Captain Norton  40 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RETO THE CHANGING WORLD invented the cylindro-conoidal bullet, but the British Government failed to adopt this form of projectile until 1851. Both these inventions, indirectly due to steam-power, had event
