y well be doubted," writes Colonel Maude . . . " whether the French feudal laws at their worst, inflicted greater misery on the people than the 41 untrammelled action of the laissez faire school . brought upon our unfortunate working classes in the dark days before the Factory Acts." (6) By 1832 widespread misery had become universal in England. In 1842 women and children were still working in the coal-pits of South Staffordshire, and of deaths among the miners 57 per cent. were due to accidents. " In one part of Manchester the wants of upwards of 7,000 people " were " supplied by thirty-three necessaries only." (7) If such were the conditions under which the workers lived, those under which the soldiers lived were even worse. The Army was unpopular, officers had to take to plain clothes so as not to be seen in the streets in uniform ; duelling was not prohibited until 1843 ; professional education was all but non-existent, and age counted for far more than efficiency. For instance, in 1826, in one regiment there was an ensign on full pay aged 61 ; as late as 1852 there were thirteen generals of 70 years' service and upwards, thirty-seven of 60 to 70, one hundred and sixty-three of 50 to 60, seventy-two of 40 to 50 and seven under 40 years' service. Whilst in the Navy, in 1831, on the Admirals list there was one above 90, seven between 80 and 90, twenty-five between 70 and 80, seven between 70 and 65, and one, the youngest, aged 65. Also on the active list-six com- manders between 81 and 76, and eleven lieutenants between 81 and 63.

The following are some of the conditions as given by Fortescue(0) : "The only urinals for barrack rooms were wooden tubs, the stench of which was appalling. Moreover the same tubs, when emptied, were the only vessels furnished to the soldier to wash in. . . . The barrack-rooms were shared by the wives of soldiers married ' on the stren
