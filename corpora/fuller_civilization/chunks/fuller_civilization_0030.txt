The barrack-rooms were shared by the wives of soldiers married ' on the strength,' the proportion of wives allowed in barracks being six to every hundred men. It was in these rooms that the soldier brought his newly-  42 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION THE CHANGING WORLD wedded partner for the honeymoon, and it was in these that his children were born, all in the presence of half a dozen comrades.". . . Sanitation was practically non- existent. .. two tallow dips were allowed to every room of twelve men. . . . Discipline was based on punishment ; at Fort Charles, Jamaica, " three hundred men had within two years received among them fifty-four thousand lashes.". . . (In 1832, a Regimental Court Martial could order three hundred lashes, and a District Court Martial five hundred.) . . . The diet was un- alterable-" beef-broth and boiled beef "; there were only two meals a day-breakfast at 7.30 a.m. and dinner at 12.30 p.m. . . . Bad food drove the soldier to drink. " To the clerks at the Treasury rations represented not the means of keeping soldiers alive, but simply a charge of pounds, shillings and pence against the national purse." The canteen system was pernicious in the extreme, there were no recreations, and drinking in the evenings was due to sheer exhaustion. . .. On the West Coast of Africa the annual death-rate ranged from 75 to 80 per cent. In 1825 there were 441 deaths out of 571 troops, and the next year 342 out of 471. With such conditions as these in both civil and military life, the much boasted years of peace are apt to lose their glamour. Those unfortunates who could not emigrate-and 337,000 did so in 1840-1842 ; 221,000 in 1842-1845 ; 130,000 in 1846, and on an average 248,000 a year between 1847 and 1852-turned to the only hope offered to them-the as yet narrow path of Socialism. In 1834, under the auspices of Robert Owen, the " Gr
