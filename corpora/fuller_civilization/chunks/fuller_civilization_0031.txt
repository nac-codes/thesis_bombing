In 1834, under the auspices of Robert Owen, the " Grand National Consolidated Trades' Union " was launched, and in 1842 Karl Marx, one of the most remarkable men of the century, began to edit the Rheinische Zeitung. These two men were to found a new form of war which reached its climax in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and has not yet run its course.

These are strange origins, but life is a perpetual conflict, and war
