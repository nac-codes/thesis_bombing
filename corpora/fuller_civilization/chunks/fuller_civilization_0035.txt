es on Asia, the British Govern- ment engineered the Opium War in China which gave England Hong Kong in 1842 and threw open to the foreigner the ports of Canton, Amoy, Foochow, Ningpo and Shanghai. This most iniquitous piece of banditry laid the foundations of the present Civil War in China. Also Great Britain turned her attention seriously to India. This led to a series of wars : the disastrous First Afghan War of 1839-1842 ; the Sind War, the Gwalior War ; the first Sikh War, and the Second Sikh War (all fought during the forties) and the Second Burmese War of 1852 ; all more or less land-grabbing operations which led direct to the Indian Mutiny in 1857. From the point of view of the art of war there is little to be learnt from the engagements fought.

For example, when at the opening of the first Afghan War the Army marched against Shah Shuja, " one brigadier had sixty camels to convey the various articles which he deemed necessary for himself alone."(12) JOMINI AND CLAUSEWITZ Though military ineptitude was at its height, it was largely during the thirties that a new philosophy of war was established, and this philosophy was destined to influence the whole nature of fighting from 1866 onwards. In 1832, Clausewitz having died the year before, his widow published his famous unfinished work On War, and in 47 1837 Jomini published his Summary of the Art of War, which, though one of his lesser works, was probably his most influential. Clausewitz did not like formalism in war, Jomini did. To Clausewitz " war is the province of chance," to Jomini it was far more the province of calculations. The first was a generation before his time, for the success of his doctrines depended on the establish- mert of a national military system. The second, basing his arguments on a professional army, in spite of the fact that it might be a conscript
