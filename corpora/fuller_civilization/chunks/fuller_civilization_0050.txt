(11) Then Mr. Fyffe writes : " Never had the ideal of industrious peace been more im- pressively set before mankind than in the years which succeeded the convulsion of 1848. Yet the epoch on which Europe was then about to enter proved to be pre-eminently an epoch of war. In the next quarter of a century there was not one of the Great Powers which was not engaged in an armed struggle with its rivals. Nor were the wars of this period in any sense the result of accident, or disconnected with the stream of political tendencies which make the history of the age.

(12) War was to solve what peace desired but could not establish ; war was to compel change, because peace could only argue over consequences. It is not easy to hammer a dozen pieces of iron into one lump, but it is easy to fuse them together by fire, and what fire is in the physical world war is in the political. So it happened that once again Europe was to be plunged into the crucible by blind forces and by blind men. If a new war-epoch was about to open, as indeed it was, what would be its nature ?
