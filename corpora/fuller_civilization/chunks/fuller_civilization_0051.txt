62 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION Kaffir War of 1852, during which it was discovered that " at a range of from twelve to thirteen hundred yards small bodies of Kaffirs could be dispersed." (18) Its weight with bayonet was 102 lbs., its bore Â·702 inch and it was sighted from 100 to 1,000 yards. What did this mean ? It meant that the danger zone, the reach of the bullet, had been increased from 200 yards to at least 800 yards, and that, consequently, the whole of tactics had been changed, because soldiers would now have to fight their way forward single-handed over 800 yards of ground ; for smooth-bore case-shot, being out- ranged, could no longer support them. Since 1851 no two European armies have met on the battlefield on equal terms. From now onwards in the hands of brave and disciplined men weapon-power was to dominate war as it had not done since the days of Gustavus Adolphus. Brave men there were, as the loss, on October 25, 1852, of the Birkenhead showed ; men worthy of the new rifle ; but the generals were as they had been depicted by Charles Napier fifty years before this date : "Under a long feather and cocked hat, trembling, though supported by stiff Hessian boots, gold-headed cane and long sword, I see the wizened face of a general grinning over the parapet of a fine frill, and telling extraordinary lies, while his claret, if he can afford claret, is going down the throats of his wondering or quizzing aides-de-camp." (14) These old men carried the old Brown Bess spirit into the new rifle tactics. - PART II PERIOD OF NATIONAL CONSOLIDATION 1853-1871 RETO  CHAPTER III THE WAR PERIOD OPENS, 1853-1860 Origins of the Crimean War.
