by Pélissier, a soldier of resolute character. In May this general captured Kerch, and by cutting the peninsular off from the mainland sealed the doom of the fortress. On June 7 an assault was made on the Redan, and another on the 18th. On September 8 the French under General Bosquet stormed the Malakoff, General Mac- mahon being one of the first to mount the scarp. Mean- while, on June 28 Lord Raglan died, of whom Fortescue writes : "No commander was ever worse treated, but maltreatment only evoked from him the greater loyalty and the higher standard of duty." (4) On February 26, 1856, an armistice was arranged, and on March 30 hostilities were finally brought to a close by the Treaty of Paris, by which Russia's armaments were strictly limited in the Black Sea ; Bessarabia, obtained by her in 1814, was relinquished ; and the renunciation of all rights of intervention between the Sultan and his  72 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RETO WAR PERIOD OPENS Christian subjects was enforced. Nicholas did not, however, live to experience this humiliation, for he died on March 2, 1855, and was succeeded by his son Alexander II. In all, this uncalled for war cost the Allied Powers 252,600 men, and the Russian not far short of 500,000. In money it cost Great Britain £69,000,000, France £93,000,000 and Russia £142,000,000. By crippling Russia in Europe, the defeat she had sustained induced her to turn her attention to Asia in order to restore her prestige. This was certainly not to the advantage of Great Britain, whose gains from the war were insignificant. Napoleon III had won a silver-gilt glory, all he had aimed at, and at the Peace Conference in Paris he had befriended Russia and opposed England. In Prussia it was believed that he would soon endeavour to overthrow the order established in Europe in 1815, and from about this date, as we shall see in Chapter V, Prussia began to set her military house in order and to prepare for the worst.
