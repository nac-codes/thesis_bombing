"Men," writes one in an awful picture of one of Rose's marches, " began to talk of home and cool shady places and brooks as the hot wind begins to blow over them, parching up every drop  78 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RETO WAR PERIOD OPENS of moisture in the body ; and dogs rush past with great raw wounds like sabre-cuts, caused by the sun, howling for water and shade."

Thus Sir John Adye describes the approach of Sir Colin Campbell's army on Cawnpore on November 28, 1857 : " What with the women and children, the wounded (amounting in all to 2,000 people) and the usual accumulations of camp equipage and stores which are inseparable from an Indian army in the field, his line of march extended for about twenty miles ; and when the strings of elephants, camels, bullock-waggons palanquins, etc., began to cross the bridge of boats the following day, the scene was more like the emptying of Noah's ark than anything else."

Though, on February 17, 1858, it gave the British Army khaki uniform, it effaced from its memory the reverses of the Crimea and so had a reactionary influence on British military revival. Scarcely had it terminated than further trouble occurred in China which, in 1859, resulted in the French looting the Summer Palace in Pekin.

On January 14 an attempt on the life of the French Emperor was made by Orsini, and though it failed it had a strange influence on the political situation. As the plot had been hatch
