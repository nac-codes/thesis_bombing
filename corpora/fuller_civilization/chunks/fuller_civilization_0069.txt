PROGRESS IN THE ART OF WAR This war is noted as the first in which railways were extensively used for troop movements, and also as the first in which use was made of rifled cannon, the smaller fragmentation of its shells proving more effective than the old spherical ones. As the Austrian Lorenz rifle was a superior weapon to the French Mini√©, Louis Napoleon had instructed his troops that " arms of precision are only dangerous at a distance. They will not prevent F  82 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RET WAR PERIOD OPENS the bayonet being, as in former days, the terrible weapon of the French infantry," (21) At Solferino, according to Marshal Niel, " So long as it was a musketry fight I lost ground, owing to the enemy's advantage in numbers.
