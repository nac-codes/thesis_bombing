In this fight, which took place almost under the entrenchments of Washington, the Confederate Govern- ment unwittingly started out on an admirable strategy ; for the rout of the Federal forces so terrified Lincoln and his ministers that for more than two and a half years the security of Washington obsessed the Northern political brain to such an extent that it distorted the whole of the Union strategy in the East.
