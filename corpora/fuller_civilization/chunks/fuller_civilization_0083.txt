d an aspect similar to that seen fifty years later in north-eastern France. Thus did the defensive grow in& strength. Colonel Lyman writes : " Put a man in a hole and a good battery on a hill behind him, and he will beat off three times his number, even if he is not a good soldier ; "(8) and Frank Wilkeson, a private soldier, says : " Before we left North Anna I discovered that our infantry were tired of charging earthworks.

Here is a graphic description by Colonel Lyman of a " 1914" battle fought in 1863 : " I had taken part in two great battles, and heard the bullets whistle both days, and yet I had scarcely seen a Rebel save killed, wounded or prisoner !

The great art is to conceal men ; for the moment they show, bang, bang, go a dozen cannon, the artillerists only too pleased to get a fair mark. Your typical ' great white plain,' with long lines advancing and man≈ìuvring, led on by generals in cocked hats and by bands of music, exist not for us. Here it is, as I said : ' Left face-prime-forward !'-and then wrang wr-rang, for three or four hours, or for all day, and the poor bleeding wounded streaming to the rear.
