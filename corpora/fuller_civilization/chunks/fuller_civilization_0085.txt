His know- ledge enables him to place his fingers on the pulse of war, yet he cannot count its heart beats, nor can he diagnose its fever. He is blind to the reality of rifle warfare ; yet, though he wrote the above in 1884, he was no blinder than the majority of generals of thirty years later, or many of to-day. The rifle bullet utterly changed tactics, and unless this is understood all knowledge is a blank, or worse-a danger. MILITARY INVENTIONS It is, however, in the realm of military inventions that this war is so extraordinarily modern. In the half century preceding it what do we see ? Eli Whitney's cotton gin (12) transforming the South; Fulton's steamships plying the waters of the Hudson, Delaware, Ohio and Mississippi ; railways developing apace between 1840 and 1860 ; the electric telegraph established in 1844, and McCormick's reaper conquering the prairies of the West.

To the sorrow of many a Southern beauty it was speedily captured, " the meanest trick of the war," so says General Taliaferro. (13) Explosive bullets are mentioned, and in June, 1864, General Pendleton asked the Chief Ordnance Officer at Richmond whether he could supply him with " stink-shell " which would give off " offensive gases" and cause " suffocating effect." The answer he got was ". . . stink-balls, none on hand ; don't keep
