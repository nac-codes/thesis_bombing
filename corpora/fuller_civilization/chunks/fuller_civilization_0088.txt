able early in 1861, to put into the field, in addition to their volunteers, one Army Corps of regular troops, the war would have ended in a few months." Surely one army corps in the continent of America, confronted by the riflemen of the South, would in a few weeks have met the fate of Braddock and his Regulars on  100 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION the Monogahela in 1755, or of Lord Percy and his Red Coats at Lexington twenty years later. Moltke, however, did recognize this : " That the fire of stationary troops was so much more effective than that of troops advancing that it would be well to combine as far as possible a tactical defensive with a strategical offensive," (20) and Havelock suggested (21) reducing the British infantry and forming a body of 7,890 mounted riflemen on the pattern of those used during this war.

Yet during these years some progress was made. In 1862 Henri Dunant, a Genevese philanthropist, published a book entitled Un Souvenir de Solf√©rino in which he described the sufferings of the wounded. It was this book which resulted in the assembly of a conference at Geneva in 1863, and the signing of the first Geneva Convention, on August 22, the following year.

Whilst on one of his inspections he met a gentleman in the passage and asked him what hour he usually came to his duty. "' Oh !' said the gentleman in reply, 'I usuall
