In 1858 Frederick William IV of Prussia was becoming totally insane, and Prince William, who was born in 1797 and had been present at the battle of Arcis-sur-Aube in 1814, a soldier by instinct and education, became regent. On January 2, 1861, as King William I of Prussia, in his speech from the throne, he said : " The Prussian Army will, in the future, also be the Prussian Nation in Arms."
