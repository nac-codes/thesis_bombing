The horse was tied to a post, the Com- mittee standing on one side. The fuse was lit, where- upon the horse, somewhat startled, turned round, pointing the muzzle at the heads of the interested spectators.

Imbued with the III spirit of Clausewitz they examined the war in the light of his doctrines. In 1869, Moltke issued a series of Instructions for Superior Commanders of Troops. In them we read : " Very large concentrations of troops are in themselves a calamity. The Army which is concentrated at one point is difficult to supply and can never be billeted ; it cannot march, it cannot operate, it cannot exist at all for any length of time : it can only fight.
