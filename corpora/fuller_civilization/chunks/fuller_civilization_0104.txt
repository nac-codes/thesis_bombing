wrecked even more rapidly ; for, on July 16-17, the Southern German States threw in their lot with Prussia and so annulled at one stroke the French triumphal march inco Bavaria. The Prussian forces were organized in three armies : The First, General Steinmetz, 60,000 ; the Second, Prince Frederick Charles, 131,000; and the Third, the Crown Prince, 130,000, and a general reserve of 63,000. On July 22 the French Army, about 250,000 strong, organized in seven corps and the Guard stretched from Belfort to Strassburg, still awaiting transport and supplies. A word must now be said as regards armaments, especially because this was the first war in which breech- loader was to meet breech-loader, a war in which " killing by accident " was to become more important than " killing by intention."

In brief, the French rifle tactics were based on long range fire, so that the superiority of the chassepot might be fully developed ; then to dig in, await the enemy, and crush him by fire before attacking with the bayonet. These tactics compelled Moltke to assume the tactical offensive, which he had hoped to avoid, and he generally did so by holding his enemy's front and simul- taneously attacking a flank. Every tactical group from the company upwards was instructed to remain always on the offensive so as to give the French no breathing space-to hold by fire, attack by fire, outflank by fire and never cease fighting. BATTLES AND SIEGES The campaigns which now opened may be divided into two main periods : that between the declaration of war and the fall of the French Empire, and that under  WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION 116 RETO CONSOLIDATION OF GERMANY the Third Republic. Both of these periods may be divided into two series of operations : the first into the battles of the frontier and the overthrow of the French Army, and the se
