LIDATION OF GERMANY the Third Republic. Both of these periods may be divided into two series of operations : the first into the battles of the frontier and the overthrow of the French Army, and the second-the sieges of Paris, Metz, etc., and the people's war. From the beginning the only hope of a French success lay in so rapid an advance that the German mobilization would be upset.

It was a chaotic jumble, and though the French could have massed a superior force they failed to do so. An account of
