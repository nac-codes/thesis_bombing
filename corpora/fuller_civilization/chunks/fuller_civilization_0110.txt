aws." (7) Moltke had hoped that by the end of October he would be " shooting hares at Creisau." Instead, he was hard put to it at Paris. By the end of September the capital was surrounded and Headquarters established at Versailles. Meanwhile the French fortresses, Metz, Belfort, Strassburg, Toul, Verdun and Mézières held out and under their indirect protection thousands and thousands of Frenchmen were enrolled and added to the 500,000 regular soldiers, chiefly recruits and reservists, and 50,000 sailors and marines who were still in the country. The " Défense Nationale " now began in dead earnest, campaigns being waged around Orleans, Le Mans, the Loire, the Sarthe, the Lisaine and about Belfort.

In 1870, as to-day, it was not the political centre only but the greatest road and railway centre in the country. He who holds Paris, it has
