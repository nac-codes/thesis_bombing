Sedan, in its turn, was essentially an artillery battle, a battle in which the German infantry played but a subordinate part. On this question of artillery a German writer says : " It was just the same later on, as regards the Republican levies, whenever the terrain in any way enabled artillery to be used. On every occasion when the infantry fight with its successive efforts was predominantly employed, as at Spicheren, Fifth Corps at Wörth, Third Corps at Vionville, Eighth and Ninth Corps at Gravelotte, the result was the complete dissolution of the body of troops engaged, divisions as well as corps, and extraordinary losses." (10) The reason for this failure in the methodical attack, exept when purely a holding operation, was that fronts had become inviolable, and, as Colin says, " the Germans never succeeded in taking a position by a frontal attack, and still less so the French." (11) So does Boguslawski indirectly say the same thing when he writes : " In the greatest battles of the war, those of Gravelotte and Sedan, the turning tactics came prominently forward "(12) that is, they are by far the more important. As regards the infantry soldier there was little to choose between the courage of French or German. Psychologically, the Frenchman develops his fighting qualities better in attack than in defence, and the German the other way round.
