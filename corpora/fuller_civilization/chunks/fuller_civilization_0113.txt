(13) Hönig more honestly says that when they lost their officers they lost their heads; and Meckel that the German dislikes dispersion, " he is confused by disorder, and by the withdrawal of his accustomed leaders. . . . It is not so with the soldiers of the Latin race." (14) The French, contrary to their instincts, assumed the  WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION 124 RETO CONSOLIDATION OF GERMANY defensive, and made constant use of rifle pits. They generally opened fire at from 1,000 to 1,400 yards, forcing the Germans to seek cover by ground at 400 yards' distance. At Wörth, in order to obtain the fullest rifle effect, the French occupied a forward slope and were pulverised by the German artillery. Under cover of this fire the German infantry advanced, and when within effective range one third of each company extended, the remainder following as supports and reserves in column of sections. The second line was stronger than the third, and advanced in line of company columns at deploying intervals. Once engagement took place, a swaying battle resulted, which, between 400 and 500 yards from the defender, swallowed up all three lines. Neither side ever succeeded in bringing troops in close order into the front line. " On both sides . . . the tactics of the drill ground and of peace manœuvres were completely altered as far as concerns the fire of the masses . . Bayonets were never crossed in the open field, and but seldom in village or wood fights. . . . At Wörth, Mars-la-Tour, and Gravelotte, there was a surging backwards and forwards of the swarms of skirmishers on both sides."

In 1866 the Germans had learnt their lesson, but from this campaign the French learnt nothing. Sedan was the greatest artillery battle of the war ; all the French attacks were brought to a standstill by gun fire, and most of them at
