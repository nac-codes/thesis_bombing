of which was so to balance power in Europe that no nation would be strong enough to exert armed force against her. Militarily threatening none, economically she absorbed all. Then, in 1871, this balance of power was completely upset. Germany, hitherto a corn exporting country, began rapidly to become a manufacturing one. The French indemnity, though at first it dislocated the money markets, enabled her to emulate England. She stepped forth on the road travelled by England over a hundred years before, when the gold of Bengal, seized by Clive, fertilized the British industrial revolution. In 1872 Germany demonetized her silver. This struck at French prosperity, as France, unsupported by Great Britain, was compelled to suspend her bimetallic system, and the result was that shortage of gold forced up commodity prices. Though this affected French trade during the first ten years after the Franco-Prussian War, under the stimulating influence of the Zollverein German industry developed vastly. Then, as it began to feel the competition of a reviving world, in 1879 Bismarck introduced trade protection, but neglected to create a 133 colonial empire capable of absorbing over-production at home. Between the years 1880 and 1891 protection was extended, and what was the result ? The answer is given by Mr. Fullerton when he writes : " The neighbouring nations exercised reprisals. The number of foreign markets diminished. Yet the German population was rapidly increasing. An industrial crisis ensued. Then it was that the Germans began to emigrate in droves. A fresh war might have helped to solve the situation. Instead, Germany decided to alter her economic policy. Between 1891 and 1907, accordingly, she followed the system of signing commercial treaties with the different Powers. Prosperity seemed to return. German manufactures once again launched forth on what appeared to be the route of a magnificent future. Now, instead of exporting her citizens-many of whom even returned from a
