e age of Ghenghis Khan. Between 1870 and 1900 Great Britain acquired 4,754,000 square miles of territory, adding to her population 88,000,000 people : between 1884 and 1900 France acquired 3,583,580 square miles and 36,553,000 people ; and in these same years Germany, a bad last, gained 1,026,220 square miles and 16,687,100 people. There were many other nations besides who acquired land ; but these three examples will suffice to prove the stupendous and rapid progress of this crusade. The three spheres of colonial activity were Africa, the Pacific and China. Almost the whole of the first was partitioned among the European Powers, their respective spheres of influence being determined at the Conference of Berlin, in 1884-85, and by subsequent Conventions. Then the second was absorbed ; and when once the Pacific Islands had been swallowed up the third was attacked. The history of this gigantic movement is of the greatest interest, but I can here give only a very brief outline of it. Bismarck did not want colonies or a fleet, though during the last four years of his supremacy he began to see the necessity for the former. He was willing, however, to back the French colonial policy, because he believed that it would keep French eyes from " staring as if hypnotised into the gap in the Vosges " ; meanwhile Russia looked east and, in 1873, stormed and took Khiva. Great Britain started the business of African partition in 1875, quite unintentionally. To secure the route to India, in November Disraeli bought up the Khedive's shares in the Suez Canal. Then, in 1877, the Transvaal was annexed ; and the Zulu War, which followed in 1879, relieved the Boers of the fear of extermination. As with 135 the American Colonies after 1763, safety at home directly led to the Boers seeking independence, which itself led to the disastrous war of 1880-1881, when, at Majuba Hill, on February 27 of the last-mentioned year, a small force of British soldiers under Sir George Colley was routed.
