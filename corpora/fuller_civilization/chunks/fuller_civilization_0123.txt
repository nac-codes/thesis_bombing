pendence, which itself led to the disastrous war of 1880-1881, when, at Majuba Hill, on February 27 of the last-mentioned year, a small force of British soldiers under Sir George Colley was routed. This war resulted in the Transvaal gaining complete internal self-government, and was a direct cause of the South African War of 1899-1902. No sooner was the first Boer War at an end, than, in September, 1881, the Arabi revolt took place in Egypt. In November, Gambetta, then head of the French Government, invited Great Britain to discuss measures to secure the Khedive. In February the next year his Government fell and this proposal was abandoned, Bis- marck declaring that " Egypt was the Schleswig-Holstein of the two Western Powers," and that " they would in- tervene together and quarrel over the spoils." (3) Though England acted single-handed he was right. On June II, 1882, riots broke out in Alexandria. Great Britain asked France to co-operate with her in re-establishing order, but de Freycinet, now in power, declined, Italy also declining. On July 11 Alexandria was bombarded, and on September 13 Arabi was crushed by General Wolseley at the battle of Tel-el-Kebir. Drawn from Egypt into the Soudan, on January 26, 1885, occurred the Gordon tragedy. The conquest of this vast area was then suspended on account of the Penjeh crisis which arose over a boundary squabble with Russia in Turkestan, and it was not revived until 1896, when the back of the resistance was broken by Sir Horatio Kitchener at the battle of Omdurman on September 2. In 1882 Bismarck was delighted by the turn of events, and France, with the Napoleonic legend behind her, was furious. The result was that the Egyptian quarrel separated the two countries until 1904. In 1886 Great Britain conquered Upper Burma, in 1894 she established a protectorate in Uganda, and in 1895 occurred the Jameson raid into the Transvaal which heralded the South African War.
