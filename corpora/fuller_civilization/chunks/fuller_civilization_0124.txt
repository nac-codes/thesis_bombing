1894 she established a protectorate in Uganda, and in 1895 occurred the Jameson raid into the Transvaal which heralded the South African War.  WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION 136 The year 1881 is as important in French colonial history as in British, for in this year her Majuba was the massacre of Colonel Paul Flatte's expedition by Tuaregs in the Sahara. This same year she established herself in Tunis much to the annoyance of the Italians ; two years later she proclaimed a protectorate in Madagas- car, annexing that island in 1896, after having already annexed Tongking in 1885. In these land-grabbing operations she eventually fell foul of Great Britain ; for, in 1893, a dispute arose over the Siam boundary, which country was only saved from annexation by one side or the other because of the mutual jealousies engendered by their respective expansion policies.
