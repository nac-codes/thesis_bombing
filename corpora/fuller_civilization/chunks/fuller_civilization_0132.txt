THE RUSSO-TURKISH WAR OF 1877-78 Before ending this chapter it is necessary to deal briefly with the only extensive war of this period ; 143 namely, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. Its origin must be sought in the consistent suppression of the spirit of nationalism in south-eastern Europe since 1856. In 1870 all Christians in the Balkan States, coming as they did under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Ecumen- ical Patriarch, were looked upon as Greeks and not as separate races. Then, on March 3, the Sultan Abdul- Aziz by creating the Bulgarian Exarchate laid the founda- tion of a new power which though Christian was no longer Greek ; hence rivalry arose between the Christian races. The immediate cause was an agrarian rising in Herzegovina in 1875. From there the spirit of revolt spread into Bosnia and thence throughout the Balkans. England took little notice of it, Russia was interested ; then incensed by his subservience to Russia, Abdul Aziz was deposed and murdered. He was succeeded by Murad V, who in his turn was deposed and succeeded by Abdul Hamed II in August, 1876. Meanwhile, in June, an insurrection broke out in Bulgaria which was suppressed by the Sultan with atrocious cruelty ; whereupon, on July 2, Serbia and Montenegro declared war on Turkey and were defeated. Thereupon Russia, in spite of the fact that England supported Turkey, resolved to free the Slav races. The result was that on April 24, 1877, war was declared on the Ottoman Empire. The main interest in this war lies in its crudeness. Since the advent of the rifle and the rifled cannon neither Russian nor Turk had learnt anything of war. The Czar's total forces numbered 1,500,000 ; the Turkish maximum being about one-third of this figure. As regards armaments, the Turks were equipped with Krupp breech-loading artillery far superior to the Russian bronze
