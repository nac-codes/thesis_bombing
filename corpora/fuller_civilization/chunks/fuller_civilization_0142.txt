The advance is made by successive rushes followed by a quick fire of short duration. The fighting line reinforced by the reserves, and if necessary by the battalion in second line, gradually reaches to within 150 or 200 metres of the enemy.

The 1895 Regulations answer " Yes " ; consequently whole battalions shoulder to shoulder in single rank lines are called " skirmishing lines," and behind them whole brigades, or divisions, are held back for the decisive attack, and are called " troupes de choc " and " masse de manœuvre."
