" philo- sopher-his name was Ardant du Picq. He had seen much service, and before 1870 he had jotted down his reflections on war in a haphazard way. After the war they were published in book form, were studied and, as we shall see, were turned upside down and converted into a veritable river of death. His philosophy may be outlined by means of quotations. (10) His starting point in war is the human heart as it palpitates on the battlefield.
