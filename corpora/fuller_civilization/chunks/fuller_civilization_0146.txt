lant falls, smashed. The remainder, little encouraged by their reception, disperse automatically or before the least indication of an advance on them. Is this what happens ? Not at all ! The moral effect of the assault worries the defenders. They fire in the air if at all. They disperse immediately before the assailants, who are even encouraged by this fire now that it is over. It quickens them in order to avoid a second salvo." Then a little later on he adds : " It is well known to everybody, to all nations, that the French have never met anyone who resisted a bayonet charge." That all this is complete and unadulterated nonsense a little historical research should have revealed to him. For instance, Marshal Bugeaud says of an attack on the English during the Napoleonic Wars : " The English remained quite silent, with ordered arms, and from their steadiness appeared to be a long red wall. The steadiness invariably produced an effect on the young soldiers. " Very soon we got nearer, shouting ' Vive l'Empereur ! en I57 avant ! à la baïonette !'

At the moment of intense excitement, the English wall shouldered arms, an indescribable feeling rooted many of our men to the spot, they began to fire. The enemy's steady concentrated volley swept our ranks ; decimated, we turned
