t consequently necessary, once this nation has been formed, to continue with the absolute conception ; this oversight led this great soldier into a most astounding error. To prove that any improvement in firearms adds strength to the offensive and that, consequently, the larger a force the stronger it becomes in the attack, he writes on p. 32 : " Nothing is easier than to give a mathematical demonstration of that truth : Suppose you launch 2 battalions against .. You then launch 2,000 men against .. I . . 1,000 With a rifle fire of I shot to a minute, 1,000 defenders will fire With the same rifle, 2,000 assailants will fire 1,000 bullets 2,000 " Balance in favour of the attack .. 1,000 With a rifle firing 10 shots a minute, 1,000 defenders will fire within I minute .. 10,000 With the same rifle, 2,000 assailants will fire . . 20,000 Balance . . 10,000 As you see, the material superiority of fire quickly increases in favour of the attack as a result of improved firearms." (14) Is not this complete lunacy ? To mention one factor only, out of a large number omitted, as the defender offers but one-eighth of the target that the attacker does, the assailants' hits must be reduced by seven- eighths ; therefore, in the above example, the balance against him is 7,500, and not 10,000 in his favour. Carried away by this absurd calculation, he elaborates his doctrine of-" Attack ! attack ! attack ! " He writes : "No victory without fighting. . . . Tactical results are the only things that matter in war. . . . No strategy can henceforth prevail over that which aims at ensuring tactical results, victory by fighting. . . . To make war always means attacking."  160 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RET MYTHS AND REALITIES Having out-Clausewitzed Clausewitz, he out-du Picqs du Picq. He quotes Joseph de Maistre as saying : "' Ã€ battle lost is a battle one thinks one has lost ; for,' he added, ' a battle cannot be lost physically ? ' Therefore, it can only be lost morally. But then, it is
