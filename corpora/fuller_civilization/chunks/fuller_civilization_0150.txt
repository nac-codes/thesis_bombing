s Joseph de Maistre as saying : "' Ã€ battle lost is a battle one thinks one has lost ; for,' he added, ' a battle cannot be lost physically ? ' Therefore, it can only be lost morally. But then, it is also morally that a battle is won, and we may extend the aphorism by saying : A battle won is a battle in which one will not confess oneself beaten."(15) Then a little later on he adds : " The will to conquer : such is victory's first condition." True ; but not the only condition. The fact is that Foch intended to have it both ways : if you attacked with superior numbers you would win ; and if you attacked with superior morale you would win.

He saw clearly enough the - economic nature of war.
