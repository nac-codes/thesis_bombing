Far distant, in the southern extremity of Africa, one man, Cecil Rhodes, the Clive of his age, a man who as a statesman had sprung into prominence during the Bechuanaland annexation of 1884, dreamt of a vast United States of South Africa, an immense British Dominion pushed northwards into Central Africa until its margins struck the confines of the Congo and the Nile.

Then, after vain attempts to gain justice, on October 11, 1899, at five o'clock p.m. came war.
