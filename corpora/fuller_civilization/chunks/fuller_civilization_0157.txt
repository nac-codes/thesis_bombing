were tested on a large scale ; that the theatre of war was spread over 800,000 square miles of undeveloped country ; that railways were few, roads almost non-existent, and that during its two and a half years' duration the British Empire put into the field 450,000 men against an enemy who never numbered more than 40,000 men, out of a possible total of some 90,000. This war cost Great Britain £200,000,000, and it is interesting to realize that the number of rifle rounds expended by her soldiers was 66,000,000, or twice as many as were fired by the Germans during the Franco-Prussian War. As far as casualties are concerned the results were insignificant, the British loss in killed totalled 5,774, and the Boer about 4,000. To understand this war, as to understand the American Civil War, it must never be forgotten that the stronger side, in this case the British, had to subdue a hostile people, and not merely a hostile army. Hence the length of the war and the bitterness it engendered. Exactly a month before war was declared Lord Wolseley had said : " If this war comes off it will be the most serious war England has ever had." (1) These words, though true, were scarcely prophetic, for Great Britain was not only without a foreign friend but her policy of " splendid isolation " had morally so antagonized con- tinental Powers that when war broke out the entire European Press was against her. 167 From the military point of view, her idea as to what such a war entailed was ludicrous. Her War Office had learnt nothing from wars in South Africa. In 1848 Sir Harry Smith with six companies of foot and two of Cape Mounted Rifles had routed 1,000 Boers at Boom- platz, the mounted rifles proving of the greatest value. În 1881 Sir George Pomeroy-Colley, who was killed at Majuba Hill, had said : " The want of good mounted troops told very heavily against us, and our soldiers are not as trained skirmishers and shots as the majority of these Boers, who from their childhood have lived i
