" due to the wide extensions enforced by the magazine rifle and smokeless powder. The old terror of a visible foe gave way to the paralysing sensation of advancing on an invisible one, against whom no weapon could avail, an invisibility which fostered the  170 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RET LAST OF WARS OF EXPANSION suspicion that the enemy was everywhere. A universal terror rather than a localized danger now enveloped the attacker, whilst the defender, always ready to protect himself by some rough earth-work or stone-work, was enabled, on account of the rapidity of rifle-fire, to use extensions quite unheard of in past fighting and so to overlap every frontal attack. Thus, at the battle of Modder River, the Boers extended 3,000 men on a frontage of 7,700 yards ; at Magersfontein, 5,000 men on 11,000, and at Colenso, 4,500 men on 13,200. Yet in spite of this human thinness, these fronts could not be penetrated. The frontal attack, consequently, failed time and again ; for against so mobile a foe it was almost impossible to man≈ìuvre. Soon, however, the British generals began to realize that a mounted enemy must be met by his like, so that whilst his front is held by fire his flanks may be turned and enveloped. Though the cavalry under General French, some 6,000 strong, opened the road to Kimberley by a magnificent charge, in which they broke right through the Boer position at exceedingly small cost to themselves, only one officer and fifteen men being killed and wounded, it was mounted infantry and not cavalry which played the leading part in this war. Shock actions, such as that at Elandslaagte on October 21, 1899, were the exception ; for it was by making use of the horse in outflanking movements and of the rifle when fighting on foot that the most profitable results were obtained. The general lesson of this war is well put in the German Official History, which says : " In South Africa the contest was not merely one between the Bullet and the Bayonet, it was also
