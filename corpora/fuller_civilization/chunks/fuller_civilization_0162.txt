The general lesson of this war is well put in the German Official History, which says : " In South Africa the contest was not merely one between the Bullet and the Bayonet, it was also between the soldier drilled to machine-like movements and the man with a rifle working on his own initiative. . . . War had been proclaimed between rigid formulas and untrammelled healthy common-sense." (8) Inexperience in handling large bodies of men during peace time had " mechanized " the brains of the British Generals, who, being oblivious of the 171 friction and difficulties which arise even during peace man≈ìuvres, looked upon the masses entrusted to them as mechanical contrivances which could be moved forward by a word of command. During this war, which, in spite of all its dissimilarity was on a very small scale a rehearsal for the World War of 1914-18, the British Generals, at least some of them, learnt : that extensions were an essential in the attack ; that discipline must become less mechanical ; that the defence was stronger than the attack, and that envelopment alone could produce profitable tactical results. In Germany, in spite of the highly critical Official History already quoted, the General Staff considered that there was little to be learnt from it, and from General French's charge during the relief of Kim- berley operations they deduced the entirely erroneous conclusion that great cavalry charges were still possible against highly trained European soldiers.
