This was a direct challenge to Japanese expansion, as also was the occupation of the Chinese ports by other European Powers who, in 1894, had been so insistent on the maintenance of the integrity of China. Japan, sup- ported by the alliance with Great Britain, signed in 1902, which protected her from German, French or American interference, though her navy was inferior to the combined Russian fleets and her army less than half the total strength of her enemy's-which numbered 1,000,000 men-decided that the moment had arrived, a moment which might soon pass by, wherein to challenge Russia to single combat.

As long as the first existed she reckoned that Russian reinforcements would be seriously slowed down ; and as regards the second she realized that if she could occupy this ice-free port before the ice-bound port of Vladivostok was open, not
