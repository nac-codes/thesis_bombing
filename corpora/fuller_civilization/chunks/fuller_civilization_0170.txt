true reason for it, which was superiority of artillery fire. Major J. M. Home, a British officer attached to the Japanese Army, was one of the first to realize this. He says : " The denser the formation of infantry when launched to the attack the better, pro- viding the attacking guns can keep down the fire of the defence until they have to cease fire for fear of hitting their own infantry." (12) The true reason, then, is to be found in the superiority of gun fire which compelled 179 the Russians to keep down in their trenches and so slacken their rifle fire, coupled with the fact that the closer an attacker can advance the more nervous the defender becomes. Guns and earthworks are the two main characteristics of this war, and not bayonets and bullets. For though bullet casualties still vastly out-numbered those caused by shell-fire, whenever the guns were well handled (and in this war the quick-firing field-gun was first used), victory in nine cases out of ten was assured. The gun in its turn forced the infantry to entrench, and the entrenched infantry forced the attacking guns to take cover behind sky-lines and make use of indirect laying, that is, of defiladed fire. Defiladed fire demanded telephone communications, trenches demanded wire entanglements, and for enfilading purposes machine-gun fire, whilst cavalry in battle faded out of the picture. There is not one cavalry action of importance recorded ; yet in fairness to this ancient arm it must not be over- looked that the Japanese were but poor horsemen and the Russian Cossacks a mounted canaille. It is true that the bayonet figured more conspicuously than it did in 1870-71. The reasons for this are to be found in the fact that the broken and hilly country often made small surprise attacks possible, and as the plain lands were frequently covered with kaoliang (millet), which grows to a height of from eight to twelve feet, small parties of men and sometimes entire firing lines encountered each other unawares.
