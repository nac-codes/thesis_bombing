s and quarrelsome, they attempted to discover a short cut to a social heaven by building a second tower of Babel, this time founded upon gold. As the nineteenth century passes away we enter an age of contradictions, of blood-red sunsets and glimmer- ing false dawns ; of disquisitions on peace and war, wealth and poverty, socialism and capitalism and this thing and that thing, all girt about and riveted loosely together by ignorance and opportunism, and fused into an amorphous mass by a venal, sensation-loving Press which stood for the spirit of democracy, and did in fact fairly represent it, since it howled for action with one voice and condemned it with the other. It is an age of excessive spending. Thus, in 1872, elementary education in Great Britain cost £1,500,000, in 1908 it cost £16,000,000 ; the cost of the British Army in 1892 was £17,000,000, and in 1906 £29,000,000. 18I  182 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RET TURMOIL OF THE NATIONS From these figures we can clearly deduce one fact, namely that the increased education of the masses does not necessarily tend towards peacefulness. This fact is, I think, supported by history ; for if the period 1814- 1914 is examined it will at once be discovered that during its first forty years there were thirteen wars of import- ance, and during its last sixty, thirty-three. This is scarcely an earnest of the peaceful nature of democracies. Nevertheless, in 1907 the second Peace Conference assembled at the Hague, yet it accomplished so little that two years later Lord Rosebery said ; " Armaments are increasing, this calm before the storm is terrifying." (1) Between 1898 and 1908 the European war budgets rose by £100,000,000, and again between 1908 and 1914 by a similar sum. As expenditure on armaments tended towards war, so did expenditure on social reforms tend towards revolution. Both meant national and inter- national bankruptcy. War, or revolution, which was it to be ? We will attempt to trace the answer to the question.
