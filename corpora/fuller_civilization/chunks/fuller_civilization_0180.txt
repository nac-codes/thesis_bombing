In their Infantry Regulations we read : " At the break of day the fire of the infantry and machine guns in concert with that of the artillery will oblige the enemy to burrow in his trenches. One will thus be able to proceed with the destruction of the obstacles and deliver the assault." (5) The French theory was based on the doctrines of Ardant du Picq : To move forward under controlled fire to 400  188 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RET TURMOIL OF THE NATIONS yards' range, at which point no aimed fire being possible losses will diminish ; then to advance and take the position with the bayonet.

Both believed in the advantages of indirect laying for all guns not immediately supporting the infantry attacker ; but the Germans on the whole disliked defiladed fire, believing that, as their artillery was numerically superior to that of the French, by opening fire .from all guns simultaneously from uncovered positions they would be able the more rapidly to crush their antagonist. The main difference lay in their respective outlooks on the howitzer. After Plevna the Germans had adopted the light howitzer, after Manchuria they adopted the heavy.
