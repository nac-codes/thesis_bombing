, whilst the French did not-they were too intel- ligent. (6) Such were the theories propounded between 1905 and the outbreak of the World War ; and of the two armies it was certainly the German which had learnt most from the Manchurian struggle. Both sides, however, missed the main lesson : The preponderance of the pro- jectile, bullet or shell, on the defensive, and its logical consequence-field entrenchments. Neither could see that on account of the bullet a war between millions instead of hundreds of thousands of men must become a war of entrenchments, and that a war of entrenchments must result in an enormous increase of artillery and of shell ammunition. A French writer says : 189 " In a war between France and Germany we do not anticipate a battle of such a nature [i.e., an entrenched battle]. The fortified places are already quite numerous, and an army that would shut itself up in a permanent defensive position would be inviting destruction. "The defence will always be only temporary and consequently will be made in a position hastily established, which the enemy will have to take quickly otherwise the motives which imposed a temporary defence will have soon ceased and the force on the defensive will pass to the offensive. " Battles in entrenched camps as occurred at Plevna or Mukden will never take place in a war with the French army."(?) This forecast should be compared with M. Bloch's picture given at the end of Chapter VIII. It is also of interest to compare with it the following outline of how the French looked upon the next great European conflict : " The war will be short and one of rapid movements, where manœuvre will play the predominant part ; it will be a war of movement. The battle will be primarily a struggle between two infantries, when victory will rest with the large battalions; the army must be an army of personnel and not of matériel. The artillery will only be an accessory arm, and with only one task-to support the infantry attack. For this
