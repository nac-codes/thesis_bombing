rest with the large battalions; the army must be an army of personnel and not of matériel. The artillery will only be an accessory arm, and with only one task-to support the infantry attack. For this task it will only require a limited range, and its first quality must be its rapidity of fire, to admit of it engaging the manifold and transitory targets which the infantry will disclose to it. The obstacles which one will meet in the war of movement will be of little importance ; field artillery will have sufficient power to attack them. In order to follow as closely as possible infantry to be supported, the equipment must be light, handy, and easy to manœuvre. The necessity for heavy artillery will seldom make itself felt ; at all events, it will be wise to have a few such batteries, but these batteries must remain relatively light in order to retain sufficient mobility, which precludes the employ- ment of heavy calibres and powerful equipments. A battery of four 75-mm. guns develops absolute efficiency on a front of 200 metres ; it is consequently unnecessary to superimpose the fire of several batteries. It will serve no useful purpose to encumber oneself with an over-numerous artillery, and it will  190 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RET TURMOIL OF THE NATIONS suffice to calculate the number of batteries that should be allotted to the organization of formations on their normal front of attack."(8) To-day, knowing what we do of the tactics of the World War, it would be difficult to concoct, even as a joke, a more faulty appreciation. THE ECONOMIC BACKGROUND Before turning to the political manœuvres and forays which led up to the World War, I will examine the economic background, not of the world, for that would be too immense a subject for a few brief pages, but of the part of it called Germany. I do so because I believe that since the industrial revolution the foundations of all political actions are economics. The civilization of 1899-1914 was economic, the origins
