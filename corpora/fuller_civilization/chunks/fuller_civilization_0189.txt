wo main characteristics : First, it was a European Civil War ; secondly, it was a World War ; for though it started as a local contest between two nations, the Austrians and the Serbs, who declared war upon each other on July 28, 1914, it rapidly sucked in most of the European Powers and finally nearly all the World Powers. The reason for both these phenomena was one and the same. Since 1871 the political autonomy of nations, which had been a reality during the age of agricultural supremacy, had in fact become a myth. By 1914 few nations remained self-contained or self-supporting ; a new civilization had arisen based on steam power, which demanded for its supremacy international interdependence and not national independence. The world, unseen by the politicians, was fast becoming a vast yet single economic unit in which war for national ends was a disruptive and not a creative force. Directly Austria declared war on Serbia the shock vibrated along every economic and financial channel carrying disruption into the most distant extremities of the world, which since 1871 had largely become a European Empire. If it be granted that the desire of the German people, not necessarily of her Government, was to gain economic dominion over the world (and this, as I have attempted 199 RET  200 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RET GRAND STRATEGY OF THE WAR to show, was the case), then to attain this end, her Government, driven on by this popular urge, must first conquer Europe, and secondly, in order to hold her conquests, not necessarily territorial but economic, she must establish a German outlook among the conquered nations. We get here two governing factors, the first is military and the second is moral, or cultural. The second, which would affect and influence all nations, belligerent and neutral, could only be gained by the first, which included two problems-the command of the land and the command of the sea. Neutral nations, such as the United States and Holland, did not unders
