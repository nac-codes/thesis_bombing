Dutch still protested against the blockade policy of the Entente, until, on May 1, the inevitable happened : S.S. Gulflight, a U.S.A. merchantman, was torpedoed without warning. If this were not bad enough, on May 7 Germany perpetrated one of those mad acts which showed how completely she was out of touch with world opinion : the Lusitania was sunk off Queenstown, and American sentiment began to veer definitely towards the Entente. This, to the foreseeing, was the beginning of the end, for it was a moral and political German defeat of the first order. Not only was this use of the submarine a political blunder, but also a naval one, for the simple reason that Germany did not possess sufficient submarines to gain decisive results, and once this campaign was launched, complete surprise was at an end. Whilst Germany thus aimed at obtaining an economic decision by underwater attack on her enemies' com- merce, England and France, possessing as they did 207 surface command of the sea, extended their blockade policy by changing their military object. On December 30, 1914, the Grand Duke Nicholas, Commander-in Chief of the Russian Armies, had suggested to the British Government an expedition against the Turks in order to ease the Russian situation in the Caucasus, which had been brought about by Turkey entering the war (October 29, 1914). The upshot of this was that, on January 13, the British War Council considered a naval attack on the Dardanelles, and, on the 28th, the British Government decided in its favour. A naval bombardment was opened on February 19, repeated on March 18, and the Entente forces landed on April 25 and 26. Concurrently with these events, the army in Mesopotamia was re- inforced, and the Battle of Shaiba took place on April 12 to 14. In these operations we see the beginnings of that encircling policy by which, by laying siege to the Central Powers and Turkey, it was hoped to reduce them to surrender through starvation instead of by direct attack.
