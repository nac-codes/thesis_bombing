see the beginnings of that encircling policy by which, by laying siege to the Central Powers and Turkey, it was hoped to reduce them to surrender through starvation instead of by direct attack. They were destined to fail, because they were strategically, tactically and politically unsound ; because the steamship working on exterior lines cannot compete with the railway working on interior lines ; because the submarine was restricting more and more the use of surface craft ; because the Entente Powers did not possess sufficient man-power or resources for this colossal siege, and to attempt to undertake it with insufficient forces must lead to a violation of concentration of force. Politically it must inevitably lead to friction. No sooner was the Dardanelles campaign launched than Italy denounced the Triple Alliance (May 4) and declared war on Austria (May 23). This was the result of a secret agreement signed in London between the Italian Government and the Entente on April 26. Already, earlier in the year, the British Government had suggested to Greece and Roumania to enter the war and assist Serbia, but with no results.  RET GRAND STRATEGY OF THE WAR 208 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION During this period we see strategy completely over- ruled by diplomacy which, more and more, aimed at encircling the Central Powers in place of concentrating against some one vital point. On February 23, the island of Lemnos was occupied by British Marines : the Greeks objected to this occupation, but the British' Government pleaded military necessity, the same plea put forward by the Germans when they entered Belgium. This wrangle with Greece and the Balkans led not only to a diplomatic but to a military fiasco. In October Bulgaria entered the war against the Entente ; Entente troops were sent to Salonika, in spite of Greek protests, and in December the evacuation of Gallipoli was begun and was completed by January 8, 1916. From all points of view 1915 was a year of grotesque failure,
