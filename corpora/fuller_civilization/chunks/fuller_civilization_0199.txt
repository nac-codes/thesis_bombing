From all points of view 1915 was a year of grotesque failure, traceable mainly to the change of military and political objectives. The Germans pushed on to Vilna and Pinsk, and yet Russia remained undefeated. On September I Germany acknowledged her submarine error by accepting the limitations of submarine activity laid down by the United States.
