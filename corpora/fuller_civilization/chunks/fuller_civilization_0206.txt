dered that Russia could be supported with profit, and the true meaning of America entering the war was not appreciated. What the Entente Powers lacked was imagination, because they had no single head which could think clearly. Further, the colossal failures of the Verdun and Somme battles, during 1916, might have suggested to them the un- likelihood of Germany, even when rid of Russia, being able to break through the Western Front were it carefully prepared to meet her onslaught. This spring offensive, which was to consist in a dual attack-one from the direction of Arras eastwards, and one from the direction of Rheims northwards-was strategically unsound because the prospective battlefields were too far apart. It was also taccically unsound in that the frontage of each battlefield was too restricted. 215 The Germans smelling out this attack, for lengthy preparation had polluted the air, on February 25 they began to fall back from the river Ancre and by April 5 had completed their retirement to the Hindenburg (Siegfried) line. This strategically threw out of joint the Arras operations ; nevertheless the battle of Arras was launched on April 9 and continued until May 4, during which period the British Army lost 155,000 in casualties. On April 16 the French began the Second Battle of the Aisne which ended, four days later, in a complete fiasco. Out of these quite uncalled for opera- tions some good, however, emerged. On May 15 General Nivelle was succeeded by General PÃ©tain as Commander- in-Chief, and General Foch was made Chief of the General Staff of the French Ministry of War. Thus, what many Conferences had been groping after for over a year was eventually attained through disaster. Failure is always the most expensive of masters ; and later on we shall again meet with this grim pedagogue. One factor of importance which became noticeable during the French offensive was the low point to which French morale had fallen. This was largely due to political intrigue, the
