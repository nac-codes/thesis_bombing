this grim pedagogue. One factor of importance which became noticeable during the French offensive was the low point to which French morale had fallen. This was largely due to political intrigue, the standing curse of the French Army ; also to bad leadership and the terrible casualties suffered in 1916. And yet this lack of morale was made an excuse to continue offensive operations against Germany, and as the French were unable to take a leading part the bulk of the work fell upon the British Army. Thus, I suppose, it was thought that France would, like a phoenix, rise from British ashes. A curious conception. If the Arras-Aisne operations were unnecessary, those in Flanders, between June 7 (when the Battle of Messines opened) and November 10 (when the Battle of Ypres ended), were doubly so. As regards the former, the excuse could be alleged that it was not possible to see how events would turn out in Russia ; but by July 31 (when the Ypres offensive was launched) the Russian summer offensive had petered out and any hope of  216 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RET GRAND STRATEGY OF THE WAR further Russian support had vanished. In place of Great Britain economizing man-power she squandered it. In Flanders she lost nearly 400,000 men killed, wounded and missing as well as some 200 tanks ; in fact, in these operations, the British Army was bled white, and at a period when it was visible to all that Russia must within a few weeks vanish as an ally and that America could not take her place until the summer of 1918. The French, having revived, on August 20 opened a strong offensive at Verdun which dragged on to December 15, and tens of thousands more casualties were piled up. The British, failing at Ypres, launched a new offen- sive at Cambrai on November 20. It opened with a startling success, so startling that no reserves had been assembled to make good the initial penetration. It ended in a startling failure and 75,000 casualties were added to the British total. Meanwhile
