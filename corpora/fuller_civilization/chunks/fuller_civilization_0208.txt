artling success, so startling that no reserves had been assembled to make good the initial penetration. It ended in a startling failure and 75,000 casualties were added to the British total. Meanwhile, Germany settled with Russia. In July, August and September the Russians were hammered from Galicia to the Baltic. On September 15 the Russian Republic was proclaimed ; on November 8 a Bolshevik coup d'Ã©tat was carried out in Petrograd by Lenin and Trotski ; on December 2 hostilities were suspended between the Russian and German armies, and on the 15th of this month the Armistice of Brest-Litovsk was agreed upon, and Russia went out of the war save for some desultory engagements, peace being finally signed on March 3, 1918. At length, after three years' incessant fighting on her Eastern front, Germany gained the first half of her military object. Now she was faced by the second half, the conquest of the French and British Armies. In 1914 she had been confronted by 3,000,000 Frenchmen and 120,000 Englishmen, and yet she had failed. Now she was faced by 3,000,000 Frenchmen, 3,000,000 English- men, and behind these loomed the United States with an easy 6,000,000 more. In 1914 the world was passively on her side, now it was actively against her. Not only had America declared war on her, but the following 217 countries had done likewise : Honduras, San Domingo, Haiti, Greece, Siam, China, Uruguay, Brazil, Ecuador, Panama and Cuba-nothing very great indeed but dependable as weather-cocks. Her submarine campaign had not brought England to heel, and the spirit of her own navy was low ; for on August 3 a serious mutiny broke out at Wilhelmshaven. Yet the Entente was terrified to meet her ; the Italians had bled themselves white in twelve battles on the Isonzo ; Roumania had ceased hostilities, and the British and French armies had lost between them over a million men. These are, I think, the true reasons, for fear is both the parent and offspring of failure. If 1915 was a year
