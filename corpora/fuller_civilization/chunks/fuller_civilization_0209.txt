hostilities, and the British and French armies had lost between them over a million men. These are, I think, the true reasons, for fear is both the parent and offspring of failure. If 1915 was a year of diplomatic blunders, 1917 was indeed, on the part of France and Great Britain, a year of military mistakes. Yet all this blundering can be traced to one definite cause, the lack of a thinking head. As the failure of the spring offensive produced Foch, so did the failure of the autumn offensive produce some semblance of unity. On November 7 an Ã…llied Confer- ence was held at Rapallo and a Supreme War Council was agreed upon.

Then, she had two problems : the first, military-the defeat of the Entente Powers ; the second, political-the maintenance of world opinion on her side. Now that she had smashed Russia she was left facing not only the Western Front but also the Italian. Macedonian and Mesopotamian fronts ; and behind all these fronts st
