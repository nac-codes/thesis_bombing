Macedonian and Mesopotamian fronts ; and behind all these fronts stood an angry hostile world in place of neutral nations expecting to grow rich on the turmoil of the war. If the problem of the Western Front had been too hard a nut to crack in 1914, it was many times harder now. In fact there remained but one rational course open to Germany, and that was to hold her Western Front, perhaps to strike at some economic or political objective, but above all to pander to President Wilson's highbrowed idealism by forcing her enemies to attack her in place of attacking them, and so show the world that she was solely fighting for her life, and not for dominion over others, and that she would accept a just peace even if by it she were slightly crippled. Was there any inkling that such a policy would have succeeded ?

Such an objective stared
