ce, she should have selected an economic objective, the capture of which would have adversely affected French politics and so have prepared France to consider terms of peace. Such an objective stared her in the face, namely, the Bruay coalfields ; but instead of attacking these, she selected the worst possible strategical point- the junction of the Franco-British armies, a point towards which the total French and British reserves could be rushed from either flank without mutual inter- ference. The success of this attack was mainly due to the fact that the British Army of 1917 had been bled white in Flanders during the summer and autumn of that year. The causes officially alleged were subsidiary to this paramount cause. The Somme offensive of March and April, 1918, was the coping stone of the work of the British higher command at Ypres, which cost another 90,000 men. In place of following up the initial tactical success of March 21 with a determined attack on the British Third Army in order to gain the Bruay coalfields which were vital to France, the German Armies followed the line of least resistance, and, through lack of communications and, consequently, of supply, their attack petered out on April 5, a few miles east of Amiens. Then in place of hitting at a vital spot, however tough, they committed the deadly tactical sin of looking for a soft spot, and the result was the Battle of the Lys which, beginning on April 9 lasted to April 29, during which the Germans exhausted their reserves and placed themselves in an all but untenable pocket. Then they looked for another soft spot, and on May 27 found it between Soissons and Rheims. The battle fought here, known as the Third Battle of the Aisne, brought the German forces right down to Ch√¢teau Thierry, and another pocket, this time a veritable trap, was formed in which the last of the great German offensives flickered out. When we examine these battles we see quite clearly that the German tactical gains were the measur
