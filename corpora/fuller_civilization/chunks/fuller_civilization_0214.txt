Unity of command on the side of the Entente Powers, backed by superiority of man-power and weapon-power and supported by the will of the world, led to final victory.

On October 31 revolution broke out in Vienna and Budapest, and on November 7 Bavaria proclaimed herself a Republic.

There can be no doubt that the German Armies were beaten, that her fleet was bea
