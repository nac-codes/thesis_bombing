d to Germany's proposal for an armistice, and on the 11th it was signed on French soil ; that is the significant point. There can be no doubt that the German Armies were beaten, that her fleet was beaten, that her allies were beaten, and that her own people were beaten ; yet the Allied Powers won only a physical victory and they did not win a moral one. To effect such a victory demanded an unconditional surrender on the part of Germany.

THE INNER STRUGGLE IN this world there is a reason for all things. In every set of circumstances there lurks an uninevitable destiny.

These were : That democracy stood for economic nationalism. whilst commerce, unseen by the men of mercantile mind, stood for economic interdependence ; that democracy gorged itself upon quantity, whilst science sought after quality, not brute force but economy of force, not ever- growing numbers but a deeper and a deeper truth. Science, the urge of Western civilization, which knew no bound
