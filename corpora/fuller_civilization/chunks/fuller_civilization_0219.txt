itary monks, though they swung incense before the moral factors, were so immersed in the scholasticism of dead wars that they forgot that the soldiers who were to fight in the next war were living beings dreading death, yet willing to face battle as long as facing it did not mean wilful suicide. In August 1914, the German armies, without reserves, were drawn up in phalangial formation from Aachen to Basle. Their right was to wheel through Belgium, round Paris, and then advance eastwards sweeping the armies of France into Germany and Switzerland.

Instead of holding their frontiers lightly and assembling their reserves there, and then, as the enemy's three hundred mile long phalanx began to twist out of shape as it inevitably must, striking in strength,what did they do ? They concen- trated the bulk of their forces on the frontier, with a reserve army close in rear, their intention being to penetrate the phalanx, break it in half, and so dislocate it ! M. Bloch, the Polish banker, now comes in.
