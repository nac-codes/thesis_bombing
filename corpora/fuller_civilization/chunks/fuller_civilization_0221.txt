fired ; for those at the Battle of Arras, in 1917-2,000,000, and for those at the Third Battle of Ypres, the same year -4,300,000 ! At this last-mentioned battle the shells fired during the preliminary bombardment, that is before 229 the infantry attack began, weighed 107,000 tons and cost approximately Â£22,000,000, a figure nearly equal to the total yearly cost of the pre-war British Home Army ! Did this inundation of iron lead to victory ? No; it could not possibly do so ; for in the process of digging up trenches by shell fire, everything in the neighbourhood of the trenches was dug up. Roads vanished, tracks vanished, railways vanished, and the surface of the ground vanished under the influence of the material earthquake to which all things were subjected. The enemy was slaughtered-true. But though he fled, or was exter- minated, an impassable area was created, which in swampy districts, such as Flanders, or when it rained, were turned into a morass of mud. In place of accelerating infantry movement, every shell that fell impeded this all necessary act of winning the war by force of arms. Further still, as these bombardments lasted from seven to twenty-one days, surprise became impossible. The result was colossal slaughter. For example : The battles of the Somme in 1916, and of Ypres in 1917, cost the British Army in killed, wounded and missing over 800,000 men. Yet on the Eastern Front the casualties were still heavier. Before the first year of the war was out the Russian armies had lost 4,000,000 men. In 1917, Brusilov's armies lost 375,000 men in twenty-seven days, and, as I have already mentioned, 1,000,000 men in three months ! " In my own opinion, the monopoly of strategy and tactics by shell bludgeoning prolonged the war in place of shortening it. It dulled the imagination of the higher command, who became obsessed by two ideas : Fill the trenches to hold them, and blow them to pieces to capture them. . . . As the brain-power of the opposing armies grew
