some semblance of order ; yet no Government appeared to realize that the attack by lies besmirched its own future, because the poles of the magnet which must attract all neutrals worth attracting are straight-fighting and straight-speaking. 235 After all, is it not to the advantage of the world that the " cleanest " nation should win ?- That is common sense. Fortunately, the moral, or immoral, attack did not halt here. The bullet had driven the soldier into his trench, and the shell had failed to dig him out. Then it was that the Germans, adopting Lord Dundonald's idea, replaced steel particles by gas particles, so that an entire battlefield, and all the targets included in it, either above ground or below, might be hit. The first gas attack took place on April 22, 1915, in which the Germans made two cardinal mistakes : First, they did not use enough to win a decisive battle, and secondly, they used a lethal gas-chlorine-which was unnecessary, because the Hague Convention had not forbidden the use of gases of a non-toxic nature. The result of this unexpected form of attack was that the traditional soldier was horrified. He pronounced gas warfare to be the invention of the Devil, and forthwith went into partnership with his Satanic Majesty. The horrors of gas warfare were well advertised, and as usual the anathema pronounced upon it was absurd- in fact public opinion on any vital subject is always wrong, because it generalizes the views of the most ignorant. Here are the true facts : In the American Army the total casualties were 274,217. Of these 74,779, or 27.3 per cent., were due to gas.

Out of the 86 men totally blinded during the war only 4 were blinded by gas, and " in the year 1918 there were one and a half times as many cases of tuberculosis per thousand among all Ameri
