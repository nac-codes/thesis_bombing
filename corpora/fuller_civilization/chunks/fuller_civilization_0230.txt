Here was a means of not only attacking the war makers them- selves, but of establishing a condition of treachery which was likely to prove overwhelming. This method of attack, a method endowed with the power of bringing a war to a rapid termination and thereby vastly reducing the destructive nature of war, was in its turn anathematized. Nations refused to see that if they would continue to practise absolute warfare, that is, if they refused to shake off the democratic idea of " the nation in arms," then to attack the war-workers, whether they were men or women, was as justifiable an act as to attack the fighting-men themselves. In 1918 France had in the field an army of close upon 3,000,000 men, but this army would have proved utterly useless unless the 1,700,000 workers employed in her war industries 237 remained at work. During 1917 the French armies required 225,000 field-gun shells a day. They wanted these shells to kill Germans with. The men and women who made them (and there were 900,000 employed in this work) were as deeply concerned in the problem of killing as the French gunners themselves. If two men go into partnership, one making a knife for the other to cut somebody else's throat with, by the law of every civilized country both will be convicted of murder. In the days of kingly wars it was barbarous to slaughter the civil population, because the people stood outside the quarrel. But in democratic wars the people instigate the quarrel, they are the quarrellers who hire assassins to do the grim work for them. Afraid to commit murder they are afraid of being murdered. The long and the short of the matter is that " a nation in arms " or " a nation in arsenals " is obviously a legitimate war target ; and the oftener a bull's-eye is scored on it the sooner will the war be over. In the moral attack, as waged under the conditions imposed by democratic warfare, one side of the problem is to hit the civilian in order to terrify him, the other is to stop the sold
