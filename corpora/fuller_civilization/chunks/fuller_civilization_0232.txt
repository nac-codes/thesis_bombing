from bullets, and his suggestion is to carry forward " thin iron shields capable of protecting the gunners against infantry fire " in " one or possibly two carriages to each battery," the shields being made in sections. " Then the artillery might calmly await any attack whatever, certain to destroy an enemy long before he could reach the guns. All anxiety as to capture would be extinguished, and we might proceed to build up a system of tactics based upon the supposition that artillery will not need to run away from anything in front of it. . . . " "If two lines of artillery were contending against each other, surely the side which was safe from shrapnel bullets and the infantry fire of the other side ought to overwhelm its antagonists. . . . " If we can prevent nine-tenths of the loss in killed and wounded, and nearly all risk of capture, we can afford to disregard accidents. . ." "As surely as ships of war can carry iron plates sufficient for defence against heavy guns, so surely can field artillery carry sufficient protection against the fire of infantry and shrapnel bullets. . . . " " The fire of infantry has become so formidable of late years that defensive measures must inevitably be adopted sooner or later by field artillery. . . " "If . . . we add the use of defensive armour which can be carried by artillery and cannot be carried by cavalry and infantry, a power will be created which must seriously modify the tactics of the battle- field. The development is as sure to come as the day to RE CHANGING NATURE OF WAR 239 follow the night. We may hope that England will set the example instead of following other nations." (9) This idea was realized by the English on September 15, 1916, when tanks advanced over the battlefield of the Somme. Brackenbury saw clearly that " Moral effect is the object aimed at in a battle, for the killed and wounded have no influence on the final retirement." (10) He saw as Frederick the Great had seen " that to advance is to conquer,"
