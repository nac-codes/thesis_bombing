" Moral effect is the object aimed at in a battle, for the killed and wounded have no influence on the final retirement." (10) He saw as Frederick the Great had seen " that to advance is to conquer," because of the terrifying moral effect of a continuous advance. This was the underlying idea of the " bayonet school " of military thought, an idea pre- eminently sound, but in the circumstanes impossible. The " shell school " of 1914-1917 never grasped this idea ; it could not, or did not, see that the problem was not to reduce the enemy's position to mud and rubble but to advance the guns under hostile rifle and machine gun fire ; and that. could such an advance be made, it would prove not overwhelmingly destructive, but over- whelmingly demoralizing. This is exactly what the tank- mobile armoured artillery-accomplished and proved. On the first day (July 1) of the Battle of the Somme, in 1916, a battle fought according to the doctrines of the " shell school," British casualties numbered close upon 60,000. On the first day (August 8) of the Battle of Amiens, in 1918, the most decisive battle of the war, a battle fought according to the doctrines of the " tank school," British casualties were slightly under 1,000 and the Germans captured exceeded the numbers of German killed by thousands. " During July, August, September, October and November, 1916, the British Army lost approximately 475,000 men, it captured 30,000 prisoners and occupied some 90 square miles of country. During the same months in 1917 the losses were 370,000, the prisoners captured were 25,000, and the ground occupied was about 45 square miles. In July, August, Sep- tember, October and November, 1918, the losses were 345,000, the prisoners captured 176,000, and the ground occupied was 4,000 square miles. If now we divide these losses by the number of square miles captured, we shall obtain a rough estimate of  240 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION casualties per square mile gained. These figures are approxi-
