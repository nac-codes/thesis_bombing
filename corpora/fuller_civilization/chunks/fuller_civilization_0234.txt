now we divide these losses by the number of square miles captured, we shall obtain a rough estimate of  240 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION casualties per square mile gained. These figures are approxi- mately as follows : ( a ) July to November, 1916 : 475,000 + 90 sq. miles = 5,277 casualties per sq. mile. July to November, 1917 : (b) 370,000 + 45 sq. miles = 8,222 casualties per sq. mile. ( c ) July to November, 1918 : 345,000 - 4,000 sq. miles = 86 casualties per sq. mile. In the third period alone were tanks used efficiently."(11) The " tank school," the brain of which was the Tank Corps General Staff, never ceased to think in terms of the moral attack; not because they were kindly disposed to the enemy but because they realized that this was the most economical and decisive form of attack. In 1917 they suggested carrying machine gunners in large tanks through the enemy's battle front and depositing them in rear of it. Why ? Because the rear is the morally weakest point in the enemy's battle body. In 1918 they again suggested passing high-speed tanks through the enemy's battle front and attacking the enemy's command headquarters in rear. Why ? Because a shot through the brain paralyses the body and leads to a moral débâcle. This suggestion was accepted by Marshal Foch as the basic idea of his 1919 plan of campaign. Then came the armistice and back came the " bayonet school " into its own. In the 1924 edition of the British Field Service Regulations we read : " Infantry is the arm which in the end wins battles. . . . The rifle and the bayonet are the infantryman's chief weapons. The battle can be won in the last resort only be means of these weapons." RE CHAPTER XIII THE INFLUENCE OF THE WAR UPON THE WORLD ORDER, 1914-1932 The Apotheosis of Nationalism.
