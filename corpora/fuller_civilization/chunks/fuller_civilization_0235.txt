olution. The Chaos of Europe. Disarmament. War and Civilization. THE APOTHEOSIS OF NATIONALISM WAS Europe to become a satrapy of Germany as Asia and Africa had become satrapies of Europe ? This was the question in 1914, and the answer, as we have seen, was " No." In the name of national liberty the war was declared, and in the name of the self-determination of nations it was concluded ; for the war ended in the creation of eight new nations, namely, Hungary, Czecho- Slovakia, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia, Finland, and Albania ; whilst Serbia, now Yugo-Slavia, Roumania and Greece added vastly to their size, and France, Italy, Denmark and Belgium to a lesser extent to theirs.

The British Commonwealth of 1914 had ceased to exist, just as the Europe of 1914 had ceased to exist. A rampant nationalism had swallowed them both, and had digested them into groups of separate nations, fearful of their individual weaknesses and jealous of their
