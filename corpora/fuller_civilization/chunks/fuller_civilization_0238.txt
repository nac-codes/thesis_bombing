To the Occidental, battles are business  244 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RE INFLUENCE UPON WORLD ORDER operations, to Orientals-straws of fate pointing which way the storms of power are drifting. The war between China and Japan in 1894 showed the superiority of European military organization over Asiatic; the war in South Africa showed that even a poorly armed people endowed with the spirit of freedom can become a formidable antagonist.
