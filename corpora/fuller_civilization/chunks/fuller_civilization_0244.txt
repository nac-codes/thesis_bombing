of going to war unless against an equally weak nation, or unless it is allied to an industrial neighbour, or supplied with arms from outside. As a matter of fact few even of the greatest industrial nations are even from the military point of view self- supporting. For example : " During the last war, the German headquarters was in need of aluminium for the bodies of its Zeppelins and of carburet of cyanamide for its explosives. At the same time the French dis- covered that the Allied factories could not manufacture magnetos comparable with those of the German factories, which meant inferiority for French aeroplanes. The result was that Switzerland imported magnetos from Germany far beyond its needs and from France quantities of bauxite and cyanamide for which the country itself had no use." (4) With weak industrial Powers the situation is more astonishing still, for their instruments of national defence lie outside their own control, and because of this the great industrial Powers use these nations as diplomatic weapons. For example : in 1920 British interests demanded that the Turks should be kept away from the Bosphorus, and French interests demanded that the Turks should be propitiated so that French interests in Syria might be consolidated. What happened ? The two Governments turned their backs ; meanwhile the firm of Vickers, on credit, supplied arms and munitions to the Greeks, and the firm of Creusot, on credit, supplied arms and munitions to the Turks. The  250 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RE INFLUENCE UPON WORLD ORDER result was the Gr√¶co-Turkish War of 1921-1922; a war not only between Greeks and Turks, but also between French and British diplomacy, in spite of the fact that both nations were still bound together by the Entente Cordiale ! Such actions as these are unrealized by the masses of the people, for common man is too simple and indolent to unravel diplomatic tangles. The masses do not notice such " coincidents " as that on the day upon which the A
