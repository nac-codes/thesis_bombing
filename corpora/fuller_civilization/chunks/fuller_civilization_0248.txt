aralysis only, but also universal chaos. War between nations will almost certainly be followed by war within nations; that is, civil war, in which the sufferings of the people will in most cases be beyond description. As long as wars continue, and they must continue until their causes are eliminated, the only military solution to this problem is to shorten their length. This means that in military organization quality must replace quantity. To-day nations are obsessed by a neurotic dread of numbers, yet in modern warfare numbers are 253 actually a detriment, for the larger the population, or the mass of troops, the larger the target for the enemy to hit at. It is in the quality of arms and not in the quantity of men that the solution to this problem must be sought. In this light it will at once be seen that qualitative disarmament is its antithesis. To scrap the newer weapons is to prolong wars ; to prolong a war is to commit national suicide whilst temporarily insane- perhaps this is what an all-wise Providence desires. But, as I have already pointed out, the true war potential is the equivalent of the peace potential, because war being a continuation of peace policy in another form, it draws its strength from peace industry. The generating plant for war energy in Europe lies within the area Stockholm, Danzig, Cracow, Budapest, Florence, Bar- celona, Bilbao, Glasgow, Bergen and thence to Stockholm; for within this circle lie " all the large coal mines, all the large metallurgical industries, all the large chemical industries, all the large factories of electrical material and railway material, all the big naval dockyards, etc." (0) In Russia the war power-station lies in the Don valley and the Caucasian oil-fields ; and in America in the area Boston-Chicago-St. Louis-Baltimore. These facts are unalterable, for they are acts of God. Even if it were desirable, how can qualitative dis- armament be made a reality ? Bombing aeroplanes are built in the same workshops as
