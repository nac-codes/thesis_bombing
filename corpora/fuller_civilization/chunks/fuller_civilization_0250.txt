an alliance of states, and unless this alliance possesses a peace potential capable of fulfilling the demands of scientific warfare, warfare of this nature cannot be waged at all. Until this climax arises, or until the causes of war are eliminated, wars will and must continue, paradoxically as it may seem, for the advancement of mankind ; for if man will not eliminate the causes of war, which are social and economic diseases, they can only be eliminated by wars which will teach him the deadliness of their nature. What will future warfare then be like ? It will include many strange contradictions, so strange that unless we have thought them out beforehand we shall be utterly surprised. War will be absolute in the extreme, for whole nations will be besieged ; yet there will be no front of operations, fronts will be everywhere. Again, there will not be one war but two wars, the first waged against the enemy's armies, and the second against his civil population ; the former becoming more and more humane, and the latter more and more brutal, as happened in the Middle Ages. It is at the moral and industrial centres that the main RE INFLUENCE UPON WORLD ORDER 255 blows will be struck, and not so much at military power itself, because military power is founded upon the civil will and upon civil industry, and to attack an army at its foundations is a more certain way of destroying its power than by removing its roof tile by tile. Cities and towns will consequently have to be protected and defended as they were in the Middle Ages, and the people disciplined for war in order to shield themselves against the main weapon of the attacker-their own panic. They must not only be physically disciplined as soldiers are in order to maintain order during a crisis, but mentally disciplined so that they may withstand the corrosive effects of propa- ganda ; for every human achievement will be distorted by the enemy to further his war ends. Wars will in fact largely become armed propaganda
