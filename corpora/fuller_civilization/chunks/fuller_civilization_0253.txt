or Hersch writes : " War kills not only directly, on the battle-field or as the result of wounds or diseases contracted by the soldiers in the course of hostilities, but also indirectly by causing an increase of mortality among the civilian population of the belligerent countries and even in many neutral countries." (1) The reason for this is not far to seek ; it is due to industrial and commercial disturbances. Hersch further writes : " The fact that war kills not only in the belligerent countries but also in the neutral countries . . . had already been noted during the great wars of the nineteenth century. Thus, during the war year 1866 the increase in the number of deaths was 11,000 in Holland and 29,000 in Belgium. The increase in the number of deaths as a result of the war of 1870-71 was 47,000 in Holland, 55,000 in Belgium and 23,000 in Switzerland. Furthermore, it may be noted that the highest number of deaths was observed in all three of these countries precisely during war years, when all three had remained neutral (except Belgium during the World War). Thus in Holland the number of deaths has only four times exceeded 100,000 and all four correspond to war years, namely, in 1859 (103,067 deaths), in 1866 (101,854), in 1871 (106,978) and in 1918 (with 115,440 deaths). In Switzerland the highest number of deaths (not given for the whole country before 1867) are those of 1870 (72,838 deaths), 1871 (77,998) and 1918 (75,034). Similarly in Belgium the highest figures correspond to the years 1866 (151,116), 1871 (145,746) and 1918 (157,340). At the time of the World War, owing to its extent, the circle of neutrals affected by it was naturally much enlarged. It was observed, for instance, that the maximum of deaths recorded for Sweden for a century and  258 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RE FOUNDATIONS OF INTERNATIONALISM a half belonged to the year 1918 (104,591). The maximum number of deaths ever observed in Norway also corresponded to the year 1918 (43,603) and i
