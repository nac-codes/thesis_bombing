STERN CIVILIZATION RE FOUNDATIONS OF INTERNATIONALISM a half belonged to the year 1918 (104,591). The maximum number of deaths ever observed in Norway also corresponded to the year 1918 (43,603) and in Spain (695,758). . . . The World War . . . claimed nearly 600,000 victims in the neutral countries of Europe alone." (2) The epidemics which have followed every modern war have been still more devastating. Thus, in 1866 the number of combatants killed or died was about 53,000, yet the cholera epidemic carried off 200,000 civilians. In 1870-71 the Germans lost 41,000 soldiers killed and died and the French about 100,000, yet on account of the small-pox epidemic 270,000 German civilians died and 600,000 French. Finally we come to the influenza epidemic of 1918, which clearly shows how international the effects of war have become. It swept over the entire world killing at least 15,000,000 people. Tube Tuberculosis also swept throughout the world, but more particularly in the blockaded countries. In Germany it rose above its peace level by 61 per cent. and in Austria by 67 per cent. ; yet in Holland it also rose by 50 per cent. The following is an incomplete balance-sheet of the mortality caused by the War : (8) Continent Military Civilian Total Europe .. 12,637,000 12,219,000 America . . 174,000 1,500,000 1,674,000 Asia .. 69,000 13,700,000 13,769,000 24,856,000 Africa .. 99,000 900,000 Oceania .. 76,000 60,000 999,000 136,000 13,055,000 28,379,000 41,434,000 From these figures it will be seen, not only that modern war is universal in its destructive effects, but that the loss in civilian lives is double that of the military losses. This stupendous loss was due almost entirely to the length of the war. Had it been possible to have cut down its 259 length to a few weeks, or even to a few months, and that in this shortening of it 1,000,000 civilians had been killed and disabled by direct attack, the actual saving in life and reduction of suffering would have been colossal
