Then, the nations of this continent may sink their differences and unite in the common cause for European independence.

In conception it started as a world league, and though it was an American creation, the United States, not wishing to become entangled in its problems, and wishing to control it by outside pressure, at once refused to enter it ; Russia for similar reasons did likewise. It was, therefore, launched as a European League, upon whose keel became attached certain RE FOUNDATIONS OF INTERNATIONALISM American and Asiatic barnacles. When this League has rubbed these off on some convenient sand-bank, such as Manchuria, the good ship Pan-Europa will move 263 more swiftly through the inter-continental waters. What will the result be ? As the three Leagues trim their sails to the winds of their own salvation, nationalism will begin to lose its all-absorbing interest.
