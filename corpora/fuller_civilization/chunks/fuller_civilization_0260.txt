at the World War was not fought in vain. ore group which must be considered, namely, the British Empire, or Commonwealth of Nations, which is an inter-continental group, artificial and not geographic-hence its fundamental weakness. Heretofore, fear of foreign invasion, quite as much so as sentiment, has held it together. Further, as at present constituted, its parts are not homogeneous, for it does not only consist of Great Britain and five self-governing Dominions, but it also includes four great non-European sub-empires-India, Malaya, East Africa and the Sudan, and West Africa, as well as many isolated dependencies.

The solution to this problem lies in establishing some controlling organ such as an Imperial Council, which, though it may possess no political power, will be able to advise the Empire as a whole on all' vital Imperial questions. To-day we possess but one piece of Imperial machinery, an heirloom of the War, namely, the Imperial War Graves Commission, a cynical reminder of the fate which awaits this greatest of the Great Empires unless we also establish an Imperial Commission for the living.  WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION 264 - RE FOUNDATIONS OF INTERNATIONALISM Thus we are finally faced by four possible groups of nations-Russia and Asia, North and South America, Europe, and the British Empire ; consequently the question arises what is likely to be the war relationship between them ? WORLD INTERDEPENDENCE AND WAR There can be little or no doubt that what we call the civilized world is an interdependent unit, and that when the uncivilized portions of it become civilized, then
