oper is considered to be equivalent with slavery. Whether tariffs between European nations are drastically reduced, or whether they vanish, one thing is certain : Europe, in order to safeguard her economic existence, will be compelled to establish formidable tariff walls against what I will call " Russasia." The more the Russian Five-Year Plan prospers the greater will be the conomic pressure brought to bear on Europe, and the greater this pressure becomes the greater will become the inducement for European nations to coalesce politically as well as economically ; for it is outside pressure, and not internal ruin, which will force coalescence, and, consequently, interdependence. Look at the recent advances that Russia has made. Her population is increasing at the rate of 60 millions every twenty years; her city population has grown 30 per cent. since the war ; school attendance has risen from 8 millions, in 1913, to 20 millions, in 1932 ; in 1930, 842 million copies of 47,000 different books and periodicals in fifteen languages were circulated ; in 1913, 29 million tons of coal were produced, in 1931, 57 million ; in the same period petroleum production has risen from 9 to 23 million tons, and electrical power from 2 to 12 million kilowatt hours. The railways are carrying 50 per cent. more freight than they did before the war, and passenger traffic has increased from 185 millions in 1913, to 709 million in 1931. Finally, in 1913 the post office handled 563 million letters and, in 1931, 1,414 million. (6) It is true that at the present moment Russian industrialization is incomparably inferior to that of Great Britain, Germany or France ; but when it is remembered how rapidly American industrialization advanced after 1865, and German after 1871, the fact that it is advancing, and rapidly, will soon fill Europe with consternation. As this consternation grows, if Europe is to survive there can be but one answer ; she must settle her internal quarrels ; establish the fre
