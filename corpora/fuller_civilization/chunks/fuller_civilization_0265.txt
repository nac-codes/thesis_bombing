This book opened with nationalism as an ideal, and it ends with yet another ideal-continental coalescence, or group nationalism ; and because this ideal is upon us, it does not follow, as it may be thought, that we are about to sink our individualities in one common herd. We shall do the very opposite ; for free contact between nations enhances and does not obliterate their essential differences. Men do not go to war because they are artists, scientists or musicians.
