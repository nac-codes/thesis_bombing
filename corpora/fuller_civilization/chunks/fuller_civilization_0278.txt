III, chap. i, sec. 5, articles of commerce are divided into two groups : those which " are of use only in war," and those which " serve only for pleasure "; as regards those which are useful in war and peace he bases any restriction of them during war time on the vague factor of " justice." Under the " Declaration of London," agreed upon on February 26, 1909, but never ratified, articles were divided under three headings : (1) warlike goods ; (2) goods exclusively used for peaceful purposes, and (3) goods which may be used for peace or war. Directly war was declared it was found that practically all goods could be used for peace and war and the result was constant friction. CHAPTER XII (2) W ar and the World's Life, Colonel F. N.
