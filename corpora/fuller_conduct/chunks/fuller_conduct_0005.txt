So far as I am aware, it is a subject which has never been examined deeply, and it is one so vast and so intricate that my study of it can be no other than an imperfect and a tentative one.Because of this the book is in no sense a history of the wars fought since 1789, nor is their conduct viewed primarily from the military angle; instead from that of the pressure of political, economic and social developments upon it.
