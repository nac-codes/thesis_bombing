I have seen whole vollies fired [at close range] without even killing 4 men’,1  possibly the reason was that on occasions a tacit agreement existed between the opposing lines to fire over each other’s heads, because normally casualties were appalling. Colonel Nickerson quotes that at Malplaquet one authority estimates the losses of the Allies at thirty-three per cent, and another at twenty-two, and that fifteen to twenty per cent, was common during the Seven Years’  War (1755-1763). At Torgau (1760) Frederick lost thirty per cent, and at Zorndorf (1758) the Russians fifty per cent, ‘a world’s record for a field army during a single day’s fighting in which the defeated side is neither crushed nor unresistingly massacred.’2This readily explains why battles were avoided and manoeuv­ring became the fashion. Another reason was the change in the system of subsistence. Because pillage was prohibited, armies had to be rationed by supply columns, which in their turn demanded the introduction of magazines fed from the home base, or by purchase of local products on cash payment. Normally magazines were established in fortresses or fortified towns, hence the prevalence of sieges to obtain possession of them. The chief disadvantage of the magazine system was that, if an army were to be adequately supplied, it limited its ad­vance to seven marches from the nearest fortress, and two days from the nearest field bakery. Only when the supply system broke down was enforced requisitioning resorted to.
