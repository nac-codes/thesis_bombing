War he left London for Paris with so much precipitation that ‘it never entered my mind that we were at war with France’, and that on his arrival at Dover it suddenly occurred to him he was without a pass­port. However, this did not impede his journey, and when he arrived at Versailles, the Duke of Choiseul, French Foreign Minister, had one sent to him. In Paris he was cheered by his French admirers, and at Frontignac was invited to theatricals by the English colony.1The strategy resorted to was one of attrition, not of annihi­lation; to exhaust the enemy, not to kill him, and normally its aim was to strike at the enemy’s line of supply and his fortres­ses, not at his army. As early as 1677, the Earl of Orrery observes that ‘we make War more like Foxes than Lyons; and you will have twenty Sieges for one Battel.’2  And some twenty years later Daniel Defoe writes: ‘Now it is frequent to have armies of fifty thousand men of a side stand at bay within view of one another, and spend a whole campaign in dodging, or, as it is genteely called, observing one another, and then march off into winter quarters.’3  At the siege of Pizzighetone, in 1793, we are offered a perfect example of a ‘limited’  siege. A truce had been arranged, and we read:‘A bridge thrown over the breach afforded a communication between the besiegers and the besieged: tables were spread in every quarter, and the officers entertained one another by turns: within and without, under tents and arbours, there was nothing but balls, entertainments and concerts. All the people of the environs flocked there on foot, on horseback, and in carriages: provisions arrived from every quarter, abundance was seen in a moment, and there was no want of stage doctors and tumblers. It was a charming fair, a delightful rendezvous.’4In all these drawn-out operations of the limited warfare era, attrition was the key principle.
