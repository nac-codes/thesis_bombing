arily to seek out an enemy and beat him. There were two alternatives prescribed by the best authorities, namely, to fight at an advantage or to subsist comfortably. Comfortable subsistence meant at its best subsistence at the enemy’s ex­pense. A campaign wherein an army lived on the enemy’s country . . .  was eminently successful, even though not a shot was fired.
