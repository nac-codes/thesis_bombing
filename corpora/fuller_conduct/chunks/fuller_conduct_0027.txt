Also, the Revolution had many admirers in neighbouring countries: in England Charles James Fox wel­comed it and even condoned its crimes; in Germany its sup­porters were numerous, and the doctrine of the freedom of man was enthusiastically welcomed in the Netherlands, whose people were eager to cast off Austrian rule.The first trial between the two forms of war, the now anti­quated limited and the still embryonic unlimited, took place at Valmy on 20th September 1792, when the Prussians, under Charles William Frederick Duke of Brunswick, faced the French, under Charles Fran$ois Dumouriez.
