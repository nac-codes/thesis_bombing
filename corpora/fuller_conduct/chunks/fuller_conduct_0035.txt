ir marches and bivouacking in the open led to a higher human wastage than had the old and more comfortable system, conscription could readily make it good.Conscription had yet another and very important influence on war. Because soldiers were recruited from all classes of society, on an average they were more intelligent than the men of the old royal armies, although not so highly disciplined. Not trained to carry out the mechanical evolutions of the period, they rapidly devised tactics which fitted their pugnacity and elan.  Volley firing was either given up or largely supplemented by aimed deliberate fire; loose order was added to close order, and battalions of tirailleurs  were raised, whose task it was to precede and prepare the way of the assault columns. The skir­mishers were, says Sir Robert Wilson, ‘as sharpsighted as ferrets and as active as squirrels.’1  And the Duke of York’s aide-de-camp wrote: ‘No mobbed fox was ever more put to it to make his escape than we were, being at times nearly sur­rounded.’2  Of the conscripts, a Prussian officer said: ‘In the woods, when the soldiers break rank and have no drill move­ments to carry out, but only to fire under the cover of the trees, they are not only equal but superior to us. Our men, accustomed to fight shoulder to shoulder in the open field, found it more difficult to adopt that seeming disorder which was yet necessary if they were not to be targets for the enemy.’8In spite of these overwhelming strategical and tactical ad­vantages over the old royal armies, the conscript armies of the Revolution had one crucial defect which, politically, annulled one and all of them. This was the difficulty for a conscripted nation -  that is, a nation in arms -  a nation fed on violent 1  Life ,  of Sir Robert Wilson,  H.
