fessor Arnold Toynbee is at a loss to understand why democracy which emerged ’ from the French Revolution, not merely failed to work against war ‘b u t. . .  positively put its “drive” into War.’  How is this to be explained? ‘And how is it possible’, he asks, ‘a priori, for Democracy to act as an anti­social force? For Democracy “breathes the spirit of the Gospels . . .  and its motive-force is Love”.’ 4 1  Peace and War , p. 127.*  Historical Essays , Second Series  (1875), pp. 173-4.*  The Art of War in the Middle Ages  (1924), Vol. II, p. 253.4  A Study of History , Vol. IV, pp. 156-7.

Nevertheless, the question is a valid one, because the understanding of the problem of war is wrapped up in its correct answer, and until it is correctly answered, there is little possiblity of moderating war, and absolutely none of elimi­nating it.The answer is not to be discovered in abstract speculations but in human nature; of which Herbert Spencer once said: ‘I believe you might as reasonably expect to understand the nature of an adult man by watching him for an hour (being in ignorance of his antecedents) as to suppose that you can fathom humanity by studying the last few thousand years of its evolution.’1In 1892-1893, after half a century of work, Spencer com­pleted his vast System of Philosophy with two volumes on The Principles of Ethics . In his studies of evolution he had hoped to find a code which placed human conduct (ethics) on a scientific footing. Instead, he discovered that evolution, as seen to work in human communities, spoke with two voices, each enunciating a separate code. He called the
