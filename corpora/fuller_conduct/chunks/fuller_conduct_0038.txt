ced human conduct (ethics) on a scientific footing. Instead, he discovered that evolution, as seen to work in human communities, spoke with two voices, each enunciating a separate code. He called the one the ‘Code of Amity’, and the other the ‘Code of Enmity’. Of them he wrote:Rude tribes and . . . civilized societies . . . have had continually to carry on an external self-defence and internal co-operation -  external antagonism and internal friendship. Hence their members have acquired two different sets of senti­ments and ideas, adjusted to these two kinds of activity.’2‘A life of constant external enmity generates a code in which aggression, conquest, and revenge, are inculcated, while peace­ful occupations are reprobated. Conversely a life of settled internal amity generates a code inculcating the virtues con­ducing to a harmonious co-operation -  justice, honesty, vera­city, regard for each other’s claims.’3 1  Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer , D.

That the tribe may survive, tribal man must be willing to sacrifice himself in battle, and that the tribe may maintain its cohesion, he must submit himself
