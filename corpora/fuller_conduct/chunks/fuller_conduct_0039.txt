by the pressure of his social environment. That the tribe may survive, tribal man must be willing to sacrifice himself in battle, and that the tribe may maintain its cohesion, he must submit himself to its taboos. Davie points out that the relation of tribes to one another is one of isolation, suspicion and hostility; but within the tribe the common interest against every other tribe compels its members to unite for self-preservation. That thus a distinction arises between one’s own tribe -  the ‘in-group’  -  and other tribes -  the ‘out-group’; that between the members of the first peace and co-operation are essential, and that their inbred sentiment toward all outsiders is one of hatred and hostility. These two relations are correlative, and to reinforce his argu­ment he quotes from Sumner’s Folkways :‘The exigencies of war with outsiders are what make peace inside, lest internal discord should weaken the in-group for war. The exigencies also make government and law in the in­group, in order to prevent quarrels and enforce discipline. Thus war and peace have reacted on each other, and developed each other, one within the group, the other in the inter-group rela­tions. The closer the neighbours, the stronger they are, the intenser the warfare, and then the intenser is the internal organization and discipline of each.’3Thus it arises that there are two sets of morals -  of mores -  one for the in-group, and the other for the out-group, and 1  Ibid., Vol. I, p. 316.*  Ibid., Vol. I, p. 324.*  The Evolution of War .
