Nevertheless, his maxims: ‘In war men are nothing, it is the one man who is all’,5  and ‘One bad general [in command]. . .  is worth two good ones’, 6  remain as true today as when they were first uttered.What he expected of his generals and soldiers may be dis­covered from what he wrote and said on generalship and soldiership.As regards the first: ‘The essential quality of a general is resolution.’7  ‘A general should never paint pictures [of a situ­ation]; his intelligence should be as clear as the lens of a telescope.’8  ‘A general who has to see things through the eyes of others will never be able to command an army as it should 1  Ibid., I, No. 83. 2  Ibid., I, No. 399. 8  Ibid., I, No. 420.4  Ibid., XII, No. 10329. 8  Ibid., XVII, No. 14283.8  Ibid., XXIX, p. 107.7  Sainte-Hiltone Journal inidit  (1815-1818), General Gourgaud, (edit.  1899) ),Vol. II, p. 423.8  NapoUon en Eodl, ou Vicho de Sainte-H&bne  (1822), B.
