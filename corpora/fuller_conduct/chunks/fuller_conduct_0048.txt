general he said: ‘If courage is the first quality of the soldier, perseverance is the second.’4  And when in St. Helena Madame de Montholon asked him which were the best troops? ‘Madame’, he replied, ‘those who win battles.’5Napoleon’s success as a planner of campaigns derived directly from his position as autocrat, which empowered him to combine in his own person the political and strategical conduct of war. This advantage, coupled with his single- mindedness and enormous industry, enabled him to transfuse his genius into his plans, at times so much so that they were quite beyond the comprehension of his generals. As the war lengthened and his problems grew more complex, the lack of comprehending subordinates became increasingly dangerous, and especially so during the Leipzig and Waterloo campaigns, when his brilliant manoeuvres were botched by the stupidity of his marshals. This is why, when at St. Helena, he said: ‘If I had had a man like Turenne to second me in my campaigns, I should have been master of the world.’*To him the planning of a campaign was an exacting work of art, as the following citations show: ‘At the moment when war is declared, there are so many things to be done that it is wise to have looked a few years ahead .. .’7  ‘I am accustomed to think out three or four months in advance what I should do, and I base my calculations on the worst [situation] . ..’8  ‘Nothing is gained in war except by calculation .. .’9  ‘It is my habit to take so many precautions, that nothing is left to chance.’1 0  ‘It is only when plans are deeply thought out that one succeeds in war.’1 1 1  Correspondance inedite de NapoUon ler , conserve aux Archives de la  Guerre , Ernest Picard et Louis Tuetey (1912), No. 247.2  Corresp.9  XI, No. 9105.4  Ibid., VII, No. 4855.• Gourgaud, Vol. II, p. 135.• Ibid., XIII, No. 10810.1 0  Ibid., XVI, No. 13652.1 1  Ibid., XVII, No. 14307.8  Ibid., XXII, No. 18041.6  Las Cases, Vol. VI, p. 85.7  Corresp.,  X, No. 8075.• Ibid., XII, No.
