ops is the art of war. Distri­bute your troops in such a way that, whatever the enemy does, you will be able to unite your forces within a few days.’1  The assembly is the distribution of corps or divisions in the battle area, while concentration refers to the battlefield. On 14th February 1806, Napoleon wrote to his brother Joseph: ‘Your army is too dispersed; it should always march in such a way that it is able to unite in a single day on the battlefield.’2  The area of assembly, which includes the marching and resting columns, contracts as the enemy is approached, until all columns can be concentrated within a few hours. Because ‘The first principle of war is that one should only engage in battle when all troops can be united on the battlefield’,3  and because, ‘The art of generalship consists in, when actually inferior in numbers to the enemy, being superior to him on the battle­field’,4  it follows that an inferior force, if correctly assembled, will generally defeat a superior force that is not. PROTECTiON.From 16th September 1793, when as a penniless and unemployed captain, a sheer accident gave him command of the Jacobin artillery at the siege of Toulon* to 18th June 1815, when as Emperor of France, in the square of his 1st Grenadiers of the Guard, he retired from the field of Waterloo, never once did he engage in a purely defensive battle.It is true that at Leipzig (1813), at la Rothiere (1814), and at Arcis-sur-Aube (1814) he was driven to fight defensively; also it is true that, because of his inferiority, throughout his 1814 campaign he had to assume a strategical defensive; nevertheless, it consisted in a series of rapid marches and of furious attacks. Yet, notwithstanding his complete avoidance of the defensively planned battle, all his offensive operations were grounded on the protective principle. He defines it as follows: ‘The whole art of war consists in a well reasoned and circumspect defensive, followed by rapid and audacious attack.’5 1  Corresp
