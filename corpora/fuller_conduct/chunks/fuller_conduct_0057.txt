ll” (Berthier to Soult, Osterode, March 1, 1807). “The Emperor, Monsieur le Marechal, needs neither advice nor plans of campaign. No one knows his thought, and our duty is to obey” (Berthier to Ney, Warsaw, January 18 1807).’1  To this Vachee adds: ‘The Emperor himself said that the General Staff was the least necessary part of grand head­quarters.’2  As bad, the same cavalier treatment was meted out to his marshals.The Duke of F^zensac’s comment on this is:‘His orders had to be executed whatever the means of com­mand. . . .  This habit of undertaking everything with insuffi­cient means, this determination not to recognize impossibilities, this boundless assurance of success, which in the beginning were the causes of our triumphs, in the end became fatal to us.’3Some historians have held that the Emperor’s lack of success in his later campaigns was due to ill-health or physical degeneracy; there is little to support this. The truth is, that it was his activity,4  not his lethargy, which was as much the cause of his fall as of his rise, for it led him to believe that in his person he could combine the duties of commander-in-chief and chief of staff, and when skilled staff officers were needed they were not to be found. Caulaincourt informs us that in 1812 ‘The staff foresaw nothing, but on the other hand, as the Emperor wanted to do everything himself, and give every order, no one, not even the general staff, dared to assume the responsibility of giving the most trifling order.’5  D’Odeleben says that in 1813 the staff was even less eilieient than the year 1  Napoleon at Work  (English edition, 1914), p. 24. *  Ibid., pp. 140-1.*  Souvenirs Militaires de 1804 a 1814  (1863), pp. 118-9.* For examples of it in 1812, see Caulaincourt’s Memoirs , Vol. I, pp.135, 141, and 245; and for 1813, see Baron d’Odeleben’s Relation Cir - constaneiie de la Campagne de 1813 en Saxe  (French edition, 1817), Vol.  I, p. 224, etc.5  Op. cit., Vol. I, p. 155.
