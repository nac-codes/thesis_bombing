because, not only did it deprive the continental nations of goods, which England alone could supply, but it involved one and all in his war with England. His grand strategy, therefore, was at fault; it was no more than a make­shift substitute for the fleet he had lost at Trafalgar in 1805.Immediately after the battle of Jena, the Emperor initiated his continental blockade by his Berlin Decree, and England retaliated with an Order in Council which prohibited neutral trade with France and her allies.
