ached the gospel of the Nation in Arms throughout the length and breadth of Europe, and in time it became the military creed of all her troublesome peoples. Spiritually linked with this is what Stanislas Girardin, in his Memoirs , relates on Napoleon’s visit to the tomb of Rousseau. In reply to a question of Girardin’s he said: ‘Well, the future will show whether it would not have been better for the repose of the world that neither I nor Rousseau had existed.’2 1  Manmcrit de M il Huit Cent Treize , Baron Fain (1824), Vol. I, p. 39.
