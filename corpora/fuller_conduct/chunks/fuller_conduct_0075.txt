had Gustavus Adolphus, Charles X II and Frederick the Great, and the career of any of one of them would soon have been brought to a close by the destruction of his fighting force: instates torn by internal dissensions, this centre generally lies in the capital; in small States dependent on greater ones, it lies generally in the Army of these Allies; in a confederacy, it lies in the unity of interests; in a national insurrection, in the person of the chief leader, and in public opinion; against these points the blow must be directed’  (III, pp. 106-107). ‘The centre of gravity of the French power lies in its military force and in Paris. To defeat the former in one or more battles, to take Paris and drive the wreck of the French across the Loire, must be the object of the Allies. The pit of the stomach of the French monarchy is between Paris and Brussels’  (III, p. 171).In a war against a coalition, such as Napoleon’s conflict with England, Clausewitz shows remarkable insight.‘If two or more States combine against a third’, he writes, ‘that combination constitutes, in a political aspect, only one War. . . . We may, therefore, establish it as a principle, that if we can conquer all our enemies by conquering one of them, the defeat of that one must be the aim of the War, because in that one we hit the common centre of gravity of the whole War’  (III, p. 108).Napoleon was fully aware of this, and it was because he lacked naval power to win command of the English Channel and hit at England directly, that he relied on his Continental System to bankrupt her and render her impotent to raise coalitions against him. 6 •  The Principles of W ar Once the grand strategical aim is fixed, the next problem to consider is, what principles should govern the plan of war and its execution?
