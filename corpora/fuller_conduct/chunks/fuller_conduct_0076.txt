Clausewitz mentions two, which he holds to be fundamental:‘The first is: to reduce the weight of the enemy’s power into as few centres of gravity as possible, into one if it can be done;  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 72 --- THE THEORIES OF CLAUSEWITZ 69 again, to confine the attack against these centres of force to as few principal undertakings as possible, to one if possible; lastly, to keep all secondary undertakings as subordinate as possible. In a word, the first principle is, to concentrate as much as possible.‘The second principle runs thus -  to act as swiftly cls possible;  therefore, to allow of no delay or detour without sufficient reason’  (III, p. 141).When combined, these principles bear close resemblance to Napoleon’s maxim: ‘In the art of war, as in mechanics, time is the grand element between weight and force.’Besides these two principles, Clausewitz lays down a series of general principles, which he deduces from his three principal war objects, which are:‘(a) To conquer and destroy the enemy’s armed force.‘(b) To get possession of the material elements of aggres­sion . . .  of the hostile Army.‘(c) To gain public opinion.’To attain the first, the chief operation must be directed against the enemy’s principal army, which must be beaten before the remaining two ob j ects are tackled. In order to seizethe material resources, operations should be directed against those points at which they are established -  large towns, fortresses, etc. As regards the third, ‘Public opinion is ultimately gained by great victories, and by the possession of the enemy’s capital.’  Next, Clausewitz lays down the principles which should be followed in the attainment of these objects:‘(1) To employ all  the forces which we can make available with the utmost  energy. . . .‘(2) To concentrate our force as much as possible at the point where the decisive blows are to be struck. . . .‘(3) Not to lose time. . . .
