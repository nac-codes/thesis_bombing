lled to modify his tactics, he must never abandon his aim. At the start he must assume a defensive attitude until he has measured up his opponent. Next, he must move toward him under cover of his defence, and lastly, by foot-play, and still under cover of his defence, he must assume the offensive and attem pt to knock him out. Thus we arrive at four primary principles: (1) The principle of the mainten­ance of the aim or object; (2) the principle of security of action; (3) the principle of mobility of action, and (4) the principle of the expenditure of offensive power.Should the two pugilists be skilled, they will recognize the value of three accentuating principles. They will economize their strength, so as not to exhaust themselves prematurely; they will concentrate their blows against the decisive point selected, the left or right of their opponent’s jaw, etc., and throughout will attempt to surprise him -  that is, take him off guard, or do something he does not expect, or cannot prevent. Thus we arrive at: (5) The principle of economy of force; (6) the principle of concentration of force, and (7) the principle of surprise.

The first occurs in Chapter IX  of Book VIII, entitled ‘The Destruction of the Enemy as the Object’. He writes ‘that almost the only advantage which the offensive posses
