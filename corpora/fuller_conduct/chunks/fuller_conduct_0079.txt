his remarks on the offensive. The first occurs in Chapter IX  of Book VIII, entitled ‘The Destruction of the Enemy as the Object’. He writes ‘that almost the only advantage which the offensive possesses is the effect of surprise at the opening of the scene. Suddenness and irrestible impetuosity are its strong­est pinions; and when the object is the complete overthrow of the enemy, it can rarely dispense with them’  (III, p. 153). In Chapter XV of Book III, ‘Attack of a Theatre of War with the View to a Decision’  -  an all but identical title -  he demolishes this:‘The first aim of the attack is victory. To all the advantages which the defender finds in the nature of his situation, the assailant can only oppose superior numbers. . . .
