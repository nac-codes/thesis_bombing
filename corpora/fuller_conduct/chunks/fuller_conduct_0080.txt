form of conducting War, but has a negative object, it follows of itself that we must only make use of it so long as our weakness compels us to do so, and that we must give up that form as soon as we feel strong enough to aim at the positive object’  (II, pp. 134-136).Clausewitz’s defensive is, therefore, a delayed offensive, or what is sometimes called ‘the defensive-offensive’, in which the first phase is attrition and the second counter-attack. Or, as Clausewitz says: ‘The defensive form of War is . . .  no mere shield but a shield formed of blows delivered with skill’  (II, p. 134); and again: ‘. .. a defensive, without an offensive return blow, cannot be conceived’  (III, p. 3).But it can be, because long before he had reached this con­clusion, in Chapter II of Book I he had written:‘If then the negative purpose, that is the concentration of all the means into a state of pure resistance, affords a superi­ority in the contest, and if this advantage is sufficient to balance  whatever superiority in numbers the adversary may have, then the mere duration  of the contest will suffice gradu­ally to bring the loss of force on the part of the adversary to a point at which the political object can no longer be an equivalent, a point at which, therefore, he must give up the contest’  (I, pp. 34-35).Whether this is meant to be a philosophical comment or a practical proposal is uncertain, but from its context it would appear to be the latter.The trouble with Clausewitz is that his philosophical way of thinking-his habit of reducing operation to ‘things-in- themselves’  -  constantly trips him up. Neither the defensive nor the offensive is inherently stronger or weaker; they are complementary operations, and which is the more suitable to an occasion depends on the circumstances which surround it. At times the offensive is the more so, as it was with Napoleon, because his genius coupled with his enemies’  obsolescent ideas favoured it. At times the passive defence was profit
