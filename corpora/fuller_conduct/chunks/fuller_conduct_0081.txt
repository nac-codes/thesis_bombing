which surround it. At times the offensive is the more so, as it was with Napoleon, because his genius coupled with his enemies’  obsolescent ideas favoured it. At times the passive defence was profitable, as with Wellington at Torres Vedras; and at times, also with Wellington, it was the defensive-offensive which was correct,  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 76 --- THE THEORIES OF CLAUSEWITZ 73 and in Spain he handled it in a masterly way. The foundations of all operations of war are not philosophy, they are common sense, as the seven principles of war so clearly show. 8 •  The Decisive Battle In Clausewitz’s conception of the decisive, or great, battle there is no more nonsense about weaker and stronger forms of war, and he speaks with no uncertain voice.‘The combat is the real warlike activity, everything else is only its auxiliary’  (I, p. 238).‘. .. the essence of War is conflict, and the [great] battle is the conflict of the main Armies, it is always to be regarded as the real centre of gravity of the War’  (I, p. 270).‘. .. the direct destruction of the enemy’s forces is every­where predominant; we contend here for the overruling impor­tance of the destructive principle and nothing else’  (I, p. 241).Numerical superiority is only one of the factors relied on to produce victory (I, p. 193). Others are the enveloping attack (II, p. 145); manoeuvre ‘to turn or surround’  (III, p. 11), and surprise (I, p. 262). These three additional means are ‘only possible for the side which has the initiative’  -  the attacker (II, p. 145).Rightly he points out that, although ‘The battle is the bloodiest way of solution . . .  it is not merely reciprocal slaughter, and its effect is more a killing of the enemy’s courage than of the enemy’s soldiers’  (I, p. 286). Because ‘loss of moral force is the chief cause of the decision . . . this loss continues to increase until it reaches its culminating-point at the close of the whole act’  (I, p. 246). After which, ‘the next qu
