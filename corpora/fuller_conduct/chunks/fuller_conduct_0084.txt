n, and Clausewitz was probably the first to suggest this. 10  •  Clausewitz's disregard of Napoleonic Warfare When it is borne in mind that Clausewitz not only lived throughout the Napoleonic Wars, but also took part in the campaigns of 1806, 1812, 1813 and 1815, it is astonishing that he pays so little attention to Napoleon’s generalship. Equally astonishing is it that, although he saw in Napoleon the greatest exponent of the offensive, and could write: ‘Buonaparte hardly ever started upon a War without thinking of conquering his enemy at once in the first battle’  (I, p. 289), he nevertheless held that the defensive was the stronger form of war. Again, it is astonishing that in his illuminating discussion on the centre of gravity he does not mention Napoleon’s struggle against six English coalitions, and his ultimate failure to win his long series of wars because of his inability to ‘hit the common centre of gravity of the whole war.’Although he points out that ‘Napoleon always showed great foresight in the provisions he made [to secure] the rear of his Army; and in that way, even in his boldest operations, he incurred less risk than might be imagined at first sight’  (III, p. 221), he did not grasp the main reason for it. It was, in order to gain complete freedom of movement, to move away from his communications should he wish to: he was willing to accept their temporary loss as long as his base remained firm.Instead of holding, as Clausewitz did, that ‘there is no more imperative and no simpler law for strategy than to keep the  forces concentrated . No portion is to be separated from the main body. . . . On this maxim we stand firm’  (I, p. 208), Napoleon frequently sought to trap his enemy by dividing his army.
