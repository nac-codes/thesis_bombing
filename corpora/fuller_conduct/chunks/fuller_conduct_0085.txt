CONDUCT OF WAR Instead of keeping it concentrated to cover his line of com­munications, as Clausewitz would have done, he split it into three or more widely spaced columns and formed what he called a bataillon carree  (‘battalion square’), because they were distributed in diamond formation. Each column was suffi­ciently powerful to hold its own, should the enemy strike at it, until one or more of the remaining columns came to its support, while one or more manoeuvred against the enemy’s flank. Whichever column first encountered the enemy became the advanced guard to the other columns.1  That Clausewitz, who took part in the Jena campaign -  its most notable ex­ample -  was completely ignorant of this flexible method of concentration, as opposed to his own rigid method, is proved by his statement that, ‘. . . serious combats of advance guards which precede a battle are to be looked upon only as necessary evils’  (I, p. 264).But of all Clausewitz’s blind shots, the blindest was that he never grasped that the true aim of war is peace and not victory; therefore that peace should be the ruling idea of policy, and victory only the means toward its achievement. Nowhere does he consider the influence of violence on eventual peace; actually the word ‘peace’  barely occurs half a dozen times in On War.  In Napoleon he found the past-master of his theory of absolute war; yet to where did absolute war with its maximum of violence lead him? Not to the peace he aspired, but to St. Helena. Violence pushed to its utmost bounds ended in absolute failure. Better the advice of Mon­tesquieu: ‘That nations should do each other the most good during peacetime and the least harm during wartime without harming their true interests’,2  if peace is to be anything more than a temporary suspension of arms. 1  For a full description of the bataillon carrie  in the Jena campaign,  see the author’s Decisive Battles of the Western World  (1955), Vol. II,  pp. 423-6.2  Cited by Guglielmo Ferrero in
