But when the factory began to challenge the domestic system, like a magnet coal drew the new-born industries towards it. This led to the rise of the Black Country in England, Clydeside in Scotland, the Ruhr in Germany, and the Lille area in France, with their conglomeration of great industrial towns, which steadily re­placed agricultural civilization by urban, and when the cities became the centres of business, increasingly their cultural value declined. As early as 1804, William Blake prophetically engraved above the title of his Laocoon: ‘Where any view of Money exists, Art cannot be carried on’, and under it: ‘Art Degraded, Imagination Denied, War Governed the Nations.’2In a remarkably brief space of time, machines displaced hand labour; they conscripted the hand-workers and regi­mented them in factories, which Lewis Mumford compares to barracks.3  In them mass production in big units was rendered possible, and they not only deprived the domestic workers of their jobs, but at the same time of their skills, because in mechanized manufacture the unskilled worker is the real worker, and the skilled craftsman is no more than his auxilliary, who prepares his work for him.These radical changes in Western Civlization began to take root s
