industrialization it was the foreign market that came first, and the competition between the factory owners was so violent that, in order to survive, they had to plough back the greater part of their profits into their businesses. To raise wages would have meant less profits, and less profits would have meant falling behind in the competitive race. This struggle is well described by Andrew Ure, the great apologist for Victorian capitalism.‘The present’, he exclaimed in 1835, ‘is distinguished from every preceding age by a universal ardour of enterprise in arts and manufactures. Nations, convinced at length that war is always a losing game, have converted their swords and muskets into factory implements, and now contend with each other in the bloodless but still formidable strife of trade. They no longer send troops to fight in distant fields, but fabrics to drive before them those of their old adversaries in arms, and to take possession of a foreign market. To impair the resources of a rival at home, by underselling his wares abroad, is the new belligerent system, in pursuance of which every nerve and sinew of the people are put upon the strain.’1While the factories poured out goods for profit, in order to finance the pouring out of more goods wherewith to oust their rivals, the workers rotted in their slums, which became hot­beds of discontent and class-hatred, and the sight of others living in comfort and often in luxury aroused in them a sullen wrath against society. Thus, as industrialization spread, it created a class of malcontents in every industrialized country, a class increasingly antagonistic to the existing social order, the institutions of which, deriving as they did from the agri­cultural age, were not designed to give expression to the functions of an industrial one, or status to the industrial worker. 1  The opening paragraph of his Preface to The Philosophy of Manu­factures: or An Exposition of the Scientific, Moral and Commercial Economy  of the F
