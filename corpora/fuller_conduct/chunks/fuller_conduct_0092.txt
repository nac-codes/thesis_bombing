ged from his notes and edited by Engels; they were published in 1883-1885 and 1890-1894 respectively.As a thinker Marx owed much to Hegel, from whom he adopted the Socratic dialectical system he had employed in his philosophy of history. It was a critical process of question and answer, the aim of which was to delve out contradictions in the subject under discussion. But while Socrates looked upon contradictions as obstacles to be surmounted, Hegel held that they were of essential value, because, so he maintained, it was only through opposition that progress toward truth could be made. His dialectical process was, therefore, one of thesis, which affirms a proposition; of antithesis, which denies it; and of synthesis, which embraces what is disclosed to be  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 85 --- 82 THE CONDUCT OF WAR true in both. But once the synthesis replaces the thesis, it itself becomes a thesis to be faced with another antithesis; this leads to yet another synthesis, and so on, step by step, until Absolute Truth (God) is reached. In brief, a system that winnows the grain of truth from the chaff of falsehood.Marx, as he himself said, inverted Hegel’s dialectic. Instead of working upward toward the Absolute, he worked downward from what he held to be axiomatic -  that the material world is the fundamental and only reality. He discarded idealism, and with the materialists he held that the world possessed an objective existence apart from man’s perception of it, and that by means of the dialectical process it was possible to obtain a knowledge of the world which, although incomplete, would contain a core of absolute truth, and that this core would grow as the process progressed. Dialectical materialsm was, therefore, the only scientific method by which reality could be arrived at.According to his interpretation of history, historical materi­alism is dialectical materialism applied to human relations within society.1  In the preface of his Contribution to the
