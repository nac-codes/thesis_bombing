Then the productive 1  For a criticism of this see The Materialist Conception of History: A  Critical Analysis , Karl Fedem (English edition, 1939).2 In his speech at the graveside of Marx, Engels said that Marx  ‘discovered the simple fact, hitherto concealed by an overgrowth of  ideology, that mankind must first of all eat and drink, have shelter and  clothing, before it can pursue politics, science, religion, art, etc.’  Apparently he overlooked the ‘simple fact’  that mankind has to breathe  before he eats, etc; but this would not have fitted his economics.
