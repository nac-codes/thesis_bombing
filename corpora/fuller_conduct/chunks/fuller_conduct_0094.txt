ve economic forms of production, each of the last four of which, in accord­ance with the dialectical principle, is an advance upon its pre­decessor, because each in turn takes up whatever is of value in the preceding one once it has reached maturity. The first is the primitive form, in which means of production are socially owned;2  the second is the antique or classical form, in which the slaveholder owns them; the third is the feudal form, in which the feudal lord owns the greater part of them;3  and the fourth is the bourgeois form, in which the capitalist owns them, and although he does not own his workers, through fear and starvation they are compelled to work for him. Ultimately, when capitalism has reached maturity the fifth form comes into force; the proletariat appropriates the means of produc­tion,4  and with the negation of the contradiction inherent in Capitalism, which is that the rich become richer and richer and the poor become poorer and poorer,5  production reaches its fullest development.Although Marx never clearly defined what he meant by ‘class’, as we see, he held that since primitive times there had invariably been two: one which controls the means of pro­duction and the other which does not. And we see also that the force which shapes the world is the clash of classes, and that it must inevitably lead to the dictatorship of the proletariat, when, with the transformation of Socialism into Communism, 1  Centenary edition (1948), p. 13.*  Compare with Rousseau’s ‘noble savage’.3  This is a bad shot, because the feudal order was a military and not  an economic one, and to suggest that it took over what was best in the  classical means of production is historically absurd; its antithesis was  not capitalism but gunpowder, The antithesis of the classical age -  if it  had one -  was the barbarian invasions, whose ‘productive forces’ were  conquest and robbery.4  ‘The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees,  all capital fro
