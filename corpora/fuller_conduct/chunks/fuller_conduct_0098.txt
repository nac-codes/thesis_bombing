FLUENCES OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 85  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 89 --- 86 THE CONDUCT OF WAR 4 • Impact of the Revolution on M ilitary Power Due to the inertia of armies and navies, their disregard of industry as the source of their power, and the reaction against war which followed the Napoleonic conflict, between the dates mentioned by Stendhal the impact of the Industrial Revo­lution on them was negligible; so much so that in 1824 they differed but slightly from what they had been in 1785. Never­theless, a spirit of invention had been awakened, and here and there some enthusiast hit on an idea which years later weevilled its way through the military carapace.In 1759, Cugnot, in France, bolted a steam boiler onto a wagon frame, and succeeded in making the first steam-driven road vehicle. His idea was that it would be useful in war; but during its first public trial he had the misfortune to knock down part of a wall; was cast into jail, and his experiment abandoned. Yet, should Mr Manchester be right, its value did not go unnoticed, because later ‘Napoleon must have visualised the possibilities of Cugnot’s machine for military purposes, for when the great general was selected a member of the French Institute, the subject was “The Automobile in War” .’1 In 1783, the Montgolfier brothers built the first man-lifting balloon; it made its maiden flight on 15th October, and on 7tb January, the following year, it crossed the English Channel. Its military possibilities were at once appreciated, and soon after the opening of the French Revolutionary Wars an aero nautic school was founded at Meudon, and four balloons were made for the Army of the North. One of them was used to reconnoitre the Austrian position just before the battle of Fleurus, on 16th June 1794.The application of steam propulsion to ships was also experi­mented with at an early date, and the earliest steamboat would appear to have been constructed by James Rumsey, a Vir­ginian, in 1775.
