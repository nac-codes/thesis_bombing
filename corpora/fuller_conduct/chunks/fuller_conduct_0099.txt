The application of steam propulsion to ships was also experi­mented with at an early date, and the earliest steamboat would appear to have been constructed by James Rumsey, a Vir­ginian, in 1775. Strangely enough, instead of making use of the paddle-wheel, which dated from Roman times, Rumsey’s steamboat was driven by water-jet propulsion: a steam pump sucked in water at her bow and ejected it at her stern. 1  ‘The Forerunner of the Tank’, H.

The first was not adopted by the British Ordnance Committee until 1803, and the second, which was destined to render obsolete the wooden battleship, not until 1822.Two other inventions, the percussion cap and the cylindro- conoidal bullet, revolutionized infantry tactics. The first was impracticable before the discovery of fulminate of mercury in 1800 -  an explosive which detonates on concussion.
