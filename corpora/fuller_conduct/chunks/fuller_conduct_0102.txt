oralizing effect on the Austrians in 1866.1On account of cost, the development of artillery was slower than that of the rifle, and although breech-loading and the rifling of cannon were as separate ideas old, it would seem that, when combined, they were first experimented with in England in 1745.2  Next, exactly one hundred years later, an effective breech-loading 6.5-inch rifled gun was invented by Major Cavalli, a Sardinian officer, and a still more effective one by Baron Wahrendorff in 1846. Nevertheless, no country would face the cost of re-equipment. Then came the war in the Crimea (1853-1856), during which a number of cast-iron, muzzle-loading, smooth-bore 68-pounders and 8-inch guns were converted into rifled pieces on the Lanchester principle.3  Because their greater range and accuracy made the bombard­ment of Sevastopol a ‘very hideous thing’, after the close of the war all the Powers set about to experiment with rifled breech-loading ordnance.A weapon which was introduced in the early years of the Industrial Revolution, and which stands apart from both musket and cannon, was the war-rocket. It is the oldest of all explosively propelled projectiles, and in Asia dates from the thirteenth century. It was the rocket used by Tipu Sultan at the siege of Seringapatam in 1799 which attracted the atten­tion of the British gunnery expert Colonel Sir William Con­greve; he took it as his model and improved on it. He tells us that he made rockets of from two ounces -  ‘a species of self­motive musket ball’  -  to three hundredweights.4  In 1806 they 1  See Military Reports , Colonel Baron Stoffel, French Military Attach^  in Prussia, 1866-1870 (English edition, 1872), p. 64. The breech-loading  system dates from very early days. It was advocated for rifled cannon  and muskets in 1742 by Benjamin Robins in his New Principles of  Gunnery , a book studied by Napoleon.2  See Tracts on Gunnery , Benjamin Robins, p. 387.8  The rotation of the shell was achieved, not by groov
