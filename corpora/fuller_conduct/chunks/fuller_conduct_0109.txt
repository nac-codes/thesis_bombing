This led to a change in ‘productive relations’, and ultimately to war between two variant economic societies -  the inhabi­tants of the Northern States and those of the Southern. While the former were staunch democrats, mainly occupied in agri­culture and commerce, the latter were an aristocratically- minded people, almost feudal in outlook, whose plantations were cultivated by slave labour.Although during the War of Independence (1775-1783), or immediately after, the founding fathers of the Union repro­bated slavery, when, in 1787, the Constitution was drafted, on the insistence of South Carolina and Georgia slavery was retained.1  As things then stood, slavery was on the decline, and had the ‘productive forces’  remained as they were, the probability is that, within a generation or two, slavery would have withered away.This was not to be, because four years after the ratification of the Constitution in 1788, suddenly there appeared an in­vention which was enormously to stimulate the cultivation of 1  Slavery was abolished in the Northern States between 1777 and  1804; the first State to free its slaves was Vermont and the last New  Jersey. Actually, this was of small advantage to the slaves themselves,  because most of the Northern slaves were transferred to the Southern  slave markets. 95  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 99 --- 96 THE CONDUCT OF WAR cotton in the Southern States. In 1792, Eli Whitney, an American, designed his ‘saw gin’  for separating cotton from the seed, and it made cotton so profitable that between 1815 and 1861 it became known as ‘King of the Southern States’. Coincidentally this placed slave labour on a highly profitable footing, with the result that, instead of slaves being a drug on the
