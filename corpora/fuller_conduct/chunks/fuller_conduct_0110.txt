een 1815 and 1861 it became known as ‘King of the Southern States’. Coincidentally this placed slave labour on a highly profitable footing, with the result that, instead of slaves being a drug on the market, their supply fell short of demand. Prior to the introduction of the saw gin, tobacco, more so than cotton, had been the staple crop of the South, but by 1820 the cotton crop had risen to 160 million pounds; ten years later it had doubled, in 1850 it passed the 1,000 million pounds mark, and in 1860 it stood at 2,300 million pounds. Concurrently, the price of a ‘prime field hand’  rose from about $500 in 1830 to about $1,800 in 1860, which shows how vital their supply had become to the prosperity of the South.Meanwhile rapid economic changes were taking place in the Northern States. The two long trade embargoes, the first between 1807 and 1812, during the Napoleonic Wars, and the second between 1812 and 1815, in the war with England, had compelled the Northern States to rely on and extend their home industries. Thus it came about that, while in the South capital was represented by slaves, in the North it increasingly became represented by factories. By 1812 they were so firmly established that textile machinery made America independent of foreign importation of cotton fabrics. In 1840, there were 1,200 cotton factories in the United States, the majority in New England, and by 1860 their goods were reaching the remoter parts of the West.The iron industry in Pennsylvania developed more slowly, and to protect it and other infant industries tariffs were intro­duced. Essential as they were to the Northern foundry and mill owners, the Southern planters did not directly benefit from them, and in South Carolina they were pronounced to be unconstitutional devices to tax the South for the benefit of the North. So violent became the dispute over tariffs that, in 1832, South Carolina declared the Tariff Act of 1824 -  known as the ‘Tariff of Abominations’  -  null and void.
