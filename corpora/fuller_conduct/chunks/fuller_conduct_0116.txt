Atlanta lay about one hundred miles south of Chattanooga, and both towns were linked by a railway which ran from Louisville in northern Kentucky to Savannah in Georgia, with a branch line to Charleston in South Carolina. Chattanooga and Atlanta were of the utmost importance to the Confederacy, for should they be lost, the two lateral railways would be cut and connection between the two sub-theatres severed.Because the Confederates could not hope to conquer the Northern States, their problem was to resist conquest. In other words, to tire the Federals out, and force them to abandon the war. Its solution depended on how long their resources would hold out, and, in order to add to them, it was vital to maintain contact with Europe, which demanded that the main ports in the Confederacy should be kept open.On the other hand, the Federals could only hope to conquer the Confederacy bit by bit, that is reduce it systematically, not only in size but also in resources, until it was unable to sustain its armies in the field.
