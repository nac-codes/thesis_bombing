ts armies in the field. At the outset of the war this was realized by the Federal Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant- General Winfield Scott (1786-1866), who appreciated the relationship between economic pressure and attack. His project was to seal up all Southern ports, and simultaneously form two powerful armies, one to move down the Mississippi and cut off the western half of the Confederacy from its eastern half, while the other threatened Richmond and pinned down the main Confederate forces in Virginia.Of the Confederate ports, nine were linked to the interior by rail, and all of these, except Mobile, Charleston and Wil­mington, were in Federal hands by April, 1862. Of the three which were not, Wilmington was of incalculable importance to the Confederacy, in fact it may be said to have been its mouth; nevertheless, it was not occupied by the Federals until 15th January 1865 -  a first-rate blunder. Scott’s other proposals were not adopted until late in the war; instead the main battlesTHE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR 1 8 6 1 - 1 8 6 5  101  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 105 --- 102 THE CONDUCT OF WAR were fought to gain Richmond, and, until 1865, all were abortive.When we turn to President Davis, we find he failed to appreciate that the only means open to him to prevent the conquest of the Confederacy were, while he husbanded its resources, to hold the Federals back. This demanded a defen­sive strategy, but instead he adopted an offensive one, and attempted at one and the same time to protect Richmond and drive the Federals out of the war by a series of battles aimed at the occupation of Washington. Yet both geography and communications indicated that early in the war the most effective way to protect Richmond was to base a powerful army on Chattanooga, and carry out a defensive-offensive campaign in Tennessee, while a less powerful army covered the capital. A vigorous campaign in Tennessee would almost certainly have drawn Federal forces out of Virginia to meet it,
