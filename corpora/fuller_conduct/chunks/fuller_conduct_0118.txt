A vigorous campaign in Tennessee would almost certainly have drawn Federal forces out of Virginia to meet it, and simultaneously have directly protected the vital railway hub Chattanooga-Atlanta, as well as indirectly the important crossing of the Mississippi at Vicksburg. Although something like this was attempted in a muddled way, because the preser­vation of the Confederacy depended more on husbanding resources than on winning battles, to seek them in Virginia was to squander staying-power.Not until the opening of 1863 was Scott’s project fully1  resorted to by General Ulysses S.
