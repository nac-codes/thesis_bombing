same blunder and with identical results.Throughout the war, the spade increasingly became the complement of the rifle, until, in 1864, every battle fought between Grant and Lee in the Wilderness of Virginia was an entrenched one,1  and when Grant neared Petersburg and Richmond, both sides became so extensively entrenched that siege warfare set in and lasted for nearly ten months. Even in Sherman’s simultaneous advance on Atlanta, the mobility of his campaign was due, not only to his skill in manoeuvring 1  Colonel Theodore Lyman writes: ‘The great feature of this campaign  is the extraordinary use made of earthworks’  Meade's Headquarters  1863-1865  (1922), p. 99.

I remember even line officers, who were at the battle of Chancellorsville, said: “Why, we never saw any Rebels where we were; only smoke and bushes, and lots of our men tumbling about” ; and now I appreciate this most fully. The great art is to conceal  men; for the moment they show, bang , bang , go a dozen cannon, the artillerists only too pleased to get a fair mark. Your typical “great white plain”, with long lines advancing and manoeuv­ring, led on by generals in cocked hats and by bands of music, exist not for us. Here it is, as I said: “Left face-prim e -  forward!” -  and then wrang , wr-r-ang,  for three or four hours, or for all day, and the poor bleeding wounded streaming to the rear. That is a great battle in America.’1It was the rifle bullet and the spade which made the defensive the stronger form of war, a fact also noted by Lyman: T u t a man in a hole’, he said, ‘and a good battery on a hill behind him, and he will beat
