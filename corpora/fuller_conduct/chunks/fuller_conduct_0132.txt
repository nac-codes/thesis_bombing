or in strategy. From Clausewitz he learnt that statecraft and generalship are closely related, and in consequence he took a profound interest in politics and foreign affairs. He was one of the earliest to appreciate the defensive power of the muzzle-loading rifle, and from it he inferred that, except in holding operations, frontal attacks were likely to become too costly to be remunerative; therefore that victory should be sought through envelopment. He was a voluminous writer who, not only produced a large number of military histories, and a technical work on railways, but throughout his life he set down his problems on paper, analysed them, and rewrote them again and again until he was satisfied with their solutions.His studies led him to appreciate that, because armies were growing larger and larger, deployments more and more exten­sive, and means of movement increasingly more rapid, com­mand demanded decentralization. Further, because no plan of operations can with any certainty look beyond the initial clash of major forces, once it has occurred, it is incumbent on subordinate commanders to act on their own initiative, but in accordance with a common doctrine. Therefore, once battle was engaged, general directives should replace detailed orders. In this there was a risk of confusion arising, as it did on several occasions in 1870; but Moltke accepted it as the lesser of two evils, the greater was loss of time.In 1860 he wrote a memoir on the deployment of the Prussian army in the event of a war with Austria, and although it is too long to quote at length, a few brief extracts from its opening paragraphs will give some idea of how Moltke thought out his problems.‘A war between Austria and Prussia would affect all the Powers of Europe; for a considerable success of the one or the other would end the present disintegrated condition of Ger­  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 118 --- many . . . and found in the centre of Europe a united State, which would be equa
