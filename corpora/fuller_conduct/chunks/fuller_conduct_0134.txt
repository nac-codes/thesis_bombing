n deciding the limits up to which we may make the most of our success, or must submit to our misfortune.’1This memoir is a masterpiece of logical reasoning, which during the following six years, as the political situation changed, was periodically brought up to date by Moltke.Moltke’s two wars, the Austro-Prussian of 1866 and the Franco-Prussian of 1870-1871, relaid the political foundations of Europe, and consequently were epoch-making. They created 1  Moltke's Projects for the Campaign of 1866 against Austria , translated  and precised for the General Staff, War Office (London, 1907), pp. 4-6.MOLTKE, FOCH, AND BLOCH 115  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 119 --- 116 THE CONDUCT OF WAR the German Empire and established it as the strategic hub of Europe; for England they evoked a challenging trade com­petitor; they debased the prestige of France, hitherto the leading continental power; and they weakened the Austro- Hungarian empire which, like a bastion, had for centuries protected eastern Europe against the encroachments of Turks and Slavs. The effects of some of these changes will become apparent later, here our observations must be restricted to the conduct of these two wars.When compared with previous wars, their brevity is re­markable. The first war was won by Prussia in seven weeks, and although the second lasted five months, its outcome was decided by the battle of Sedan on 1st September 1870, in slightly less than seven weeks of the French declaration of war. The reasons for these rapid decisions were: the limited nature of both wars, the superiority of the Prussian General Staff, the speed of Prussian mobilization, and superior Prussian tactics.Both wars were limited by their aims. In the Austro- Prussian Bismarck’s policy was closely circumscribed. Because the existence of Austria as a great power was essential to Prussia’s security, it was not to humiliate Austria, or to annex part of her homelands; it was to drive the Austrians out of Germany, and th
