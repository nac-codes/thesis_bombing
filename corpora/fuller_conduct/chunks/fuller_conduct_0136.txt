en weeks. This was due, firstly to the inferiority of its General Staff, which Moltke had closely watched and found very indifferent in the 1864 Schleswig-Holstein War; and secondly, because its infantry were armed with the Lorenz muzzle-loading rifle which, although its range of fire was twice that of the Prussian breech-loading needle gun,1  was completely outclassed by it. Against the massed Austrian formations its fire was deva­stating. At the battle of Nachod, six and a half Prussian battalions, by rifle fire alone, held back twenty-one Austrian battalions for two hours and inflicted five times their own losses on them. At Sadowa, although for the greater part of 3rd July the Austrians fought on the defensive with odds of five to three in their favour, they lost 18,000 in killed and wounded to the Prussian 9,000. Further, the quick and easy loading of the needle gun in the prone position had a demoraliz­ing effect on the Austrian infantry, who had to stand up to load. An Austrian colonel said that in action his men felt themselves disarmed the greater part of the time, while the Prussians were always ready to fire.2Based on his experiences of 1866, in 1869 Moltke issued his Instructions for Commanders of Large Formations , and in them he wrote:‘It is absolutely beyond all doubt that the man who shoots without stirring has the advantage of him who fires while advancing, that the one finds protection in the ground, whereas in it the other finds obstacles, and that, if to the most spirited 1  The former was sighted to 1,000 meters, and the latter to 400.1  Military Reports , Colonel Stoffel (English edition, 1872), p. 64.
