on of what he calls the ‘antiquated methods’  of war which were upset by the French Emperor. He pours scorn on limited warfare, and among others castigates Marshal Saxe for having said: T am not in favour of giving battle; especially at the outset of a war. I am convinced that a clever general can wage war his whole life 1  Seventh edition (1914), pp. 121-3.*  All references are to the English translation by Hilaire Belloc (1918).

Whether by intention or oversight, these words are torn from their context, and misrepresent what Saxe actually had in mind.1Once he has reduced to ridicule a method of warfare utterly repugnant to him, he sets out to prove that ‘Any improvement of firearms is ultimately bound to add strength to the offen­sive. . . . Nothing is easier’, he adds, ‘than to give a mathe­matical demonstration of that truth.’  It is worth quoting, if only to show how completely a rational man may be obssessed by an irrational theory: ‘Suppose you launch 2 battalions against 1You then launch 2,000 men against 1,000With a rifle-fire of 1 shot a minute,1,000 defenders will fire 1,000 bulletsWith the same rifle, 2,000 assailantswill fire 2,000 „Balance in favour of the attack 1,000 „MOLTKE, FOCH, AND BLOCH 123 With a rifle firing 10 shots a minute,1,000 defenders will fire within 1 minute 10,000With the same rifle, 2,000 assailantswill fire 20,000 Balance 10,000 „ ‘As you see, the material superiority of fire quickly increases in favour of the attack as a result of improved firearms. How much more quickly [here enters du Picq] will grow at the same time the ascendancy, the moral superiority of the assail­ant over the defender’  (p. 32).This is mathematical abracadabra. To mention one fact out of several, because 1,000 defenders lying prone will offer but one-eighth of the target of 2,000 assailants advancing, the assailants’  hits must be reduced by seven-eighths; therefore t
