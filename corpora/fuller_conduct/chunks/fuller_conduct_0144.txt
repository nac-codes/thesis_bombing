one fact out of several, because 1,000 defenders lying prone will offer but one-eighth of the target of 2,000 assailants advancing, the assailants’  hits must be reduced by seven-eighths; therefore the balance against the assailants will be 7,500 bullets, and not10,000 in their favour. 1  See above Chapter I, pp. 24-5, for Saxe’s remark in full.

But then, it is also morally that a battle is won, and we may extend the aphorism by saying: A battle won , is a battle in which one will not confess oneself  beaten ' (p. 286).

Also they secured from France ‘most favoured nation treatment’  as regards tariffs and tr
