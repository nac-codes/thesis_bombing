the destruc­tion of that army: namely battle , overthrow by force.9  What does this demand? ‘To seek out the enemy’s armies -  the centre of the adversary’s power -  in order to beat and destroy them; to adopt, with this sole end in view, the direction and tactics which may lead to it in the quickest and safest way: such is the whole mental attitude of modern war’  (p. 42).Therefore for Foch, ‘Tactical results are the only things that matter in w ar... . Where there is no battle, there is no award, nothing is accomplished.. . .  No strategy can henceforth  prevail over that which aims at ensuring tactical results , victory  ty fighting9  (p. 43); and the ‘synthesis we can deduce from history . . .  is characterised by three things: preparation; mass; impulsion’  (p. 44).When he has explained what he means by preparations; in brief, that they must forestall and out-distance those of the enemy, Foch returns to tactical action.‘In what does it consist?’  he asks, and answers: ‘There is but one means of treating with the adversary, namely to beat him, and therefore to overthrow him. Hence the idea of a shock  composed of two terms: mass  and impulsion .’  Because in modern warfare mass absorbs ‘all the physical and moral forces of the country, the same will be true of any tactical operation.. .. The greatest part of our forces, if not the whole, will be reserved as a masse de choc ’  (p. 45).As regards impulsion , ‘Tactics on the battle-field will be the tactics of movement.  The last word of offensive or defensive fighting will be therefore: the troop in movement-  that is, attacking.. . .  The theory which aims at achieving the strongest  possible shock  prescribes to strategy as a primordial condition to bring to the point of shock all  available troops. .. .
