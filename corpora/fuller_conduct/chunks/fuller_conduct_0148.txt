If we did not seek it, it might well either not occur at all, or occur under bad conditions; we might then fail to destroy the forces of the adversary, which is in war the only means of reaching our en d ... . Such is, the first law that governs the theory, a law from which no troop can ever escape and which has been expressed by the military formula: of all faults, one only is degrading, namely inaction9  (p. 45).In the concluding pages of The Principles of War  (pp. 341- 349), Foch discusses the ‘Decisive Attack5 . It is ‘to fall on [the enemy] in numbers  and masses : therein lies salvation5 , because ‘numbers imply moral superiority  in our favour5 , and create ‘surprise in the enemy’s ranks, as well as the conviction that he cannot resist.’The battle is opened by an intense artillery bombardment; preliminary preparations may last for the greater part of the day, and during them the infantry assemble. The moment to act then arrives. ‘In order to decide the enemy to retreat, we must advance  upon him; in order to conquer the position. . . . Here begins . . . the action of infantry in masses. They march straight on to the goal. . . speeding up their pace in proportion as they come nearer.’  When the mass reaches a point 600 to 800 yards distant from the enemy, it develops its maximum fire power.
