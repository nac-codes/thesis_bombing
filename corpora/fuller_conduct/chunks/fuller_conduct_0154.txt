opean settlements on the coasts of Africa, the map of that country was still almost a blank. Thirty years later, in 1900, except for Morocco, Tripoli, Abyssinia and Liberia, in all some1,200,000 square miles in extent, the remaining 10,000,000 square miles of the continent had been parcelled out between Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and Portugal, although much of it was still unexplored.As a whole, this partitioning does not concern us, but 131  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 135 --- 182 THE CONDUCT OF WAR certain items in it do, namely those which led to contentions between the colonizers.In 1875, in order to secure the route to India, the British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, bought the Khedive’s shares in the Suez Canal, a French project opened in 1869, the construction of which had been opposed by Lord Palmerston. Next, in 1877, Britain annexed the Transvaal and two years later conquered Zululand. Because this relieved the Boers of the Zulu menace, like the American colonists after 1763, safety at home led the Boers to seek independence, which, in 1881, they regained by defeating the British in the First Boer War, out of which was to sprout the second.No sooner was this war at an end than the Arabi revolt broke out in Egypt, and Gambetta, then head of the French Government, invited Great Britain to discuss measures to secure the Khedive. But early in 1882 the Gambetta govern­ment fell, and the proposal was abandoned until June, when riots broke out in Alexandria. Britain then asked France to co-operate with her in restoring order, but de Freycinet, now in power, declined the request and so did Italy. In July the British bombarded Alexandria, and on 18th September Sir Garnet Wolseley crushed Arabi Pasha at Tel-el-Kebir. From Egypt the British were drawn into the Sudan, and in 1885 occurred the Gordon tragedy. The conquest of that vast country was then suspended because of the Penjeh crisis, which arose out of a boundary squabble betw
