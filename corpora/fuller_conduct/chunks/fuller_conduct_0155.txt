The conquest of that vast country was then suspended because of the Penjeh crisis, which arose out of a boundary squabble between Great Britain and Russia in Turkistan, and it was not revived until 1898, when on 2nd September General Sir Herbert Kitchener’s victory over the Sudanese at Omdurman led to the annexation of the Sudan.In the meantime France had extended her power over the vast regions of the Sahara and, in 1881, occupied Tunisia, much to the annoyance of the Italians.

It aroused the envy of Ger­man merchants interested in Africa, and due to their pressure and the growing need for new regions to absorb Germany’s increasing trade, Bismarck was at length convinced that the time had come to provide Germany with colonies. The result was that, in 1884, Germany occupied the coast of Angra Pequena in South West Africa, Togoland, Cameroon, and part of New Guinea, to which, in 1885, the hinterland of Zanzibar was added, to become German East Africa. This led to tension with Great Britain, because German South-West Africa was adjacent to Cape Colony, and New Guinea to Australia.
