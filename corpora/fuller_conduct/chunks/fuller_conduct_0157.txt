ountry to be carved up.Thus, by the close of the century, eight Western European powers -  Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and the Netherlands -  together in extent slightly under1.000.000 square miles, had within a generation added some11.000.000 square miles of foreign territories to their home­lands; an area three and half times the size of the United States, and rather more than one-fifth of the land surface of the globe! So extensive a conquest had no equal since the invasions of the Mongols in the thirteenth century, and no previous conquest had been so rapid and bloodless since the age of Alexander the Great. Like his, it was destined to be followed by the wars of its Diadochi. 2 •  M ilitary Developments 1870-1903 The period of Colonial expansion coincided with three major developments in weapon-power: the general adoption of the small-bore magazine rifle, firing smokeless powder; the per­fection of the machine gun; and the introduction of quick- firing artillery.By 1871, the single-shot breech-loading rifle had reached so high a standard of efficiency that the next step was to con­vert it into a repeating, or magazine, rifle. Although the idea was an old one, it was not fully practicable until the adoption of the all-metal cartridge case, which reduced jamming in the breech. The first European Power to introduce the magazine rifle was Germany who, in 1884, converted her 1871 pattern Mauser rifle to the magazine system; the magazine was of the tube type inserted in the fore-end under the barrel, it held eight cartridges. In 1885, France adopted a somewhat similar rifle, the Lebel, which fired smokeless powder -  an enormous advan­tage. Next, in 1886, the Austrians introduced the Mannlicher with a box magazine in front of the trigger guard and below the entrance of the breech. And two years later the British adopted the .303 calibre Lee-Metford with a box magazine of  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 138 --- THE ROOTS OF ARMAGED
