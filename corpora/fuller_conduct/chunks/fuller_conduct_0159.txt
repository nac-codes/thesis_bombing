Already in the Crimean War traction engines had been employed to haul trains of loaded wagons from the magazines at Balaclava to the front over tracts of country impassable for horsed vehicles. Again in the Franco-Prussian and the Russo-Turkish Wars they were so used, as well as for the haulage of heavy guns. Between 1872 1  An excellent gun, first introduced toward the end of the American  Civil War.

In November, 1899, the British Government dispatched twenty-four to assist in the war in South Africa; others followed, including six armoured road trains, each of which consisted of an armoured traction engine and four armoured wagons; the armour was a quarter of an inch thick and could resist direct rifle fire at twenty yards. Both the engine-driver’s cab and the wagons were loop- holed for rifle fire, and one idea was to use these armoured trains as self-contained mobile block-houses, which could move across the veld from point to point: but there is no record that they were so used.This problem was, however, not to be solved by steam-power but by petroleum, the rapid production of which in the United States from 1859 on brought it more and more into commercial use,1  and in 1876 led to the invention of the stationary gas engine2  by Doctor N. A. Otto. Next, in 1885, Gottlieb Daimler devised an internal combustion motor using petroleum spirit, and fitted it to a bicycle:3  such was the first step taken toward the production of the modem petrol driven road vehicle. Two years later MM. Panhard and Levessor secured the French patents from Daimler for the
