t to a bicycle:3  such was the first step taken toward the production of the modem petrol driven road vehicle. Two years later MM. Panhard and Levessor secured the French patents from Daimler for the propulsion of road carriages. From then until 1894 little interest was shown in them; but that year the Petit Journal  gave impetus to the French motor car industry by organizing a trial run of motor vehicles from Paris to Rouen. It aroused so much interest that in the follow­ing year a race was organized from Paris to Bordeaux and back, a distance of 744 miles, and the winner covered it at a mean speed of fifteen miles per hour. The next year, 1896, motor vehicles first took part in the French army manoeuvres, and three years later the first tactical motor vehicle, a four- wheeled cycle, equipped with a Maxim gun which could be fired from it through an armoured shield when in motion, was 1  In 1850 2,000 barrels were produced; in 1869 -  4,215,000; and in  1879 -19,914,146.:In idea old. The first constructed would appear to be Christian  Huygens’ in 1680; it was worked by gunpower and air.9  Also in 1885, Butler in England propelled a tricycle by means of an  internal combustion engine using benzoline vapour.

Toward the end of the century pro­pulsion by means of the internal combustion engine had so far advanced that, on 17th May 1900, Mr Arthur Balfour said in the House of Commons, he sometimes dreamed that in addition to railways and tramways, the future might see ‘great high­ways constructed for rapid motor traffic, and confined to motor traffic.’1But the greatest triumph of the new engine was yet to come. On 17th December 1903, at Kill Devil Hill, Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Orville Wright in a power-driven aeroplane flew for twelve seconds, and thereby added a third dimension to war.In the internal combustion engine lay hidden the greatest revolution in civil life and
