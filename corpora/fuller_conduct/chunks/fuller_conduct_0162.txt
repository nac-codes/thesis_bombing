CONDUCT OF WAR fluences on civil life and on naval strategy were enormous, and no wit less so on land and air warfare. Also it went far, if not to create psychological warfare, to give world-wide power to propaganda; to dement entire nations by transforming the spoken and written word into a weapon of war possessed of the velocity of light and in radius global. Further, it led to the development of the science of electronics.In 1903, although the influences of these amazing changes lay behind the iron curtain of the future, that curtain was by no means altogether impenetrable. Nevertheless, it was so little penetrated by the minds of statesmen and soldiers that the conduct of future warfare was to be reduced to a game of chance- a blind gamble between players who moved their pieces in the dark on a totally novel kind of board. 3 •  The Last of the Wars of Expansion At the close of the nineteenth century and at the opening of the twentieth two small wars and one major one were fought; the Spanish-American War of 1898; the Anglo-Boer War of 1899- 1902; and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. Beside their political importance, all three are of considerable tactical interest, because they were the first in which the new weapons were put to the test.The dominant cause of the first of these wars was that, with the projected Panama Canal in mind, the United States was determined to oust Spain from the Caribbean Sea; a long­standing aim of successive administrations since the time of Jefferson, because it was feared that Cuba might fall into other European hands than those of Spain.

Politically, the war was important, because it raised the United States from the position of a continental power to that of an inter-continental one; mili­tarily it was a small affair. Its two naval battles were execu­tions
