than a localized danger, now enveloped the attacker, while the defender, always ready to protect himself by some rough earth- or stone-work, was enabled, because of the rapidity of rifle fire, to use extensions unheard of in former battles, and in consequence overlap every frontal infantry attack. Thus, at the battle of the Modder River, the Boers extended 3,000 men on a frontage of 7,700 yards; at Magers- fontein, 5,000 on 11,000; and at Colenso, 4,500 on 13,000. Yet in spite of this human thinness, these fronts could not be penetrated.After the battle of Paardeberg, on 18th February 1900, the Boers took to guerrilla warfare, and the war proper may be said to have begun. It was to last until 31st May 1902; absorb in all 450,000 British soldiers, many of whom were mounted infantry, and was brought to a successful conclusion by an audacious scheme which struck at the enemy’s mobility. A vast network of fenced block-house lines was woven over thousands of square miles of the theatre of war; these split it up into horse-proof areas. Next, one after another of them was cleared by mounted columns. It was a long process of attrition, but an eminently successful one.The causes of the Russo-Japanese War were Russia’s east­ward expansion, which aimed at absorbing Korea, and the rise of Japanese imperialism. Because the Japanese realized that they would be no match against the Russians once the gap in the trans-Siberian railway at Lake Baikal had been filled, they determined to strike while strategy favoured them.
