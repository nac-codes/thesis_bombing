d before the next winter set in, not only would the Russian warships at Vladivostok be cut off from those at Port Arthur, but should the Russian Baltic fleet be sent east, without Port Arthur it would be denied an ice-free base of operations. Therefore the Japanese plan was to wrest Port Arthur from the Russians, and next concentrate the whole of their land forces in a great battle, the loss of which it was hoped would persuade the Russians to abandon the war.Officially, the war was declared on 10th February 1904, and its operations may be listed under three headings: (1) The siege and fall of Port Arthur, which included the destruction of the Russian squadron in its harbour; (2) the series of Japanese victorious land battles, which culminated in the battle of Mukden, fought between 23rd February and 10th March 1905; and (3) the annihilation of the Russian Baltic fleet in the Strait of Tsushima on 27th May 1905.

Therefore, from a purely strategical point of view, in spite of her tactical victories, the odds were against her winning the war.That she did so was due to the collapse of the Russian inner front.

In October the Tzar gave way, and a par
