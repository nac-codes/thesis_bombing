This meant that the war would affect the whole continent, and were its outcome -  that is, the peace which followed it -  to be profitable to the victor, then it was incumbent on the members of each alliance to decide on a common policy which would direct them toward that end. Were this not done, the war must inevitably be a chaotic one, and the peace which followed it none the less so.Because the Entente alliance was more complex than that of the two Central Powers -  Germany and Austria1  -and because it was compelled to operate on exterior lines, it may be accepted as axiomatic that no common policy could have been agreed by all its members. But for its two major ones, France and Great Britain, this most certainly was not so, and from 1904 on there had been ample time for them to arrive at a common policy governed by a positive political aim -  the nature of the peace it would be most profitable for them to establish. Clausewitz had written: ‘The subordination of the political point of view to the military would be contrary to common sense’, because ‘policy is the intelligent faculty, war only the instrument.’  But in August 1914, there was no Anglo- French political point of view,2  therefore the military point of view was subordinated to a vacuum, which it at once filled to become the sole point of view: in other words, the means monopolized the end.Throughout the war, this led to an intermittent wrangle over unity of command; a futile one,3  because without unity 1  Italy declared her neut
