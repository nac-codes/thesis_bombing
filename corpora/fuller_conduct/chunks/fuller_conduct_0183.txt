Aware that the Russian mobilization would be considerably slower than the French, and correctly anticipating that the bulk of the French forces would assemble on the line M^zieres-Epinal, he decided to oppose the Russians with an army of ten division and local troops (the Eighth Army) in East Prussia while the Austrian armies advanced into Galicia, and deploy seven armies against France on the line Krefeld-Mulhausen, five (First to Fifth) north of Metz, and two (Sixth and Seventh) south of it.
