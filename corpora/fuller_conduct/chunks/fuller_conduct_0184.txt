aff he was Commander-in- Chief all but in name, once his armies had been deployed, he looked upon his role as no more than that of a starter of a race -  all he had to do was to lower the flag, and then leave operations to his generals. He did not believe in executive control, worse still, he feared it, and ‘actually drew some comfort from the Emperor’s frequent declarations that in the event of war he would himself command in the west.’1Although Moltke had in 1906 accepted Schlieffen’s plan, 1  The German General Staff , Walter Goiiitz (1953), p. 144.THE CONDUCT OF WORLD WAR I 155  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 159 --- 156 THE CONDUCT OF WAR in 1912, at Schlieffen’s suggestion, he changed it. On the French front he substituted for Schlieffen’s original idea of a Leuthen the idea of a Cannae (216 B .C .).

Not only would this strengthen the right wing, b u t- a s  im p o rtan t-it would necessitate the weakened left wing falling back, which, in its turn, would draw the French armies eastward, and the farther east they advanced the more decisive would his rear attack become. This move Moltke cancelled, and he brought the strength of the left wing up to forty-two per cent, of that of the right wing.The French plan was a piece of back-stairs jobbery. In 1911, General Michel, at the time general-in-chief designate in the event of war, held that the Germans would advance through Belgium, and that therefore the most powerful French forces should be assembled on the left. The Comite des Forges de  France  disagreed, because this would not sufficiently p
