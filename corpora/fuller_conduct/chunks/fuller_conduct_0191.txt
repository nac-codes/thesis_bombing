e the Western Front ended in costly failure.Exasperated by these unprofitable assaults, and ignorant of tactical considerations, the allied statesmen accused the soldiers of lack of imagination,2  and set out to recapture mobility by a change of front, as if the locality itself was to blame for the stalemate.
