This led to the Allied Macedonian campaign, or, as the Germans said: ‘To the for­mation of the largest Allied “concentration camp”, with “an enemy army prisoner of itself”. ’2  For three years around Salonika, writes General Edmonds, ‘a great Allied Force was locked up; in 1917 the average British strength was 202,265, besides French, Italians, Russians, Serbs, making a total of over 600,000 . . .  and this force was guarded by half of the Bulgarian army with a little German stuffing.’3  Once again the defensive trinity had proved invincible. The British bill for this escapade was a total of 481,262 sick admitted to hospital, and 26,750 casualties in action.In the meantime the solitary brigade at Abadan, as a set-off for the Gallipoli failure and Salonika fiasco, had grown into an army, whose aim was to occupy Baghdad. Thus the costly Mesopotamian campaign came into being.
