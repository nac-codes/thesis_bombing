3,500.Besides these three large diversionary operations, a fourth  emerged out of the protection of the Suez Canal. In January  1915, it was threatened by a medley of some 15,000 to 20,000 Turkish and Bedouin troops, who were easily dealt with, and 1  This was the nominal reason; the actual one was to find a job for  General Sarrail, who had great influence with the Left, which at the  time threatened the downfall of the Government.*  A Short History of World War  1, Sir James E.

Then, with the advent of Mr Lloyd George as Prime  Minister, an offensive strategy was resorted to.

Thus another costly sideshow  was born, which was to drag on until the end of the war.

This figure, however, has little relation to the gross  wastage, for the total number employed up to October, 1918, amounted in all ranks to 1,192,511.*1All these peripheral endeavours to discover a penetrable  front were a waste of effort, and in expenditure of man-power-  the vital factor in mass-warfare -  costly in the extreme. The  stalemate laughed each to scorn. 4 •  Strategy of Attrition When, in the autumn of 1914, the Germans and British reached the English Channel near Nieuport, the Western Front assumed the shape of a huge salient which bulged west­ward between the sea and the Vosges with its apex
