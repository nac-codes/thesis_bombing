during the mobile period of the war, it would have been  possible to penetrate the unentrenched, or slightly entrenched,  fronts of those days. This was one of the lessons Napoleon had  taught his age, and he had said: ‘It is only with artillery that  one makes war.’1  Now, when the opportunity had passed, and  entrenched fronts were daily growing deeper and deeper, the  French General Staff fondly imagined that they had discovered  the secret of victory in the aphorism ‘Artillery conquers,  infantry occupies’. Tactics were reduced to a matter of push  of pikes -  actually push of sh ells-d rill took the place of  manoeuvre, method of surprise, and bombardments replaced  leadership. Tactics, in fact, reverted to their level under the  Spartans in the fifth century B.C., with one marked difference -  the generals never went into battle.It is understandable that the paltry gains and colossal  losses of these artillery battles terrified the politicians and  added fuel to their escapist policy. And there is this to be said  for it: should attrition, as the generals urged, be accepted as  the tactical norm, and should the Central Powers refuse to  come to terms, there could be no end to the war except mutual  extermination. On the other hand, because the war was a  conflict between two alliances, no single member of either  alliance was a free agent. Since the autumn of 1914 the Russians  had suffered a series of disastrous defeats, therefore the Entente  armies could not look idly on and leave their ally in the lurch.  It was imperative to come to his aid, and only less so in order 1  Corresp.,  XIV, No. 11896.
