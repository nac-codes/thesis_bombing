foreseen, that mass warfare,  based on the magazine rifle and machine gun, if not impossible,  as he declared it to be, was at best an unremunerative instru­ment of policy; nowhere could the bullet be escaped, and no­where could a well-established entrenched system be decisively  broken.In the eastern theatre of the war, because of its vast spaces,  fronts could frequently be turned, but in the western they  stood inviolate. Nevertheless, it is strange that the soldiers  so slowly fathomed the crucial difficulty in trench warfare.  Experience had now taught them that with a sufficiency of  artillery they could occupy their enemy’s front line, and from  this they concluded that, with more and more artillery, they  would be able to take his second line, his third line, and so on  until complete penetration was effected. What they failed to  understand was, that the more shells they hurled at the  enemy’s entrenchments, the more would the surface of the  ground be damaged, and from a normal battlefield it would  grow into a crater area. Thus, in the removal of one obstacle  they would create another, which would make forward move­ment so difficult that, even were the infantry to pass through  the crater zone, they could not be supplied. Roads would have  to be built through the chaos to enable the guns and supply  vehicles to move forward, and by the time they were built, the  enemy would be re-entrenched. Then another battle of pene­tration would have to be fought.Undeterred by the holocausts of 1915, early in December, at an Allied conference, under the presidency of General Joffre, it was decided to prepare a ‘maximum’  offensive on the Western Front for the following spring. But before preparations were completed, the Germans struck at Verdun.According to General Falkenhayn, who had succeeded  Moltke as Chief of the German General Staff, the aim of the  Verdun offensive was to weaken ‘the enormous hold England  still had on her allies’, and because ‘the strain on F
