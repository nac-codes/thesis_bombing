nhayn, who had succeeded  Moltke as Chief of the German General Staff, the aim of the  Verdun offensive was to weaken ‘the enormous hold England  still had on her allies’, and because ‘the strain on France had  almost reached breaking-point’, were Verdun wrested from  her, ‘that breaking-point would be reached and England’s bestTHE CONDUCT OF WORLD WAR I 167  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 171 --- 168 THE CONDUCT OF WAR sword knocked out of her hand.’ Verdun was selected because  its retention would compel the French General Staff ‘to throw  in every man they had. If they do so’, writes Falkenhayn, ‘the  forces of France will bleed to d e a th -a s there can be no  question of a voluntary withdrawal -  whether we reach our  goal or not.’1  Verdun was, therefore, to be another battle of  attrition.On 21st February 1916, the battle was launched on a front of twenty miles, and although the French knew that it was impending, because its preliminary bombardment was limited to twenty-four hours, instead of the normal week or more, it came as a surprise to them. Fighting went on until 11th July, by when a penetration of five miles had been effected at a loss to the Germans of 281,000 men, and to the French of 315,000.To relieve the pressure on Verdun, the long delayed Franco- British spring offensive, known as the Battle of the Somme, was launched on a twenty-five miles front on 1st July. It was preceded by a bombardment of eight days, in which 1,738,000 shells were poured onto the enemy’s defences. Its tactical surprise was the introduction of the rolling barrage, under cover of which the infantry slowly moved forward from objec­tive to objective. The battle continued until 14th November, by when a strip of ground some thirty miles long with a maxi­mum depth of seven miles had been conquered at a cost of 419,654 British and 194,451 French casualties. The German losses were probably in the neighbourhood of half a million.Although Sir Douglas Haig2  was well pleased
