three and a half months. When, on 10th November, the battle ended, the Germans had been pushed back a maximum depth of five miles on a frontage of ten miles, at a cost of a little under 200,000 men to themselves, and, at the lowest estimate, of 300,000 to their enemy.8Thus ended the last of the great artillery battles of attrition  on the Western Front, and when in retrospect they are looked  on, it becomes understandable why the politicians were so  eager to escape them. 1  A History of the Great War, 1914-1918  (1934), p. 488.*  These are Captain B.

Without the rifleman, trenches were no more than ditches and entanglements fences. It was the man with the rifle or machine gun in the trench and behind the wire who gave tactical value to both; therefore the solution lay either in eliminating him or in disarming him. Could one or the other be done without months of preparation, which prohibited surprise, and without upheaving the surface of the battlefield, which impeded forward wheeled movement, the problem was solvable.The first step toward the solution was taken by the Germans. In spite of being a party to the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibited the use of poisons as weapons, they decided to adopt Dundonald’s proposal of 1812 and 1855, and asphyxi­ate their enemy’s trench garrisons with toxic gas. They selected chlorine, a common commercial product easily obtainable in quantity, and the method of discharge was to be from metal cylinders built into the front line parapet. Fortunately for the British and French, the Germans failed to realize that they had a battle winner, ajid instead of waiting until they had accumu­lated suffi
