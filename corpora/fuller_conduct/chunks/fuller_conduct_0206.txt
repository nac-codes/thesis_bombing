inders built into the front line parapet. Fortunately for the British and French, the Germans failed to realize that they had a battle winner, ajid instead of waiting until they had accumu­lated sufficient cylinders to asphyxiate a wide front, so it would appear, they looked upon their lethal gas attack as a minor experiment. The locality selected was a section of the north-eastern face of the Ypres salient, at the junction of the French and British lines, held by the Turcos and Canadians.The attack was made at 5 p.m. on 22nd April 1915. It opened with a furious bombardment, and as it ceased a greenish-yellow gas rose from the German front line and drifted toward the enemy. Its effect was devastating; all men close to the front were choked to death, and those on the edges of the gas cloud broke to the rear in wild panic. Gas was again discharged on the 24th, and the outcome was that the Franco- British line was compelled to fall back three miles nearer in to Ypres. W hat the Germans had failed to reckon, was that a chlorine gas attack was unlikely to be repeated with equal success, because it could be countered by means of masks or cloth helmets impregnated with a suitable solution.

Also it was a purely static method of attack.These disadvantages were overcome by the introduction of the gas shell,2  which was largely independent of wind, which enabled sudden concentrations of gas to be landed on selected targets, which needed no special training, a
