The whole operation was over in a few hours, and its success was due to his tactics, the aim of which was, not to demolish wire and trenches, but to incapacitate their defenders.These tactics were consistently resorted to by the Germans in their great battles on the Western Front in March, April, May and June 1918. In them phosgene and mustard gas were used on a lavish scale before each was launched, with the aim of destroying the enemy’s morale. Between 21st March and 5th April gas was one of the most important factors1  that enabled the Germans to drive the British back on a front fifty miles between Arras and La Fere, and advance to a depth of nearly forty miles. And, in April, Armenti&res was inundated with mustard gas to such an extent that it is said to have run in the gutters of its streets. It enabled the Germans to take the town, without entering it, at practically no loss of life.In the American attack on the St Mihiel Salient in September  1918, and in subsequent operations, severe casualties were  inflicted by German gas shelling. And it is instructive to note  that, out of the total American casualties suffered in the war -  namely 258,338 -  70,752, or 27.4 percent., were gas casualties.2  Also, while 46,419 of the total casualties were fatal, only 1,400 due to gas resulted in death -  that is, 2 per cent, compared  with 24.85 per cent. Contrary to common belief, gas was the  most humane weapon used in the war, and one of the most  effective; even when the respirator gave 100 per cent, im­munity, when worn it reduced the soldier to half a fighting  man, and it gave little protection against mustard gas.The second step toward solving the stalemate was, as we  have
