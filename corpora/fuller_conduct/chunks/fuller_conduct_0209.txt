gave 100 per cent, im­munity, when worn it reduced the soldier to half a fighting  man, and it gave little protection against mustard gas.The second step toward solving the stalemate was, as we  have said, to disarm the defender by rendering his rifles and  machine guns ineffective. This could be done by protecting the  attacker with a bullet-proof shield of sufficient size to cover 1  In volume II, p. 597 of his memoirs General Ludendorff writes:  . .  our artillery relied on gas for its effect;’ and on p. 579: that the  artillery bombardment was to be powerful and short, ‘to paralyse the  enemy’s artillery’ and ‘keep the infantry in their dug-outs.’*  See Chemical Warfare,  Brigadier-General Amos A. Fries and Major  Clarence J. West (1921), p. 388.  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 178 --- his body when in movement. As it would be too heavy for him to  carry, it would have to be mounted on a self-propelled vehicle,  which also would need to be armoured, and because this  vehicle would have to move off the roads and over an en­trenched battlefield, it would have to be provided with cater­pillar tracks instead of wheels. These three requirements led  to the introduction of the tank, a small mobile fort, or, as it  was first called, ‘a land ship*.The idea was an exceedingly old one, but was impracticable  until the invention of the internal combustion engine, and no  sooner did the stalemate set in than independently in Britain  and France a number of imaginative men put forward various  suggestions on how armour could reinstate mobility.1Tanks were first used on 15th September 1916, during the Battle of the Somme. Due to mechanical breakdowns and the difficulties of the cratered and entrenched battlefield few got into action, but those which did showed that, with improved machinery and increased numbers used in mass, instead of in driblets, the stalemate might be broken. This is borne out by the German account which said, ‘that their men felt powerless to with
