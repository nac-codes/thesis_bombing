ave seen, he proclaimed an unrestricted submarine campaign, and in April the United States declared war on Germany.The blockade struck at every man, woman and child, every  factory and every farm in the enemy countries, and by the  summer of 1918, had it not been for the wheat of Rumania and  the Ukraine, the Central Powers would have been starved into  capitulation. By then, cattle in Austria and Hungary had,  since August 1914, decreased from 17,324,000 to 3,518,000, and pigs from 7,678,000 to 214,000.2  Also it has been estimated  that, during the last two years of the blockade, ‘800,000 non-  combatants died in Germany from starvation or diseases  directly attributed to under-nourishment -  about fifty times  more than were drowned by submarine attack on British  shipping.’3 1  Soldiers and Statesmen , Vol. I, p. 818.*  Military Operations, Italy, 1915-1919  (British Official History,  1949), p. 379.3  Unfinished Victory,  Arthur Bryant (1940), p. 8.

Napoleon could to his advantage have unleashed the ‘pent-up animosity’  of the Russian serfs and Ukrainians in 1812, and have stirred up a revolution in France during the Hundred Days, but he refrained to do so.1  The Duke of Wellington, as he himself tells us, had a horror of fomenting revolution in any country; and, in 1871, Bismarck did not befriend the Paris Commune. The reason was that, in times past, war was waged to change the enemy’s policy, and not to change his government -  the policy maker. Its aim was to change the government’s mind, and should the government be overthrown, there would be no stable authority to negoti
