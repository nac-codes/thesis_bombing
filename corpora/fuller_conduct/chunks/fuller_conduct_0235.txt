In all Russia lost 26 per cent, of her  population, 27 per cent, of her agricultural land, 26 per cent  of her railways, and three-quarters of her coal and iron.  So crippling and degrading were these losses that the Left  Socialist Revolutionaries resigned from the Government;  peasant risings followed and were ruthlessly suppressed.No sooner was the treaty signed than the Soviet regime was confronted with intervention on the part of Russia’s allies,2  as well as with civil war from the Baltic to the Black Sea and from Murmansk to Vladivostok.

As in the French Revolution, foreign intervention led to a wholsesale terror, during which, on 16th July, Nicholas II and his family were butchered at Ekaterinburg.The civil war reached its climax in the autumn of 1919 and the winter of 1920; one by one the White Russian generals were defeated, in part by Bolshevik propaganda, in part by the Red Army, but in the main because their aim was to restore the old regime, and this lost to them the support of the peasants, who feared that their recently gained lands would be restored to their former owners. As the civil war petered out, the interventionist forces were withdrawn, but Russia’s troubles were not ended. On 25th April 1920, the Poles, under Marshal Joseph Pilsudski, advanced on Kiev; were driven back to Warsaw where, between 16th and 25th August, the Bolshevik general Mikail Tukhachevski was routed, and central1  See The Communis
