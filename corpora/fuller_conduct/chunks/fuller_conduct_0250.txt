t go to the end.‘(2) You must concentrate a great superiority of forces  at the  decisive point, at the decisive moment, otherwise the enemy,  who has the advantage of better preparation and organization,  will destroy the insurgents.‘(3) Once the insurrection has begun, you must act with the greatest determination , and by all means, without fail, take the offensive.  “The defensive is the death of every armed rising.”‘(4) You must try to take the enemy by surprise and seize the moment when his forces are scattered.‘(5) You must strive for daily  successes, even if small (one might say, hourly, if it is the case of one town), and at all costs retain “moral ascendancy .”‘Marx summarized the lessons of all revolutions in respect  to armed insurrection in the words of Danton, “the greatest  master of revolutionary tactics yet known”:  “audacity,  audacity, and once again audacity”. uStalin quotes these instructions in his Problems of Leninism , and adds to them:‘The decisive battle, says Lenin, may be deemed to have fully matured i f “(1) all the class forces hostile to us have become sufficiently entangled, are sufficiently at loggerheads, have sufficiently weakened themselves in a struggle which is beyond their strength” ; if “(2) all the vacillating, wavering, unstable, elements -  the petty-bourgeoisie, the petty-bourgeois democrats as distinct from the bourgeoisie -  have sufficiently exposed themselves in the eyes of the people, have sufficiently disgraced themselves through their practical bankruptcy” ; if “(3) among the proletariat a mass sentiment in favour of supporting the most determined, supremely bold, revolution­ary action against the bourgeoisie has arisen and begun vigorously to grow. Then revolution is indeed ripe; then, indeed, if we have correctly gauged all the conditions indi­cated above. . .  and if we have chosen the moment rightly, our victory is assured”.’2 1  Selected Works , Vol. II, pp. 133-4.2  Problems of Leninism , pp. 86-87.SOVIET REVO
