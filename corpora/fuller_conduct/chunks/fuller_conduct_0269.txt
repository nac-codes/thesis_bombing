In opposition to Keynes he held that justice demanded  that Germany should pay for the whole damage caused by the  war,3  and he set out to prove that many of Keynes’s forecasts  were not verified by subsequent events.

Soon  it was discovered that, in order to revive their international  trade, it was more profitable for them to restore Germany’s  economy than to shackle it. Failure to do so, Keynes had pre­dicted would inevitably lead to another European explosion.‘If we aim deliberately’, he wrote, ‘at t
