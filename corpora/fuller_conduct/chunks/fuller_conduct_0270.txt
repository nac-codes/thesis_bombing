fitable for them to restore Germany’s  economy than to shackle it. Failure to do so, Keynes had pre­dicted would inevitably lead to another European explosion.‘If we aim deliberately’, he wrote, ‘at the impoverishment  of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp.  Nothing can then delay for very long that final civil war  between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions  of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war  will fade into nothing, and which will destroy, whoever is  victor.’1Further he forecast that the only way full reparations could  be exacted was to nurse the trade and industry of Germany for  a period of five to ten years; supply her with large loans, and  make her the greatest industrial nation in Europe.2  In a blind  and confused way the course of events forced the victors into  this direction.In December 1922, Germany defaulted on her reparation  payments, and to enforce them, on 11th January 1923, French  and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr. Thereupon the mark  crashed, and in the following November stood at the fantastic  figure of 4,200,000,000,000 to the dollar. The currency was  then stabilized at 1,000,000,000,000 paper marks for one reten - mark , and in April 1924, the Dawes Committee recommended  that a loan of 800 million gold marks be granted to Germany  in order to place her currency on a new basis. No sooner was  this agreed than foreign capital began to pour into Germany,  and during the period of the Dawes Plan -  that is up to 1929 -  its net importation was more than twice the amount of repara­tion payments. As Mantoux admits: ‘Reparations were being  paid, literally, with the money of foreign investors, not with  the savings and taxes of the German people.’3  Also he writes:  ‘Mr. Keynes had predicted that the Reparation clauses could 1  Op. cit., p. 251. *  Ibid., p. 189. #  Op. cit., p. 147.
