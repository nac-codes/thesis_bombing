This outcome has  earned him the glory of a prophet.’1  Not alone so, because he  also predicted that:‘When Germany has recovered her strength and pride, as  in due time she will, many years must pass before she again  casts her eyes Westward. Germany’s future now lies in the  East, and in that direction her hopes and ambitions, when  they revive, will certainly turn.’2The crux of the whole problem has concisely been stated by Professor E. H. Carr: ‘The victors of 1918 “lost the peace” in Central Europe because they continued to pursue a principle of political and economic disintegration in an age which called for larger and larger units.’3  In other words, the Treaty should have aimed at the integration of Europe, if only in order to eliminate the economic causes of war.On 28th June 1919, the Treaty of Versailles was signed by the German plenipotentiaries at the pistol point of the block­ade, and therefore was morally invalid. The other treaties were as bad, notably those of Trianon and St. Germain, which organized chaos in Central Europe.4  In one and all, instead of there being no annexations, no contributions, no punitive damages, these three malignant viruses of war were im­planted, and as to the self-determination of peoples, instead of the peacemakers regarding it as ‘an imperative principle of action’, they ignored it as ‘a mere phrase’.Colonel Hoffman Nickerson has written that he suspects ‘. . . that the worst bunch of autocrats known in history -  say Nero, Heliogabalus, Caesar Borgia and Louis XV -  given the Europe of 1919, would have mustered up enough collective intelligence and good will to make something of it.’  Neverthe­less, in the final reckoning, it was not Wilson, nor Clemenceau, 1  Ibid., p. 155.*  A  Revision of the Treaty ,
