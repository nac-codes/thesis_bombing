Yet,  in spite of her reviving prosperity, when Hitler was freed, he  persistently predicted impending disaster. In 1929 it came and  with a vengeance. A crash on the American Stock Exchange  precipitated a world-wide monetary depression, which was to  last until 1932.For Germany’s artificial prosperity it was catastrophic.
