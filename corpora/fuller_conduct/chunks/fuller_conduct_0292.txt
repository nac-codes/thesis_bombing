.The leading exponent of the offensive use of aircraft was the  Italian General Guilio Douhet, whose theories, elaborated in  his book The Command of the A ir,1  had a profound influence  on war, and tallied closely with those held by General William  Mitchell in the United States and General Sir Hugh Trenchard  in England.Douhet was looked upon as a futurist; but actually he was a tactical reactionary, because he harked back to the great artillery bombardments of World War I, which were purely destructive operations, and tilted them from an horizontal into a vertical position. He compared the aeroplane ‘to a special gun capable of firing shells a distance equal to its flying range’; therefore an air force was no more than ‘a large battery of guns’  (p. 162). He held that, ‘Because of independence of surface limitations and its superior speed . . .  the aeroplane is the offensive weapon par excellence*  (p. 18). ‘What determines victory in aerial warfare’, he writes, ‘is fire power. Speed serves only to come to grips with the foe.. . .  A slower, heavily armed plane, able to clear its way with its own armament, can always get the best of the fastest pursuit plane’  (p. 41).2  Therefore in air warfare there is no need to consider the defensive, whether in the air or on the ground, and, in consequence, air power should act independently of armies and fleets. ‘All possible resources must be used to strengthen the Independent Air Force so that it can operate and defend itself in the air solely by means of intensive and violent offensives.. . . ’  This ‘statement is fundamental and admits no exceptions’  (p. 95). 1  The first edition was published in Italy in 1921, and the second  edition in 1927. The English edition (1943) is a translation of the latter,  and references are to it.*  This contradicts what he had written on p. 34: ‘An Independent  Air Force should be organically composed of bombing units and combat  units . . .  the second to protect the bombers.’  File:
