This is repeated time and again, and, granted a superior air force, Douhet light-heartedly assumes that com­mand of the air can be gained within a few days of the outbreak of war.Once command of the air is gained, the second phase opens; its aim is to obliterate the enemy. The targets should be ‘industrial and commercial establishments; important build­ings . . .  transportation arteries and centres; and . .. areas of civilian population’  (p. 22). Further, ‘in the future, war will be waged essentially against the unarmed populations of  the cities and great industrial centres'  (p. 223). ‘The guiding principle of bombing action should be this: the objective must be destroyed completely in one attack’  (p. 22). This would appear to be easy, because it cannot be denied ‘that 1,000 tons of explosive, incendiary, and poison-gas bombs dropped on Paris or London could destroy these cities’  (p. 150).‘A complete breakdown of the social structure’, he writes, ‘canno
