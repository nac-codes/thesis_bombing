eneral Staffs of the French and British Tank Corps; but whereas the former adhered to close co-operation between tanks and infantry -  as illustrated in the Cambrai tactics -  from the earliest days the latter had considered the independent use of tanks and the future development of tank armies including all arms. These ideas were founded on the traditional conception of battle as a clinch and struggle between armed forces, and although tactically sound, they excluded the use of a very different tactical idea, which the tank rendered practical. This idea first occurred to the writer in the summer of 1917, and reached maturity in March the following year, when the Germans broke through the British Fifth Army.In the debacle which followed he saw tens of thousands of  men pulled back by their panic-stricken headquarters. He saw  Army Headquarters retire, then Corps, next Divisional, and  lastly Brigade, or vice versa.  He saw the intimate connection  between will and action; that action without will loses co­ordination; that without a directing brain an army is reduced  to a mob. Then it became fully apparent to him that by means  of the tank a new tactics could be evolved, which would enable  a comparatively small tank army to fight battles like Issus  and Arbela over again. What was their tactical secret? It was  that, while Alexander’s phalanx held the Persian battle-body  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 246 --- THE TWENTY YEARS ARMISTICE 2 4 3 in a clinch, he and his Companion Cavalry struck at the enemy’s will, concentrated as it was in the person of Darius. Once this will was paralysed, the body became inarticulate.In May 1918, this idea was elaborated in a long memorandum, entitled ‘Strategical Paralysis as the Object of the Decisive Attack’, later changed to ‘Plan 1919’.1  Its salient points were:The fighting power of an army lies in its organization, which can be destroyed either by wearing it down or by rendering it inoperative. The first comprises kill
