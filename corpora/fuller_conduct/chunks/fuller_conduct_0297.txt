Therefore the key to their acceptance, rejection or modification  is to be sought in the peace policies of the future belligerents.Those of France and Great Britain were to maintain the status quo  under the aegis of the League; they had nothing to gain from another war, and as their peoples were pacific democracies so also were their governments.
