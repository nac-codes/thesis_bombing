How  to achieve the moral break-down of the enemy before the war  has started -  that is the problem that interests me. Whoever  has experienced war at the front will want to refrain from all  avoidable bloodshed.. . .  Mental confusion, contradiction offeeling, indecisiveness, panic: those are our weapons Thelessons of revolution, these are the secret of the new strategy.  . . .  To me all means will be right... . My motto is: “Destroy  [the enemy] by all and any means”.’1French tactical theory was purely defensive; it was based  on building an immensely powerful system of fortifications,  known as the Maginot Line, from Basle to Wissembourg, and  thence to Longwy -  that is, along the common Franco-German  frontier-in order to cover Alsace and Lorraine.

But instead of
