ons and armies, and to be fully effective the destruction of an idea must be total, which means that it can only be killed by a more acceptable idea.These antagonistic ideologies led to three variant outlooks on war: that of the Democracies was either to free enslaved peoples or to prevent their enslavement; that of the National Socialists -  to expand the Reich racially and territorially; and that of Soviet Russia -  to foster world revolution through an ever-increasing extension of the class struggle. To the Demo­cracies peace was an end in itself -  the cessation of war; to the National Socialists it was a time wherein to incubate war; and to the Russian Marxists it was but another form of war. Of the Russian and German outlooks on war, the former was the more all-embracing, because its ideology was global and its warfare continuous, therefore it was the more threatening to the Democracies. What mattered was not whether Hitler was more evil than Stalin, or Stalin more so than Hitler, but which of their aims was the more dangerous to the democratic way of life.In 1914, to all intents and purposes, the belligerents were firmly united nations, whose peoples staunchly supported their respective governments. But in 1939, and particularly in those countries in which revolutionary governments had been estab­lished, there existed extensive reactionary inner fronts, and in many other countries Communist, Fascist and National Socialist movements had taken root, all of which challenged Democracy. These fronts and movements enabled an enemy, who co-operated with them, to attack his antagonist internally, as important an operation in the ideological struggle as the overthrow of the enemy armies was in the physical struggle. War remained war, but it had become more complex; never­theless, in spite of its complexities, Clausewitz’s dictum that ‘War is only a continuation of State policy by other means’  remained constant. 2 •  Allied War Policy 1939-1940 When, on 28th May 1937,
