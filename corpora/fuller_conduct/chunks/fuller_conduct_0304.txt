theless, in spite of its complexities, Clausewitz’s dictum that ‘War is only a continuation of State policy by other means’  remained constant. 2 •  Allied War Policy 1939-1940 When, on 28th May 1937, Mr Neville Chamberlain became Prime Minister, he believed more firmly than any of his pre­decessors had that the fate of Europe depended on Anglo-  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 253 --- 2 5 0 THE CONDUCT OF WAR German collaboration. Between 1925 and 1930 Herr Strese- mann, Field-Marshal Hindenburg’s Foreign Minister, had vainly attempted to bring it about, and since then each suc­ceeding British administration had failed to consider it, and what was as unfortunate, after Hitler’s rise to power, the Baldwin administration paid no more than lip-service to defence. So it came about that, when Chamberlain took office, he had no military backing to his diplomacy, hence his policy of appeasing Hitler. The alternative, urged by Mr Churchill, then a private member of Parliament, was an alliance with Russia.1  This was repugnant to Chamberlain, as may be gathered from a letter he wrote on 26th March 1939:T must confess to the most profound distrust of Russia. I  have no belief whatever in her ability to maintain an effective  offensive, even if she wanted to. And I distrust her motives,  which seem to me to have little connection with our ideas of  liberty, and to be concerned only with getting everyone by  the ears. Moreover, she is both hated and suspected by many  of the smaller States, notably by Poland, Roumania and  Finland.’2Could Russia have been relied on, there might have been  sense in Churchill’s alternative; but Chamberlain had gauged  Stalin’s intentions far more clearly than he had. Nevertheless,  it is difficult to understand why Chamberlain decided to give  his pledge to Poland, for it could be no other than a thinly  disguised bluff. Feiling’s explanation is, that his resolve to do  so was based on news that a surprise attack on Poland was  imminent.Un
