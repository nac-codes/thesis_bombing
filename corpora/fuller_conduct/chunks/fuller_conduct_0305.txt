his pledge to Poland, for it could be no other than a thinly  disguised bluff. Feiling’s explanation is, that his resolve to do  so was based on news that a surprise attack on Poland was  imminent.Unable to base their war policy on the balance of power, on 3rd September 1939 -  two days after Hitler invaded Poland -  Britain and France proclaimed an ideological crusade against Hitler and Hitlerism. In the House of Commons Churchill 1  In March 1938: ‘I had been urging the prospects of a Franco-  British-Russian alliance’ (The Second World War , Vol. I, p. 213).

Chamber- lain was aware of this, and that the Opposition was supported by a number of Hitler’s generals. In August and again in September 1938,3  through its agents, the Opposition had con­tacted the British Foreign Office; therefore, on 4th September 1939, Chamberlain opened the ideological attack in a broad­cast to the German people. He said: ‘In this war we are not fighting against you, the Germ
