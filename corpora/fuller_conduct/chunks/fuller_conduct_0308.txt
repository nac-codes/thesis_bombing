about them [the  Russians]. I knew that they accepted no moral code and studied their  own interest only’ (Ibid., Vol. I, p. 351). Why then had he so ardently  courted them?

It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.’1  Refer­ence to any work on Soviet foreign policy would have informed  him that it had remained constant for over twenty years -  it  was peace at home and trouble abroad.His next diversionary side show he calls ‘my pet’, and he threw himself with ‘increasing confidence into this daring adventure.’2  It was the Narvik expedition of April 1940; it ended in a fiasco, tumbled the Chamberlain administration, and, on 10th May 1940, Churchill became Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. In this dual capacity the conduct of Britain’s part in the war passed into his hands.Churchill was a man cast in the heroic mould, a berserker  ever ready to lead a forlorn hope or storm a breach, and at his  best when things were at their worst. His glamorous rhetoric,  his pugnacity, and his insistence on annihilating the enemy  appealed to human instincts, and made him an outstanding  war leader, which was the greatest of his contributions to his  country.
