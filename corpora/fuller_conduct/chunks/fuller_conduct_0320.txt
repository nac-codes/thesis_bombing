is Lebensraum  before the United  States intervened in the war? If he could not, then of a  certainty the Western negative front would once again become  a positive front, and he would be caught between two fronts,  the thing he dreaded most. The solution lay in the correct  choice of the Russian strategical centre of gravity, and refer­ence to Clausewitz would have told him where it lay. Had not  the latter pointed out that Russia could only be subdued ‘by  effects of internal dissension’?1  Later, had not Theodor  Mommsen compared the Russian Empire with a dust-bin held  together by the rusty hoop of Tsardom; and later still had not  Lenin declared:‘Nowhere in the world is there such oppression of the majority of the country’s population as there is in Russia: The Great Russians form only 43 per cent, of the population, i.e. less than half; the rest have no rights as belonging to other nationalities. Out of 170,000,000 of the population of Russia, about 100,000,000 are oppressed and without rights.’2In 1941, Stalin’s oppression was incalculably worse than  any Tsar’s, and the Ukrainians, White Russians, Balts, Cos­sacks, Caucasians; and many others had not forgotten the  horrors of his ten years of collectivization (1929-1938), during  which some 10,000,000 people had been massacred, trans­ported and starved to death. In 1941, in the Ukraine, White  Russia and the Baltic States alone, some 40,000,000 people  yearned for liberation; therefore, in order to disintegrate the  colossus, all Hitler had to do was to cross the Russian frontier  as a liberator, and terminate collectivization. It would have  won over to him, not only the minorities, but it would also  have dissolved Stalin’s armies, because they so largely con­sisted of collectivized serfs. This is why Stalin dreaded a  German invasion, and he did not believe that the Germans  would be so foolish as to conduct the war ‘with arms alone.’8  ‘Had the Germans’, writes Reitlinger, ‘brought with them 1 See supra
