And  I think if I give him everything I possible can and ask for  nothing from him in return, noblesse oblige, he won’t try to  annex anything and will work with me for a world of demo­cracy and peace.’This ‘hunch’ was the linch-pin in the President’s pro-  Russian policy, and it was to render abortive every victory  won by the two great Western Allies; bring the Slavs to the  Elbe, and replace Hitler by Stalin. 6 ’  The Strategical Grand Climacteric The grand climacteric of the war was reached in the second half of 1942.

The result was that his army was surrounded, and on 2nd February 1943, it
