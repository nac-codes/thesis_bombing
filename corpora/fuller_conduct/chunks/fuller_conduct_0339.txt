re anybody in the  centre of Europe, in that mosaic of countries without con­sistency or unity, bled moreover by war and foreign domina­tion, who could contain the ambitions of Stalin? There is  certainly no one.. . .  We may be sure that after the German  domination, the only domination which could live in these  countries is Communism.

If Germany did not exist, Europeans  would have to invent her and it would be ridiculous to think  that her place could be taken by a confederation of Lithu­anians, Poles, Czechs, and Roumanians who would rapidly be  converted into so many more states of the Soviet confedera­tion. .. .? 1Very different was the policy adopted by President Roose­velt and Mr Churchill when, in mid-January 1943, they met in conference at Casablanca, and at the very moment when the German Sixth Army was in its death throes. They agreed to prepare for the invasion of Sicily, and press on with pre­parations for the invasion of Northern France -  later to be code-named ‘Overlord’. As regards Germany, they decided to prepare for the ‘heaviest possible air offensive against German war effort’2-h e r industrial system and the morale of her people -  and to issue ‘a declaration of the firm intention of the United States and the British Empire to continue the war relentlessly until we have brought about the “unconditional surrender” of Germany and Japan. The omission of Italy’, adds Churchill, ‘would be to encourage a break-up there. The President liked this idea, and it would stimulate our friends in every country.’8  If so, then ‘unconditional surrender’would discourage the break-up of Germany and dispirit the anti- Hitler Opposition, and, in consequence, prolong the war.According
