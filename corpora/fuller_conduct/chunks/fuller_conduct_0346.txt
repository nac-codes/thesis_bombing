the most important; nevertheless, it was only during the final twelve months of the war that they became the dominant targets. Instead of con­centrating on them, between May 1940 and May 1944, they were seldom bombed, and urban bombing with increasing violence was continued to the close of the war.In spite of innumerable attacks on the war industries, in­stead of their output declining it steadily increased. This, graphically, is shown in the two charts reproduced from The United States Strategic Bombing Survey , Overall Report {Euro­pean War),  published in 1945. One reason for this was that:‘The destruction of buildings . . .  did not involve a pro­portionate destruction of vital machine tools and, as it turned out, the enemy was able to salvage such tools and to resume production at a far more rapid rate then had been anticipated.’ (p. 1 8.)1The attacks on urban targets resulted in enormous physical damage. ‘During the period from October 1939 to May 1945 the Allied Air Forces, primarily the R.A.F., dropped over one- half million tons of high explosives, incendiaries, and frag­mentation bombs . . .  on 61 cities.. . .  These cities included25,000,000 people . . . attacks are estimated to have totally destroyed or heavily damaged 3,600,000 dwelling units, ac­counting for 20 per cent, of Germany’s total residential units, and to have rendered homeless 7,500,000 people. They killed about 300,000 people and injured some 780,000.’  (p. 72.) Berlin was estimated to be 60 to 70 per cent, destroyed . . . three-fourths of the damage was caused by fire’  (p. 93). Although decline in morale was considerable, it had practi­cally no effect on armament production (p. 97), and the mental reaction of the people to air attack is thus described in the Survey: 1  References are to the Strategic Bombing Survey .
