r, as the front moved eastward, to attack the railways and canals extending into Germany. By October 1944, Western German traffic was almost paralysed. This had a catastrophic effect on the distribution of coal. We read in the Survey:‘Essen Division car replacements of coal which had been  21,400 daily in January 1944 declined to 12,000 in September.  . . .  By November deliveries of coal to factories in Bavaria  had been reduced by nearly 50 percent.. . .  By January 1945 coal placements in the Ruhr district were down to 9,000 cars per day. Finally in February well-nigh complete interdiction  in the Ruhr district was obtained. Such coal as was loaded was  subject to confiscation by the railroad to supply locomotive  fuel coal.. . .  Contemporaneously, as mining continued at a  higher level than transport, coal stocks at Ruhr collieries rose  from 415,000 tons to 2,217,000 and coke stocks increased from630,000 tons to 3,069,000 in the same 6 months’  (pp. 63-64).In May 1944, preliminary attacks were made on the larger synthetic oil plants, but it was not until after the Normandy landings in June that the main blow was struck. By July every  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 289 --- 2 8 6 THE CONDUCT OF WAB major plant had been hit. In May these plants had been pro­ducing 316,000 tons a month; in June their output fell to107.000 tons, and in September to 17,000, and aviation petrol dropped from 175,000 tons to 5,000. These attacks also dealt a crippling blow to the munitions and explosives industries, and reduced the supply of synthetic rubber, which fell to about one-sixth of its war time peak of 12,000 tons a month.From the above it will be seen that the air attack on Germany only became a true strategical operation when it was directed against the sources of energy and the means of distribution. From the first, had bombing been restricted to them, vast economies would have been effected, and the savings could have been invested in the production of landing- cr
