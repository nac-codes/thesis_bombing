NDUCT OF WAR that by the time the Big Three met his armies would have overrun the whole of Poland, and that he would be in a position to present his allies with a fait accompli . This came about, because on 4th February 1945, the day the Big Three met at Yalta in the Crimea, the Russian marshals had carried their armies to the Oder.The President left America for the Crimea with high hopes and little preparations;1  the war was nearing its end and the time had come to assure himself of Stalin’s full-hearted col­laboration in U.N.O.
