There they had to consider their allies; but the war with Japan was 95 per cent, an American war, and, in order to avoid complications, it was essential that the United States should win it single-handed. Had this been understood, it would have been seen that, as Russia was the only Power who could complicate the issue, it was highly desirable for the United States to bring her war with Japan to an end before or immediately after Germany collapsed -  that is, while Russia was still engaged in Europe. Was this possible?

Because Japan depended on Manchuria and Korea for most of her raw materials and much of her grain, which had to cross the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea, her merc
