ort a population over half as large. Because Japan depended on Manchuria and Korea for most of her raw materials and much of her grain, which had to cross the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea, her merchant navy was the centre of gravity of her strategy. The attack on Japanese shipping was the main task of the American submarines, and the part they played in bringing about the defeat of Japan would be difficult to overestimate; out of the total of 8,900,000 1  Cited by C.

In the aggregate 104,000 tons of bombs were dropped on sixty-six cities, and 42,900 tons on industrial areas.2  Although this bombing reduced produc­tion, loss of shipping remained the dominant factor in Japan’s economic decline, because it was the interdiction of coal, oil, other raw materials as well as grain, and not the destruction of factories and urban centres that struck the deadliest blow at her economy.The Survey  points out that much of this bombing was dupli­cative, because most of the Japanese factories, oil refineries, steel mills, and munition plants lacked raw materials, and in consequence Japan’s economy was in a large measure being destroyed twice over, once by cutting off imports, and secondly by air attack. Further, that attack of Japan’s extremely vulnerable railroad network would have greatly extended and cumulated the effects of the shipping attack already made. ‘The Survey’, we read, ‘believes that such an attack [on a stated number of
