The tensions between the two set up violent oscillations; within the nations they lead to social upheavals, and between the nations to increasing animosities. In embryo it is to be seen in the Napoleonic Wars, and its future is pre­dicted in two absolute theories, the one on war as expounded by Clausewitz, and the other on economics as expounded by Marx.
