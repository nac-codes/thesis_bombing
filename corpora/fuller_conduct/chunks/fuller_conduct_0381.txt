Statesmen and soldiers continued to think in terms of bayonets and sabres, and it did not occur to them that in an industrial age the factory had become the power­house of the barrack, as in the agricultural age the peasantry was the main source of fighting power. When toward the close of the century, oil as a new motive power and developments in the electrical sciences heralded in the second phase of the Industrial Revolution, little attention was paid to the radical changes they portended in the techniques of war.Thus it came about that, although the causes of the First World War were largely industrial and commercial, in 1914 the armies of all belligerents set out to fight the war with no clear idea of the sort of conflict they were called upon to wage, and only after complete stalemate had set in did they appeal to industry and science to haul them out of the quagmire of their  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 315 --- 3 1 2 THE CONDUCT O
