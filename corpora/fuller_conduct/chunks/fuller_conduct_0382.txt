Nevertheless, when due to the attrition of German industrial power and agricultural production by the blockade the war collapsed, instead of the victors seeking a peace in which its economic causes might be eliminated, they ignored them and got back to Big Business on 1913 lines, and, as a corollary, they returned in greater part to the military organi­zations which had led to the initial stalemate.With the return to Big Business, the oscillations which had precipitated the war began to repeat themselves. While in Europe the nations were in revolutionary turmoil, in America industrial concentration developed so rapidly that half the wealth of the United States passed into the hands of some 200 giant corporations. This centralization of wealth, which on the one hand increased productivity and on the other failed to build up the people’s purchasing power to consume it, toppled over in the financial crash of 1929, and out of its debris Big Business began to pass into Big Government.In Russia this had already occurred when Lenin’s experi­mentations in Marxism, which ruined production, forced him to introduce State capitalism and his N.E.P. policy, and in Italy Mussolini had striven to build up the people’s purchasing power in his Corporate State. Then, in 1933, both Roosevelt in America and Hitler in Germany set out to solve the self­same problem, the one by means of his New Deal and the other by means of his New Order. But as none of these would-be economic messiahs could discover how to equilibrate consump­tion with production, they were impelled toward war, because, as Lewis Mumford points out: ‘An army is a body of pure consumers . . .  it tends to reduce toward zero the gap in time between profitable production and profitable replacement. . . .
