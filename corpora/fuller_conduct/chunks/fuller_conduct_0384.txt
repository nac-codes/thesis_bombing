f a new scientific process cannot be deleted, it should be accepted with an important reservation. It is that, directly the political factor is introduced, in all wars, except those of the most primitive kind, the destructive means employed to achieve a profitable end must be limited. For example, when in feudal times the aim of a king was to bring his truculent barons to heel, the primitive artillery of that period was found in­valuable to deprive them of their power of resistance -  their castles. But had its destructive effect been such that, not only their castles, but their retainers, serfs, orchards and cattle within a radius of several miles would be obliterated, nothing would have been left to bring to heel - the means would have swallowed the end.The same applies to all civilzed warfare, because there is always a relationship between force and aim. The first must be sufficient to attain the second, but not so excessive that it cancels it out. This is the crux in nuclear warfare.Since the Hiroshima atomic-bomb, which had an explosive equivalent of 20,000 tons of TNT (20 kilotons), was dropped,  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 317 --- 3 1 4 THE CONDUCT OF WAR thermo-nuclear devices, such as the hydrogen bomb, have been developed with an explosive equivalent of 20,000,000 tons of TNT (20 megatons), and there is no upward limit to their increase in power. Further, so-called ‘tactical’  nuclear pro­jectiles have been devised with an explosive equivalent as small as 100 tons of TNT,1  which confuse the issue; for where is the line to be drawn between high and low scale nuclear missiles? Common sense replies, in apportioning the means to the aim; but, unfortunately, common sense is the rarest of the senses in war, and directly a nuclear weapon, even of the lowest explosive equivalent, is introduced, no check can be relied on to prevent it growing in destructive power until megaton size is reached, when, it has been estimated that, in an attack with hydrogen
