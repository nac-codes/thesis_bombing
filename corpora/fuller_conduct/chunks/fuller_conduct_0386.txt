excludes all political, social, economic and moral con­siderations, it leaves the door wide open to the Soviet Union to exploit them. Yet, in Mr Isaac Deutscher’s opinion: ‘Prob­ably no nation lives in greater horror of nuclear war than do the Russians’,1  which is undoubtedly true, if for no other reason than it deprives war of its political meaning, which is the soul of Russian strategy.This does not mean that Khrushchev and his colleagues fear that an all-out nuclear war would annul the final consum­mation of Communism, because with Marx they hold that no technical discovery, however powerful, can abrogate the laws of history. What they fear is, that it would for the time being delay its advent by crippling the industrial foundations upon which the entire conception of the Communist earthly paradise is built. Nuclear war or no nuclear war, it is the certainty of the Marxian revolution that Khrushchev had in mind when, in 1955, at the height of the ‘peace offensive’, he said: ‘. . . if anyone thinks that we shall forget about Marx, Engels, and Lenin, he is mistaken. This will happen when shrimps learn to whistle.’2  This must also have been in his mind when at a reception at the Polish Embassy in Moscow, in 1956, with reference to the Democracies, he said: ‘We will bury you.’  3 His frequent rocket rattlings should delude no one, they are no more than the brandishings of fire extinguishers, and his ‘brinkmanship’  is both bluff and political blackmail. Deutscher is certainly right, no man fears an all-out nuclear war more so than he.So it comes about that the two great camps into which the world of wardom is now divided are, as in trench warfare of former days, separated by a no-man’s-land which neither dares to cross, and we arrive at a stalemate which both fear to break, and which, through fear that the other may dare to break it, leads to both sides frantically multiplying their nuclear armaments in order indefinitely to postpone the Crack of Doom. 1  The Grea
