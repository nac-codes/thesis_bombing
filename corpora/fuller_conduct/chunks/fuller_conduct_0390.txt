e less the need to batter down the edifice they support. In this there is nothing new, as a simple example will make clear. A walled city can be physically attacked by battering down its walls; economically attacked by starving out its garrison, and morally attacked by subverting it. When, before the age of gunpowder, walls were difficult to breach, the second and third were frequently resorted to. Today, in the age of nuclear explosives, because the process of breaching is mutually destructive, they are being relied upon again.Lenin, as we have seen, appreciated this at the time of the Brest-Litovsk peace negotiations, when his people were starv­ing, his followers divided, and his army impotent. Since then, although the Soviet Union has become the second greatest industrial and the greatest military Power in the world, because of the physical stalemate created by nuclear weapons cold war is likely to continue as long as the spell of foul political weather lasts. The conclusion is that, because the essence of the clash between East and West is between two ideologies akin to those which detonated the American Civil War, Lincoln’s famous warning to his fellow-countrymen may in the present age be extended to the world in general. Today, it may be said: ‘A world divided against itself cannot stand, it cannot endure permanently half-slave and half-free. We do not expect the world to fall; but we do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.’  Which is it to be?

To the one peace begins when war ends, to the other it is a continu­ation of war by every means short of actual fighting. To the one international differences in peacetime are settled by argu­ment, to the other they are accentuated by it. While in democratic countries government is based on collectivism,
