WAR Khrushchev affirmed that the next seven years would be decisive, and that by 1965 the U.S.S.R. would produce more industrial goods per head of the population than the United Kingdom and Western Germany, and that by 1970, or even before, the output per head of the United States would be surpassed.1This was a declaration of war, a war in which the economic offensive was to become the positive instrument of Soviet policy, and under cover of the terror induced by the threat of all-out nuclear war, armies were to give way to factories, weapons to goods, and markets were to become the battlefields of the future. In a different form it was to be a return to the bloodless warfare of the absolute kings, whose aim had been to bankrupt each other’s exchequers rather than ruin each other’s armies. If the reader will turn back to Chapter V, p. 80, and re-read what, in 1885, Andrew Ure had to say on the rivalries between the factory owners of the first phase of the Industrial Revolution to capture foreign markets -  which he called ‘the new belligerent system’ -  he will obtain some idea of the type of warfare the Soviet Union intends to wage.Since 1939, the industrialization of the U.S.S.R. has bordered on the fabulous. In recent years its productivity has advanced at a rate roughly twice that of the United States, and in 1959 it was estimated to have reached 45 per cent, of it. To a large extent this has been due to the same cause which led to the rapid increase in productivity in Great Britain during the first phase of the Industrial Revolution -  namely, to the ploughing back of profits into the capital equipment industries instead of sharing them with the work­ers. While in the first phase the poverty of the British workers was an incidental concomitant of the competition between the factory owners,2  in the Soviet Union it is planned, and may be described as ‘organized poverty’. Therefore consumer goods are restricted, as there is but a limited market for them, and, as
