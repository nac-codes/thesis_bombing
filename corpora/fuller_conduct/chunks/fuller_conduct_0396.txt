Therefore consumer goods are restricted, as there is but a limited market for them, and, as we shall see in the next Section, this planned poverty, which in its incidental form was the disease of the early 1  This claim is based on the assumption that production in the West  would remain at its 1958 level.*  See supra,  Chapter V, p. 80.

When China is omitted, the main danger is not so much Soviet competition as its own lack of economic integration.Its material resources are very great, and in population -  one of the main elements in industrial production -  it con­siderably outdistances its antagonist, as may be seen from the following population figures. Western Bloc: United States -  177,399,000; Western Europe -  319,225,000, and Canada, Australia and New Zealand -  29,708,000. Soviet Bloc: U.S.S.R. -  208,826,000, and its Satellites -  86,079,000. A total of536,332,000 compared with 294,905,000 -  that is, a superiority of 231,427,000.1At present, the superiority of the Soviet Bloc over the Western resides in its organization, which is para-ipilitary. The Presidium is its Chiefs of Staff, the Party its corps of officers, and its industrial and other workers its economic soldiers. As in an army, the first can plan without reference to the third, and can rely on its orders being implicitly obeyed by the second. This is the key difference between the opposed economic systems.As in actual war, the economic offensive demands the con­centration of t
