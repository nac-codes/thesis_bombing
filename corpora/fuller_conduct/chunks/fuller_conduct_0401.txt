Today they are faced with economic war on military lines, the aim of which is a revolutionary one, and in which trade represents armed force. As the situation now stands they are economically at sixes and sevens, unintegrated and un-cooperative, separ­ated by tariffs and quotas, and daily wrestling for each others’  markets.
