is socially free, and in the East a society which is under rigid state control. While in the West, the impact of industrialism has followed an evolutionary path, and increase in productivity has progressively led to a rise in the standard of living, in the Soviet Union, in spite of its remarkable productivity, because its revolutionary economic policy is based on organized poverty, the living standard of the vast majority of its peoples has been artificially restricted. Added to this, the problem is further complicated by the impact of Communism on China, which today is in the same stage the Soviet Union was in a generation ago.Since the opening of the present century, and never more so than today, industrial progress in the United States, and to a lesser extent in Great Britain and Western Europe, instead of making the rich richer and poor poorer, as Marx predicted, has proceeded in the opposite direction. The incomes of the working masses have steadily increased, and those of the rich have declined. In America the earnings of the workers have in many cases reached those of middle class standards, and there are no signs of the distribution of wealth halting. Within the foreseeable future poverty will be abolished, first in the United States and later in Western Europe, and with it will vanish Marx’s concept of the proletariat, on which he so largely built his hypothetical economic order.Coincidentally with this non-Marxian evolution, the growth of state enterprise, which in the United States became apparent during the period of the New Deal, has been accelerated not only in the United States but also in Western Europe. This has been due to the increased activity of the State in industrial undertakings which are beyond the capacity of private enter­prise to finance, and to the Western governments being com­  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 332 --- THE PROBLEM OF PEACE 3 2 9 pelled to maintain enormous peacetime military establish­ments as well as most of the s
