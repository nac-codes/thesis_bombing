The tendency today is, therefore, toward increasing state enterprise and decreasing private enterprise. These two evolutionary changes, the elimination of poverty on the one hand, and the growth of state control on the other, are progressively being speeded up by the almost daily advances in technology.A very different permutation is to be seen in the Soviet Union. It is neither an evolutionary nor a revolutionary development of Marxism; instead it is its perceptible withering away.When Khrushchev stepped into Stalin’s shoes, he was aware that terror was defeating its own end. During the despot’s rule, not only had he and his colleagues lived in constant dread of sudden liquidation, but terror was paralysing the initiative industrialism required in order to maintain its vigour and health. It was not that he and his comrades contemplated a modification, let alone an abandonment of Marxism -  their religion -  but that the advances in technology were forcing them to liberalize the existing tyranny by giving more freedom to the Russian peoples.By the turn of the mid-century, through force of its inherent requirements, industrialization in Russia had brought into being a middle class of scientists, technicians, managers, etc., whose skills, as in capitalist countries, are most effectively stimulated by the prospect of high salaries. Today some of these people are earning as much as a million roubles (say, £20,000) a year, and considerable numbers several thousand pounds. These new rich form an administrative and techno­logical plutocracy, and inevitably act as fugelmen to the rising generation of educated Russian youth.These young people are penned in by Marxism, and unlike the youth of the West can find no outlet for the
