The coexistence of states with  different social systems is a form of class struggle between  socialism and capitalism.’‘Peaceful coexistence of countries with different social  systems does not mean conciliation of the socialist and  bourgeois ideologies. On the contrary, it implies intensifica­tion of the struggle of the working class of all communist  parties for the triumph of socialist ideas.

Among these are:The Soldatenfreund  (Soldier’s Friend) for enlisted men and  n.c.o.’s. It carries fictitious letters to the editor, invents abuses  and exaggerates actual complaints, stirs up trouble and makes  extensive use of obscene photographs and crude eroticism.The Wehrpolitik  (Defence Policy) for officers and intellec­tuals. It is of higher calibre, and publishes articles written by  former Nazi officers based on objective sources and given a  communist slant.The Kaserne  (The Barracks) for pacifists and anti-militarists.
