is of higher calibre, and publishes articles written by  former Nazi officers based on objective sources and given a  communist slant.The Kaserne  (The Barracks) for pacifists and anti-militarists.  It specializes in pictures of graves, crosses, corpses, coffins and  grotesque untruths not lacking in pornography.The Tabu  is a more cleverly written magazine designed for  young people. It is artistically produced, and contains illus­trated articles on popular science, anti-religious topics, etc.,  as well as suggestive photographs of nudes.Besides these organs of propaganda, extensive use is made  of anonymous letters and false official communications, such as  posting to the wives of officers and men of the defence forces  scented notes written in a female hand implicating their  husbands in some extra-maritial intrigue, or of faked official  notices to the relatives of soldiers informing them that their  husbands and sons have met with a fatal accident or are sus­pected of some crime, etc.The extent of these subversive activities may be judged  from the fact that every month between one and two million  of the above publications fall into the hands of the West Ger­man postal authorities. Their influence is largely discounted by  their crudeness and baseness. Dirt is poor propaganda. 3 4 3  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 347 --- This page intentionally left blank  File: --- fuller_conduct.pdf --- Page 348 --- Index Absolute kings, 20-25, 31  Absolute war, 62-63, 74  Aircraft, 137, 176; offensive use of,  239-42, 244, 279-87  Aisne, battle of the, 159,170  Alanbrooke, Viscount, 254, 287  Alexander, Sir Harold, 292  Alexander, Tzar, 57  Alexander the Great, 242-3  Algeciras, Treaty of, 147  Algeciras Conference, 145-6  Amiens, battle of, 176  Anders, Wladyslow, 268  Anglo-Soviet Treaty, 266  Anti-Comintern Pact, 234  Arabi Pasha, 132  Arabi revolt, 182  Arcadia Conference, 273, 308  Arcis-sur Aube, battle of, 51  Ardennes, battle of the, 293  Armour, 93-94, 17
