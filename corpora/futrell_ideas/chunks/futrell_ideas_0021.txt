the Air Service and its successor, the Air Corps. The War Department General Staff emphasized, however, that doctrine should be formulated only by the chief of an Army arm or service? "Doctrinal literature," said an Army Air Forces staff officer in 1944, “originates with the highest authority and states in general the overall policy to be followed."”4  Given agreement on the proposition that air doctrine derived from the highest authority, there was less agreement as to its precise nature. In 1938 the Air Corps Board stated:  Principles change not at all, or but slightly, over considerable periods. Doctrines generally change slowly, but will change as different applications of principles bring forth different beliefs and teachings. Methods are influenced both by doctrine and technical improvement and will change more rapidly than doctrines. The most satisfactory Field Service regulation would be one dealing only with principles and expressed in terms that would never change. However, air warfare is relatively new and there is much difference of opinion as regards principles of employment.  In 1943 an AAF staff officer defined doctrine as  a body of fundamental principles expressing the logical possibilities and objectives of air warfare, as well as its general limitations. Like any other doctrine, especially one for a weapon so newas the air arm still is, it is onlynatural that the AAF doctrine should include speculative as well as proven truths, but they are all necessary to provide a basis for initial decisions in the design of airplanes and in the training of personnel to accomplish the desired end.

By 1948 the growth of the Army Air Forces during World War II and the achievement of a separate status by the United States Air Force led Air University thinkers to suggest that the time
