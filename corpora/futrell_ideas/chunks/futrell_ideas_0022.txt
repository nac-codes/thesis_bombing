doctrine."  By 1948 the growth of the Army Air Forces during World War II and the achievement of a separate status by the United States Air Force led Air University thinkers to suggest that the time was opportune to undertake that part of their mission which charged the institution to prepare, review, and revise all Air Force publications pertaining to basic doctrine.” As this work progressed, the Air University acknowledged the definition of doctrine provided by the Joint Chiefs of Staff:  A compilation of principles and policies, applicable to a subject, which have been developed through experience or by theory, that represent the best available thought, and indicate and guide but do not bind in practice. Its purpose is to provide that understanding within a force which generates mutual confidence between the commander and his subordinates in order that timely and effective action will be taken by all concerned in the absence of instruction.
