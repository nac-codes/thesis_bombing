on aviation in a book entitled Air Warfare in 1926, he included a chapter that applied the principles of war to air warfare. These principles also were discussed in the Air Corps Tactical School text, Air Warfare, dated 1 March 1936. In September 1943 Col Ralph F.

In the early 1950s these principles of war were accepted and taught by both the Army and the Air Force. The Navy’s attitude, however, was that these principles were permissible as maxims, precepts, factors, guides, or even basic considerations, but it questioned whether they were to be accepted as principles. The Navy did not list these principles in its US fleet publications, but the basic thoughts of the principles were taken cognizance of in these doctrinal publications.” The Royal Air Force (RAF) distinguished between the principles of war, which it considered not to be principles but guides or aides-mémoire, and the doctrines that were derived from them.?! Like the Navy and the RAF, the Air University did not include a specific discussion of the principles of war in its proposed manua
