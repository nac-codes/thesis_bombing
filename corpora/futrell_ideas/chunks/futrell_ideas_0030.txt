nt. "The Air Force," Gen Nathan F. Twining, acting Air Force chief of staff, had stated in 1952, "is not bound to any fixed doctrine or concept. It grew out of scientific achievement."°° When he approved AFM 1-2 0n1 April 1953, General Vandenberg thought it necessary to warn that "the dynamic and constant changes in new weapons make periodic review of this doctrine necessary." Looking backward at past events, Gen Laurence S. Kuter admitted that he could not suggest that doctrine had ever been the controlling factor in setting the rate of development of air power. Instead, he recognized a "mutual interdependence of doctrinal technological, political, and other elements."* Even though there was general agreement that Air Force doctrine ought to be forward-looking, Maj Gen Lloyd P. Hopwood, a former commandant of the Air Command and Staff College, expressed dismay at the idea that doctrine could not be anything more than descriptive of an existing state of the military art. "We try to make our doctrine and strategy conform to glamorous hardware," Hopwood wrote, "instead of studying modern conflict to find acceptable solutions from which to establish the hardware requirements we need."  Arguments about the parameters of doctrine did not slack up after the "perfection" of AFM 1-2 in mid-1955. In retrospect this manual reflected strategic air lessons drawn from World War II. The main emphasis stressed offensive air actions as providing the ultimate prospect of victory by reducing an enemy’s will to fight, chiefly through selective destruction of population centers. There was some acknowledgment of a need for defense against hostile air attack, but the subject of defense was less emphasized than that of offense. The manual noted that air power should support national objectives, but said nothing authoritative on the subject, perhaps because the authors were vague about what our national objectives might be.  After the issuance of a revised AFM 1-2 in April 1955, there did
