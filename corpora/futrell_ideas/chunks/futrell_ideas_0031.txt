After the issuance of a revised AFM 1-2 in April 1955, there did not appear to be an immediate need for more considerations of the subject of air doctrine — this despite changes in national policies and the maturity of intercontinental ballistic missiles.”” Since the Air University was charged to maintain currency of the basic air doctrine manual, a suggested revision of AFM 1-2 was prepared and forwarded to the Pentagon in 1958. The Air Staff refused to accept the revision, expressing a general satisfaction with the currently approved statement of doctrine. Another reason behind the Air Staffs action was a fatalistic assumption that technology was developing so fast that it was useless to try to capture doctrine in printed pamphlets  9  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 31 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  that became out of date overnight.
