e Board of Ordnance and Fortification nevertheless instructed General Allen on 5 December 1907 to solicit bids for the delivery of a heavier-than-air flying machine designed to carry two persons and sufficient fuel for a flight of 125 miles and capable of a speed of at least 40 miles an hour.®  The Signal Corps specifications for its first airplane did not include an operational requirement that it would be expected to satisfy. Hence, when the first Wright plane was eventually accepted on 2 August 1909, the Army had a new item of experimental equipment that was in need of a mission. Several minds went to work to bridge this gap. In his student thesis at the Army Service School, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1907, Lt Benjamin D. Foulois had predicted that large fleets in the air would operate well in advance of ground troops and that these opposing air fleets would be the first military forces to engage at the outbreak ofa | war.” In 1911 Lt Thomas DeWitt Milling tested an experimental aircraft bombsight, and in the following year Milling and Capt Charles DeForest Chandler first fired a Lewis machine gun from an airplane. Even these early aviation enthusiasts, however, recognized that "the very limited flight performance of aircraft in 1912 had not demonstrated any military value other than reconnaissance.""- US Army field service regulations of 1910 merely noted that for purposes of reconnaissance: "The dirigible balloon or flying machine is used as the commander directs."  During hearings in the spring of 1913 held by the House Military Affairs Committee on a bill to create a separate air corps as one of the line components of the Army, Assistant Secretary of War Henry S. Breckinridge explained the War Department position that military aviation was "merely an added means of communication, observation and reconnaissance" that "ought to be coordinated  16  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 38 --- THROUGH WORLD WARI  with and subordinated to the general serv
