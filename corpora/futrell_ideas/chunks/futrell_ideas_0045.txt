. For strategical reconnaissance, the dirigible had the greatest practical value, but aeroplanes were said to be more dependable for field service with a mobile army since dirigibles required substantial shelter from winds while they were on the ground. "In forces of the strength of a division, or larger," the regulations stated, "the aero squadron will operate in advance of the independent cavalry in order to locate the enemy and to keep track of his movements."  European Adversaries Speed Aviation Development  Feeling the threat of hostile neighbors, European nations accelerated the development of aeronautics during the 1900s. At the Hague Conference in 1899 the European nations had been willing to accept a US proposal and impose a five-year prohibition against "the discharge of projectiles or explosives from balloons or by other new methods of similar nature." The US delegate had rationalized: "The balloon . . . can carry but little; it is capable of hurling... indecisive quantities of explosives, which would fall, like useless hailstones, on both combatants and noncombatants alike." But in 1907, when the Second Hague Conference declaration extended this moratorium on aerial bombing, no major powers except the United States and Great Britain proved willing to ratify it. There were ominous predictions that a future war would begin with air bombardments of belligerent capitals. For the most part, the opposing powers hurriedly developed aviation as an added means of reconnaissance.  17  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 39 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  As the war approached, however, a new strategic concept began to take hold: military commanders in Germany, France, and Russia began to discount the prospect that any means of reconnaissance could dispel the fog of war in an all-out modern conflict. First Germany and then France and Russia accepted the strategic concept of offense a l’outrance—a headlong offensive that would attain victory before an enemy
