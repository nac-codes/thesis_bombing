orce would actually vary according to the number of fast fighting machines that the enemy operated on a given portion of the front at a given time. In an extended discussion of the bomber force he desired to put into action in 1918, Bolling explained that day bombardment required faster aircraft, which desirably would be employed freely "if it should be possible to drive from the air practically all the enemy fighting machines." By bombing at night, however, large and slow airplanes could carry large numbers of bombs. In response to the question, "Could night bombing be conducted on a sufficiently great scale and kept up continuously for a sufficient time?" Bolling replied, "there seems good reason to believe that it might determine the whole outcome of military operations. Up until the present time, the trouble seems to have been that all bombing has been carried on intermittently and sporadically because of a lack of attention to the subject and provision for large enough numbers of the right kinds of airplanes."  Even though American aviation pioneers had thought of aviation as a combat arm, the idea of a massive independent bombing force, which was so readily accepted by the aeronautical commission, was relatively new, even in Europe. Shortly after arriving in Europe, Bolling had conversations with Gen Sir David Henderson of the British air board, who divided aviation into three categories: service aviation allocated to ground forces, fighter aviation in requisite quantities (preferably a three-to-one numerical superiority) to drive the enemy out of the air, and bomber aviation in the greatest amounts that a country was able to produce "to use against the enemy in bombarding him out of his position and cutting off his communications and destroying his sources of supply." As a result of a visit to Italy, the Bolling commission was evidently favorably impressed with Italian bombing raids against Austria, and the commission recommended that the United States should
