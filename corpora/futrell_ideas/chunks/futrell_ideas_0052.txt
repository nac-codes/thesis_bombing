However, fanciful statements made by Secretary Baker and other people in authority as to the tremendous numbers of American planes that would deluge the Western Front caused the Germans to redouble their air production effort in what they called their Amerikaprogramm, but these statements did very little to mobilize the American productive effort.2” According to the War Department organization, the Signal Corps, Aviation Section (which was variously redesignated as the Aeronautical Division, the Airplane Division, the Air Division, and the Air Service Division), was responsible for the recruitment and training of aviators and aviation personnel.
