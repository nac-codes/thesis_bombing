the Western Front, US Air Service units were employed in support of the US I Corps at the Marne and Vesel rivers in July and August 1918. The greatest American air action, however, came in support of the US First Army in the Saint-Mihiel and Argonne-Meuse offensives beginning in September 1918. For the Saint-Mihiel offensive, Mitchell had the services of British and French as well as US squadrons; altogether he had the use of 701 pursuit, 323 day-bomber, 91 night-bomber, and 366 observation aircraft — a total of 1,481 planes of which about one-third were American.  The air action in these battles illustrated the value of concentrated air forces, but the employment of aviation continued to be planned in terms of the ground mission. Although Air Service officers spoke of the desirability of attaining aerial supremacy, they considered that this was possible only in certain selected sectors for limited periods of time. The major mission of pursuit aviation was described as being "to keep clear of enemy airplanes an area about 10,000 yards deep in front of the line of battle." This zone was the area in which corps and division observation aircraft flew and, thus, the objective of pursuit aviation was defined as "the destruction of the enemy air service and the protection of our own observation aircraft." The primary object of day-bombing attacks was said to be "the destruction of the enemy’s morale, materiel and personnel." In this effort, "the ratio of the effect of lowering the enemy’s morale over that of destruction was estimated as about 20 to 1." Bombing and strafing of ground targets proved advisable only when air supremacy was attained, a lesson learned by hard experience. According to Colonel Milling, the US Air Service’s day-bombing force sustained about 60 percent losses during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel when it was closely escorted by pursuit aircraft. Being tied to the bombardment planes, the pursuit aircraft always had to fight on the defensive. The solutio
