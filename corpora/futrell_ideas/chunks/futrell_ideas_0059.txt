The Gorrell plan, therefore, stated that it was "of paramount importance that we adopt at once a bombing project . . . at the quickest possible moment, in order that we may not only wreck Germany's manufacturing centers but wreck them more completely than she will wreck ours next year." The plan proposed that the bombing attacks would be mounted by day and night from airfields in the Toul-Verdun area against industrial plants around Diisseldorf, Cologne, Mannheim, and in the Saar Valley. Up to 100 squadrons should be directed against each of these targets in turn, the idea being to keep a given target under a sustained bombardment up to five hours at a time. Such an assault would overwhelm target defenses, wreck manufacturing works, and shatter the morale of workmen.?‚Äù  In Great Britain popular dissatisfaction with the ability of the the air defenses to deal with Zeppelin and Gotha attacks against London forced a reorganization of aviation affairs. On the advice of a board headed by Lt Gen Jan Christian Smuts (with strong support from Winston Churchill), the British government set up a separate Air Ministry in December 1917.
