ince aircraft production was beginning to achieve success late in 1918, it appeared probable that this program objective could have been met had the war continued.*? When hostilities ended on 11 November 1918, however, just 45 American air squadrons—with 740 airplanes, 767 pilots, 481 observers, and 23 aerial gunners — were actually assigned to the Air Service, AEF.

According to his memoirs, Gen William Mitchell was not entirely happy that the Armistice had come before aviation had proven itself. Mitchell would recall that by the spring of 1919 he had expected to see great bombardment attacks against Germany’s economy and even a paratroop employment of the 1st Infantry Division behind German lines. "I was sure that if the war lasted," Mitchell recollected, "air power would decide it."*6  The Mitchell Era: From Air Service to Air Corps  "It is important for the winning of the war," stated the report of Field Marshal Jan Christian Smuts’s committee on air organization and home defense to the British prime minister on 17 August 1917, "that we should not only secure air predominance, but secure it on a very large scale; and having secured it in this war we should make every effort and sacrifice to maintain it for the future. Air supremacy may in the long run become as import
