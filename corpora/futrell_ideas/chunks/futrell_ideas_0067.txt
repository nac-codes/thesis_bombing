Written in March 1919, but not published until later, General Patrick’s Final Report of the Chief of Air Service, AEF stated that to regard air forces as separate and distinct from other component parts of the Army would be "to sacrifice the cohesion and unity of effort which alone distinguishes an army from a mob.""” Two tentative manuals prepared under the direction of Colonel Gorrell— entitled "Notes on the Employment of the Air Service from the General Staff Viewpoints" (February 1919) and "Tentative Manual for the Employment of Air Service" (April 1919) — represented the belief "that in the future, as in the past, the final decision in war must be made by men on the ground, willing to come hand-to-hand with the enemy.
