The leading measures were the New and Curry bills, each of which sought to create an executive department of aeronautics.» On 8 August 1919, the secretary of war appointed a board of general officers headed by General Menoher to report on these bills. After study, the Menoher board reported general agreement on several fundamental considerations: aeronautics would play an increasingly important role in a future war in proportion to the capacity of a nation to produce aircraft and train personnel for aircraft maintenance and operation; no nation could afford to maintain military air fleets required for war in time of peace; the nation that first mobilized a superior air fleet after a war began would have an undoubted advantage; and a nation desirably  29  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 51 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  should have a full development of commercial aviation in order to provide military potential in time of war. The board stated that a single government agency ought to be established for research and development and for procurement of military, naval, and commercial aircraft. It recommended that the government also should develop and operate air route facilities and that it might provide direct subsidies to airline companies but that it should not undertake the production of aircraft. Whether or not a single separate governmental agency for research and development, procurement, and subsidization of the civil air fleet could be established, however, would depend on the magnitude of federal expenditures that Congress would be willing to vote for national aeronautics.  The Menoher board revealed an understanding of the nation’s requirement for a progressive development of aviation potential, but it could see no need for a separate Army-Navy aeronautical service. It stated: "An air for
