evealed an understanding of the nation’s requirement for a progressive development of aviation potential, but it could see no need for a separate Army-Navy aeronautical service. It stated: "An air force acting independently cannot win a war against a civilized nation, nor by itself, accomplish a decision against forces on the ground." On the other hand, military forces could not be efficiently trained nor could they operate effectively without air force support. With respect to an army, an air force was an essential combat branch, and it had to be an integral part of an army command "not only during battle but also during its entire period of its doctrinal training." The Menoher panel stated that the outstanding defect of the Air Service, AEF, had been its lack of cooperative training with the Army, and it quoted extensively from the Dickman board’s findings to substantiate the air mission as being one of support for ground operations. The creation of the Royal Air Force in Great Britain was said to have been motivated "for political rather than military reasons." In regard to the exact organization of the air component of the Army, the Menoher board recommended that the military air force was an essential combat branch and ought to be placed on an equal footing with the infantry, cavalry, and artillery. "Whatever may be the decision as to a separate Aeronautical Department," the board concluded, "the military air force must remain under the complete control of the Army and form an integral part thereof both in peace and war."  In the late spring of 1919 the case for a separate air force drew support from the report of a mission headed by Assistant Secretary of War Benedict Crowell. Including American industrialists as well as Army and Navy officers, the Crowell mission visited France, Italy, and England, and conferred with civil and military leaders. The report noted a general agreement in Europe that "any future war will inevitably open with great aerial activity
