rewrite and add explanatory notes to his "diary of war-time experiences" that would indicate his early support for the concept of strategic bombardment, Mitchell’s wartime activities and writings indicated that he cooperated with the desires of his Army superiors with little real question.”* In January 1919, however, Mitchell was ordered to return to the United States to become director of military aeronautics. He may well have recognized that he was returning to the United States at a time when the nation lacked an air policy. Instead of looking backward at World War I, he began to look ahead to logical projections of air power capabilities. One thing was clear, the Air Service needed a definite mission of a distinctive nature. In 1915, when he had been assigned to the War Department General Staff, Mitchell had prepared a survey of America’s aviation needs in which he had theorized that Army aviation would be a valuable "second line of defense" if the Navy’s "first line of defense" should fail to stop an invasion of the United States. He had made the point that aviation attached to harbor and coastal defenses would be useful both for reconnaissance and for preventing similar enemy activity. Aircraft could destroy an invader’s airplanes, attack his submarines, and disrupt the operations of his minelayers. ‘ Something of these earlier thoughts may have been in Mitchell’s mind while he was returning to the United States; a naval officer with him aboard the westbound Aquitania duly reported that Mitchell was "fully prepared, with evidence, plans, data, propaganda, posters and articles, to break things wide open" for air power.  When Mitchell assumed office as director of military aeronautics on 6 March 1919, the duties of this position had already been superseded in large measure by the appointment of General Menoher as director of air service. Menoher, however, assigned Mitchell as the chief of the Air Service’s Training and Operations Group, the headquarters agency
