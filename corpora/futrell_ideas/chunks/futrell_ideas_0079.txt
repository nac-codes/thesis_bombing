As a part of the Army Reorganization Act of 1920, which became law on 4 June 1920, the Air Service was made a part of the combat line of the Army and no changes were made in its existing relations with the War Department General Staff.” Still far from beaten by the course events were taking, General Mitchell urged the House Committee on Military Affairs to add a clause to the Army appropriation bill for fiscal year 1921 to provide that the Army Air Service should control all aerial operations from land bases and that the Navy should control all aerial operations attached to a fleet. This clause was opposed by the secretaries of war and Navy, but, as approved on 5 June 1920, the Army Appropriation Act provided: "That hereafter the Army Air Service shall control all aerial operations from land bases, and Naval Aviation shall have control of all aerial operations attached to a fleet, including shore stations whose maintenance is necessary for operation connected with the fleet, for construction and experimentation and for the training of personnel."
