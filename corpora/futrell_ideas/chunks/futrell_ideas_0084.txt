59 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  instructed, these armies probably never will come into contact as the air force will settle the matter itself." Applying what he had observed in Europe to the strategic problem of the United States— namely, "the ability to attack at a distance and the ability to attack possible debarkations, other troops on the ground, and to cover landings" — Mitchell advocated a unity of air command. The air force commander not only should control the air force and army observation planes (in the beginning of hostilities before ground combat was joined), but also all antiaircraft weapons, searchlights, and barrage balloons. Since aviation’s primary mission was to destroy hostile air forces, Mitchell urged that bombardment wings should be formed out of two groups of high-speed, diving-type pursuit and one group of high-level bombardment aircraft. Attack wings should comprise two groups of fast-climbing, maneuverable pursuit and one group of armored attack aircraft. Mitchell specifically recommended that the minimum air force for the United States should be one brigade of 600 planes behind the East Coast, one division of 1,200 planes on the Pacific Coast. This force should be roughly one-fifth active air force and four-fifths reserve, which could be mobilized in two days. Mitchell ended his report by pointing out:  The organization along our coasts is so complicated between the corps area, the coast artillery, the naval districts, the coast guard, the air forces, the meteorological service which is under the Department of Agriculture, and the radio service which is partly under the navy and partly under the army that we would be terribly handicapped and our hands almost tied in case we were attacked by a first-class power.  In commenting upon his visit to Europe, Mitchell reported that he had met "more men of exceptional ability in Italy than .. . in any other country." Ten years would pass before Mitchell would mention that he had had "frequent co
