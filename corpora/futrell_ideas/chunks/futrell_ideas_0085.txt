to Europe, Mitchell reported that he had met "more men of exceptional ability in Italy than .. . in any other country." Ten years would pass before Mitchell would mention that he had had "frequent conversations: with the Italian air strategist Giulio Douhet, whose career paralleled Mitchell’s own in many ways. Douhet had begun to write about military aviation in 1909; he had been imprisoned for a year in 1916-17 for having criticized Italy’s wartime military policy; the court-martial had been expunged in 1920. Promoted to general officer rank in 1921, Douhet completed his first serious treatise on military aviation—J/ Dominio dell’ Aria [the command of the air]—in October 1921. In this essay on the art of aerial warfare, Douhet demonstrated that two new instruments of war—the aerial arm and poison gases—had been introduced in World War I. For the future, he predicted: "Not only explosives, but also chemical and bacteriological poisons can be carried by the aerial arm to any point of the enemy’s territory, scattering death and destruction over the entire country of the foe." Douhet argued that ground warfare would be progressively stalemated by improvements in guns but that aircraft were instruments of incomparable potentialities against which no effective defense except for the establishment of command of the air could be foreseen. "To prevent the enemy from harming us by means of his air forces," he wrote, "there is no other practical method than to destroy his air forces. ... Command of the air means to be in a position to prevent the enemy from flying, while at the same time retaining this right for one’s self."  38  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 60 --- THROUGH WORLD WARI  Believing that "it is easier to destroy the potentiality of the enemy in the air by destroying the nests and eggs of the flyers rather than to seek the flyers in the air for the purpose of bringing them down," Douhet thought that an independent air force should be an air fleet of bomber
