troying the nests and eggs of the flyers rather than to seek the flyers in the air for the purpose of bringing them down," Douhet thought that an independent air force should be an air fleet of bombers and combat planes—the latter to be a bomber-type plane that would be equipped with many guns and used to convoy bombers and fight off hostile pursuit planes. Following establishment of command of the air, the independent air force would be able to destroy an enemy nation by attacking transportation lines and population centers. Conversely, if two opposing air fleets began operations simultaneously and command of the air could not be established, Douhet reasoned that it would be necessary "to resign one’s self to suffer offensives which the enemy is capable of inflicting upon us, so that all the means We possess may be utilized for the purpose of inflicting on the enemy more powerful offensives."  In his writings, Mitchell never attributed any special influence on his thought to Douhet— US air officers would not publicly cite Douhet for several years”? Even though Douhet’s works would not be generally available in a published translation until 1942, a five-page extract of The Command of the Air was prepared by the War Department Military Intelligence Division on 23 March 1922 and found its way into the files of the Air Service Plans Division.° A typescript translation of the first 100 pages of the book (the substantive portion) was received by the Air Service Field Officers School on 3 May 1923.71 Moreover, during 1922 Lt Col A. Guidoni, the Italian air attaché in Washington, sent a summary of the book to Air Service headquarters and to Lester Gardner, editor of Aviation magazine. Guidoni reported that Gardner had discussed the summary with Mitchell and had said that Mitchell was greatly impressed with Douhet’s ideas.”  Air Service officers, thus, certainly knew of Douhet’s ideas, but probably recognized that these concepts were politically unacceptable in the United S
