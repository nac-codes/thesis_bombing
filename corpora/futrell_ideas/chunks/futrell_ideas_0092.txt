tion: "Offensive aviation is employed most effectively at the beginning of hostilities during the period of ground and water mobilization and concentration. ... Against an enemy not in possession of an adequate air force, offensive aviation, if employed effectively, can force a decision before the ground troops or sea force could join in battle."  The secretary of war appointed a board of General Staff officers, headed by Maj Gen William Lassiter, to hear Patrickâ€™s plan and make recommendations on it. When the Lassiter board convened in daily sessions beginning on 22 March 1923, General Patrick argued the Air Service plan that he had outlined earlier. He wished to reduce the auxiliary services of aviation (mainly observation) and increase the primary services needed to secure control of the air (pursuit) and destroy hostile targets behind enemy lines (bombardment). "The principle of concentration of air forces becomes a maxim," he said. And again he urged: "I am. .. convinced that the concentration of all air force under one GHQ Reserve Commander is the most effective way of assuring aerial supremacy." But Patrick ran headlong into the opposition of Brig Gen Hugh A. Drum, of the War Department General Staff. General Drum insisted that the board should first determine what aviation would be needed to support the ground armies and then decide how large the air force ought to be. Under this formula, the board proved unwilling to divest divisions of their observation squadrons and to concentrate all air force units in a GHQ Reserve. Instead, the Lassiter board recommended that the observation air service should be an integral part of divisions, corps, and armies; that an air force of attack and pursuit should be an integral part of each field army; and that an air force of bombardment and pursuit aircraft and airships should be directly under the General Headquarters Reserve for assignment to special and strategical missions, the accomplishment of which might be either
