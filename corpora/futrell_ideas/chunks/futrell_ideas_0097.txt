He also argued that the principal doctrinal problem for the Air Service, and one that defied solution, was the overlapping jurisdiction between the Army and Navy for coastal defense. !‚Äù  General Patrick stated a concept that a nucleus of aircraft manufacturers had to be kept in readiness to expand in time of emergency to meet the requirements of war.
