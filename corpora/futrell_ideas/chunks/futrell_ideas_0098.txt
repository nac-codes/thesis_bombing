eliminating the duplication of effort wherein both the Army and the Navy, because of different interpretations of the Army Appropriations Act of 5 June 1920, were both apparently charged with the air defense of sea frontiers of the United States. He stated that "the assignment to the air corps of all air coast defense functions which can be performed from land bases (the limit to be taken at about 200 miles under the present state of aircraft development) will be one of the most important and immediate economies, and one of the greatest gains to efficient national defense which will result from the formation of the air corps."!20  The general tenor of Air Service testimony before the Lampert committee reflected the evolutionary program desired by General Patrick. Only General Mitchell, in repeated appearances before the committee and in his series of articles that appeared at almost the same time in the Saturday Evening Post, deviated from the Air Service position. Mitchell asserted that the national organizational pattern that divided aviation among the Army and Navy, the air mail service of the Post Office Department, and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics was designed to protect vested interests rather than to foster a national air power doctrine.
