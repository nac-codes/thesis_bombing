has no function independent of the Army and Navy." Possibly one of his most. telling points—and Drum repeated it several times — was the opinion of the august General Pershing. "The Infantry," Pershing had said on the eve of his retirement, "still remains the backbone of the attack, and the role of the other arms is to help it reach the enemy. ...

What circumstances lay behind the Morrow board’s speed in acting were never definitely known, but it presented its report on 30 November 1925, exactly two weeks before the Lampert committee could report. "We do not consider," stated the Morrow board, "that air power, as an arm of the national defense, has yet demonstrated its value—certainly not in a country situated as ours—for independent operations of such a character as to justify the organization of a separate department. We believe that such independent missions as it is capable of can be better carried out under the high command of the Army and Navy." The board concluded that the United States was in no danger from air attack, and it further stated that "the belief that new and deadlier weapons will shorten future wars and prevent vast expenditures of lives and resources is a dangerous one which, if accepted, might well lead to a readier acceptance of war as the solution of international difficulties."
