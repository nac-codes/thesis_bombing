While the use of gas was now prohibited by treaty, Patrick doubted that such a prohibition would hold in war. "Assume," he suggested, "that aircraft are able to fly at will over enemy territory, in other words, assume air supremacy. Imagine, in consequence, the enemy’s industrial establishments, his munitions factories, his means of communication, destroyed; add to this drenching with gas, which even though not deadly, would cause great discomfort, and then estimate how long such a harassed enemy would fight." The waging of such "air pressure" against an enemy nation, Patrick said, "can best be done by an organization which is developed and directed by those who know thoroughly its achievements, its possibilities, and its limitations."!”°  During the winter of 1925—26, William Mitchell continued to wage a strong fight for an air power concept and the emotional responses engendered by his court-martial ensured him a wide audience. Published in August 1925 as a summarization of some of his articles, Mitchell’s Winged Defense was extensively quoted during his trial. Before the House Committee on Military Affairs on 5 February 1926, Mitchell made a statement that represented the culmination of his thinking on the nature of war and of air power:  There has never been anything that has come which has changed war the way the advent of air power has. The method of prosecuting a war in the old days always was to get at the vital centers of the country in order to paralyze the resistance.

Now, in order to keep the enemy out of that, armies were spread in front of those places and protected them by their flesh and blood. You had mass killings there, sometimes for years before these vital centers were reached. It led to the theory that the hostile army in the field was the main objective, which it was. Once havi
