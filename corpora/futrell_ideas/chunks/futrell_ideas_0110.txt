"The coming of aircraft has greatly modified this isolation on account of the great range and speed which these agents of communications are developing.""* Believing that "changes in military systems come about only through the pressure of public opinion or disaster in war," Mitchell hoped that he could modify the military policy of the United States by laying "aeronautical facts" before Congress and the people.!4” Though he counted himself a close personal friend of Mitchell, General Arnold looked backward many years later and observed that Mitchell’s agitation for air power had a considerable effect upon the development of naval aviation but that it had made Army officers "set their mouths together, draw more into their shell, and if anything, take even a narrower point of view of aviation as an offensive power in warfare."
