It was General Arnold’s theory that a growth of air power of a marked magnitude depended on a combination of a critical state of international relations and a favorable state of aviation technology. To his way of thinking, such a coincidence of national military requirements and air technology had been near at hand just f before the Armistice in 1918 but would not again occur for more than a decade.!”? The successful conclusion of World War I and the Washington Disarmament Treaty of 1922 stunted the development of military aviation. Early in 1925, General Patrick predicted that the Locarno agreements, which marked a relaxation of tension in Europe, would lessen the amount that the American people would be willing to pay for national defense.)  The Baker board stated an unequivocal opinion that the United States was in no danger of air attack from any potential enemy of menacing strength.
