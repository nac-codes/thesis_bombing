Mitchell visualized a requirement for defensive air forces to be stationed in Hawaii, Panama, and Alaska, but he opposed the establishment of a strong air force in the remote Philippine Islands lest it be easily destroyed. Patrick believed, however, that "our only salvation" in the Philippines "is to have an air force there that is competent and qualified to oppose an enemy air force.""“ Oddly enough, the more conservative Patrick believed that there was no question but that the time was coming when "we can bomb trans-sea countries.">> Mitchell, on the other hand, visualized that strings of islands would be seized so that aircraft based on them might fly from one island to another. He pointed out on numerous occasions in 1924 and 1925 that there was no stretch of water in the northern hemisphere between the United States and Europe or Asia greater than the cruising range of the modern aircraft of the day. a  Despite their impatience with military conservatism, Air Corps officers of the Mitchell era frequently talked and thought in terms of the strategic situation of World War I. In 1924 these air officers formally introduced the concept that air power was different from land and sea power; but Patrick, Milling, and Mitchell all agreed that air power could be divided into air force and air service (auxiliary) aviation. By 1926, moreover, Mitchell stated that the air service of the Navy could  "stay just the way it is .. . for work on the high seas.
