We then have control of the air."57 Patrick thought of air supremacy as a condition wherein one adversary practically wiped out another’s air force and thus went virtually unchallenged in the air.  Air Service leaders agreed that an air force had to be an effective D-day force and that it had to be supported by a healthy domestic aircraft industry. In their thoughts on strategic air warfare, the air leaders did not seem to be entirely certain whether air bombardment could win a war without army and navy action. Patrick drew upon Liddell Hart’s concept of a future war under conditions similar to the ground-siege situation of World War I and visualized aerial pressure as breaking the morale and capabilities of an enemy nation that was presumably first brought to bay by air and naval action.~” Even Mitchell hesitated to say that air power could be decisive without ground and naval action. "I believe," he told congressmen on 5 February 1926, that "air power in the future will have a great influence in determining any conflict, so I believe if you figure your whole national defense as 100 percent, air power would make approximately 50 percent, the land forces 30 percent, and the sea forces 20 percent."  Writing in 1948, an Air Force leader evaluated the significance of William Mitchell as being that of a "visionary and missionary."!° Certainly Mitchell saw beyond his times but, because of the close-knit fellowship of air leaders in the early 1920s, one may wonder how many of the basic ide
