ng that of a "visionary and missionary."!° Certainly Mitchell saw beyond his times but, because of the close-knit fellowship of air leaders in the early 1920s, one may wonder how many of the basic ideas attributed to Mitchell actually may have originated with his associates. Mitchell, Patrick, Milling, and other air officers did not differ markedly in their essential thinking except for the impetuousness manifested by Mitchell. It is significant that Mitchell’s last book on aviation, Skyways, published in 1930 after the author had been out of touch with his fellow air officers for some four years, continued few thoughts that he had not presented before 1926.1 In his early writings, however, Mitchell had publicized the ideas which would be continued, expanded, and refined to become the doctrine of the Air Force.
