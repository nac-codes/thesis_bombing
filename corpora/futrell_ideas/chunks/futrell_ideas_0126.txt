Arnold, "we could not have had any real air power much sooner than we got it."! Arnold reasoned that in the early 1920s the state of the technological art of aeronautics was not far enough advanced to support air power doctrines. In the field of national aviation policy and military aviation technology, the early developmental period clearly ended in 1926. In that year the World War I stocks of such items as Liberty engines were used up or declared obsolete, as were many of the war stocks of aircraft. The ten aircraft production companies that had survived the stringent years of the early 1920s were getting on sound footing and were receiving some orders for commercial aircraft. Research and development in aeronautics was making headway in the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), at the Air Corps Materiel Division at Wright Field, Ohio, and in Guggenheim Foundation laboratories. The Air Corps Act of 1926 stated the policy that the government should encourage aircraft production companies to develop design and engineering staffs by following a rather liberal policy of placing experimental orders for prototype aircraft. It also provided that the government ought not to enter into competition with private industry by manufacturing aircraft in government arsenals.  In the early years, the Air Service had considered it logical that the military services should bear the brunt of the burden of developing aeronautics until such time as the utility of air transportation could be established. In 1922 the Air Service had opened a model airway connecting New York, Norfolk, Washington,
