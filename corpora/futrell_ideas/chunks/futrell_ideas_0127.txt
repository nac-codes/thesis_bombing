burden of developing aeronautics until such time as the utility of air transportation could be established. In 1922 the Air Service had opened a model airway connecting New York, Norfolk, Washington, and Dayton; by 1925 the airway was extended to St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and Fort Worth. Lighted beacons guided night flying, and radio-meterological stations were established along the routes. The Air Mail Act of 1925 and the Air Commerce Act of 1926 took the Post Office Department and the military services out of commercial aviation, and the acts served as legislative cornerstones for the development of commercial aviation in the United States. After competitive bidding, the Post Office Department negotiated 12 airmail contracts; these initial contracts provided the eventual base upon which the nation’s great trunk airlines were built. The real breakthrough in aviation, however, occurred in 1927 when Charles A. Lindbergh’s pioneer trans-Atlantic solo flight on 20-21 May galvanized the imagination of the people. After May 1927 the public suddenly wanted to fly. During 1927 the new airline companies carried only 8,679 passengers, but the  61  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 83 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  number of passengers transported reached 48,312 in 1928, 161,933 in 1929, and 384,506 in 1930. In 1926 US aircraft production totaled 1,186 planes and in 1929 the total was 6,193 — 5,516 of which were civil aircraft.’  The Air Corps Wins a Foothold  Both Maj Gen Mason Patrick and Maj Gen James E. Fechet, who became chief of the Air Corps on 14 November 1927, considered the Air Corps Act of 1926 to have been farsighted legislation. F. Trubee Davison was appointed to the newly created position of assistant secretary of war for air on 16 July 1926 and Air Corps officers were assigned to the War Department general staff divisions. After a year’s delay while studies were made, the Air Corps was authorized a five-year expansion program in which it was expected t
