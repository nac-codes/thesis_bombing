instructors desired to exploit. After completing the school in 1928 and 1929, Capt Robert Olds and Lt Kenneth N. Walker remained on the faculty as instructors in bombardment aviation. Olds had assisted Mitchell in his appearances before the Morrow board; Walker was an experienced bombardment officer who had been a member of the Air Service Board in 1925. What these two men doubtlessly already believed was confirmed in May 1929 during the annual Air Corps maneuvers held in Ohio. Maj Walter H. Frank, assistant commandant of the Air Corps Tactical School, served as chief umpire. At the close of the maneuvers he reported: "There is considerable doubt among the umpires as to the ability of any air organization to stop a well organized, well flown air force attack. ... The difficulty that pursuit had, not only in attacking, but in finding some of the missions that were sent into hostile territory during these maneuvers, would make it appear that a well planned air force attack is going to be successful most of the time." Major Frank obviously had studied Douhet’s writings, since he observed: "Douhet, a well known Italian writer, says that ‘now that aviation has entered the ranks as a means of carrying on war, more than ever war is going to be a question of give and take.’ It emphasizes the fact that air force is principally an offensive weapon rather than a defensive one."  Back in the classroom at Langley, Lieutenant Walker saw the major significance of the theorem that "a well organized, well planned, and well flown air force attack will constitute an offensive that cannot be stopped." In fact, his students subsequently would credit him with originating the whole idea." The revised Air Corps Tactical School text The Air Force, issued in April 1930, boldly stated: "a defensive formation of bombardment airplanes properly flown, can accomplish its mission unsupported by friendly pursuit, when opposed by no more than twice its number of hostile pursuit" and that "defensive
