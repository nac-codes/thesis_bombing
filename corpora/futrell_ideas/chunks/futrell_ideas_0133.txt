Under the older air doctrines, air superiority, air supremacy, or control of the air had been considered to be fleeting and attainable only by the concentration of a predominant number of pursuit aircraft in a local area. And although the April 1930 version of The Air Force continued to mention the old doctrine, it marked a shift in air force thinking by suggesting that bomber attacks against enemy airdromes would be the best method of destroying enemy aircraft.!” The next revision of The Air Force (February 1931) went even further, boldly predicting that control of the air, air superiority, or air supremacy (the terms were said to be synonymous) would be attainable throughout a combat theater by destroying the hostile air force in the air, on its airdromes, and in the enemy’s depots and factories. "Victory is practically assured to the commander whose air force has gained and can maintain, control of the air," the text stated, "even if his ground forces are merely equal or somewhat inferior to those of his enemy."8 "Pursuit alone," the text continued, "cannot ensure protection from air attack, but .. . bombardment and attack must participate to a degree undreamed of in the World War in the contest for control of the air, but attacks ag
