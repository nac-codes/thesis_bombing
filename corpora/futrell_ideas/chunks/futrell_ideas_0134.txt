An air force preponderately pursuit, cannot materially affect the ground situation except through the indirect method of destroying hostile aircraft.  At the same time that the concept of the primacy of bombardment aviation was becoming firmly established at the Tactical School, the War Department also appeared to have gotten a clear mandate to develop aviation for the performance of its traditional mission of coast defense. Unwilling to accept General Patrick’s demands for legislation defining the exact division of Army-Navy responsibilities for aerial operations at the nation’s sea coasts, the War Department had preferred in 1926 to rely upon the Joint Army-Navy Board for such decisions. As a portion of the Joint Board’s Joint Action of the Army and the Navy, approved in December 1926, the secretary of war and the secretary of the Navy had agreed that the Navy’s peacetime purchases of land-based aircraft would be "limited to those primarily designed and ordinarily used for scouting and patrolling over the sea." In time of war, however, the Navy would be authorized to conduct "operations from shore bases for overseas scouting, and for the observation and patrol of sea communications and their defense against raids."  65  File: --- fu
