he Air Corps had only 1,619 planes, of which 442 were either obsolescent or nonstandard.” The Air Corps based its new defense strategy on the assumption that the United States would be attacked bya coalition of two or more naval powers who would muster a superior force of carrier-based aviation and upon the fact that the War Department was responsible for coastal air defense. Based upon this appreciation of the situation, Brig Gen Oscar Westover, the assistant chief of the Air Corps, requested that the War Department on 15 March 1933 strengthen the air garrisons of the Panama Canal department, the Hawaiian Islands, and the Philippines, and that it authorize the organization of bombardment and coast defense patrol units in the six critical defense areas along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States. Noting that Air Corps operational doctrine varied according to the various Air Corps tactical commanders, General Westover asked authority to establish a center for tactical research at the Air Corps Tactical School, which had moved from Langley to Maxwell Field, Montgomery, Alabama, on 1 July 1931.  The timing of the Air Corps plan was appropriate since General MacArthur was considering a reorganization of the Army into four continental armies, but the War Department General Staff viewed the Air Corps submission with skepticism. Like the rest of the world, the United States was in the throes of an economic depression. The five-year Air Corps expansion plan that was just concluding, moreover, had worked hardships upon the Army’s ground arms, which had been compelled to give up personnel spaces to the Air Corps since ceilings on overall Army strength had been curtailed while Air Corps authorizations had increased.° On 3 June 1933 the War Department directed the chief of the Air Corps to submit a new plan, staying within his approved ceiling of 1,800 aircraft, that would recommend the manner in which a general headquarters air force would be employed under war
