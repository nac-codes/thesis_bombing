nct requirement for the organization of a mobile GHQ air force that could be concentrated in the peripheral areas of the United States to oppose the landings of hostile forces and to support subsequent ground operations against the invaders. The Drum board recommended that the GHOQ air force should be organized, and it stated that the Air Corps had a requirement for 2,320 aircraft to be organized into 27 bombardment, 17 pursuit, 11 attack, and 20 observation squadrons. The Drum board, however, was unwilling to recommend an immediate increase in Air Corps personnel or aircraft strength until other Army requirements needed to augment ground forces were met. Secretary of War George H. Dern approved the Drum board report on 11 October 1933.8  Toward a Long-Range Bombardment Mission  While the War Department was examining its strategic planning, additional information became available from the concentration of a GHO Air Force (Provisional) on the Pacific coast for a maneuver defense against a simulated hostile fleet and accompanying aircraft. In his July 1933 report on this maneuver, General Westover called attention to the wide disparity between the speed of new bombers and of pursuit and observation planes. "The modern trend of thought," Westover wrote,  is that high speed and otherwise high performing bombardment aircraft, together with observation aviation of superior speed and range and communications characteristics, will suffice for the adequate air defense of this country. The ability of bombardment aviation to fly in close formation and thus to insure greater defense against air attack ... warrants the belief that no known agency can frustrate the accomplishment of a bombardment mission.  Lt Col Henry H."Hap" Arnold, who served as Westoverâ€™s chief of staff during the maneuver, called for the development of air task forces (including transport planes) built around the modern bombers. He also recommended that the time had come to establish an Air Corps board with
