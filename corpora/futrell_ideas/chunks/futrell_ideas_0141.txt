the Air Corps Tactical School from 1927 to 1929 and was assigned as chief of the Air Corps Plans Division between 1933 and 1935, made a translation of an epitome of Douhet’s ideas, which appeared in the French magazine Les Ailes. This translation seems to have provided the basis for an article published by retired Col Charles DeF. Chandler entitled "Air Warfare Doctrine of General Douhet" in U.S. Air Services in May 1933.” At the very least, Douhet’s arguments for building "battle cruiser" aircraft that would not require fighter escort and in favor of the decisiveness of air attack as a means of winning a war, for establishing command of the air by air attacks against an enemy’s airdromes, and for developing commercial air transport aviation as an adjunct to military aviation proved useful as a corroboration of Air Corps ideas. Thus, on 9 May 1933 General Foulois sent 30 mimeographed copies of Chandler’s article to the chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs with the notation that the paper "presents an excellent exposition of certain principles of air warfare." :  Although the War Department was unwilling to permit any immediate Air Corps expansion, General MacArthur was sympathetic with Air Corps proposals for the development of experimental long-range bombers. Completed in July 1932, a study by the Air Corps Materiel Division indicated that a bomber with a speed of 200 miles per hour, a range of 5,000 miles, and a 2,000-pound bomb load was technically possible. In December 1933 the Air Corps suggested and the War Department approved the commitment of funds for Project A: the development of a long-range bomber that not only would be able to "reinforce either coast line  .. but would definitely enable . .. reinforcement of... Panama and Hawaii." The single XB-15 that the Boeing Company would deliver under this contract in 1937 would be too large for existing engines (someone once humorously remarked that if the engines on the XB-15 had ever looked back
