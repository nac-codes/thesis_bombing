XB-15 that the Boeing Company would deliver under this contract in 1937 would be too large for existing engines (someone once humorously remarked that if the engines on the XB-15 had ever looked back to see what they were pulling, all four of them would have quit simultaneously). But technology was catching up with requirements, and the Air Corps was learning to write military characteristics for planes that would be good yet attainable. In 1933 the Air Corps distributed proposals to manufacturers specifying a design competition for a multiengine bomber with a range of 2,000 miles and a speed of 250 miles per hour. In the design competition the following year, Douglas offered the DB-1 (an extrapolation from its DC-3 transport that would be the prototype for the twin-engine B-18); Martin  69  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 91 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  proposed a modification of its already successful B-10; and Boeing offered a four-engine Model 299, which would be the prototype of the B-17 Flying Fortress.*4  Baker Board Influences Air Organization  While making plans to implement the recommendations of the Drum board in the winter of 1933-34, the Air Corps was suddenly launched into a tragic undertaking that would center public attention and criticism upon it. Convinced that there was evidence of collusion and fraud in airmail contracts with commercial air transport companies, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the Air Corps to start flying the airmail effective on 19 February 1934. Undertaking this mission without proper equipment, with inadequate ground organization, in the face of extremely bad winter flying weather, and with only ten daysâ€™ preparation, the Air Corps experienced 57 accidents and suffered 12 fatalities while flying 1,590,155 miles with 777,389 pounds of mail. Alarmed by the loss of life, President Roosevelt, on 10 March, directed the Air Corps to operate only in favorable weather conditions. On 8 May new contracts with priv
