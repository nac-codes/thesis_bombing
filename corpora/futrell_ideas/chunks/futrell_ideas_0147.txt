which are created after the war commences." George argued that in a future war air forces would be in action for weeks or months before land forces got into action and that an air force, therefore, required independent organization.’”  Emphasizing that he was expressing personal opinion, Maj Donald Wilson pointed out that world conditions were leading toward war, that the basic principles of war applied by an intelligent enemy portended that the principal hostile effort against the United States would be through the air, that the defense problem of the United States with planes of limited range was particularly disadvantageous, and that an air force organized, equipped, and trained to defend the United States was an essential element in providing the national defense.
