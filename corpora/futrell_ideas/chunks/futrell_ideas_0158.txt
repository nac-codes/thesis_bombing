rmy-Navy operations. The regulation stated that the effect which air forces were capable of producing and the extent to which they would influence warfare was still undetermined. Complete control of the air was considered to be an unlikely prospect. But attacks were to be made against hostile air forces prior to ground army contact and the interdiction of enemy reconnaissance and hostile attacking aircraft was to be a continuing function during ground battles. In effect the new edition of Training Regulation 440-15 was a middle-ground compromise between extreme viewpoints of both air and ground officers. There were enough loopholes to permit continued air force development. The regulation, for example, respected the unity of the GHOQ Air Force and allowed leeway for independent air operations that were to be conducted before ground armies made contact. For the first time, Maj Gen Follett Bradley later remarked, the regulation spelled out an air doctrine "to which most Air Force officers could subscribe."©  Beliefs in Bomber Invincibility  Much of the reorientation of the Air Corps that was required when the GHOQ Air Force was being established fell to General Westover. This reorientation had to do with organization, the procurement of new aircraft, and the promulgation of a uniform tactical doctrine for the employment of all branches of aviation. General Westover relied heavily upon the Air Corps Tactical School and the Air Corps Board to prepare basic studies in each of these areas. The latter was, in effect, an arm of the Office of Chief of the Air Corps on detached location at Maxwell Field. While he was acting chief of air corps in the absence of Foulois (who was nearing retirement), Westover directed the Air Corps Board on 11 March 1935 to devote its efforts to preparing a uniform tactical doctrine for all types of Air Corps units. But he indicated that the board’s mission would be expanded when more personnel could be assigned to it?  As an immediate solution
