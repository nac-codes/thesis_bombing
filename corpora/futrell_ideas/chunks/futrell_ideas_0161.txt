ground forces.  At its organization in March 1935, the GHQ Air Force consisted of four bombardment, three pursuit, two attack groups, and four reconnaissance squadrons, with a total of approximately 1,000 airplanes.”~ Since this force could not be greatly expanded, General Andrews desired a continued modernization of  79  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 101 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  its aircraft. Because of the limited funds available to the Air Corps during the middle 1930s, however, much thought had to be given to the planned tactical usage and the state of the art of aviation technology before awarding contracts for aircraft purchase. Any arm or service or individual could propose military characteristics of a required type of equipment; the Air Corps, like other arms, submitted its requests, after approval by the Office of Chief of the Air Corps, to The Adjutant General for General Staff study. Approval of the military characteristics by the War Department constituted a requirement for the item. Thereafter an aircraft went through a design phase, the letting of contracts for an experimental model, the testing and evaluation of the experimental model, the procurement of a small quantity of aircraft for service testing, and finally the procurement and delivery of standardized aircraft in numbers. So much time was involved in this process that when standard aircraft were put in service they were already obsolescent in the sense that newer ideas for tactical employment and subsequent advances in aeronautical science had already created a demand for improved types of planes.”  During the early and middle 1930s, the state of aeronautical technology, the strategic requirements of the Red-Orange war plans, and the industrial fabric theory of war, which was being put together at the Tactical School, melded together to produce an emphasis on the development of long-range bombers.
