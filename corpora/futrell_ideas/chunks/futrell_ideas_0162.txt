being put together at the Tactical School, melded together to produce an emphasis on the development of long-range bombers. Using the latest model P-26 pursuit aircraft and B-12 bombers in tests flown at March Field, California, in 1934, Colonel Arnold—who would become assistant chief of the Air Corps in January 1936— concluded that the speeds of bombers and fighters were so evenly matched that "pursuit or fighter airplanes operating from front line airdromes will rarely intercept modern bombers except accidentally." Arnold suggested that the Air Corps ought to develop a two-place, long-range pursuit aircraft that would be able to provide escort for bombers. During 1935 the Air Corps Materiel Division experimented with the design of such a pursuit plane, which basically turned out to be a heavily armed B-10 type. When the matter was referred to the Air Corps Board, the board reasoned that a large pursuit plane with pursuit safety factors, with at least 25 percent greater speed than bombers, with at least the range of bombers, with a higher ceiling capability than bombers, and with an extremely high rate of climb would probably not be technologically possible. The board recommended that experiments to develop such a plane should be continued, but every conceivable means of self-defense for bombardment aircraft should be exhausted before such long-range fighters were provided.”  The principal concern of the Air Corps continued to be developing long-range bombers. From data developed in the Project A bomber program, the Air Corps Materiel Division reported early in 1936 that an 8,000-mile range, 230-mile-per-hour bomber could be built. Ignoring some protest that such an intercontinental bomber would be a weapon of aggression not required for defense, the War Department authorized General Westover in April 1936 to secure a prototype plane from the Douglas Aircraft Company. Given the name Project D and, when it was completed in 1941, the XB-19, this intercontinental bom
