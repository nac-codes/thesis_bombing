thorized General Westover in April 1936 to secure a prototype plane from the Douglas Aircraft Company. Given the name Project D and, when it was completed in 1941, the XB-19, this intercontinental bomber would provide a great quantity of technological information needed for  80  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 102 --- GROWTH OF THE AF IDEA  the development of long-range bombers. But, like the B-15, the XB-19 would be underpowered for its size and weight and would never be placed in quantity procurement.  Already, as a result of design competitions announced in 1934, the Boeing Company offered a prototype XB-17 and the Douglas Company provided an XB-18. In its initial tests during 1935, the four-engine XB-17 flew nonstop at 232 miles per hour for a distance of 2,100 miles. The Air Corps was so favorably impressed that it wished to purchase 65 of these aircraft, but an unfortunate crash on 30 October 1935 destroyed the original XB-17 before it could be formally evaluated. As a result, the War Department awarded the 1935 bomber competition contract to Douglas for the purchase of 133 twin-engine B-18s. In February 1936 the Air Corps obtained permission to order 13 YB-17s for service testing. One justification used at this time was that a limited purchase order would assist Boeing in developing a commercial transport aircraft. Delivery of these 13 planes was completed in August 1937.  During May 1937 GHQ Air Force tested the first seven of the B-17s delivered in an Army-Navy maneuver off the Pacific coast. Because it had greater range and speed than the B-10s that also participated, the B-17s showed important advantages both in sea search and in bombing operations against the battleship Utah, which was deployed for maneuver purposes under a fog bank 385 miles off the California coast. Using new Norden bombsights, the crews of the B-17s were able to score many hits with water-filled bombs with as little as five-second bomb runs over the battleship.‚Äù After nea
