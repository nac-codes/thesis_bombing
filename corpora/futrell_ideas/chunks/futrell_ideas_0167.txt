g. Like the XP-39, which was ordered in fiscal year 1938, the Lightning would be a short-range, cannon-equipped interceptor.  Thoughts on Air Support Aviation  During the 1920s, possibly because of Mitchellâ€™s enthusiasm for such an aircraft, the Air Corps had been interested in developing and employing heavily armored attack planes that could seek out and destroy enemy personnel and materiel in low-level strikes. The Lassiter board of 1923 recommended that both observation squadrons and a force of attack and pursuit aviation should be an integral part of field armies. The assumption was that attack aircraft would be designed for strafing and fragmentation bombing. In the late 1920s, however, the Air Corps did not have a standard attack aircraft; thus, in Air Corps maneuvers pursuit squadrons frequently were employed to simulate attack missions. In 1932 tests of the all metal, low-wing Curtiss XA-8 aircraft led to the procurement the following year of 46 of these planes, which were redesigned with radial engines and designated A-12s. Following development from a commercial aircraft model, the Air Corps secured delivery of 110 Northrop A-17s in 1936. These two-place monoplanes carried five .30-caliber machine guns and stowed fragmentation and demolition bombs internally.  When the Army began looking toward a reorganization of its basic ground forces, the Air Corps initiated serious studies of ground support aviation. In a report on the modernization of the Army completed on 9 January 1936, the Air Corps Board recommended that there should be no change in the existing assignment of an observation group and a balloon observation group as organic parts of each corps and an observation group as an organic part of each field army. The board, however, displayed misgivings about the proposed assignment of attack aviation as an organic part of an army. It noted that attack aviation would appear to be "an ideal weapon in the hands of an Army commander." But, the board argued,
