the proposed assignment of attack aviation as an organic part of an army. It noted that attack aviation would appear to be "an ideal weapon in the hands of an Army commander." But, the board argued, because of its expense, relative scarcity, and capability to penetrate, attack aviation ought to be assigned to the GHQ Air Force, in order that it could be used anywhere in a theater of operations as directed by General Headquarters. "A weapon capable of giving direct support to more than one subordinate unit," the board reasoned, "should be assigned to a superior headquarters." The board also indicated that one of the principal missions of attack aviation would be to disrupt the railways that supported an enemy’s front; highways were thought to be much less vulnerable to air attack.*°  At a 13 April 1936 meeting of the General Staff committee that was studying the reorganization of the Army, General Westover reported his approval of the Air Corps Board report. In some cases, Westover said he would be willing to attach aviation to armies or corps, but he emphasized that aviation supporting an army normally ought to operate under the control of the GHQ Air Force.

He could understand how observation aviation could be a part of the air-ground team, but he argued that pursuit, attack, and bombardment received no assistance from the ground forces in their combat operations. The War Department General Staff did not agree with these independent ideas. It insisted that "even independent air operations are carried out as part of the general plan of the Commander-in-C
