and 13 B-17Bs from current funds in fiscal year 1939.  Although the Air Corps was not obtaining the type of aircraft that it felt necessary for its missions, the War Department procurement actions of the middle 1930s pushed the Air Corps toward its authorized strength of 2,320 aircraft, which would be attained with fiscal year 1939 purchases. Looking toward stabilizing and modernizing Air Corps strength at this figure by the annual purchase of newer replacement aircraft, Secretary of War Harry H. Woodring directed the General Staff to provide him with a five-year 2 aircraft replacement program that would take effect beginning in fiscal year 1940.‚Äù! After it had been drawn up in conferences between Westover and Andrews and had been modified by the General Staff, Secretary Woodring on 18 March 1938 approved the Balanced Air Force Program  84  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 106 --- GROWTH OF THE AF IDEA  (better known as the Woodring program), which authorized the Air Corps to maintain a combat strength of 144 four-engine bombers, 266 twin-engine bombers, 259 attack aircraft, and 425 pursuit aircraft. Although the Air Corps had also asked to purchase a modest number of transport planes, Woodring instead directed that obsolete bombers would be used for transport purposes. The Air Corps was specifically authorized to purchase 67 four-engine bombers in fiscal year 1940 and 48 in fiscal year 1941.  Although the Woodring program was said to manifest "an excellent spirit of cooperation with the ultimate objective of the Army," events were brewing that would cause the War Department to suspend heavy bomber procurement. In April 1937, the chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee that handled War Department estimates recorded his protest against the unwise tendency to build larger and more expensive bombers such as the B-17. On 23 September, however, Andrews forwarded an elaborate defense of the planned four-engine bomber procurement under the Woodring p
