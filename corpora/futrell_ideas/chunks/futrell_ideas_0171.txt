endency to build larger and more expensive bombers such as the B-17. On 23 September, however, Andrews forwarded an elaborate defense of the planned four-engine bomber procurement under the Woodring program. He argued that: (1) the heavy-load, long-endurance multiengine bomber was a powerful instrument of defense and, in view of the nation’s fortunate strategic position and defensive policy, such an airplane as the basic element of the GHO Air Force was essential to accomplishing the GHQ Air Force mission; (2) such an airplane, with bomb and fuel loads interchangeable to a high degree, offered the most economical and efficient means of performing the functions of reconnaissance and bombardment (though not on the same mission); (3) based on per ton load of bombs carried or per square mile of area reconnoitered, a multiengine aircraft was actually cheaper to operate than medium bombers such as the B-10 or the B-18; and (4) in view of these factors the process of experimental aircraft and engine development had to continue so that bombers of longer range and superior performance could be made available.”? On 9 October 1937 Andrews told an audience at the Army War College that "from some sources comes the statement that the modern development of large bombers is for the purpose of aggressive action on the part of the United States. Often we hear of our large bombers spoken of as ‘Weapons of Offense,’ ‘Superbombers,’ and similar appellations. These terms are unfortunate and misleading."  At the same time that General Andrews was pleading the cause of the multiengine bomber, Army officers were drawing different lessons as a result of reports received from the Italian campaign in Ethiopia and the Spanish Civil War. An Army War College course conducted during September 1937 taught that air power had limited value when employed independently and was chiefly useful as a support for surface operations.
