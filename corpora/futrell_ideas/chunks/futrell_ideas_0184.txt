wanted. On 12 January 1939 he asked Congress for $300 million—instead of $500 million—for the Air Corps. In three months Congress passed the emergency Army air defense bill substantially as requested: the Air Corps was authorized a total strength of 5,500 aircraft and given authority to procure 3,251 new planes.  As finally enacted, President Roosevelt’s somewhat hastily managed Army air defense program promised a larger expansion of American aviation production facilities than it did an increase in the size of the active Army Air Corps. The War Department, however, inclined a more sympathetic ear to the Air Corps in part because of the personal influence of Brig Gen George C.

Employing arguments long used by Air Corps officers, General Marshall, on 29 November 1938, cited to General Craig numerous reasons why it was essential for the Air Corps to purchase maximum quantities of B-17B aircraft.!21 Yielding to Arnold’s argument that unity of purpose and planning were necessary to attain the Air Corps mission, the War Department on 1 March 1939 placed the GHQ Air Force under the immediate responsibility of the chief of the Air Corps rather than the chief of staff. 122  In view of General Craig’s impending retirement on 1 September 1939, General Marshall was made acting chief of staff on 1 July.

Andrews immediately organized an Air Section in the G-3 Division, thereby causing lifted eyebrows all over the Munitions Building.’ On 24 August the War Department’s old restriction against Air Corps flights of more than 100 miles out to sea finally was rescinded by the issuance of an Air Corps circular that permitted air operations over the sea to the maximum range of multiengin
