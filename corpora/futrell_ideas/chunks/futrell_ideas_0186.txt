pose of the national defense as being to hold US territory inviolate, to discourage an enemy from attempting an invasion, and to defeat an invasion if it were attempted. The Air Corps Board assumed that an enemy nation would employ combined air, ground, and naval forces in a series of expeditionary operations designed to establish bases progressively closer to vital areas of the United States. It defined air power as "a measure of a nation’s capacity to wage air warfare" and stated that air power would be effective only if it could strike an enemy decisively and simultaneously preserve its own integrity. Under this definition, the range of bombardment aircraft both increased the ability of a plane to apply pressure against the enemy and increased the security of the bombardment bases against enemy attack. Since air forces were said to lack the ability to control the air to a degree that would positively deny hostile air operations, an air force could be defeated only by attacks against its bases. The report asserted that the mission of air power was the offensive, and it accordingly argued that primary emphasis should be given to the development of a striking force (bombardment and attack aircraft) with secondary emphasis to security force aviation (pursuit aircraft and fighters) and to information aviation (reconnaissance and observation aircraft). Although it would be desirable to have fighter escort for bombardment missions, such was believed to be impractical. The Air Corps Board recommended that the main aircraft production capacity should be devoted to the production of the bombardment planes, which would be of greatest value in the initial phases of an attack against the United States, Although it was apparently valuable only for local air defense, pursuit aviation would be required and ought to be assisted by an aircraft warning service.  The GHQ Air Force replies to the Air Corps Board questionnaire differed from the board’s report in a few respects, princi
