on would be required and ought to be assisted by an aircraft warning service.  The GHQ Air Force replies to the Air Corps Board questionnaire differed from the board’s report in a few respects, principally in the characteristics of the aircraft desired for development. Where the board wished to standardize the air fleet chiefly upon bombers with a 1,500-mile range to meet the needs of hemisphere defense, GHQ Air Force wanted a family of bombers that included a heavy bomber with a 5,000-mile radius which could make reprisal attacks against an enemy’s homeland, a medium-range bomber with a 2,500-mile radius for hemisphere defense, a short-range bomber with a 1,500-mile radius to attack hostile naval forces, and an attack bomber with a 500- to 750-mile radius to support ground forces. GHQ also wanted reconnaissance aircraft with ranges equal to bombers, a speedy 350-mile range interceptor, and a 1,500-mile range fighter. Like the Air  93  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 115 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  Corps Board, the GHQ Air Force assumed that bombers would not require fighter escort; but the 8th Pursuit Group in a subjoined statement said that the Air Corps had a requirement for a fighter aircraft that could accompany bombers over enemy territory and render support in the vicinity of defended objectives. The 1st Pursuit Group, on the other hand, did not think that bombardment aviation would require pursuit protection unless a situation demanded prolonged bomber operations against a single objective or several objectives in a specific, limited area. =  As formally undertaken on 12 June 1939, the Aviation Expansion Program authorized an approximate threefold expansion of the combat strength of the Air Corps, and the construction of hemisphere defense bases in the northeastern and southeastern United States, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and Panama.) The Air Corps planned to attain within two years an overall strength of 24 groups — including five heavy bombardme
