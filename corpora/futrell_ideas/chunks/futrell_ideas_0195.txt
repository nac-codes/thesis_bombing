the board could see for developing bomber escort aircraft was to adapt some bombers to defensive purposes. While the board was not entirely certain that such would be necessary if the bomber defenses were  97  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 119 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  strengthened by additional machine guns, it suggested that some bombardment planes might be very heavily armed with extra guns and gun turrets. Three of these special aircraft could be employed as the rear element of a nine-plane bombardment flight to defend the vulnerable rear area of the formation from attacks by hostile fighters.1? This solution apparently caught the attention of General Marshall, who asked Arnold on 13 June to consider the practicability of developing an air cruiser that would perform both air combat and bombardment missions. At this juncture, however, Arnold argued that the Air Corps had to emphasize production of existing equipment instead of research and development on an entirely new aircraft.)  During the spring of 1940 a steady steam of reports from France and England kept the War Department informed of the doctrinal lessons of the war in Europe. These reports noted that the Luftwaffe preserved the integrity of its air fleets and air corps, employing them as unified and flexible striking forces in support of the blitzkrieg. On 11 and 12 May, for example, two air fleets supported the German northern army group in Belgium and Holland, but on 13 and 14 May the whole air mass shifted southward to place a tremendous concentration of fire on French defenses at Sedan in support of a few armored divisions. In contrast, the British initially attached a Royal Air Force component to the British Expeditionary Force in France and maintained an independent advanced air striking force on the continent. On 15 January 1940, however, the British Air Ministry put all this aviation under the commander, British air forces in France, who was directed to use the whole force to
