could not be stationed within enemy territory), the problem of massing fighter defense against a bombing attack was practically insurmountable, considering the great advantages the bomber force had in selecting the time, altitude, density, and place of attack. In 1938 Air Corps maneuvers, pursuit units had been unable to locate inward-bound bombers except on the occasions when the bomber crews intentionally revealed their positions by radio transmissions, thus allowing the pursuit pilots to get some intercept training. In short, the theorem that "a well planned and coordinated bombardment attack, once launched, cannot be stopped" was heavily based on the belief that pursuit aircraft would have great difficulty locating bombardment formations.» Looking backward at the air doctrine of the 1930s, Maj Gen Haywood S. Hansell later commented that the Air Corps Tactical School correctly had assumed that modern bombers could penetrate to their targets within enemy nations, but the edge of the offense over the defense had been much narrower than anyone had believed. As Hansell later remarked:  Our ignorance of radar development was probably a fortunate ignorance. Had this development been well known it is probable that theorists would also have reasoned that, through the aid of radar, defensive forces would be massed against incoming bomber attacks in a degree that would have been too expensive for the offensive. As it ultimately developed the School’s basic concept that the offensive enjoyed a peculiar advantage in air warfare did later turn out to be substantially correct.  100  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 122 --- GROWTH OF THE AF IDEA  In the winter of 1940-41, however, General Arnold was not inclined to be very philosophical. In view of reports from the Battle of Britain, he stated in September 1940 that the Air Corps might well have to conduct the bulk of its bombardment operations at night.°® Based upon already completed development, the War Departmen
