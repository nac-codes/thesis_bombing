tle of Britain, he stated in September 1940 that the Air Corps might well have to conduct the bulk of its bombardment operations at night.°® Based upon already completed development, the War Department placed production orders for SCR-268 antiaircraft artillery radars and for a new SCR-270 early-warning radar. Early in September 1940 Sir Henry Tizard brought the secret of the improved microwave radar to Washington. ~” In February 1941 Arnold complained that air defense was getting "nowhere fast." Asked whether the United States should produce existing early warning radars or delay production in the expectation of getting improved microwave equipment, he stated that the Air Corps "was badly in need of detector equipment for tactical use" and required equipment without delay for training purposes, even if it was not the ultimate type that would be produced.1@ Arnold may well have been thinking about the new capabilities of electronic-directed pursuit when he wrote: "During daylight in good weather, when pursuit aviation is present in strength in an area, it can pretty nearly bar the air to the bomber."  Mobilizing the Army Air Forces for War  To President Roosevelt the German victories in Europe in the spring of 1940 presaged increased aerial threats to the Western Hemisphere. Apparently selecting a good round number that would jolt the nation’s thinking, Roosevelt asked Congress on 16 May to provide 50,000 planes for American defense and a productive capacity for at least that many more planes each year. In addition to building up the Army and Navy, Roosevelt had in mind an even-Stephen division of new bombers with the British.1? Shortly after he took office, the new Secretary of War Henry L.
