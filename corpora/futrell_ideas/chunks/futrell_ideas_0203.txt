ne aircraft was mandatory for the distances involved in hemispheric defense, and that, in the event of military operations in the Far East, long-range bombers would be the only weapons that could exert immediate pressure.  Hardly before the First Aviation Objective was under way, General Marshall discussed the national need to expedite aircraft production in government-owned plants with representatives of the Air Corps Plans Division. On 24 October 1940 Marshall asked whether the Air Corps ought not to visualize expansion beyond the 54-group program. Asa result of this conversation, the Air Corps planned aSecond Aviation Objective, which was not so much designed to increase the number of air groups as to provide an internal augmentation of existing units. As far as possible, the Air Corps handled an additional number of aircraft by increasing the unit equipment of bombardment and transport groups, and by the addition of two squadrons (one designed to be a training squadron) in each interceptor and fighter pursuit group. In addition to these augmentations, the Air Corps expanded its overall force objective to 84 groups, including 24 heavy, 12 medium, and 13 light bombardment; five fighter and 18 interceptor pursuit; one photographic; and 11 observation groups. Not included in the 84-group strength were seven transport groups. Because General Marshall announced that he wanted to see significant numbers of Ju-87 Stuka-type aircraft in the program before he would approve it (and positively overruled the objection of air officers that dive-bombers would be very vulnerable), the 84-group program included 12 groups of dive-bombers in the light-bombardment category. On the basis of this planning, the War Department approved the plans for the Army’s Second Aviation Objective on 14 March 1941, thus authorizing a combat strength of 7,799 planes—including 1,520 heavy bombers; 1,059 medium bombers; 770 light and dive-bombers; 2,500 pursuit interceptors; 525 pursuit fighters; 806
