tt and Arnold on 26 and 27 March 1941, Marshall issued orders that the chief of the Air Corps would prepare, for final action, all papers pertaining to purely Air Corps matters, except those pertaining to war plans and intelligence, and that the deputy chief of staff for air would be responsible for coordination in air matters. Secretary Stimson, moreover, directed that still further steps would be taken to place the air arm under one responsible head. By May 1941 the Air Corps Plans Division had prepared a reorganization that was put into effect by the publication of anew Army Regulation 95-5 on 20 June 1941. This regulation created the Army Air Forces, headed by Arnold, who continued to be Marshall’s deputy chief of staff for air. The Army Air Forces was given authority to coordinate the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps, the Air Force Combat Command (the GHQ Air Force was so redesignated), and all other Army air elements. Direct responsibility for Army aviation matters was given to the chief of the Army Air Forces, who was to be assisted by the Air Staff. Arnold formed the Air Staff by removing most of the Plans Division from the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps and designating its sections as A-1 (Personnel), A-2 (Intelligence), A-3 (Operations and Training), A-4 (Supply and Maintenance), and Air War Plans. The Air War Plans Division was charged to prepare "over-all plans for the control of the activities of the Army Air Forces."17  Within the Air Force Combat Command, the beginning of the Army’s Second Aviation Objective demanded further internal expansion. At its establishment, the Air Force Combat Command took command over the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Air Forces, as the former air districts had been redesignated on 17 March 1941. Placed under command of the similarly numbered air forces, the I, II, II, and IV Bomber Commands were constituted on 4 September 1941 and were quickly activated.!’3 With the implementation of the Second Aviation Object
