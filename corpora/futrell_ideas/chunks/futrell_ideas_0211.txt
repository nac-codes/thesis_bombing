The Plans Division agreed that the board ought to evaluate these lessons but it considered that it was "vital that the Air Corps Board continue its present work at its present location and away from the turmoil of this office."  In view of the many changes that were sweeping the War Department in 1941, it was remarkable that any doctrinal lessons were committed to paper that year.
