wer may prevent wars from being lost, and by weakening enemy strength may greatly contribute to victory. By themselves, however, naval and air forces seldom, if ever, win important wars. It should be recognized as an almost invariable rule that only land armies can finally win wars."  The Joint Board’s statement that "only land armies can finally win wars" indicated a polite disbelief of the contention in AWPD-1 that a strategic air offensive against Germany might preclude the need for a land campaign. In its annex to the Joint Board report, the Army insisted that the United States should have forces in being for a land offensive against Germany by 1 July 1943 and that prior to the undertaking of a land campaign against the continent of Europe, sea and air forces should have accomplished overwhelming air superiority, rendered the economic and industrial life of Germany ineffective, weakened the combat effectiveness of German air and ground units, and reduced the popular support of the German people for the continuation of the war.  112  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 134 --- GROWTH OF THE AF IDEA  Although a summary with verbatim extracts of the Joint Board estimate was published in the Chicago Daily Tribune on 4 December 1941 as an exposure of Roosevelt’s secret war plan, neither the Joint Board estimate nor AWPD-1 was a war plan. They were, rather, efforts to provide the Office of Production Management with a good feel for what America’s wartime military requirements might be. As a matter of fact, the visualization in AWPD-1 to the effect that the Army Air Forces would require an ultimate force of 239 air groups and 108 observation squadrons turned out to be an estimate that was remarkably similar to the 269 tactical groups that the Army Air Forces would possess at its maximum strength during World War 11.!"? Much of the strategic thought expressed in the two studies would turn up in one form or another during World War II. The studies produced at le
