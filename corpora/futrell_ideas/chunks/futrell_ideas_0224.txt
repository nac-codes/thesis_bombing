possess at its maximum strength during World War 11.!"? Much of the strategic thought expressed in the two studies would turn up in one form or another during World War II. The studies produced at least two immediate actions. On 11 April 1941 the Air Corps initiated a design competition for a high-altitude, 10,000-mile-range intercontinental bomber. On 19 August General Arnold indicated that the project must be pushed. Both Douglas and Northrop submitted preliminary designs and on 15 December 1941 a contract for developing two experimental XB-36 aircraft was awarded to the Douglas Aircraft Company.” AWPD-1 also provided new hope that Japanese aggression could be deterred and that the Philippines could be defended.  In November 1938, when he had stated that only long-range bomber aircraft could affect Hitler’s mad course toward war, President Roosevelt had appeared to grasp the close relationship between effective military force and the national foreign policy objectives. On 26 July 1941, President Roosevelt issued an executive order freezing Japanese assets in the United States and halting all trade with the aggressor nation. Both General Marshall and Adm Harold R. Stark recommended against this action, reasoning that an embargo on Japan’s oil supplies would force Japan either to surrender its long-range aggressive aims or, much more likely, to strike for oil in the Netherlands Indies at the cost of war with the United States. Only belatedly, after the diplomatic move had been made, was attention given to strengthening the defense of the Philippines. To maintain the strategic defensive in the Far East, AWPD-1 recommended, and the Joint Board estimate accepted, an immediate need for the movement of additional air units— principally four heavy bombardment groups — to the Philippines. On 18 August, Secretary Stimson approved a Philippine reinforcement plan including moving one B-17 group there without delay and sending three other groups there by February 1942. Whethe
