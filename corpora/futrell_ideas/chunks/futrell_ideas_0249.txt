The second phase was to wage a decisive air offensive against the Axis powers in Europe, to engage in a defensive effort in the Far East, and to conduct a land invasion of Europe "when and if it becomes necessary." After defeating the European enemies, the third phase was to be sustained air offensives against Japanese military and civil strength, the use of land forces when and if necessary, and the maintenance of sufficient flexibility to exploit opportune openings for decisive action against Japan. The plan recommended an air force of 90,000 airplanes, a production rate of 3,000 airplanes a month, and an Army of 3,000,000 men and women.
