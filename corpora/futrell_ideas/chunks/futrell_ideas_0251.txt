of combined forces in theaters of operations. From his experience in World War I in France, General George C. Marshall held a conviction that "there must be one man in command of the entire theaterâ€”air, ground, and ships." Despite a lack of enthusiasm among the other military chiefs, Marshall convinced President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill of the need to establish a unified American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) in the Western Pacific-East Indies. From this time on the US War Department believed that the Allies were committed to a supreme commander in combined operations. As a matter of fact, ABDACOM was disestablished on 23 February 1942 and future Allied theater commanders would not be given "supreme" authority. The question of the manner in which an Allied theater commander would receive his directives was solved at Arcadia by the establishment of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, a composite organization of the British army, navy, and air force chiefs of staff and their American counterparts. The use of the British chiefs of staff committee as a model for the Combined Chiefs of Staff raised an awkward complexity in that the Army Air Forces was part of the US Army, whereas the Royal Air Force was a separate service. Arnold, nevertheless, was recognized as a member of both the Combined Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, which replaced the Joint Army-Navy Board, informally came into being at Arcadia and held its first formal meeting on 9 February 1942.  Sweeping changes in the organization of the War Department and the Army Air Forces (AAF) closely followed the Arcadia agreements. Effective on 9 March 1942, the War Department was consolidated into three coordinate forces each under a commanding general: the Army Air Forces, the Army Ground Forces, and the Services of Supply (later the Army Service Forces). General Headquarters, the Office of Chief of Air Corps, and the Air Force Combat Command were
