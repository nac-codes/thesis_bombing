ertook the study, which, when completed on 9 September 1942, was entitled AWPD-42, Requirements for Air Ascendancy.?° Requirements were based on air operations visualized for 1943 and early 1944 to include: an air offensive against Europe to deplete the Luftwaffe, destroy the sources of German submarine construction, and undermine the German war-making capacity; air support for a land offensive in northwest Africa; air support for land operations to retain the Middle East; air support for surface operations in the Pacific and Far East to regain base areas for a final offensive against Japan proper; and hemispheric defense, including antisubmarine patrol. To meet such a schedule of operations, the planners calculated that the Army Air Forces would require 281 combat groups by 1 January 1944 — including 76 heavy bomber, 43 medium bomber, 26 light and dive-bomber, 70 fighter, 20 observation, 12 photographic reconnaissance, and 34 troop carrier groups. The study proposed  130  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 152 --- AF THINKING AND WWII  that 130,906 aircraft should be produced in 1943 — 75,416 for the Army, 33,050 for the Navy, and 22,440 for the Allies.  While it was prepared by several of the same officers who had written AWPD-1, AWPD-42 revealed something of the change in doctrinal thinking that was taking place in 1942. The former study had posed large requirements for B-29 and B-36 aircraft, but AWPD-42 expected few B-29s and no B-36s to come from production in 1943. It was also evident that it would be possible to base more bombers in Great Britain than had been thought earlier. The strategic philosophy of the two studies was Virtually the same, but a new study of Germany’s target system was included in AWPD-42. The priority targets were stated to be airplane assembly and aircraft engine plants, submarine yards, transportation and power centers and networks, and oil, aluminum, and rubber manufacturing facilities. The air campaign, thus, was to prepare the wa
