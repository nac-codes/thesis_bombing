sembly and aircraft engine plants, submarine yards, transportation and power centers and networks, and oil, aluminum, and rubber manufacturing facilities. The air campaign, thus, was to prepare the way for surface attack. While the changed target priorities reflected a growing demand for establishing air superiority over Germany, AWPD-42 confidently predicted that "our current type bombers can penetrate German defenses to the limit of their radius of operation without excessive losses."  Both AWPD-1 and AWPD-4?2 visualized that a land invasion of Europe would probably follow the strategic bombing campaign, but the timing of the air offensive had been changed. AWPD-1 had projected six months of intensified bombing to begin in mid-1942, however, AWPD-42 necessarily postponed it until late 1944 because of the failure to receive the overriding priorities for aircraft production as recommended in AWPD-42, plus the diversion of heavy and medium bombers to the US Navy for patrol and antisubmarine warfare. Moreover, to conserve strategic bomber resources, AWPD-42 urged that no allocations of heavy or medium bombers be made to the Navy from 1943 production.â€™ This provision, together with the competition that the proposed aircraft production program posed to the building of ships, aircraft carriers, and naval aircraft, caused the Navy to reject AWPD-42 out of hand. In a compromise on 26 November 1942, President Roosevelt finally approved a program of building 107,000 aircraft and substantial portions of the Navy shipbuilding program.  The decisions made in the winter of 1942-43 as to the final force objectives of the United States marked great changes in the internal composition of the Army. In the summer of 1940 the US victory program had called for a ground army of 215 divisions and an air force of 84 groups, but in the winter of 1942-43 the US Army changed its force plans to include 89 divisions and 273 air force groups, the 273 groups being considered to be the saturation
