s and an air force of 84 groups, but in the winter of 1942-43 the US Army changed its force plans to include 89 divisions and 273 air force groups, the 273 groups being considered to be the saturation point in the development of Army air power. Toward that end the Army Air Forces activated a total of 269 combat groups by December 1943. Some of these groups were paper units, and not a few of them were pledged to hemispheric defense. An agreement between the Army and Navy on 10 June 1943 led the Navy to take charge of antisubmarine defense, thus reducing Army requirements for air groups for hemispheric defense. As air planners had earlier predicted, moreover, the acquisition of more efficient B-29 Superfortress bombers permitted reductions in the number of bomber units needed. In a readjustment of the Army Air Forces program, most of the paper  131  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 153 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  units among the 269 combat groups were inactivated in the spring of 1944. Thereafter the Army Air Forces built upward toward the maximum combat strength of 243 groups it would attain in February 1945. This maximum combat strength included 25 very heavy bombardment, 27 heavy bombardment, 20 medium bombardment, 8 light bombardment, 71 fighter, 13 reconnaissance, 29 troop carrier, and 5 composite groups. 3 Neither the peak strength of 269 groups nor the maximum combat strength of 243 groups equaled the 281 combat groups that AWPD-42 had predicted would be required for air supremacy over the Axis. Reduced requirements for hemispheric defense and the arrival of the B-29 very heavy bombers in the combat inventory permitted reductions in total group requirements.  Many Procedures for Developing Air Doctrine  During the frantic months in which the Army Air Forces was mobilizing for war, General Arnold obviously considered it appropriate that the largest concentration of experienced air officers should be situated in Headquarters Army Air Forces.
