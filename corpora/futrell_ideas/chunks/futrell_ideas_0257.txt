Forces was mobilizing for war, General Arnold obviously considered it appropriate that the largest concentration of experienced air officers should be situated in Headquarters Army Air Forces. The organization of the headquarters also reflected Arnoldâ€™s notions about how a staff should work. Arnold often remarked that laborious staff review procedures tended to emasculate bold air concepts and decisions: "termites" in a staff could eat up good ideas before they could get through to the top. Arnold accordingly saw nothing wrong in dividing his headquarters into a policy and operating staff wherein 31 individuals had direct access to him and authority to sign action papers by his authority.!4 Air Force field commanders, however, complained of conflicts in orders and directives. The same thing was true of doctrinal and policy statements. The director of military requirements was chiefly concerned with formulating doctrine and employment policies, but his status was essentially advisory. At the same time other directorates were issuing instructions in various forms. As a result of this decentralization, many miscellaneous publications, each containing specialized fragments of air force ideas, were sent out to field commanders. These collections were too voluminous for any commander to study and the whole collection did not form a consistent and complete statement of air doctrines and employment policies. Col Charles G. Williamson, chief of the bombardment division, pointed out these facts in a discussion of air policies and doctrines written on 3 March 1943. "In military matters, especially those of the magnitude of the operations of the present war, where mistakes and inconsistencies cost thousands of lives and millions of man-hours," he warned, "it is all the more important that there be clearly expressed guiding principles which are clearly understood by all planners, as well as by all who are charged with the handling of the forces in the field."
