all field service regulations, field manuals, and publications which established AAF operational and training doctrine.  To meet the added responsibilities for preparing the doctrinal publications and the new Air Operations Briefs, General Eubank organized an Evaluation Division within the AAF Board. The Policy Branch of this division received the task of reviewing and determining requirements for doctrinal manuals. Having determined the need for a manual, the Policy Branch was expected to establish committees made up of qualified personnel from the AAF Board, the School of Applied Tactics, the Proving Ground Command, and any other interested command to prepare a draft of the manual. Even though the Policy Branch outlined a comprehensive series of air manuals that should be written, it was not notably successful in producing manuals. The Policy Branch had difficulty committing qualified personnel to its project committees and preparing a draft manual required the examining of a mass of pertinent reports and the soliciting and evaluating of suggestions from many different headquarters. The Policy Branch also ran into problems in trying to coordinate its work with the Army Ground Forces. Headquarters Army Ground Forces, for example, refused to approve the draft training circular entitled "Air-Ground Cooperation," which was forwarded to it in April 1944; it complained that the draft was theoretical and contained far too much of the thinking incorporated in FM 100-20.
