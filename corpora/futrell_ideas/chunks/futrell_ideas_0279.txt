Each of the boards would be expected to forward evaluations with supporting data to the Army Air Forces at 30-day intervals, and the reports were to be screened by the OC&R and plans directorate and sent to the AAF Board for thorough analysis. Within a few weeks the evaluation boards departed for the combat theaters, each headed by an experienced air officer — Maj Gen Jacob E. Fickel for the European theater of operations, Maj Gen John F.
