ct subjects they investigated—the only criteria being that the subject was to be of sufficient importance "to permit intelligent redirection of policy and effort in attaining maximum economy of forces in the employment of air."*! In the theaters, the AAF evaluation boards generally undertook to prepare evaluations of air actions by campaigns rather than by months. As a result their often voluminous reports would provide an important source of documentation about air operations in World War II but were not as valuable as they might have been for a current evaluation of the war effort. At the end of hostilities, the European theater and Southwest Pacific AAF evaluation boards had not completed all of their reports, so after September 1945 some personnel from these two boards were returned to Orlando to finish their tasks.  The second step toward solving evaluation problems emerged from discussions in the Air Staff in March 1944. General Fairchild suggested that a separate analysis should be made of strategic bombing, and he recommended that General Spaatz have US Strategic Air Forces in Europe submit a plan for a comprehensive evaluation. In a letter to Arnold on 5 April, Spaatz endorsed the proposal for a survey of the American strategic bombing effort and suggested that the survey be headed by a civilian of higher caliber and reputation. Although the British wanted to make a joint bombing survey, Spaatz argued against this approach because he wanted to get plain facts from a committee headed by an impartial chairman; he feared that the Soviets might be offended at being excluded from a combined undertaking; and he wanted a quick survey that would be concluded in time to be of use in planning for the strategic air campaign against Japan. The arrival of General Fickel’s evaluation board threatened some duplication of effort, but Fickel agreed to confine his studies to the tactical air warfare effort.-  When the necessary groundwork had been laid, President Roosevelt d
