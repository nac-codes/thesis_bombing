rease in the AAF Board’s work. It ceased publication of the Air Operations Briefs and the board’s activities fell from a wartime high of 514 active projects, reached on 15 March 1945, to only 230 projects in work, as of 15 September 1945, most of which were operational suitability tests on new items of equipment that were in the production pipelines at the war’s end.>” In the hope that it would be possible to record operational experience while it was still fresh, the Army Air Forces on 7 September 1945 directed the AAF Board to prepare a field service regulation that would incorporate all of the proven air-ground doctrine of World War II. On 8 October the Army Air Forces further directed the board to revise FMs 100-5 and 100-20 and then to bring all air force field manuals in the 1- series into conformity with these two basic manuals. The board completed a draft of a combined air-ground operations manual on 14 March 1946. Representing the best thought to come out of World War II, the manual was coordinated through the War Department G-3 and the Army Ground Forces and was published as War Department Field Manual 31-35, Air-Ground Operations, on 13 August 1946.8 Since General Eubank was unable to obtain experienced personnel, the revision of other manuals had to await the readjustment that followed the establishment of the postwar air force.  Thus, World War II was doubtlessly the best reported and most thoroughly documented conflict of all time. Because of this sheer volume of documentation, however, few persons — military or civilian—would have the time or the incentive  146  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 168 --- AF THINKING AND WWII  to master it. One natural result, according to the civilian scholar Bernard Brodie, was "the divorcement of doctrine from any military experience other than that which has been intensely personal with its proponents."” Under such circumstances, the operational experience of World War II could be cited to prove almost an
