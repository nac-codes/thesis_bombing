any military experience other than that which has been intensely personal with its proponents."” Under such circumstances, the operational experience of World War II could be cited to prove almost any preconception. In 1946, for example, reports by ranking Army officers such as Gen Omar N. Bradley, Gen George S. Patton, and Lt Gen Lucian K. Truscott were offered as a justification of a continuing requirement for horse cavalry in the postwar Army. "If you will only let experience be your teacher," warned Maj Gen Orvil Anderson, "you can have any damn lesson you want."

"Progress in the development of military science and strategy," he said, "is vitally dependent upon the soundness of the evaluations of past battle experience and upon the boldness, inspiration and depth of the projected thinking which creates the solution for the future."*!  Examination of the Strategic Air War  "Because the last war saw the weapons of all services employed in profusion," wrote General Spaatz, who had commanded the US Strategic Air Forces (USSTAF) in Europe and the US Army Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, "one may argue the exact degree of contribution made by strategic bombing to the final decision." According to Spaatz, "the war against Germany was fundamentally an infantry war supported by air power, much as the war against Japan was fundamentally a naval war supported by air." Writing in 1948 an Air University instructor noted that the "Douhet Theory did not receive a thorough test in World War II." The same officer also noted that the "Douhet Theory was somewhat less than an unqualified success in World War II due to the inability of the equipment of the times to fulfill Douhet’s expectations." Bernard Brodie, on the other hand, considered World War II to have been a fair test of Douhet’s ideas. "If we disregard the over-all vision and consider only specific asse
