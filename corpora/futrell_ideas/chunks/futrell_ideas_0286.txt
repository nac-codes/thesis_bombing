fill Douhet’s expectations." Bernard Brodie, on the other hand, considered World War II to have been a fair test of Douhet’s ideas. "If we disregard the over-all vision and consider only specific assertions," Brodie wrote, "it is clear that in World War II Douhet was proved wrong on almost every important point he made. . . . But it is also true that he was able to create a framework of strategic thought which is considered by many responsible airmen to fit the atomic age astonishingly well."  "No useful purpose would be served now," Spaatz wrote in 1948, "by refighting these wars [against Germany and Japan] as the airman might have wished to fight them."© Nevertheless, other air force officers, in their effort to establish a conceptual basis for forward thinking, sought to draw what lessons they could from World War II. To Lt Gen George C. Kenney, who had commanded the Allied Air Forces, Southwest Pacific Area, and the US Far East Air Forces, one of the major lessons of the war against Japan was the value of air power for keeping the peace. In November 1945 he said: "I believe that air power is this Nation’s first line of defense and that only in air power can we find a weapon formidable enough to  147  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 169 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  maintain the peace." In a lecture several years later, Kenney developed the same theme:  If the value of air power in the defense had been recognized a few years earlier our national policy would not have accepted the inevitability of losing the Philippines at the outbreak of a war with Japan. Fairly strong bomber and fighter forces in the Philippines and in Hawaii, with the warning services available at that time, could have prevented the disasters at Pearl Harbor, Bataan and Corregidor. It is extremely doubtful that Japan would even have challenged us at all.  In a Senate hearing in October 1945, General Arnold emphasized that responsibility for the defense of the United States rested
