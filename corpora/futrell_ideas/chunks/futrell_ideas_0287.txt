is extremely doubtful that Japan would even have challenged us at all.  In a Senate hearing in October 1945, General Arnold emphasized that responsibility for the defense of the United States rested upon the air force. "The defense," he said, "has got to be an offensive mission against the source [of enemy power]. ... But, better still, the actual existence of these weapons of our own in sufficient quantities and so located that a potential aggressor knows we can use them effectively against him, will have a very deterring effect, particularly if the aggressor does not know the whole story and only knows part of the story."°” General Marshall agreed that "the future peace of the world will largely depend not only on the international policies of the United States but even more on our practical ability to endow those policies with the strength to command international respect."
