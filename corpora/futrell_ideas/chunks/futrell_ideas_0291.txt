an overall air command for Europe and Africa in December 1942, the Casablanca conference charged Sir Charles Portal, chief of air staff, RAF, with the strategical direction of British and American bomber operations from the United Kingdom. This responsibility did not include decisions on matters of tactics or techniques. Instead, those two areas remained the provinces of Lt Gen Ira C. Eaker, commander of the US Eighth Air Force, and Sir Arthur Harris, commander of the RAF Bomber Command. And the command of Allied air power in the African and European theaters remained divided throughout the war. In view of the impending Overlord ground invasion of Europe, the Allied Expeditionary Air Force was established on 17 November 1943 under the command of Air Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory. It was given operational control over the RAF Tactical Air Force, the Air Defence of Great Britain, and the US Ninth Air Force. But at this same time, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed to establish a strategic air commander in the United Kingdom to control the operations of the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces, the latter being based in Italy. The British chiefs of staff did not favor the plan; nevertheless, it was effected on 1 January 1944 when General Spaatz assumed command of the US Strategic Air Forces (USSTAF) in Europe. Since the RAF Bomber Command remained outside this framework, Sir Charles Portal continued to be the coordinating agent of the Combined Chiefs of Staff for strategic bombing until 14 April 1944 when USSTAF passed to the control of Gen Dwight D. Eisenhower as commander, Allied Expeditionary Forces. Following completion of Overlord, the combined chiefs reassumed control of the strategic bomber forces on 14 September 1944.77  Maj Gen Orvil Anderson, who served as chairman, Combined Operational Planning Committee, England, from June 1943 to January 1944 and as assistant chief of staff for operations of the VIII Bomber Command from January to June 1944, was critic
