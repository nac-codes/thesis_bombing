tegic bombing attack followed rather than preceded the invasion of Europe. Weak at the war’s beginning, the RAF Bomber Command did not begin strategic bombing attacks against Germany until May 1940. After a slow buildup the US Eighth Air Force conducted its first daylight bombing mission from bases in the United Kingdom on 17 August 1942, but much of the strength of this small air force was soon drained away to support the Allied land campaign in North Africa. In January 1943 the Army Air Forces had only 12 heavy bombardment groups deployed in theaters against Germany. The maximum strength of 62 heavy bomber groups was not attained against Germany until May 1944, less than a month before the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. The total of the first-line B-17s and B-24s deployed against Germany increased from 413 in January 1943 to a maximum of 5,072 in March 1945.” The RAF Bomber Command’s strength increased from a miscellany of 515 light, medium, and heavy bombers in J anuary 1943 to a total of 1,069 Halifax, Lancaster, and Mosquito bombers in April 1945.5 Of the total 2,770,540 tons of bombs dropped by AAF and RAF aircraft against Germany, only 17 percent fell prior to 1 January 1944 and only 28 percent prior to 1July 194451 By mid-1944 the limited strategic air campaign had fatally weakened Germany’s capacity to counter the Allied ground invasion, but the maximum military benefits did not accrue to the invading forces because the greatest weight of the strategic air attack had not yet been felt by the German people or the German military forces.®”  Battling for Air Superiority  One of the basic premises of Army Air Forces doctrine was that its heavy bomber aircraft, flown in massed and self-defending formations, could successfully penetrate enemy defenses and perform precision-bombing attacks in daylight hours.
