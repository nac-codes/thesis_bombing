Hence the Army Air Forces ought to concentrate on moving bombers to Britain and delay the deployment of fighters there until they were needed to support a ground invasion of Europe. Arnold and Portal decided to limit the deployment of US fighters to the United Kingdom to the few groups required for local air defense. AAF programs, nevertheless, gave a reasonable priority to activating and training the fighter groups that would be needed to provide a canopy for the invasion of Europe even though early Eighth Air Force bomber attacks, albeit relatively shallow, seemed to indicate that the bombers could defend themselves.  The Casablanca directive nominated the German aircraft industry for destruction and directed the Eighth Air Force "to impose heavy losses on the German day fighter force and to contain German fighter strength away from the Russian and Mediterranean theaters of war," but it made no requirement for establishing air superiority over Germany.® During the first half of 1943, General Eaker used Eighth Air Force P-47s and RAF fighters to help the heavy bombers penetrate the German fighter belt inward from the channel coast. Nevertheless, he remained convinced that his main requirement was for larger bomber forces that would permit the planes to fly more effective defensive formations and additional deception missions. But opposition began to build against Eaker’s position. As early as 23 March 1943, Eaker’s own plans section argued that "our primary objective should be the German Fighter Force in the air, on the ground, and the industry which supports it.... A sufficient depletion of the German Fighter Force is the one essential preliminary to our imposing our will
