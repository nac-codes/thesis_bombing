the German Fighter Force in the air, on the ground, and the industry which supports it.... A sufficient depletion of the German Fighter Force is the one essential preliminary to our imposing our will by the use of air power on any portion of the German war effort which may be subsequently selected, be it submarines, oil, transportation or morale." Back in the United States, following the old Air Corps Board’s idea for the development of a "bomber-destroyer" aircraft, the AAF Board tested several YB-40s— heavily armed B-17s designed to provide tremendously augmented firepower to a bomber formation. A similar modification of the B-24, called the YB-41, also was tested at Eglin Field. These experiments indicated methods of increasing the armament on basic B-17s and B-24s. However, when the YB-40s were employed in combat in May 1943, they were too heavy to stay in formation with B-17s and the whole concept proved impracticable.  Alarmed by the increasing success of Luftwaffe fighters (which were not armed with cannon and could outrange the bombers’ defensive fire), the Combined Chiefs of Staff, in June 1943, directed that the "first priority in the operation of British and American bombers based in the United Kingdom shall be accorded to the attack of German fighter forces and the industry upon which they depend." On 28 June, Arnold gave the Army Air Forces six months to provide some escort aircraft that could accompany bombers to targets deep within Germany, but the heavy losses suffered by Eighth Air Force bombers on the long-range missions to Schweinfurt and Regensburg on 17 August and on the repeat attack on Schweinfurt on 14 October gave warning that escort planes would be required well before 1 January 1944, In Washington, Kuter pointed out to Arnold that the invasions of  152  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 174 --- AF THINKING AND WWII  Europe—Overlord on the Normandy coast and Anvil in southern France (tentatively set for May or June 1944) — might
