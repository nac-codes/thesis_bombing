ns over Germany even without air superiority, most planners and commanders acknowledged that an early attainment of Allied control of the air was necessary if the surface invasions of Europe were to succeed. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey reached the opposite conclusion, however, stating that the establishment of Allied domination of the air over Europe had proven essential to the strategic bombing campaign. Without domination of the air, the bombing survey reported, "attacks on the basic economy of the enemy could not have been delivered in sufficient force and with sufficient freedom to bring effective and lasting results."”! In describing the Schweinfurt-Regensburg losses, the official Air Force history of World War II likewise concluded: "The fact was that the Eighth Air Force had for the time being lost air superiority over Germany. And it was obvious that superiority could not be regained until sufficient long-range escort became available."”* When questioned in October 1949 about the validity of this statement and about the history’s general conclusion that the Eighth Air Force had sustained unacceptable losses late in 1943, Gen Hoyt S. Vandenberg pointed out that bombers had been able to get through to their targets in spite of strong enemy defenses.

He further explained that the question of acceptable or unacceptable losses to a bomber force depended upon "the destructive effect of bomber weapons and the value of the strategic target."

Ground fire had not been effective against aircraft in World War I or in the Spanish C
