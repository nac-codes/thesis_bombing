ive action. Over Saint-Nazaire on 23 November 1942, with LeMay leading, the 305th encountered intense flak that damaged 6 of the 16 B-17s on the mission (including LeMay’s lead plane), but no planes were lost and the target was well covered with bombs. "We never did take any evasive action from then on," LeMay recalled, "and within three weeks no one else was taking evasive action either." x  Operating over France and Germany, American heavy bombers and other aircraft met exceedingly strong antiaircraft artillery defenses. From the start of the war Germany had given flak equipment an equal production priority with aircraft, and in December 1944 she gave it an even higher priority. By the end of 1944, German flak defenses included 16,000 heavy guns, 50,000 light and mobile guns, 7,500 searchlights, and 1,500 barrage balloons; more than 1,000,000 men manned these defenses. Important targets were defended all around by emplacements of heavy guns—the principal gun being the 88-millimeter piece that could fire 20 rounds per minute. The great Ruhr defenses were capable of hurling 200 tons of  155  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 177 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  metal and explosives into the air every minute; the Cologne defenses, 80 tons; and the Berlin defenses, 70 tons. The German flak defenses, firing for one minute, could have put 5,000 tons of shells into the sky.” Within the Ninth Air Force, flak evaluation intelligence and counterflak tactics helped tactical aircraft maintain the element of surprise that they needed to survive fire from very mobile and always moving light antiaircraft guns.” The Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces also used flak intelligence in the planning of their missions. However, in view of the circumjacent defenses at most strategic targets, about the best that could be said was that a mission approaching a hypothetical target from the north might be expected to draw 372 rounds, while one from the east would receive 374.
