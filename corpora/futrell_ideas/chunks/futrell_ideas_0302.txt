rgets, about the best that could be said was that a mission approaching a hypothetical target from the north might be expected to draw 372 rounds, while one from the east would receive 374. In the last months of the war, some bombs would be directed at flak emplacements for flak suppression purposes. But, for the most part, strategic bomber mission planners usually ignored flak and picked target approaches for some other tactical reason such as a course that would have a good initial point or that would keep the sun at the backs of the bombardiers. The best tactic against heavy flak was to get as many bombers over a strategic target as quickly as possible to saturate the defense.  In the early years of the war in the European theater, hostile flak and fighters worked together effectively; many of the bombers shot down by the Luftwaffe were first crippled by flak and forced to straggle. When the back of the German air force was broken early in 1944, antiaircraft artillery became the major combat risk for the Allied bomber units. In the European theater from August 1942 through May 1945, the Army Air Forces lost 4,274 aircraft in air-to-air combat (2,452 heavy bombers, 131 medium and light bombers, and 1,691 fighters) and 5,380 aircraft to hostile antiaircraft fire (2,439 heavy bombers, 492 medium and light bombers, and 2,449 fighters). Figured in terms of total American combat sorties flown in the European theater (274,921 by heavy bombers, 96,523 by light and medium bombers, and 527,314 by fighters), the loss rate was less than 2 percent even against the most effective antiaircraft defenses. Despite this evidence to the contrary, Army wargamers, testing modern methods of wargaming shortly after the war ended, played the B-17s and B-24s against the German fighter and 88-millimeter gun defenses of World War II and concluded that the heavy bombers could not live in such an environment. When told of these conclusions, General LeMay responded: "Experience, I think, is mo
