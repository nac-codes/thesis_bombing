of fuel had become insufficient for sustaining effective military operations. Under the full force of strategic bomber attack and with war requirements multiplying more swiftly than production could handle, the economic life of Germany virtually collapsed as 1944 drew to a close. "The German experience," stated the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, "suggests that even a first-class military power —rugged and resilient as Germany was— cannot live long under full-scale and free exploitation of air weapons over the heart of its territory."!>  Early Strategic Bombing in the Pacific-Far East  In the Pacific, the pattern of Allied operations and commitment of forces was different from that employed in Europe, but the strategy relative to the employment of air power was essentially the same. Because of Japanese expansion in the first year of the war, Air Force planners recognized that even the very long range B-29s would be unable to reach the Japanese homeland until the enemy’s perimeter had been reduced. "Our armed forces in the Far Eastern Theater," stated AWPD-42, "are not within effective striking distance of the vital sources of Japanese military policy. ... Hence from the standpoint of air requirements, the Far Eastern operations may be divided into two phases: (1) Air operations in support of our land and sea forces to regain bases within striking distance of Japan. ... (2) Air operations against Japan proper to destroy her war making capacity." During 1942, defensive battles at the Coral Sea and Midway contained Japan’s efforts to extend her perimeter, and limited American offensives in the Solomon Islands and eastern New Guinea added security to Allied bases. The Allied leadership was presented with competing strategies to bring Japan within reach. In Washington early in 1943, the Joint Strategic Survey Committee favored a drive supported by carrier-based aircraft across the Central Pacific to the China coast, where air bases could be established to permit
