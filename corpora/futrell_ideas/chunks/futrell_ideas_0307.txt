n early in 1943, the Joint Strategic Survey Committee favored a drive supported by carrier-based aircraft across the Central Pacific to the China coast, where air bases could be established to permit an extended air campaign against Japan. Meanwhile, in the Southwest Pacific area, Gen Douglas MacArthur urged an advance along the New Guinea-Philippines axis to the China coast.

Between the Quadrant and the Sextant conference, which was held in Cairo in November-December 1943, the Joint Staff planners in Washington debated two controversial ideas at length and with some heat.  Easiest to resolve of the two controversies was the concept of operations set forth in a Joint War Plans Committee overall plan for the defeat of Japan. The initial draft of the plan included a statement to the effect that the campaigns in Europe had demonstrated clearly that air forces by themselves were incapable of decisive action; hence, an invasion and conquest of the Japanese home island would be necessary to conclude the war. When he returned from Europe to become chief of the Combined and Joint Staff Division of AAF Plans in November 1943, General Hansell tried to get this basic thought in the concept paper eliminated but managed only to get it modified materially. The plans division under Hansell was willing to admit that air power in Europe had not demonstrated thus far that it could of itself bring a powerful modern nation to defeat. However, the circumstances in the island nation of Japan were quite different from those in Europe, and no one had proved that such an achievement could not be attained in the Japanese case. Whether or not Japan could be brought to surrender by air attack, Japanese resistance would have to be drastically reduced through a sustained bombin
