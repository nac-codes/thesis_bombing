Staff on 15 February. After hearing all parties, the Joint Chiefs on 12 March 1944 ordered Admiral Nimitz’s Pacific forces to invade the Marianas beginning on 15 June 1944. Since a new XXI Bomber Command would be based in the Marianas, the Joint Chiefs limited the size of the XX Bomber Command to a single wing of four B-29 groups.1°7  Only after the European hostilities had ended, would British air forces be available for use in the Pacific. Moreover, in the Pacific, the B-29s would be based in several different theaters of operations. Arnold later recalled that a visit to the Pacific in autumn 1942 had made him realize that he would have to retain command of the very long range B-29s: "There was nothing else I could do," he remarked, "with no unity of command in the Pacific."""* If the B-29 forces had been assigned to the European theater of operations, they doubtless would have been under the general direction of the Combined Chiefs of Staff and would have been organized in a strategic air force similar to that used to control the heavy bomber strategic forces. The conduct of a strategic air war against Japan, however, posed different command problems.  In the first thinking about Matterhorn, the AAF staff favored establishing a strategic air force headquarters in Washington similar in concept to the old GHOQ Air Force, which would be directly responsible through Arnold to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. When the Joint Chiefs accepted this concept, the US Twentieth Air Force was activated on 4 April 1944. Arnold assumed personal command as the executive agent of the Joint Chiefs, Hansell was designated chief of staff, and members of the Air Staff did double duty as the staff of the Twentieth Air Force. Commands of the theaters in which the Twentieth Air Force’s XX and XXI Bomber  160  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 182 --- AF THINKING AND WWII  Commands were based were directed to coordinate B-29 operations with other air operations in their theaters, to
