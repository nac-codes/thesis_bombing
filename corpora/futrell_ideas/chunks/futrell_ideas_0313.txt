of the XXI Bomber Command, concluded that the piecemeal employment of the B-29s had proved a psychological boost for China’s sagging morale, but from a military standpoint he suggested that the B-29 effort flown from China and India might just as well have been saved until facilities were ready to permit the B-29s to be marshaled and employed as an effective striking force. "Had we done that," Montgomery thought, "we would have saved airplanes and crews .. . and I think the war would have been over at about the same time."  Strategic Air against Japan  Only three days after Admiral Nimitz’s forces invaded the Marianas on 15 June 1944, construction of a B-29 base, named Isley Field, began on Saipan. When General Hansell, who had taken command of the XXI Bomber Command, landed the first B-29 at Isley on 12 October, however, he found that only a single unpaved airstrip had been built. In the Marianas, the B-29 command found it difficult to obtain adequate logistical support from a theater command that was primarily intent on building a fleet base and other facilities to support continuing surface operations. “ Meanwhile, back in Washington, Twentieth Air Force target planners were making a new appreciation of the strategic vulnerability of Japan to air attacks that could be flown by the XXI Bomber Command. During the summer the target planners lost their enthusiasm for Japanese iron and steel targets in favor of attacks against Japan’s aircraft plants. At Arnold’s request, the Committee of Operations Analysts submitted a fresh estimate of Japan’s strategic vulnerability based on the separate assumptions that Japan might either be defeated by an air and sea blockade or by those means plus a surface invasion.  On the first premise, the committee recommended a general air campaign against shipping including extensive aerial mining operations, an attack against the aircraft industry, and saturation bombing of six urban industrial areas. In the event of a surface invasion,
