paign against shipping including extensive aerial mining operations, an attack against the aircraft industry, and saturation bombing of six urban industrial areas. In the event of a surface invasion, the committee recommended priority attacks against the aircraft industry, with an effort also against industrial targets and intensification of the antishipping campaign. In the European theater, AAF commanders had not favored the area bombing attacks that were flown against cities by the RAF Bomber Command. In its earliest analyses of Japan, however, the Committee of Operations Analysts had brought out the fact that Japan’s cities were highly flammable and that a substantial part of Japan’s war production was done in small factories dispersed throughout urban areas. On 24 April 1944 General Kuter had called the Twentieth Air Force’s attention to incendiary tests against simulated Japanese city targets that were being conducted at Eglin Field. The AAF Board soon completed two reports recommending the proper admixture of incendiaries and fragmentation bombs and the tactics and techniques of B-29 incendiary missions that might prove most effective against Japan’s cities.  Although it accepted the report of the Committee of Operations Analysts, the Joint Target Group of the Joint Chiefs of Staff discounted the possibility that the Japanese war might be ended by any means short of surface invasion; hence, the  162  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 184 --- AF THINKING AND WWII  group recommended that an emphatic priority be given to the destruction of Japan’s air power and that urban attacks and mining operations be delayed. Acting for the Joint Chiefs, the Twentieth Air Force accordingly directed the XXI Bomber Command to attack Japan’s major aircraft plants. Following delays caused by weather, the XXI Bomber Command sent its first bombing mission on a high-level attack against Tokyo’s Nakajima aircraft plant on 24 November 1944. Against the high-flying B-29s, J
