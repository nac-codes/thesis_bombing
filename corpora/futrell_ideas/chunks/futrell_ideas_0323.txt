ior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would even have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated."!6  Thoughts on Air Power and Air Force  "The air power of a nation," the Air Corps Tactical School had taught as early as 1935, "is its capacity to conduct air operations; specifically, the power which a nation is capable of exerting by means of its air forces. Air power is actual and not potential. Air power is measured by the immediate ability of a nation to engage effectively in air warfare.""“* In the view of the Air Corps Tactical School, air power was synonymous with the military air striking force in being, but to many observers the experience of World War II indicated that this definition was much too restrictive.!  When he published his widely read Victory through Air Power in 1942, Alexander de Seversky drew upon his experience as a tsarist military pilot and as an inventor, airplane designer, and aircraft producer in the United States and boldly predicted that aircraft would be developed with global ranges, thus ending the isolation of the Western Hemisphere. "Range deficiency," de Seversky wrote, "has been the curse on Hitler’s aviation." The United States would soon be open to air attack from every point of the compass. "It is sheer waste," he concluded, "to maintain advanced bases instead of hurling the full aerial potential directly against the adversary. The entire logic of aerial warfare makes it certain that ultimately war in the skies will be conducted from the home grounds, with everything in between turned into a no-man’s land." De Seversky’s concept of global air warfare paralleled the naval warfare ideas that he had obtained from studying Alfred Thayer Mahan. As he later admitted, de Seversky also followed Mahan in offering a wide conception of the nature of air power, which included a striking
