ideas that he had obtained from studying Alfred Thayer Mahan. As he later admitted, de Seversky also followed Mahan in offering a wide conception of the nature of air power, which included a striking air force, a defensive air force, and cooperation [air support] air forces as well as the industries, the personnel, and the materials; or, in short, everything that produced the power to navigate in the air.)  167  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 189 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  When General Arnold made his official report to the secretary of war on 12 November 1945, he accepted the same extrapolation of Mahan’s classic definition of naval power. "Air power," Arnold stated, "includes a nation’s ability to deliver cargo, people, destructive missiles and war-making potential through the air to a desired destination to accomplish a desired purpose. Air power is not composed alone of the war-making components of aviation. It is the total aviation activity—civilian and military, commercial and private, potential as well as existing." This definition was accepted by General Spaatz, when he became chief of staff of the US Air Force in 1947.15! Moreover, the Congressional Aviation Policy Board stated in 1948 that: "Air power is the total ability of a nation to capitalize on the medium of flight. . . . National air power is an entity not fundamentally divisible as a weapon, or as a carrier. Materials, organization, and craftsmanship which go to make a great aviation industry are as readily turned to the combat plane as to the transport."  Before World War II, Air Corps thinkers had visualized the air force as astriking arm quite separate and distinct from the auxiliary aviation that supported surface action, although the separate air striking arm could be used as necessary to support ground action. By 1945, however, General Arnold equated air force with military air power. Only a few years later Spaatz was emphasizing that Congress had assigned the nation’s "pri
