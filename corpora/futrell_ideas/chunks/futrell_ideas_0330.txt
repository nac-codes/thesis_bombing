peaking in August 1949 after he had become chief of staff of the Air Force, Gen Hoyt S. Vandenberg announced: "My opinion of the effectiveness of strategic bombing in both Europe and in the Pacific was that it contributed in large measure to the success in the conclusion of the war and saved a great many lives that otherwise would have been lost.">2 "We of the Air Force," Vandenberg stated in a speech in August 1952, "have never claimed that air power, in alliance with mass destruction weapons, could decide a war alone."  Lessons on Air Superiority  In the 1930s, the Air Corps had regarded establishing control of the air to be essential only in support of surface operations. Based upon his observations of the Battle of Britain and other early World War II operations, however, de Seversky boldly asserted,."We cannot and must not dream of conquering the enemy without first capturing dominance in the air—but once we have clear-cut dominance in the air, all else becomes a secondary subordinate, auxiliary operation." And he stated the further rule: "Only air power can defeat air power [emphasis in original].""4 In view of the experience of the Eighth Air Force over Germany, the Army Air Forces found it easy to abandon Douhet and to adopt a doctrine of "air superiority" or "control of the air," which—like the definition given to air power—was an extrapolation from Mahan. As the United States Strategic Bombing Survey’s summary report of the European war stated, "the significance of full domination of the air over the enemy—both over its armed forces and over its sustaining economy — must be emphasized. That domination of the air was essential. Without it, attacks on the basic economy of the enemy could not have been delivered in sufficient force and with sufficient freedom to bring effective and lasting results." Looking backward at World War II in October 1945, Arnold said: "The Air Force’s primary mission the world over was to knock out enemy air power — to win the air w
