However, he immediately added that the atomic bomb might have made a tactical air force "as old-fashioned as the Maginot line." The Air Force would continue to debate the effect of nuclear weapons on air power at the same time that it was recording the doctrinal lessons of World War II applicable to tactical air power.  The experience of World War II left no doubt as to the impact of air power on land battles. "The Normandy invasion," Gen Dwight D. Eisenhower explained on 16 November 1945,  was based on a deep-seated faith in the
