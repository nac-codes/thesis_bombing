e of World War II left no doubt as to the impact of air power on land battles. "The Normandy invasion," Gen Dwight D. Eisenhower explained on 16 November 1945,  was based on a deep-seated faith in the power of the air forces, in overwhelming numbers, to intervene in the land battle. That is, a faith that the air forces, by their action could have the effect on the ground of making it possible for a small force of land troops to invade a continent, a country strongly defended, in which there were 61 enemy divisions and where we could not possibly on the first day of the assault land more than 7 divisions. . .. Without that air force, without the aid of its power, entirely aside from its anticipated ability to sweep the enemy air forces out of the sky, without its power to intervene in the land battle, that invasion would have been fantastic. ... Unless we had that faith in the air power to intervene and to make safe that landing, it would have been more than fantastic, it would have been criminal.  One of the major ironies of World War II was that, when operating against a first-class adversary on a continental landmass, air units assigned or attached to ground forces proved incapable of providing effective support to the ground forces. As has been seen, such penny packets of air power were unable to accomplish missions of importance to the ground forcesâ€”which the Allied experience in North Africa demonstrated to be the attainment of air superiority, the interdiction of the movement of hostile troops and equipment to or within the battle area, and the close support of friendly ground troops by aerial attack of battlefield objectives which could not be handled by friendly artillery. Although War Department Field Manual 100-20, Command and Employment of Air Power, prescribed the tasks of a tactical air force as being air superiority, interdiction, and close support, it did not attempt to describe.the exact organization to be used in combat theaters.
