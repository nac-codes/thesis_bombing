paratory to the First Army’s breakthrough out of Normandy), the outstanding contribution of the heavy bombers to the overall ground campaign was the elimination of the Luftwaffe as an effective fighting force. Although the Ninth Air Force stood ready to maintain friendly air superiority, it was committed routinely to interdiction and close support operations, with roughly 15 percent of the tactical air effort going to close air support. But in static periods such as existed prior to the Saint Lé breakthrough and while the armies were building up before the Siegfried Line, the proportion of air effort allotted to targets along the front lines did not exceed 10 percent of the tactical air forces capability. The remaining tactical air effort was committed to armed reconnaissance and to attack against interdiction targets behind the enemy lines.” ““ A flexible employment of tactical air groups on varied missions ensured  174  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 196 --- AF THINKING AND WWII  that no one unit suffered debilitating losses. Fighter-bombers, for example, suffered their highest rate of loss to flak on the dive-bombing missions commonly required for bridge attacks and close air support; armed reconnaissance, area support, and fighter-sweep missions were only about two-thirds as dangerous as dive-bombing missions.‘ What could happen when a group was solely committed to the most hazardous mission was illustrated during the Ardennes offensive. Because it was based closest to the area, the 406th Fighter-Bomber Group provided the burden of the close air support to the 101st Airborne Division, which was besieged at Bastogne; from 23-28 December the group flew 529 close support sorties into this area. Of its 60 operational P-47s at the beginning oft the period, the group lost 17 shot down and had more than 40 damaged by flak.” 4 Although the evidence was not conclusive, such experience indicated that an air unit committed solely to close air support in the E
