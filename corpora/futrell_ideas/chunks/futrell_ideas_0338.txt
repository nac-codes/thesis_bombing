the group lost 17 shot down and had more than 40 damaged by flak.” 4 Although the evidence was not conclusive, such experience indicated that an air unit committed solely to close air support in the European theater would have encountered disproportionately high casualty rates that would have adversely effected its continuation in operations.  In the Pacific theaters of World War II, American forces accepted the same tasks of tactical air power as were recognized in Europe, but organizational patterns were different. In General MacArthur’s Southwest Pacific theater, the entire Fifth Air Force cooperated intimately with the Sixth Army and, after June 1944, the Thirteenth Air Force usually worked with the Eighth Army. While General Kenney began to organize tactical air commands for the planned invasion of Japan, he elected to use standard bombardment and fighter wings to provide cooperation with individual ground task forces during the war.!”> In the early days in the Pacific Ocean areas, Marine Corps and Thirteenth Air Force aircraft were organized in the same naval task group to support ground fighting on Guadalcanal. Marine F7F Tigercats usually flew air patrols overhead while Air Force P-39 squadrons, which lacked the ability to intercept high-flying enemy aircraft, performed close support missions. In the island invasions of the Central Pacific, Navy and Marine carrier-based air units provided air superiority, interdiction, and air support as necessary. Some years later, after he had become commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen David M. Shoup would recall that "the finest close air support for ground troops that I experienced in World War II came from Navy squadrons at Saipan." In working from fast aircraft carriers, Marine airmen not only were virtually losing their service identity, but also a serious defect in fast-carrier support for ground operations came to light on 17 June 1944 when the Fifth Fleet suddenly had to withdraw from Saipan to fight the naval batt
