Lightly gunned Marine Corps infantry was left ashore without close air support. Rather than allow this to happen again, Lt Gen Holland M. Smith, the Marine Corps officer in command of Expeditionary Troops, recommended and the Navy accepted, the proposition that Marine Corps air groups would be designated as air support specialists and would be assigned to escort carriers, which would not be withdrawn from an invasion objective for a fleet engagement. According to the organization worked out and employed by the marines at Peleliu and Okinawa, a Marine Corps air wing became an integral part of a Marine Corps  175  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 197 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  division. Since Marine ground commanders could normally expect only flat trajectory fire of naval guns during critical phases of ship-to-shore amphibious operations and since they would usually go ashore with limited amounts of organic artillery, Marine air wings would be organized, trained, and employed as a substitute for Marine artillery.!”6  In the winter of 1945-46, the War Department began to refine the air-ground lessons of World War II for the purpose of determining future organization. Army officers generally preferred the system which had been employed in the European theater of operations to that which had been devised by the Marine Corps in the Pacific. General Eisenhower, who became Army chief of staff on 19 November 1945, subsequently explained the reasons why he believed that the Army should not attempt to develop its own organic air support.  The Army concept of the land, sea and air principle of organization of the armed forces is well-known; this Service accepts without reservation the concept of complementary roles—air, ground and sea—and
