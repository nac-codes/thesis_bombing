Army concept of the land, sea and air principle of organization of the armed forces is well-known; this Service accepts without reservation the concept of complementary roles—air, ground and sea—and consequent mutual dependence of the three components of the armed services. Under this three service concept it is axiomatic that no single service should acquire forces or equipment necessary to accomplish joint missions single-handed, if such forces or equipment unnecessarily duplicate those characteristics of and fundamental to either of the other two services. The experiences of this war have indicated that in many operations, if not in the majority, the task was of necessity accomplished by contributions from two or three services acting under the principle of unified command. Furthermore, the welding of the forces resulted in the greatest possible concentration of combat power at the decisive point while at the same time permitting the greatest economy of force on lesser tasks.  Employment of tactical air in World War II is an outstanding illustration of the application of this concept to a specific problem. Battle experience proved that control of the air, the prerequisite to the conduct of ground operations in any given area, was gained most economically by the employment of air forces operating under a single command. This assured a maximum of flexibility, providing a command structure under which all forms of available air power could be concentrated on tactical support missions or on strategic missions, as the situation demanded —in other words, it permitted the maximum concentration of combat air power at the decisive point at the decisive time. Throughout the war, the Army depended on the necessary tactical air support from a practically autonomous Air Force. This type of close, accurate, and effective support of the frontline fighting units was provided and proved an essential element in the achievement of the Army objectives.
