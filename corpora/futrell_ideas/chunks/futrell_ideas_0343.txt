Forces commanders visualized a much more decisive role for tactical air power. According to Gen Omar Bradley, Maj Gen Elwood R. "Pete" Quesada, commander of the IX Tactical Air Command (which was paired with the US First Army in Europe), "had come into the war as a young and imaginative man... .To Quesada the fighter was a little-known weapon with vast unexplored possibilities in the support of ground troops."!8! Late in 1944, Quesada made a suggestion that got back to Washington in a roundabout manner, that a concentration of available Allied fighter strength in Europe in low-level attacks against Germany could win the war during the winter of 1944-45. After World War II, Quesada was promoted to lieutenant general and given command of the Tactical Air Command. He was willing to accept the relationships of the air-surface force team as it existed at the cessation of hostilities only as a point of departure for future doctrine. Writing in  177  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 199 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  1948 he thought it axiomatic that the first prerequisite for a successful major campaign would be air supremacy or control of the air. He suggested, however, that World War II had only superficially indicated the "inherent ability of Tactical Air Power to be a decisive force in a strangulation campaign." In World War II, air doctrine had envisaged the isolation of a hostile force from its means of support, but it had not looked toward preventing an enemy force from engaging in battle. Quesada thought that by a vigorous interdiction campaign tactical air power could "paralyze the enemyâ€™s means of communication" and "sources of industrial support" and "prevent opposing armies from coming into contact." If such a concept of the employment of tactical air power was effectively pursued in a future conflict, direct support of ground troops in a zone of contact might well constitute only a small portion of the total tactical air effort. Only if tactical
