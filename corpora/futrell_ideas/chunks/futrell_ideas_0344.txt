power was effectively pursued in a future conflict, direct support of ground troops in a zone of contact might well constitute only a small portion of the total tactical air effort. Only if tactical air power did not perform its primary functions in a convincing manner would friendly ground troops evidence a requirement for close air support.  Importance of Airlift  A final aspect of doctrine emerging in the postwar period related to airlift. As Maj Gen Robert M. Webster, who had headed both tactical and transport commands in Europe in World War II, remarked in 1947, "I would say that we went into the last war with only two basic types of military aircraft, the bomber and the fighter. I feel that we have come out of that war with an additional type, the transport plane, and that we should think in terms of bomber-fighter-transport — since they are all equally important — and they must be properly balanced to each other if we are to be prepared to conduct successful war operations."183 Back in the 1930s the Air Corps, prodded relentlessly by Maj Hugh J. Knerr who insisted that air striking forces could not depend upon ground lines of communications for logistical support, had established a requirement that both the GHQ Air Force and the Air Corps Materiel Division ought to possess transport aircraft. Both because of shortages of procurement funds and because of the Baker board’s recommendation that civilian airliners could be requisitioned for a war emergency, the Army Air Forces had acquired only six air transport groups with 124 aircraft by hand in December 1941. Lacking any firm basis of experience with the air transport, the officers who drew up AWPD-1 estimated that the ascendant air force would require only 19 troop carrier groups with 1,520 planes for airborne troop employment and only 13 transport groups with 1,040 planes for air logistical support. Early in 1942 the Army Air Forces established the Air Transport Command and the I Troop Carrier Command, the f
