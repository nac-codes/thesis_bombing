The control and employment of troop carrier organizations was hardly the same in any two theaters. In each theater, however, logistical services found continuing demands for the employment of troop carrier planes for intratheater movement of essential personnel and freight, but the combat employment of troop carrier planes and gliders for airborne operations always was given a higher priority. Resolution of the competing demands of the logisticians and the airborne commanders was never accomplished completely.  Since there were never enough transport planes to permit them to be parceled out among using organizations, the Anglo-American organization of theater airlift forces accordingly placed central control of most such units under some form of theater troop carrier headquarters, which could employ the transport planes interchangeably for airlift or air assault operations. The organization in the European theater included the est
