On 24 October 1946 Spaatz informed his subordinate commanders that the Army Air Forces "supports without reservation" the War Department position on unification, which comprehended a single secretary heading a single department of national defense with three branches of equal standing — army, navy, and air.  In the three years that defense unification was being studied and debated, the Navy posed different objections to plans that were offered and submitted counterproposals to each plan. As a matter of continuing policy, the Navy objected to the high degree of consolidation inherent in the War Department plan for a single chief of staff for the armed forces. The Navy also desired guarantees that would preserve naval aviation and the Marine Corps, together with its integral aviation.

Admiral Sherman said that establishing the independent Twentieth Air Force and deciding to divide the command of American Army and Navy forces between Douglas MacArthur and Nimitz "disrupted unified command in the Pacific and disillusioned naval officers who had given support to theories of a single department." Sherman also recalled that Gen George C. Marshall had told him in September 1944 that he would not tolerate further command of Army troops by Marine officers.
