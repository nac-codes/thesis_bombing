onomies which will be realized only wash it is possible to draw on one air force for the requirements of all other services.”  It is difficult to determine from available records exactly what opinions Air Force leaders held on the matter of integrating all military aviation into the United States Air Force. Even though his opinion was not official, Alexander P. de Seversky had suggested in Victory through Air Power that naval aircraft carriers would become unnecessary in view of the fact that "ultimately war in the skies will be conducted from the home grounds, with everything in between turned into a no-man’s land." He also had argued that for purely aerodynamic and engineering reasons, naval carrier-based aircraft, which had to be designed to operate from the restricted areas of carrier flight decks, would always be inferior in performance to land-based aircraft of similar types.“" On the basis of wartime lessons that carrier aircraft should be jet powered and able to carry heavier bombs, the Navy had initiated design of a 65,000-ton aircraft carrier in 1945; construction of the supercarrier, to be known as the CVA-58 or the USS United States, was begun prior to unification. The Navy conceived that the prototype flush-deck CVA-58 would be employed in task group, along with a Midway-class (CVB) carrier, two Essex-class (CV) carriers, and supporting and screening ships. Launching while the task group was still some 500 to 600 miles at sea, the CVA-58’s long-range aircraft would neutralize hostile air bases ashore, permitting the task group to run within 200 miles of an enemy coast and launch its strike aircraft to accomplish naval missions.  Shortly after he took office as secretary of defense, Forrestal remarked that the Navy believed that the Air Force wanted to get control of all military aviation, while the Air Force believed that the Navy was trying to encroach upon the strategic air prerogatives of the Air Force.”?
