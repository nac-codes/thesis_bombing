In coordination with the other services, the Air Force was charged to develop doctrines and procedures for the defense of the United States from air attack, joint amphibious and airborne operations, and air defense from land areas. Specific collateral functions of the Air Force included a responsibility to interdict enemy sea power through air operations, to conduct antisubmarine warfare and protect shipping, and to conduct aerial minelaying operations. Among its primary functions, the Navy was to conduct air operations as necessary in a naval campaign; to establish local air superiority in an area of naval operations; and to perform naval reconnaissance, conduct antisubmarine warfare, protect shipping, and
