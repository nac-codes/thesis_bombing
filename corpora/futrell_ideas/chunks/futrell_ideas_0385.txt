nified and Specified Commands  Although roles and missions were in dispute, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff successfully provided command and control arrangements for unified and specified commands. When the unified theater commands were officially formed in December 1946, the Joint Chiefs of Staff continued to exercise command over them but designated an individual chief of staff as the executive agent for a particular unified command. When the Strategic Air Command was established, the general understanding was that the new command would be centrally controlled and directed by orders of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; but Air Force mission statements provided that the Strategic Air Command would operate in accordance with directives and policies received from the commanding general, Army Air Forces, and later the chief of staff of the Air Force. The Strategic Air Command could not be handled as a unified command (which included Army, Navy, and Air Force forces) since it was composed only of Air Force forces. To solve this problem, the Key West agreements authorized the Joint Chiefs of Staff to designate one of their members as executive agent for unified commands and for certain operations, and specified commands. A specified command thus came to be a single-service command under the Joint Chiefs. Though the Joint Chiefs ultimately stated that the Strategic Air Command had been responsible to them since 14 December 1946, they did not officially assign the mission of conducting strategic air warfare operations to the Strategic Air Command until 13 April 1949. At this time they provided that the Strategic Air Command — functioning under the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the Air Force chief of staff serving as their executive agent — was authorized to direct the strategic air offensive; assign targets, weight of effort, and timing of air operations; and coordinate strategic strikes with theater air activities to prevent interference between forces and
