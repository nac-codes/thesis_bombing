Although the expressed idea that military forces should support national policy was relatively new in the United States, Marshall readily approved Handy’s basic statement. In his final war report, Marshall additionally defined his own conception of the relationship of force to diplomacy. "Our diplomacy must be wise and it must be strong," he warned.

Marshall wanted to develop a system and an organization that would endure for years rather than be organized against the expectation that war might begin at some arbitrary date. "We were trying to avoid war," he explained, "but at the same time we carefully had to avoid a financial effect on our economy which would be as disastrous as a war might well be."
