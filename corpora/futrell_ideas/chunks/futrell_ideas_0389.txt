f the Air Force directly under the Commander US Air Forces and not as a part of any task force organization that may be set up in the various strategic theaters."  Although creating the Twentieth Air Force on 4 April 1944 established the precedent for the unified command and employment of strategic air striking forces, the postwar status of tactical air forces continued to be a problem. In December 1944 Brig Gen Frederic H. Smith, Jr., deputy chief of the Air Staff, stated that a proposal to establish a postwar tactical air force to handle air-ground training was "fallacious in principle and dangerous in implication." Smith argued that only two overseas theaters had established tactical air forces and he urged: "Strategic Air Forces must when the situation demands be employed in tactical operations and vice versa."*° As has been seen, General Norstad was initially sympathetic to the tactical air force, but nuclear weapons caused him to change his mind. Since tactical air units obviously could not be employed until the strategic air offensive had been completed, Norstad favored the maintenance of a nucleus for a tactical air force that could be expanded after M-day.*”  In view of the impending Allied victory in World War II, the air defense of the United States apparently was not considered to be of pressing importance. In a study prepared on 30 May 1945, however, Maj Gen H. R. Oldfield, the AAF special assistant for antiaircraft, pointed out that fighter-interceptors, signal aircraft warning services, and antiaircraft artillery units were complementary members of  202  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 224 --- AF IN NATIONAL DEFENSE  an air defense team. "To divorce the antiaircraft artillery from this team and place it on a cooperative basis," Oldfield thought, "not only violates the principle of unity of effort and of economy of force but endangers the success of the air defense mission."® Maj Gen Donald Wilson, who had become chief of OC&R, proposed on 6 June
