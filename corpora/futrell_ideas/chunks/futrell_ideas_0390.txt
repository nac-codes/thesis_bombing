only violates the principle of unity of effort and of economy of force but endangers the success of the air defense mission."® Maj Gen Donald Wilson, who had become chief of OC&R, proposed on 6 June 1945 that air defense commands ought to be organized in the United States and charged to give their full attention to defense work. Wilson was critical of the wartime arrangement wherein three continental air forces had been charged with air defense at the same time that they were principally concerned with training of air force units."” After studying air defense requirements, Arnold forwarded a study to the War Department Operations Division on 4 August 1945, which outlined the unitary problem of air defense and recommended that antiaircraft artillery should be transferred from the Army to the postwar air force.  Few of the postwar organizational problems were as perplexing as the future of air transport and troop carrier aviation. The Air Transport Command wished to continue into the postwar period at a strength of approximately six squadrons, each with 10 four-engine transports. Brig Gen William D. Old and Lt Gen Lewis H. Brereton advocated establishing a postwar airborne army, which would combine airborne troops and troop carrier aircraft.” According to rumor, the War Department General Staff bounced the airborne army proposal from office to office, with no one liking it but everyone hesitating to disapprove it. In the end the War Department G-3 indicated that it preferred that the headquarters of a troop carrier command and of the airborne force be maintained separately but located in close proximity to permit intimate coordination without consolidation.“ In assessing the potential impact of nuclear weapons on air force organization, however, Norstad offered the opinion that troop carrier aviation ought to be integrated into the Air Transport Command and that the air force ought to procure large transport planes that could provide mobility to a strategic bombing f
