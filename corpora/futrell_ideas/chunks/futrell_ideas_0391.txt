on that troop carrier aviation ought to be integrated into the Air Transport Command and that the air force ought to procure large transport planes that could provide mobility to a strategic bombing force or lift large numbers of ground troops.  Postwar Air Organization Plans  When the Air Staff began to make plans for the postwar air force, it based its organizational conception on the War Department’s plan to maintain a postwar Army of 1,700,000 men. On this basis, Arnold approved an initial air force objective on 25 February 1944 calling for 105 groups, divided into 40 very heavy bombardment, two heavy bombardment, four medium and light bombardment, 45 fighter, three reconnaissance, and 11 troop carrier groups. The size of this force was devised without consideration of cost, but the force would be capable of "striking quickly and forcibly" on M-day and Maj Gen Laurence S. Kuter defended it as being necessary to keep the peace in a troubled world. When the 1,700,000-man Army was brought to General Marshall’s attention on 13 November 1944, however, he rejected it out of hand because the annual cost of supporting such an Army would be excessive.  203  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 225 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  To justify a more economical postwar plan, the War Department adopted more optimistic assumptions that an enemy would launch an all-out attack against the United States without a declaration of war and that the United States would have no allies for at least 18 months. But the War Department further assumed that "the United States will have cognizance of the possibility of war for at least one year, and during this year preparatory measures will be inaugurated." Marshall approved these assumptions on 13 March 1945.>> A few months later, the War Department G-4 questioned the realism of the assumption that the United States would have 12 months’ warning time; but the air force wished to continue using this assumption as the basis of its plan
