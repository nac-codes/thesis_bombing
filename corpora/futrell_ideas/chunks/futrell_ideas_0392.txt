r Department G-4 questioned the realism of the assumption that the United States would have 12 months’ warning time; but the air force wished to continue using this assumption as the basis of its planning because it would pose a strong requirement for the development of alert national intelligence.” © Givena year in which to mobilize, the Army Air Forces adopted a plan on 21 May 1945 calling for the retention of 78 groups in the interim air force. Since aircraft could not be stockpiled for a future mobilization emergency, Arnold also asked Congress to retain a substantial portion of the government-owned aircraft plants and machine tools on a standby status.  When the 78-group strength was rejected by the War Department as financially impracticable, Lt Gen Ira C. Eaker, deputy commander of the Army Air Forces, reached a decision on 29 August 1945 that 70 groups with approximately 400,000 personnel would be the bedrock minimum strength required by the postwar air force. This absolutely minimum strength would provide a force that could be operationally ready on D-day and still provide training for a million and a half men that the air force would mobilize for a planned five-year war; it was the smallest size force that would keep aircraft production in a sufficiently ready state to meet mobilization requirements; and it was the size force that could man the essential air bases that would be required in a combat and mobilization emergency. The Army Air Forces projected that the 70-group strength would include 21 very heavy bomber, five light bomber, 22 fighter, three all-weather fighter, nine strategic and tactical reconnaissance, and 10 troop carrier groups, plus 22 separate specialized squadrons. This regular strength would be backed up by 27 Air National Guard and 34 Air Force Reserve groups.”  The reduction of the Army Air Forces postwar strength from 105 to 70 groups caused revisions in organizational planning.
