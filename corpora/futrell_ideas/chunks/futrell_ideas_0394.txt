en more concerned with production than with research and development.”” Research and development responsibilities had been divided among the air communications officer on the Air Staff, the Air Materiel Command, the AAF Board, and the Air Proving Ground Command; the system had worked only because of the cooperation of the various commanders involved.“ Convinced that American military research and development had often been inferior to that of its enemies, General Arnold asked Dr Theodore von Karman on7 November 1944 to head and to organize an AAF scientific advisory group that would outline a research and development program to guide the air force for 10 to 20 years. Arnold informed von Karman that the "object of total war is to destroy the enemy’s will to resist thereby, enabling us to force our will on him," and he asked that the scientific advisory group indicate the potential scientific lines of advance that the air force might take to accomplish a predominantly offensive mission.© After a year’s study, the von Karman group would complete on 15 December 1945 a monumental report entitled Toward New Horizons.  While the scientific study was progressing, Arnold continued to point out that the air force "must have enough money and enough people and enough facilities to carry on necessary experimental research and development work to keep the US Army Air Forces and US aviation in the No. 1 position which they now occupy." 7 In a talk to his staff on 12 J anuary 1945, Arnold "drew a picture of the next war as starting without warning with thousands of pilotless ‘things’ suddenly raining destruction over Washington and other prime targets in the United States." As a defense in this scenario, he visualized "other ‘things,’ not only seeking out the enemy’s weapons, but also counteroffensive weapons which would seek out and destroy the enemy’s ability to manufacture the articles for waging war." Appearing before a Senate committee on 18 October 1945, Arnold said:  . The f
