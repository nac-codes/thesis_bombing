Air Force and to concern itself with policy matters affecting the research and development program. The Air Materiel Command would continue as the field agency responsible for research and development programs.  At the same time that he was centralizing responsibility for future research and development in the Air Staff, Arnold wanted to initiate new research projects before plentiful wartime funds dried up. In September 1945 Arnold took Bowles with him on a trip to the west coast where, late in the month, they met Donald Douglas and F. R. Collbohm in a luncheon conference at Hamilton Field, California. At this meeting, Arnold proposed to divert $10 million from the Air Force’s fiscal year 1946 procurement budget and to commit it to a long-range project wherein the Douglas Aircraft Corporation would assemble a staff of civilian engineers and scientists to study the entire subject of intercontinental warfare and the best means of waging it. The staff would also be prepared to evaluate the military worth of competing systems of warfare, current and future, with the objective of providing air planners with the best possible guides as to the most economical and effective means of achieving the AAF mission. When Douglas agreed to undertake the project, the Air Materiel Command negotiated a $10-million, three-year contract beginning in May 1946 for a study of future warfare. This contract was the genesis of the nonprofit Research and Development (Rand) Corporation, which would be located at Santa Monica, California, and which would split away from Douglas in a mutually agreeable action in 1948.  In the summer of 1944 the Air Staff had discussed and dismissed a proposition that an air council ought to be created to sit in Washington and provide high-level policy guidance. This proposal was apparently voted down because of the belief that the Air Staff could act as an air council when such was necessary.>’ In spite of the transfer of the AAF School to Maxwell Field, where
