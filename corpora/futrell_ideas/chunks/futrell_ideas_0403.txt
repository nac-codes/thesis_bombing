Norstad pointed out that at the Air University "hundreds of instructors, spurred on by the sharp analysis and questions of thousands of highly-experienced students," would constantly evaluate combat doctrines. "They," said Norstad, "can probably do a better job, resolve a greater amount of sound air thinking into usable doctrine than any other group of men anywhere. And they will do it whether or not they are charged with it.’  The disposition of the AAF Board and the distribution of its missions closely followed Norstad’s recommendations.

The redistribution of the missions and responsibilities of the AAF Board marked the completion of the postwar organization of the Army Air Forces. At Maxwell Field, Maj Gen Muir S. Fairchild immediately began to seek the resources that would permit the new Air University to accomplish its test and development mission. Tentative guidance led him to believe that the Air University would b
