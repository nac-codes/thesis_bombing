Tentative guidance led him to believe that the Air University would be assigned a fighter, a bomber, and a guided missile group, together with other units, which would serve as a test and development force. Hearing of the Air University’s expectation, Maj Gen Elwood R. Quesada, commander of the Tactical Air Command, immediately protested that the organization of a test and development force would be an extravagant use of scarce tactical units, and he demanded that tactical experimentation and development be entrusted to the operational commands. On 13 May 1946 Spaatz agreed with Quesada and informed Fairchild that tactical groups would not be assigned to the Air University.

At a meeting on 6 June, Eubank urged Fairchild to organize a small section or committee directly responsible to the Air University commander to accomplish the missions being transferred. "By keeping a separate group working together on these functions," Eubank explained, "I believe it will assure that the functions do not get lost and I believe it will help avoid the impression of a too academic interest in the problems that will come up."”? To allay the suspicions of the combat commands, Maj Gen David M. Schlatter, deputy commander of the Air University, announced that in accomplishing its research,
