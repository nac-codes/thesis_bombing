Schlatter, deputy commander of the Air University, announced that in accomplishing its research, evaluation, and doctrinal functions, the Air University would "act in the capacity of a monitoring agency or steering committee utilizing the expert knowledge available in all of the commands of the Air Force.""* On 18 June 1946, following Eubank’s recommendation, Fairchild established a Research Section within the Air University’s Academic Staff Division with spaces for 16 officers, most of whom were transferred from Eglin Field to complete projects on which they were assigned when the AAF Board was discontinued. A reorganization of the Academic Staff on 1 October 1946 resulted in the establishment of a Research Division with several sections and 18 officers. Since the division was evaluating rather than conducting research, the Research Division was redesignated as the Evaluation Division, Academic Staff, on 29 August 1947.5 Cognizant that it was responsible for stimulating thinking and discussion on air power projects and for disseminating as well as formulating doctrine, the Air University began to publish the Air University Quarterly Review in May 1947,  In spite of a rapid turnover of experienced officers in its research and evaluation function, the Air University worked off the backlog of projects that it had inherited from the AAF Board and undertook some new projects. Since it had no assigned combat units, the Air University relied on other commands to conduct tests. Especially where the Tactical Air Command was concerned, the split responsibility proved troublesome. In September 1946, for example, the Air University protested that the Tactical Air Command was providing very poor support for several test projects — notably the tactical tests of P-80 aircraft at March Field, California.
