fact that the Soviet Union would become an enemy to the free world apparently became known to different leaders at different moments. Thinking back to the time that General Bradley and he had gone forward to meet with Soviet Marshal Georgi K. Zhukov in May 1945, General Vandenberg recalled a feeling of foreboding about Russia. The Soviet army was digging in, and Zhukov proudly displayed new jet aircraft and Stormovik fighters that had technical features that American designers had said were impossible for the Soviets to achieve.
