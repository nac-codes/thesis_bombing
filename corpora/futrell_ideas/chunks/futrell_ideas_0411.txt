Based on this assumption, General Eisenhower directed that Army and Air Force strength levels for the fiscal year beginning in July 1946 should be kept to the minimum.

During 1946 General Spaatz strongly supported a 70-group strength for the Army Air Forces, but his greatest immediate problem was to salvage something from the explosive demobilization that would reduce the air arm to a strength in December 1946 of only 55 groups, of which two could be counted as combat ready.
