mission as being: "(a) To provide a long-range striking force in instant readiness and with the power and capacity to destroy the storehouse of enemy weapons and thereafter to reduce the enemy’s industrial capacity and war-making potential [and] (b) To provide in peacetime a minimum establishment for prompt and rapid expansion from peace to war." In the critical months of 1946, Spaatz gave first priority to "the backbone of our Air Force—the long-range bomber groups and their protective long-range fighter groups organized in our Strategic Air Force."!!1  When the Strategic Air Command was established, air strategists were said to have recognized that the adaptability of nuclear weapons to delivery by air at great distances "makes the airplane at present, and its descendants in the future, the greatest offensive weapon of all times."!!? The plans for the Strategic Air Command, however, were predicated on scientific reports that fissionable materials were very scarce and that a state of nuclear plenty was improbable. Arnold had stated that nuclear weapons would be scarce and very expensive. As aresult of this prediction, the Strategic Air Command planned to employ both high-explosive and nuclear weapons. To perform its mission, the command asked that it eventually be assigned 21 bombardment groups (very heavy), nine fighter groups (very long range), and three reconnaissance groups (very long range). When he was assigned to head the Strategic Air Command in 1946, Gen George C. Kenney immediately organized one wing with three B-29 groups as the atomic-capable strategic striking force.“"" The size of this force was described as sufficient "to fully exploit the expected availability and effectiveness of new bombardment weapons including the atomic bomb." or  Before World War II, air power had been unable to project across ocean barriers without the aid of surface craft, but the prospective development of 10,000-mile-range aircraft —including the Northrop XB-35 Flying Wing
