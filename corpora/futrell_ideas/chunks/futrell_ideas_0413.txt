II, air power had been unable to project across ocean barriers without the aid of surface craft, but the prospective development of 10,000-mile-range aircraft —including the Northrop XB-35 Flying Wing and the Consolidated XB-36— promised to open a new air frontier over the frozen wastes of the Arctic. "We must visualize," said Spaatz, "the launching of heavy blows from any point on the globe against any other point."116 In November 1945 a 6,553-mile flight of four B-29s led by Brig Gen Frank A. Armstrong from Hokkaido to Washington over the top of the world demonstrated that the Arctic was no barrier to air travel.!!” The Strategic Air Command’s plan for training and employment issued on 25 July 1946 acknowledged the concept of transpolar air operations and divided the world into three sectors of potential operations: North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Far East. In a future war the Strategic Air Command thought it certain that "there will be but one Theater of Operations covering the entire globe or at  215  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 237 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  least the Northern Hemisphere." Moreover, the next war almost certainly would "be primarily an air war until air supremacy is obtained, since surface forces cannot successfully operate without that supremacy." The Strategic Air Command’s concept of operational employment accordingly called for a centralized control of the global strategic bomber force and a periodic rotation of bomber, long-range fighter, and reconnaissance groups from home bases in the United States to forward bases in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Far East. In a war emergency the plan assumed that a relatively few atomic-capable B-29s would be employed, probably on the direction of the president, either as a part of larger B-29 formations or as individual aircraft that would strike at night or under cover of bad weather.  "Destruction is just around the corner for any future aggressor against the United St
