Problems of Aircraft Procurement  Besides the explosive demobilization of its strength, the Army Air Forces found it impossible to procure new aircraft that were needed for modernization and to keep the aircraft producers of the United States in a solvent condition. Believing that national security required the maintenance of a healthy aircraft industry that could rapidly expand within a one-year period, Assistant Secretary of War Robert A. Lovett had sponsored the establishment of an Air Coordinating Committee with members from the War, Navy, and Commerce departments in December 1944.  216  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 238 --- AF IN NATIONAL DEFENSE  After detailed study of mobilization requirements, the Air Coordinating Committee recommended on 22 October 1945 that the military services procure a minimum of 3,000 aircraft, or an airframe weight of 30,700,000 pounds, each year to keep the nation’s aircraft industries in a condition that would permit rapid expansion. This recommendation was predicated on an assumption that there would be a civilian requirement of 325 commercial transports and 20,000 private airplanes each year.)  As it finally materialized, the Air Force 70-group and 22-squadron program called for a total of 6,869 aircraft, while the 27 Air National Guard and 34 Air Reserve groups would be authorized an additional 5,572 aircraft, making a grand total of 12,441 aircraft. To replace losses in a period of conflict in which the aviation industry was gearing up for war production, the Air Force wanted to maintain an additional reserve of 8,100 aircraft.!”> Based on estimates of attrition and a planned program of obsolescence that would transfer aircraft from primary to secondary missions, such as training, after a given number of years, the Air Force computed that the annual procurement requirements of the 70-group and 22-squadron program would be its proportionate share of the 3,000 planes which the Air Co
