r a given number of years, the Air Force computed that the annual procurement requirements of the 70-group and 22-squadron program would be its proportionate share of the 3,000 planes which the Air Coordinating Committee indicated as being the figure that the military services needed to purchase annually. The Air Force would expect to maintain technical air supremacy. “" "Quality of equipment is of major consequence," Spaatz explained. "Only technical air supremacy will permit an air defense capable of detecting and intercepting a possible surprise attack with the air weapons of the future; an air offense capable of destroying critical targets in enemy territory; and effective cooperation with the surface forces on land and sea."  Despite their appreciation of the need for aircraft modernization, both Arnold and Spaatz found it difficult to justify aircraft purchases while the Army Air Forces was retrenching. During the last years of World War II, the Army Air Forces had placed heavy orders for modern aircraft. In fiscal year 1944 it had ordered 100 global-range B-36 bombers and 498 new P-80 jet fighters; in fiscal year 1945 it had ordered an additional 417 P-80 fighters and 100 P-84 jet fighters. With new planes on order from war appropriations, it was difficult to justify the purchase of more aircraft at the same time that tremendous holdings of war-surplus planes needed liquidation. Rather than incur criticism for purchasing new and improved transport aircraft at the same time that it was releasing planes to the civil airlines, for example, Arnold directed on 27 August 1945 that the AAF would reduce its procurement objectives for transports "to the absolute minimum for development purposes." In fiscal year 1946, which began on 1 July 1945 and was the first postwar year, the Army Air Forces purchasing authorization was cut back to 622 aircraft—the principal models including 60 of the improved Superfortresses (designated B-50s), 250 twin-fuselage Mustang fighters (
