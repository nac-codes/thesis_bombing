ar, the Army Air Forces purchasing authorization was cut back to 622 aircraft—the principal models including 60 of the improved Superfortresses (designated B-50s), 250 twin-fuselage Mustang fighters (which had been adapted as an interim all-weather interceptor and designated as P-82s), and 141 P-84 jet fighters.!2”  217  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 239 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  As it was drawn up in the spring of 1946, the postwar aircraft procurement plan of the Army Air Forces reflected the fact that large stocks of World War II planes were still combat capable, that atomic bombs were scarce, and that new jet aircraft were very expensive. Brig Gen Alfred R. Maxwell, chief of the Requirements Division (ACAS-3), visualized the following future aircraft requirements. Aircraft like the B-36 with its global range would be important as special weapons for employment against extremely distant targets — possible A-bomb targets, but such planes would not be procured in large numbers. Aircraft of the B-50 type would be the workhorse bombers for the medium range and would be procured in large numbers. Penetration fighters would continue to be the most important fighter type, but all-weather and interceptor fighters would increase in importance as enemy nations threatened US air supremacy. To give fighter support for long-range bombers, the Air Force proposed to develop a parasite fighter that would be transported by a bomber to a target area and then rejoined to the bomber for the trip home. Strategic and tactical reconnaissance planes would continue to be modifications of standard bomber and fighter models. Troop carrier aircraft would include large helicopters, which would replace gliders, and large transport models capable of moving completely equipped infantry and armored divisions to any combat zone in the world. As a matter of priority, the Army Air Forces wanted to develop jet bombers, but, with current technology, jet aircraft used large amounts
