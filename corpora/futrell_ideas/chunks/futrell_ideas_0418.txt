As a matter of priority, the Army Air Forces wanted to develop jet bombers, but, with current technology, jet aircraft used large amounts of fuel and did not have the range demanded of bombers. !8  In its budget requests for fiscal year 1947 the Air Force sought to follow the program summarized by General Maxwell and begin procuring the aircraft required for a modernized 70-group program. In its review of the military requests, the Bureau of the Budget severely reduced all items of the budget, including funds requested for aircraft procurement. The Bureau of the Budget struck out requests for authority to procure new transport aircraft on the ground that contractors would not be able to accomplish the proposed schedule although the Air Force believed that they could.

The B-45 was a new, light jet bomber that was designated as a replacement for the A-26 as a ground support aircraft; the P-86 Sabre was a new swept-wing jet interceptor.!?  The AAF aircraft procurement program for fiscal year 1947 was less than half of the Army Air Forces’ proportionate share of the amount recommended by the Air Coordinating Committee as necessary to maintain a solvent aircraft industry.}°2 In the spring of 1947, when it was drawing up its budget requests for fiscal year 1948, the Army Air Forces put in for 1,844 planes, a figure based on a modernization of 55 groups and 15 skeleton groups.
