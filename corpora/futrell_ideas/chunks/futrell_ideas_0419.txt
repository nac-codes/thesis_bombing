when it was drawing up its budget requests for fiscal year 1948, the Army Air Forces put in for 1,844 planes, a figure based on a modernization of 55 groups and 15 skeleton groups. This number was not keyed  218  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 240 --- AF IN NATIONAL DEFENSE  directly to any plan to keep the aircraft industry healthy.° 2 An economy-minded House of Representatives, plus rising costs of aircraft, cut the Air Force program far below the requested figure. Based on an authorized expenditure of $495,507,000, the Air Force issued procurement orders for 965 aircraft in fiscal year 1948. The purchase included 82 B-50s, 43 B-45s, 154 P-84s, 188 P-86s, and, for the first time since the war, 120 new troop carrier and transport aircraft."“~ The transports included 27 C-97s, a global transport version of the B-29; the troop carriers included 36 C-119 Flying Boxcars.!  First Policies on Missiles and Rockets  "The weapons of today are the museum pieces of tomorrow," General Arnold had warned when he was in the process of leaving office in November 1945. Based on guidance provided in Doctor von Karman’s Toward New Horizons, Arnold talked confidently about supersonic flight and intercontinental missiles. As drawn up in the winter of 1945-46 by the Air Materiel Command, a five-year Army Air Forces research and development program generally reflected the findings of von Karman’s scientists and was designated to provide a continuity to air research and development efforts. The program sought to conserve scarce engineering and scientific resources of the nation, but it was predicated on the basic rule that the Air Force would not engage in in-house research and development unless private agencies were unwilling to do the work on a contract basis.’ In explanation of the five-year program, General LeMay observed: "Time in this period of unprecedented scientific progress can be the decisive factor in the continued existence of the United States."°7 General Spa
