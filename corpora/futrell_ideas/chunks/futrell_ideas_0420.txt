n of the five-year program, General LeMay observed: "Time in this period of unprecedented scientific progress can be the decisive factor in the continued existence of the United States."°7 General Spaatz spoke of the requirement for maintaining a technical air supremacy; and, in a statement of general AAF policy in October 1946, he emphasized that "the Army Air Forces must maintain a position of preeminent leadership in research and development."  After studying the results of captured German scientific data, von Karman’s AAF Scientific Advisory Group had reported that the Germans appeared correct in their conclusion that a transoceanic rocket could be developed. Von Karman also suggested that rocket-driven airplanes would be necessary to maintain air superiority. Rocket barrages with atomic warheads, von Karman said, could well become the only effective. air defense weapons.!° Von Karman’s findings were quite different from those of Dr Vannevar Bush when he offered his scientific advice to the Senate Committee on Atomic Energy in December 1945. "We have plenty enough to think about," Bush said,  that is very definite and very realistic— enough so that we don’t need to step out into some of these borderlines which seem to be, to me, more or less fantastic. Let me say this: There has been a great deal said about a 3,000-mile high-angle rocket. In my opinion, such a thing is impossible today and will be impossible for many years. The people who have been writing these things that annoy me .. . have been talking about a 3,000-mile high-angle rocket, shot from one continent to another, carrying an atomic  219  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 241 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  bomb and so directed as to be a precise weapon which would land exactly on a certain target, such asa city. I say, technically, I don’t think anybody in the world knows how to do such a thing, and I feel confident it will not be done for a very long period of time to come. ... I think
