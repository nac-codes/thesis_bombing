propriated $186 million for AAF research and development.!*9 General LeMay was certain that all of this money could have been obligated by the end of the fiscal year, though not at a uniform rate. The Bureau of the Budget, however, did not feel that all of the appropriation could be obligated. In January 1947 it notified the War Department that the fund would be cut by $100 million. After a réclame, the bureau released $25 million of the amount in question but continued to impound $75 million of the air research and development fund, which was transferred to pay and travel of the Army, where there were deficiencies.'* Both President Truman and an economy-minded House of Representatives reduced requested Air Force appropriations for fiscal year 1948, with the result that Congress finally appropriated only $145,300,000 for air research and development for the fiscal year beginning on 1 July 1947. This figure would be the nadir of Air Force research and development appropriations after World War II.!°  Writing on 11 April 1947, General LeMay emphasized that "the greatest need at this time is assurance of a stabilized annual appropriation for research and development." 6 Tater on, Department of Defense experts would state that the curtailment of research and development in the immediate postwar years had been a major mistake.!*’ The reduction of air research and development funding had an immediate effect upon Air Force work on guided missiles. Making his last appearance as deputy commanding general of the Army Air Forces before the  220  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 242 --- AF IN NATIONAL DEFENSE  House Appropriations subcommittee in March 1947, General Eaker explained that with an all-out program (similar to that which had expedited the nuclear weapon), a 5,000-mile-range missile probably could be developed in five years. The Air Force, however, could not bear the expense of such a program and had to progress on the research and development effort at a
