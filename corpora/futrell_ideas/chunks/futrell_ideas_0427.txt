conomy of the United States and a western Europe that could resist aggression and give us time."!  Acting on the basis of this official line of thought and understanding that most of its units would be equipped with World War II aircraft, the Army Air Forces obtained authority in July 1947 to activate or organize all of the groups in the initial 55-group phase of the 70-group program and to have them in place with some degree of operational effectiveness by the end of the year. In the final allocation of strength, the 55 groups included 13 very heavy bombardment, three light bombardment, 24 fighter, seven reconnaissance, and eight troop carrier groups. 44 Each major command sustained a reduction of combat strength, but the new allocation indicated that the Army Air Forces was beginning to mobilize against a particularized strategic threat somewhat different from the generalized concepts in initial postwar planning.  "As the initial blow will come from the air and be delivered by air power," stated Gen George C. Kenney, who headed the Strategic Air Command, in September 1947, "the answer must be for us to maintain our air power strong enough to deter any possible enemy from attacking us."!© Under the 55-group phase, 12 very heavy bombardment groups, five fighter groups, and one very long range reconnaissance group were assigned to the Strategic Air Command.!°! Even though the Strategic Air Command enjoyed priorities in manning and equipment, it did not obtain new equipment or acomplete acceptance of its operational concept. Immediately after V-J Day, the Twentieth Air Force had been assigned to the Pacific theater; hence, one very heavy bombardment group and one very long range reconnaissance squadron continued to be assigned to the Far East Air Forces in the Pacific. The Strategic Air Command maintained that these two units should be placed under its command and that their functions should be performed by SAC groups which would stage to Pacific bases as necessary.
