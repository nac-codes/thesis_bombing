e Strategic Air Command maintained that these two units should be placed under its command and that their functions should be performed by SAC groups which would stage to Pacific bases as necessary. But Gen Douglas MacArthur, commander in chief, US Far East Command, did not agree to give up those units.!© Other than the fact that B-29s would be unable to reach many targets in the Sovet Union, the Strategic Air Command’s most pressing aircraft problem in organizing to meet the growing Soviet threat concerned fighter escort. The Army Air Forces accepted the position that "the necessity of providing adequate fighter protection for very long range bombardment aircraft was conclusively demonstrated during World War II." To protect its bombers against hostile jet  223  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 245 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  fighters, SAC would require jet fighter escorts. However, no American jet fighter had enough range to escort a B-29, and it was problematical whether jet aircraft could escort relatively slow conventional B-29s. Pending solution of the problem, the Strategic Air Command indicated that it would expect to operate its bombers over hostile territory only at night.1  In initial postwar planning, the Army Air Forces had considered air defense essentially a mobilization problem. When he was named to head the Air Defense Command, Lt Gen George E. Stratemeyer accordingly was instructed to give most of his attention to establishing an aircraft control and warning system and to managing the Air National Guard and Air Reserve, which would, upon mobilization, provide fighter units for air defense. As thus laid out, the air defense mission appeared simple, but Stratemeyer found it complex. Thinking in terms of scarce military funds and the eventual need to detect and destroy supersonic jet aircraft and nuclear missiles, Stratemeyer thought that the first priority in the Air Force budget should be given to research and development, the second
