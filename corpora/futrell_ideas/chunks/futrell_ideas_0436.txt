be accomplished without first assuming control of the air above his territory. . . . Penetration by piloted airplanes, even with jet and rocket propulsion, will be unthinkable without all-out air combat. Only with the advent of intercontinental rockets can there be any talk of penetration without combat." He pointed out that the 70-group Air Force would not necessarily represent air power in being in the full strategic sense. "A strategic military force is one which is self-sustained in its own medium, regardless of its base; capable of assuming control of its medium while denying it to the adversary.

De Seversky conceived that an air force in being should have two main divisions: an intercontinental striking force large enough to paralyze an enemy’s industrial establishment and a continental defense force of a size sufficient to defend the vital industries of the United States.’*!  "We believe," stated the President’s Air Policy Commission on the basis of testimony presented to it, "that the United States will be secure in an absolute sense only if the institution of war itself is abolished under a regime of law."
