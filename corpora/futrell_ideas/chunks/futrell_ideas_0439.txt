The aircraft carrier would be the major ship of the future Navy; to carry out its future responsibilities (one of the most important being protection against modern submarines) the Navy would require 5,793 first-line planes plus about 5,100 in support. The Navy had presented strong arguments for increasing its air strength to 8,000 first-line planes with 6,500 planes in support, but the president’s commission believed that such an increase would constitute a naval expansion which should be deferred until the Joint Chiefs of Staff had completed a strategic plan that would demonstrate the need for a naval expansion.
