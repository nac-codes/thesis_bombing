Within the Air Force share of this increment, Spaatz figured that the Air Force could—by utilizing many mothballed planes rather than buying a complete complement of new aircraft — afford to activate all of the 70-group program except for two light bomber and two troop carrier groups, which could be delayed since they would be scheduled to support ground divisions that would not be active before 1950.
