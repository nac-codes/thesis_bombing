"It is certain," he said, "that Europe would have been communized like Czechoslovakia and London under bombardment some time ago but for the deterrent of the atomic bomb in the hands of the United States."”*  Strategic Bombing and the B-36 Controversy  "I am firmly convinced," wrote Dr Edward Teller, the nuclear physicist who had done pioneer work on the A-bomb and who would father the H-bomb, "that in the early postwar years secrecy was a powerful barrier between military men who were clinging to the past and scientists who were turning away from what seemed a frightening future."“!° The whole matter of atomic weapons continued to be a very heavy secret that was not even shared among all top-level military officers. Writing in November 1948, Bernard Brodie reported there was "reason to believe that the amount of uranium and thorium available in the world for the manufacture of atomic bombs is much more limited than was being assumed two years ago, and the deposits available are much more accessible to the United States than to the Soviet Union.” ’ Knowledge of the size of the US atomic weapons production effort and the stockpile was confined to a very small circle. As late as May 1951, Gen Douglas MacArthur testified that he did not know the number of atomic weapons in the US stockpile.21® Although two years had passed since Hiroshima and Nagasaki had been destroyed by atomic weapons and additional tests of atomic bombs had been made at Bikini and Eniwetok in the summer of 1946, there was lingering uncertainty in the military services as to the potential effect of atomic weapons on the old techniques of war. One viewpoint was that an atomic bomb was merely ano
