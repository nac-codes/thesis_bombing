summer of 1946, there was lingering uncertainty in the military services as to the potential effect of atomic weapons on the old techniques of war. One viewpoint was that an atomic bomb was merely another weapon. While his statement was soon retracted, the head of the Navyâ€™s Aviation Ordnance Branch told the House Committee on Armed Services in October 1949: "You could stand in the open at one end of the north- south runway at the Washington National Airport, with no more protection than the clothes you now have on, and have an atom bomb explode at the other end of the runway without serious injury to you."  Although Air Force thinkers never underestimated the destructive capabilities of atomic weapons, they apparently required time in which to grasp the potential gamut of effects that these weapons held for air operations and the modifications of air doctrines that could be accepted when they were employed. One of the principal results of the clear identification of Soviet Russia as the major menace to world peace was a vigorous analysis within the National Military Establishment of the potential influence of atomic weapons on future American military strategy. The concept that atomic air power could "kill a nation" apparently emerged in the Air Force Directorate of Intelligence during the winter of 1947-48 when target planners were attempting to work up a list of industrial objectives in the Soviet  237  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 259 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  Union that had been requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In the aftermath of World War II, the United States Strategic Bombing Survey depreciated the effectiveness of Royal Air Force attacks against German population centers, thus US Air Force target planners attempted to develop Soviet steel, oil, aluminum, aircraft engines, tank factories, and electric power plants as air targets. Since most of these specific targets were located within 70 Soviet cities, some target planners sugge
