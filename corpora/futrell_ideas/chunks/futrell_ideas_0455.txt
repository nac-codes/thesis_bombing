Since most of these specific targets were located within 70 Soviet cities, some target planners suggested that atomic attacks might be directed against the Soviet cities rather than the specific industries. The concept followed that the mission of atomic air attack might be to destroy governmental control and industrial mobilization and support potential instead of specific industrial targets.
