In an article published shortly after his retirement, Spaatz asserted: "It is theoretically possible to demonstrate on the basis of the war just finished that the precision bombing of a few hundred square miles of industrial area in a score of Russian cities would fatally cripple Russian industrial power."

And not until we have won this control could we be absolutely sure of the outcome of a war."
