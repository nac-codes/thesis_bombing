that 100 atom bombs will release more foot pounds of energy than all the TNT released by all the belligerents of World War II combined . .. and that the effort could be put down in a single attack, it is evident that the long drawn out war is out of date... . No nation, including our own, could survive such a blow. A war in which either or both opponents use atomic bombs will be over in a matter of days so that our target analysis system should change. Bombing of targets which will effect enemy production in a few months is meaningless. There is no time to try to destroy the enemy air force. The air force that is superior in its capability of destruction plays the dominant role and has the power of decision. The inferior air force has no role. Before it can be built up the war will be over. The advantage accruing to the aggressor who makes such a surprise attack has become so great that it can almost be considered decisive.  In making a reevaluation of Douhet’s principles in the light of atomic explosives in the summer of 1948, Lt Col Joseph L. Dickman found that the Douhet theory was "not only a pattern for the conduct of the war but also a guide for the preparation for one." He argued that the power of atomic bombs validated Douhet’s principles on air power. Dickman suggested a corollary rule: "If, at any time, it appears that expenditures for tactical aviation ¥ will jeopardize development in strategic, the former will have to be sacrificed. "225 Tha study prepared on 10 August 1948, Col William W. Momyer, director of plans for the Tactical Air Command, analyzed the whole Air Force mission. He pointed out that the Tactical Air Command would not become involved in hostilities unless the atomic offensive failed and the war degenerated into a conventional air-surface action, a contingency that he did not anticipate would occur at all and, in any event, not until approximately two years after the onset of a war. Momyer pointed out that Tactical Air Command’s fighter
