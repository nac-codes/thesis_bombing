Momyer pointed out that Tactical Air Command’s fighters would pass to the operational control of the Air Defense Command at the onset of hostilities and argued for a more effective cross-training of fighters to perform both air defense and tactical air missions. Finally, he questioned the planned use of jet fighters in an escort capacity as "an obsolete concept of the last war."  Three articles in the autumn 1948 issue of the Air University Quarterly Review strongly advocated a strategic bombardment strategy.

In the war against Germany, the strategic bombing effort had been frequently switched from one target system to another in the expectation that a "key" target system could
