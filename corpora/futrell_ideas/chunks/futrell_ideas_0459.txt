support of surface combat. In the war against Germany, the strategic bombing effort had been frequently switched from one target system to another in the expectation that a "key" target system could be destroyed with decisive results. In the end, Smith said, "when German industry collapsed, no single target system was responsible but rather a widespread disintegration of all industry occurred." From this experience, Smith thought it plausible to conclude that "the most effective air siege will result by concurrently attacking every critical element of an enemy’s economy at the same time... . Ifall the critical industrial systems could be destroyed at one blow, so that recuperation were impossible within any foreseeable time, there seems little question but that a nation would die just as surely as a man will die if a bullet pierces his heart and his circulating system is stopped." Smith visualized an atomic striking force of 300 B-29s directed against an enemy nation, and he thought there was little doubt that "an offensive bomber force, utilizing tactical surprise, will be able to penetrate to targets in the enemy heartland." Believing that the strategic air assault with atomic weapons would destroy a modern nation, Smith suggested that the Air Force should abandon "the old doctrine of ‘sustained’ operations." "The atomic bomb is real. . .. There need be no doubt about its combat worthiness," he wrote. "Why then must we revert to the old TNT bombs and forever hamstring our logistical and tactical plans with the requirement for sustained operations?"  Fiscal Limits Affected the Military  Even though a bill that authorized a peacetime Air Force strength of 70 groups and an eventual level-off purchase of 5,200 aircraft a year was lost in the closing rush of the 80th Congress during the late summer of 1948, General Vandenberg considered that Congress —by providing the first increment of funds for such a purpose —had given the Air Force a clear mandate to expand to the
