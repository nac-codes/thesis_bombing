ress during the late summer of 1948, General Vandenberg considered that Congress —by providing the first increment of funds for such a purpose —had given the Air Force a clear mandate to expand to the 70-group objective. The Air Force, therefore, decided that the purchase of the 2,201 new aircraft that could be funded with the augmented fiscal year 1949 appropriations would be pointed toward accomplishment of the 70-group program. The Air Force, thus, contracted to purchase 190 B-45 aircraft to partially equip five light bombardment groups and three night tactical reconnaissance squadrons. In the spring of 1948 many Air Force officers had continued to be skeptical of the B-36. However, when the Air Force began to get deliveries of some of these planes, the test data from them was so much better than had previously been reported that Vandenberg elected on 24 June to continue the funding on the original contract for 95 aircraft.

Moreover, by stretching available personnel strength rather thinly, the Air Force was able to activate a total of 60 combat groups before the end of 194,230  In the spring of 1948 when work was begun on fiscal year 1950 budget request, the Air Force assumed that appropriations would be enlarged to support expanded personnel strength and aircraft procurement necessary for the 70-group program. The Air Staff, therefore, first submitted a request for an $8 billion appropriation to the secretary of defense. Then, as Secretary Symington explained, "word got around that again the three services were going to ask for everything they could get on a unilateral basis and then we were all going to be cut proportionately because there was no agreed on strategic plan against which to buy." Symington, therefore, took personal responsibility for raising the
