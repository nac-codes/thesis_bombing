andenberg reassured Forrestal that the Air Force could drop the atomic bomb "where, how, and when it was wanted." Working in terms of requirements for balanced forces, the McNarney board reduced the service requests to $23.6 billion but could go no lower. The Joint Chiefs of Staff estimated that the $14.4-billion defense budget would limit US action against the Soviet Union to a strategic air offensive from Britain and suggested that for $16.9 billion the United States could maintain forces needed to control the Mediterranean as well as conduct the strategic air offensive.

Faced with this ceiling, the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed that the funds should be subdivided at $4.834 billion for the Army, $4.624 billion for the Navy, and $5.025 billion for the Air Force."

Under the $14.4-billion budget ceiling, the Air Force mission (as defined by the USAF Senior Officers Board) would be:  (a) initially, to launch a powerful air offensive designed to exploit the destructive and psychological power of atomic weapons against the vital elements of the Soviet war-making capacity. (b) To provide on an austerity basis for the air defense of the United States and selected base areas. (c) To provide the air components necessary for the advancement, intensification, and/or diversification of our initial offensive until forces generated from inad
