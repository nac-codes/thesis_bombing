medium reconnaissance group should be equipped with speedy but limited range B-47s. The remaining three medium bomber groups would continue to be equipped with B-29s and RB-29s, but the board noted that the Air Force had issued procurement orders for 30 B-54A aircraft — an ultimate development of the B-50—which would probably become the replacement for the B-29s and RB-29s.40  243  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 265 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  The Senior Officers Board made no recommendations as to the aircraft to be used for modernizing the two strategic weather reconnaissance groups and the one strategic mapping group that would be retained in the 48-group program. The five light bomber groups that had been put in the 70-group program to perform ground support missions were reduced to a single group. Tactical reconnaissance also was reduced to the equivalent of one group (two squadrons in the United States and one in the Far East). The board postponed consideration of the aircraft requirements for the four heavy troop carrier groups and two light troop carrier groups that would remain in the 48-group program, but it gave careful attention to the equipment and composition of the 20 fighter groups that would be kept in active service. In World War II the P-47 and P-51 had served as admirable all-purpose fighters, but the board reasoned that the advent of jet power probably prevented the development of a successful all-purpose jet fighter. The F-80s, F-84s, and F-86s would be no more than marginally effective against any bomber faster than a B-29. Accordingly, the board recommended that a pure interceptor fighter should be developed by 1953-54. Pending further developmental work in fighters, the board recommended that the F-84 and F-86 should perform both interceptor and penetration missions, but it stated that the 20 fighter groups should be divided into eight penetration groups, seven interceptor groups, and five all-weather fighter groups.
