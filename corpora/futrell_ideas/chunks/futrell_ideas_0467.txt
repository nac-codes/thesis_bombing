h interceptor and penetration missions, but it stated that the 20 fighter groups should be divided into eight penetration groups, seven interceptor groups, and five all-weather fighter groups.  The cutback of the Air Force from its planned objective of 70 groups to 48 groups necessarily reduced the weight and speed of the initial air offensive, seriously delayed the time at which the Air Force would be prepared to support exploitative surface operations, and reduced the fighter defenses that had been planned for advanced US bases in the United Kingdom. Recognizing these limitations, Vandenberg approved the report of the USAF Senior Officers Board; Secretary Symington also gave his approval when it was submitted to him on 13 January 1949. On 5 February the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved the Air Force deployment inherent in the 48-group program.‚Äù The sudden termination of the 70-group objective meant that the Air Force had ordered aircraft from fiscal year 1949 money that it would be unable to use. By canceling various orders including 51 B-45s no longer needed for light bombardment groups, 118 F-93s ordered as penetration fighters, and 30 C-125B assault transports that had been designed to replace gliders, the Air Force recaptured some $269,761,000 from fiscal year 1949 supplemental funds that could be applied to the purchase of B-36s. In a series of actions begun on 29 January 1949, the Air Force requested authority from Secretary Forrestal to purchase 32 B-36s and 7 RB-36s and to modify the B-36s already on hand or on order with jet pods. While this request was under study in the National Military Establishment Research and Development Board, LeMay requested still more B-36s on 2 February. LeMay told Vandenberg that he carefully compared the projected performance capabilities of the B-36s against those of the B-54s and that he had decided that the B-54 contract ought to be canceled and enough B-36s be bought to equip two additional groups.
