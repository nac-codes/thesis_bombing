, favored the completion of the $188 million vessel, on which some $20 million had already been expended. General Bradley, on the other hand, reasoned that budgetary restrictions already seriously limited the maintenance of minimum levels of balanced forces, that the fundamental purpose for which the supercarrier was designed lay within a primary function of the Air Force, that the Soviet Union was not a naval power, and that the potential use of carrier air forces against land targets was limited. He, therefore, concluded that it was "militarily unsound to authorize at this time the construction of additional aircraft carriers or to continue expenditures on the USS United States." Vandenberg also expressed his opposition to the large carrier because he could "see no necessity for a ship with those capabilities in any strategic plan against the one possible enemy." He added that limited defense funds imposed a necessity "of never buying a second priority item when essential items are still unbought." When his opinion was asked, General Eisenhower agreed that construction of the large carrier should be canceled. After consulting with President Truman, Secretary Johnson issued orders on 23 April discontinuing the construction of the United States.  Meanwhile, the text of the North Atlantic Treaty was released to the public on 18 March 1949, a little more than two weeks before it was signed on 4 April in Washington by representatives of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States.* By adhering to the treaty, the member nations agreed that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America should be considered to be an attack against all of them. Each of the members agreed to â€œassist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed forces, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area."
