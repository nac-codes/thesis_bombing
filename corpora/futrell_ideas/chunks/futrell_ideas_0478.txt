kept the Air Force at the 48-group level. Not waiting for the beginning of fiscal year 1950 to initiate its downward readjustment in strength, the Air Force began to inactivate tactical organizations in March 1949, By the end of the year it would possess 47 groups and 13 separate squadrons. Generally following the recommendations of the USAF Senior Officers Board, the aircraft authorized for procurement in fiscal year 1950 included 34 B-36Fs and 13 RB-36Fs, 81 B-47s, 709 jet fighters, 14 C-97s, 51 C-119Cs, and 50 C-124s, plus miscellaneous aircraft for a total of 1,252 planes.2  Based partly on the impoundment of the funds that Congress had voted for Air  Force expansion, the Joint Chiefs of Staff assumed that the budgetary ceiling of all military forces during fiscal year 1951 would be the same austere $14.4 billion that had been authorized in fiscal year 1950.

Quite without warning in July, however, President Truman summoned Department of Defense officials and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to his office, where the director of the budget told them that the national defense expenditures for fiscal year 1951 must be reduced to $13 billion.2 "I was sick about it," said Secretary Johnson, as he recalled his reaction to the news. Although he tried to get the figure raised, he was unsuccessful. "The climate on the Hill, the climate of the President’s economists and all the rest of the economists, the climate of the world at that moment—the airlift having been successful — the climate was," Johnson recalled, "there was going to be peace." In view of the reduction of the budget, each armed service would have to stand a further reduction in forces. While the connection was not mentioned, the reduction in the defense budget was the same amount that Truman had requested; the president may have intended that redu
