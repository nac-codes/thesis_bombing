foundation for subsequent operations by land, sea, and air forces. Although the Air Force had given first emphasis to its strategic air elements, Vandenberg pointed out that the distinction made between strategic air operations (attacks against an enemy’s industrial strength) and tactical air operations (attacks against an enemy’s military forces) was not completely valid. Such a distinction, he said, "denies the unity of air power, by failing to recognize that strategic and tactical air units are component parts of a whole and are complementary forces." As a matter of practicality, he demonstrated that it was more difficult and more expensive to destroy a deployed tank or plane than to destroy them in the process of manufacture, but the choice of air targets depended on the situation. "The ultimate objective of the strategic air campaign," he said,  is to reduce an enemy’s capacity to below the level at which he can support his war effort. However, there may well be interim or emergency objectives of overriding importance. For example, this would be the case if the enemy had a long-range air fleet and a stock of atomic bombs, and if this disposition of these weapons rendered them vulnerable to attack by a strategic force. Before attacking an enemy’s economic strength, it might be mandatory, in the interest of survival, to take action to prevent these weapons of mass destruction being employed against us. Likewise, a hostile army poised on a European frontier might, under certain circumstances, provide the best target for a strategic air force.  In justifying the employment of B-36s under conditions where air superiority would not have been attained, the Air Force appeared to be deviating from its findings that control of the air was necessary for a strategic air campaign. Vandenberg was reluctant to discuss the matter in open sessions, but he reiterated the historic fact: "No bombing mission set in motion by the Army Air Forces in World War II was ever stopped sho
