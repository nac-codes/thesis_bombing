nd Normandy, will never occur again."  In his discussion of strategy, Bradley defined strategic bombing as "violent airborne attacks on the war-making capacity or potential of an enemy nation." He justified strategic bombing: "From a military standpoint, any damage you can inflict on the war-making potential of a nation, and any great injury you can inflict upon the morale of that nation contributes to the victory." As for the charge that mass bombing was immoral, he pointed out that "war itself is immoral." "Strategic bombing," he said, "has a high priority in our military planning, because we cannot hope to keep forces in being of sufficient size to meet Russia in the early stages of war. This is particularly true since we are never going to start the war, and the Soviet Union because of their peculiar governmental organization can choose the date of starting it. Lacking such forces in being, our greatest strength lies in the threat of quick retaliation in the event we are attacked." The insinuation that the atomic bomb was relatively ineffective drew Bradley’s strongest refutation. "The A-bomb," he said, "is the most powerful destructive weapon known today. ... As a believer in humanity I deplore its use, and as a soldier I respect it. And as an American citizen, I believe that we should be prepared to use its full psychological and military effect toward preventing war, and if we are attacked, toward winning it."  Both Bradley and Gen J. Lawton Collins, who had become the Army chief of staff, refuted the charge that the Air Force had neglected tactical aviation. Bradley pointed out that in the face of very strong enemy opposition in Europe the Ninth Air Force had allocated approximately one group for the support of each two Twelfth Army Group divisions. Using this comparison as a guide, he questioned whether the Marine Corps required the equivalent of seven groups for the support of only two Marine divisions.7°° Speaking of his experience in Europe during World
