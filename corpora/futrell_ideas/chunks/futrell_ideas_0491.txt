p during World War II; the group’s membership included military officers and civilian operations analysts. At the request of President Truman, the WSEG made a detailed study of the Strategic Air Command between August and December 1949. Though the results of the study were never released, a source described as knowledgeable stated on 6 January 1950 that the B-36 could be expected to have a better than even chance of delivering its bombs to a target area. The study apparently reinforced the Air Force position that the B-36, while not perfect, was capable of going anywhere of importance in the world and dropping an atomic bomb*8 Although the fact could not be presented in the public hearings, General LeMay later recalled that the Soviet air defenses in 1949 and for several years afterward were too weak to have effected unacceptable losses on a nuclear-laden strategic bombing force. "We didn’t have to worry about winning an air power battle," he reminisced, "because the Russians had no threat against us. ... We could ignore the rule book in winning the air power battle and go about destroying their resources."  Both at the time that the hearings were in progress and afterward, the B-36 and unification and strategy investigations were seen to involve challenges that had been made to broad concepts of unification and strategy. "Despite protestations to the contrary," General Bradley observed, "I believe that the Navy has opposed unification from the beginning, and they have not in spirit as well as deed, accepted it completely to date." Bradley called for team play in national defense: "This is no time for ‘fancy dans’ who won’t hit the line with all they have on every play, unless they can call the signals."*”” In the course of the hearings, Chairman Vinson openly deplored the fact that the national military budget was being prepared in terms of ceilings worked out by the Treasury and the Bureau of the Budget rather than in terms of the nation’s risks and foreign policy
