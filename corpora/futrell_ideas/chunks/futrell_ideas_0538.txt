the knowledge that the Soviets had the A-bomb.”? The immediate effect of the Soviet nuclear capability was to stimulate research and development in the field of nuclear weapons: the products of the effort would have important effects on national strategic planning.  282  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 304 --- SOVIET NUCLEAR WEAPONS  "At the end of World War II," observed W. Sterling Cole, chairman of the congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, "there was a general slowdown in our entire military program, including atomic weapon development. This relaxation was due in large measure to a general belief that a lasting peace had been accomplished, that we would enjoy atomic monopoly for some years, and that there would be international control of atomic weapons.” The two World War II atomic bombs that had been employed against Japan had been large and awkward "laboratory" models which could not have been transported by planes smaller than B-29s, and even these aircraft had to be especially modified for the purpose. As has been noted, there was a prevalent belief in scientific and military circles in the late 1940s that the world’s supply of fissionable uranium was very scarce. Air Force leaders recognized the desirability of a family of atomic weapons that could be employed against an entire spectrum of targets; however, they believed, on good authority, that fissionable material would always be scarce and that small atomic bombs could not be designed or produced. Consequently, these Air Force leaders favored the developing and stockpiling of the larger and more efficient atomic weapons that would be employed in a strategic air offensive. The Military Liaison Committee made Army, Navy, and Air Force requirements known to the Atomic Energy Commission, but the Department of Defense was only one of the customers of this production agency. Since 1946 many scientists had been more interested in the employment of the atom for peace than for war."  As early as A
