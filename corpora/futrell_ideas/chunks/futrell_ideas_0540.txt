The matter, nevertheless, continued under consideration until late January 1950, when Dr Klaus Fuchs, a former group leader at the Los Alamos atomic weapons laboratory, confessed that he had passed nuclear secrets to the Soviets, a situation that demanded immediate action. In a day-long meeting on 31 January, secretaries Acheson and Johnson agreed upon the need for immediate and full-scale development of the thermonuclear bomb. Lilienthal opposed that view, arguing that there was a considerable doubt as to the technical feasibility of thermonuclear weapons and advocating that a better course of action would be to create more flexible atomic weapons.
