committee recommended that President Truman direct the Atomic Energy Commission to take immediate steps to develop a thermonuclear weapon. Accepting the recommendation, Truman announced on 31 January that on the previous day he had directed the Atomic Energy Commission "to continue its work on all forms of atomic weapons, including the so-called hydrogen or superbomb.""” In protest Lilienthal resigned as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission on 15 February and was shortly thereafter replaced by Gordon Dean.  The decision of the United States to emphasize the weapon aspects of thermonuclear energy shortly provided the beginnings of a family of nuclear weapons. Late in February 1950 the Atomic Energy Commission announced that it would turn out A-bombs on a virtual production-line basis. Thus, the critical problem of atomic supply, long considered a question in military planning, had apparently been solved. As a matter of fact, uranium ores were never scarce. The military had based its requirements on an assumption that the availability of raw materials would rigidly limit production; meanwhile the Atomic Energy Commission did not step up its materials procurement program because the limited requirements could not be met without expanding existing sources. Higher prices offered for uranium ores following the decision in 1950 to expand production led to the discovery of large mineral reserves in the United States. Technological innovations in the thermonuclear program also permitted refinements in A-bomb technology. In May 1950 a military requirement for a small bomb that could be delivered by high-performance aircraft was forwarded to the Atomic Energy Commission, and in this same month the Sandia Corporation  284  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 306 --- SOVIET NUCLEAR WEAPONS  reported that it would be possible to proceed with the manufacture of an efficient A-bomb that could be transported and dropped by fighter-type aircraft.“4 Where nuclear weapons
