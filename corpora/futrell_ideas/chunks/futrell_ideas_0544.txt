nt to carry out at this time. ... Anybody who advocates a preventing war... is simply taking the easiest way and is not willing to face up to the tremendously difficult political and military things we have to do. I think that the American people want their military leaders and their political leaders to work themselves out of this mess in some way which is consistent with the spirit and the creed of the American people.  On 7 June, General Saville told Air War College students that there were good military reasons why the Air Force could not reasonably think about preventive war. While scientists assumed that the nuclear explosion in August 1949 had been Russia’s first test, it was possible that earlier tests had not been discovered and the Soviet Union might have a stockpile of weapons. In order to wage preventive war and simultaneously shield the United States from counterattack, the Strategic Air Command would have to destroy the Soviet Long-Range Air Force in the initial air assault. As of early 1950 the Air Force did not have the reconnaissance capabilities and available intelligence information to pinpoint the location of Soviet aircraft for an initial attack or keep account of their deployments once an attack was begun. Saville suggested that, at best, preventive war might well turn into a situation wherein "I'll beat your brains out and you beat my brains out."  At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr George Valley, Jr., a professor of physics and a member of the USAF Scientific Advisory Board, apparently read Colonel Pike’s article that degraded the potential of air defense. Professor Valley believed that an air defense system capable of blunting an enemy attack could be had with modern technology at a cost that would not unduly detract from the support of the strategic air striking arm, and he recommended that a scientific study be made of air defense. Generals Vandenberg and Fairchild immediately called in key members of the Scientific Advisory
