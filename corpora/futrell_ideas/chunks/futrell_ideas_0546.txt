weapon had increased the importance of the American strategic striking force. "Indeed," he said,  its continued effective, efficient existence is the greatest deterrent against the possibility of occurrence of another great conflict. If, through the grave miscalculation of others, such a conflict should nevertheless occur, it is our strategic striking force that we must put primary reliance upon for protection of our homeland by the destruction of the bases and remaining aircraft of the long-range forces directed against us and for so  reducing enemy capacity to support his war effort that we may gain the time required for ultimate victory.  Even though the strategic striking force continued to be of first importance and first priority, Fairchild called for a new emphasis on air defense forces. "We must," he said, "provide the greatest degree of air defense attainable, within the means available to us." The Air Force could no longer expect to mobilize air defense units in a time of emergency. "Air-defensive forces," Fairchild ruled, "must be trained and equipped and in place and actually on 24-hour alert if they are to be committed to combat in defense against any sudden atomic attack— possibly one in great force." In view of the budgetary situation and the need to emphasize both the air striking and air defense forces, the Air Force had no choice but to further reduce the priority of the tactical air force. Although the Air Force continued to program some tactical air groups to permit peacetime training and development of tactics and doctrine, the tactical air force would not be adequate for the support of any large-scale surface operation immediately on the outbreak of hostilities. Such a force would have to be mobilized after a war’s beginning.”  Speaking candidly of the importance of the strategic striking force on 10 May, Vandenberg visualized a future war:  An alert enemy will strike us first. Further, our defense forces in being will kill some of the attacke
