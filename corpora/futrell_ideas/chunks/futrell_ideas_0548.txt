could be more than 60 percent successful, he urged that the United States must build a centralized air defense system of a magnitude that could be calculated in terms of its monetary costs both to the United States and to the Soviet Union. In other words, would a dollar expended by the United States for air defense cost the Russians comparatively more to augment their offensive capabilities in order to sustain the casualties that the US air defenses would inflict on an attacking Soviet force? Saville’s "guesstimate" was that the United States could afford to build an air defense system with "two-notch" radar — one set of radars at the interior defense line and another on offshore picket vessels — and 67 air defense squadrons, the whole system to be capable of inflicting about 30 percent casualties on an attacking force. Such a defense would not prevent the Soviets from dropping some A-bombs on the United States, but it would introduce imponderables and additional requirements into their offensive plans, which would give the United States some five years to gear its forces to fight an atomic war. Saville did not favor the construction of a much more expensive three-notch radar system, with a very extended early warning radar line, until it could be determined whether other intelligence efforts could not provide the "early, early warning" more cheaply. He summed up his remarks by mentioning what he jocularly called the Saville theory of air defense: that the United States ought to try to gain as much time as possible to prepare itself to fight in an air war in which both adversaries would possess nuclear capabilities.  NSC-68: Call for US Rearmament  At the same time that he directed the Atomic Energy Commission to begin developing thermonuclear weapons on 30 January 1950, President Truman called upon the secretaries of state and defense to undertake a basic review of the national policies and military strategy of the United States in the light of the Soviet atomic ex
