Handling the paper as NSC-68, the National Security Council soon estimated that the expanded military program would cost about $50 billion a year for several years. While these defense expenditures appeared large, they appeared also to be within the economic potential of the United States.”  289  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 311 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  At the same time that the State-Defense ad hoc study group was preparing NSC-68, Congress had begun hearings on the Department of Defense budget for fiscal year 1951.
