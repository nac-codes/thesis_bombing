cannot be reconstituted or developed in an area where his foe has won air supremacy."  "In a long-term war," Weyland remarked on 28 December 1950, "tactical air power will contribute more to the success of the ground forces and to the over-all mission of a theater air commander through a well-planned interdiction campaign than by any other mission short of the attainment of air supremacy." In times of crisis, the Far East Air Forces provided friendly ground troops with an extraordinary large amount of close air support. The FEAF Bomber Command developed radar-directed night-bombing techniques that permitted its B-29s to rain down proximity-fuze bombs on Red troops as they prepared to assault friendly ground positions. In the intervals between ground battles, however, United Nations air power was directed against the middle miles of the Korean transportation system that supported the Red armies. Constant air attacks against the overextended supply lines drained the Chinese Communist armies of their combat effectiveness. The massive Chinese ground attacks mounted in January and April 1951 failed because of a lack of logistical support. Seeking to exact heavy casualties upon the enemy rather than to defend geographical objectives, United Nations ground troops preserved themselves through maneuver during the Chinese attacks and launched counteroffensives when the Red assaults collapsed. During the period between November 1950 and June 1951, continued air assault against the enemy forward areas and supporting supply routes brought death to an estimated 117,000 enemy troops, destroyed 1,315 gun positions, 196 tanks, and more than 80,000 buildings used as troop and supply centers. The enemy’s transportation system was crippled by the loss of over 13,000 vehicles, 2,600 freight cars, and 250 locomotives to air attack.”®  Following the collapse of the vaunted Chinese Communist spring ground offensive, United Nations Command forces drove forward on all fronts in May 1951 to
