The Aircraft and Weapons Board was established on 9 July 1951 to consider the matters that had been handled formerly by the Senior Officers Board. Shortly thereafter, the Force Estimates Board, the Budget Advisory Board, and the Military Construction Board were established. These directorate-level boards studied problems within their framework of authority and made recommendations to the Air Force Council. Although these four directorate boards and the Air Force Council would continue to be the top deliberative and advisory bodies during the 1950s, the secretary of the Air Force and the chief of staff continued to make the decisions that guided the Air Force.)

"Although those three jobs seemed pegged to different objectives," Vandenberg wrote, "it is impossible to separate them in practice because—and this is a principle ignored too often—air power is indivisible."!!° During the summer and autumn of 1950, the doctrine of the indivisibility of air power was a very real factor as the Air Force reconsidered its responsibilities and reorganized its forces.
