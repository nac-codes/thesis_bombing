Until the summer of 1950 the limited capabilities of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) were committed to preparing to execute a strategic air campaign against targets in the Soviet Union. However, the Strategic Air Command recognized that  306  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 328 --- SOVIET NUCLEAR WEAPONS  its atomic capability was increasing, that it was important to find some new means of defense for Western Europe against Soviet attack, and that the Army and Navy were dissatisfied with the existing air war plan. For this reason, General LeMay submitted a revised war plan, which was additionally revised and approved at a higher level on 12 August 1950. Under a new plan the Strategic Air Command would seek to accomplish three specific tasks during a strategic air offensive: destroying vital elements of the Soviet war-making capability, blunting of the Soviet capability to deliver an atomic offensive, and retarding Soviet ground advances into Europe. At the time these tasks (subsequently referred to as the Delta, Bravo, and Romeo missions) were assigned, the Strategic Air Command possessed the nationâ€™s only significant nuclear capability; but provision was made in the approved plan for the eventual employment of Navy aircraft in the prosecution of the expanded air offensive. ~ Even though he accepted the mission to slow a Soviet land invasion of Western Europe, General LeMay was not entirely convinced that the Strategic Air Command should be charged to perform tactical air warfare missions. "If you have to employ strategic air power against tactical targets," he said, "you are not getting the full use of the weapon."!  Largely for economy, but also because existing fighter aircraft were sufficiently versatile to perform either air defenses or tactical air support, the Air Force had reduced the status of the Air Defense and Tactical Air Commands in December 1948 and had placed them under the Continental Air Command.
