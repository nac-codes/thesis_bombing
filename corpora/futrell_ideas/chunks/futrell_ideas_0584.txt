The reduced status of tactical air was not popular with the Army; by June 1949 the Army Field Forces had informed the Tactical Air Command that it was no longer satisfied with the cooperative air-ground establishment visualized in Field Manual 31-35, Air-Ground Operations.” ~ In an informal word of advice in May 1950, Representative Vinson told Maj Gen Thomas D. White, the Air Force director of legislation and liaison, that for its own protection the Air Force would have to meet the Army’s requirements for air support. Vinson jokingly suggested that the air-support mission might have to be given to the Marine Corps if the Air Force did not pay more attention to it. Representatives Vinson and Dewey Short, taking an unusual step that they said was meant to assist rather than criticize, wrote Vandenberg on 2 August that the House Committee on Armed Services was "definitely dissatisfied" with the lack of progress being made in the development of the nation’s radar warning network and had "strong reservations about the efforts of the Air Force to deal with close air support for the Army." In 1950 the Air Force realized that it would be very difficult to develop an all-purpose fighter which would have the supersonic capabilities needed to intercept and destroy future generations of hostile jet bombers and still have the relatively slow speed and long flight-endurance characteristics that the Army felt necessary for a close air support aircraft.!  Even without the significant technological developments that were impending, the mobilization of additional Army and Air Force units during the autumn of 1950 probably would have forced the Air Force to reestablish a major Tactical Air Command. Moving in this direction, the Continental Air Command, effective on  307  File: --- futrell_idea
