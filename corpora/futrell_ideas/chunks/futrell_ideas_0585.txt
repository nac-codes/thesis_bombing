he autumn of 1950 probably would have forced the Air Force to reestablish a major Tactical Air Command. Moving in this direction, the Continental Air Command, effective on  307  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 329 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  1 August 1950, assigned the Ninth Air Force (Tactical) together with available fighter-bomber, troop carrier, light bomber, and tactical reconnaissance units to the Tactical Air Command.

In 1947, General Collins had agreed with General Eisenhower’s concept that the Air Force should furnish tactical air support to the Army.

He specifically recommended that the Army commanders, down to corps level in some instances, should exercise operational control of close air support. He also recommended that the Army ought to participate in determining the requirements for close-support aircraft, which, he said, "should be designed primarily for close air support roles, to include types of missions and targets, necessity for all weather operations, reasonable operational endurance, and ability to operate from advance strips in combat zo
