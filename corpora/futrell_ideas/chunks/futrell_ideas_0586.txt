Clark, chief of the Army Field Forces, emphasized that the Army wanted a plane specifically designed for the close support mission. Ifthe plane required protection from hostile fighters, the support plane could be escorted by Air Force high-performance fighters. At a conference of Army and Air Force representatives, held in Washington on7 February 1951 to discuss the development of a light close-support aircraft, Army representatives reportedly made the point that multipurpose tactical fighters frequently were diverted away from close-support operations, whereas a light, support aircraft that could do nothin but this mission would always be available when it was needed for air support!  The Army proposals to attach supporting air groups to army units and to develop special close-support aircraft struck at the heart of the Army-Air Force air-ground doctrine that had emerged from World War II. General Cannon thought it significant that the concept of specially committed air support units had originated in the Central Pacific and had been fostered in Korea under conditions in which the maintenance of air superiority was quite different than it had been in Europe. In the event of a war with the Soviet Union, Cannon urged that all available aircraft initially be committed to gaining and maintaining friendly air superiority; he accordingly objected to the development and procurement of light close- support aircraft that would be too vulnerable to participate in an air war.
