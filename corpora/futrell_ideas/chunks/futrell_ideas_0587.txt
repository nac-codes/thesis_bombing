Sanders, deputy chief of staff for operations of the Tactical Air Command, pointed out that more than 100 close-support groups would have been needed in Western Europe during 1944-45 to have supported Army divisions on a one-for-one basis. The cost of such a tactical air force would have been prohibitive, and, at any rate, this tremendous establishment had not been needed because the flexibility in control in the air support system had permitted a rapid concentration of any number of aircraft at a given point in accordance with the needs of local situations.!™ In an article published in an Army service journal in May 1951, Col Francis C. Gideon, Air Force member of the Joint Strategic Plans Group, summarized Air Force thinking on the command of tactical aviation. "If air power were nothing more than flying artillery or jet-propelled cavalry," he wrote, "it would properly be placed under the command of the ground forces. But air power, of which the forces designed for close combat support of ground operations are a part, is more than this. Air power is the sum of the means necessary to dominate the air. Viewed in this light, the reasons for establishing an integrated Air Force are logical and wise; its integrity must be guaranteed."  From the beginning of the controversy, Secretary Finletter and Ge
