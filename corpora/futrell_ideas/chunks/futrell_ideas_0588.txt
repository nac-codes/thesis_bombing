. Viewed in this light, the reasons for establishing an integrated Air Force are logical and wise; its integrity must be guaranteed."  From the beginning of the controversy, Secretary Finletter and General Vandenberg assumed that resolution of such a highly complex question as the command and control of tactical aviation ought to be handled by military men rather than by the Department of Defense or Congress. On 21 March 1951, General Collins, after evaluating the Air Force positions on the subject, sent Vandenberg a readjustment of his original position. He recognized that centralized control of tactical air units under a senior Air Force commander might be necessary in a war against an enemy nation that had a great superiority of air power, but Collins wanted this senior air commander to allocate air groups to the support of field armies if the tactical situation permitted. Once air groups were so allocated to the support of an army or an independent corps, their responsible Army commanders should be able to exercise operational control over them.!”° At this juncture, Secretary of the Army Frank Pace and General Collins agreed in a conversation with Finletter that the idea of a separate tactical close-support air force ought to be laid aside until such time as the Air Force could build up tactical air forces capable of performing the multiple functions of tactical air power.!27 Although the matter was postponed, General Clark had changed none of his thinking. Writing to Collins, Clark stated:  I consider that the traditional Air Force doctrine, which provides for coequal command status between ground and air at all but theater levels, constitutes a fundamental defect in command relationship.
