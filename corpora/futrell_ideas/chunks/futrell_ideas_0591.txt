from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Air Force in July 1951 directed the necessary modification of aircraft and ordered the Tactical Air Command to organize the atomic air division. Even though they decided that an atomic-capable tactical air division would be fielded, the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not relieve the Strategic Air Command of its retardation mission, and the Air Force did not commit itself to provide a follow-up tactical bomber replacement for the old B-45. "It is my considered opinion," Cannon continued to insist, "that any planning basis that relies in the main upon the diversion of strategic air effort to tactical targets is inappropriate. Strategic air power must be conserved for its primary mission and tactical air must possess integral forces appropriate and adequate to its needs."  Also, during the winter of 1950-51, the Air Force gave a good amount of attention to proposals for reorganizing military air transport and troop carrier aviation. During maneuvers in April and May 1950 in North Carolina, called Exercise Swarmer, troop carrier and military air transport elements were combined together in a provisional air transport force that was able to drop paratroopers to seize an airhead, to expand the airhead by the landing of transports with reinforcements, and to maintain resupply of troops surrounded by hostile forces.) Sent to J apan to take charge of theater airlift in September 1950, Maj Gen William H. Tunner organized available troop carrier and military air transport units together in the FEAF Combat Cargo Command (Provisional). Citing good experience with this organization, which could handle airborne operations and air-delivered supplies, Tunner proposed on 26 December 1950 that in the interest of both economy and efficiency the Air Force ought to unify all of its air transport organizations.! In October 1950, the Army Field Forces were reported to oppose any move to remove troop carrier aviation from the tactical air forces and to place
