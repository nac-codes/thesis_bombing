In the latter half of 1950, the Continental Air Command, even though it was hard pressed to handle its multitude of duties, remained responsible for air defense matters. Seeking relief from overwork, Lt Gen Ennis C. Whitehead, the commander of the Continental Air Command, urged the Air Force to create a separate air personnel command to handle the mobilization o
