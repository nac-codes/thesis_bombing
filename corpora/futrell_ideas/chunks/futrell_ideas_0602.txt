For the Air Force, the supplemental appropriation included the costs of an expansion from 48 to 58 wings, or the addition of 10 tactical air wings that were mobilized from the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve during the summer of 1950. For the Navy the supplemental appropriation permitted the operation of three additional attack carrier groups, three antisubmarine carrier groups, seven patrol squadrons, and nine attack and ten escort aircraft carriers.  In its postwar planning the Air Force had emphasized a requirement for a minimum peacetime strength of 70 groups and 22 separate, autonomous squadrons. This objective had been stated at a time when Russia did not have an atomic bomb and possessed very little air power. During July and August 1950, however, it was obvious to air planners that 58 wings or even 70 wings would be insufficient to the tasks then confronting the United States. Studies as to the requirements within the Air Force finally firmed up at a figure of 163 wings (138 combat and 25 troop carrier), but Air Force planners feared that a request for such an authorization would be rejected out of hand as the project of air power extremists. In August 1950 Vandenberg accordingly forwarded a requirement to the Joint Chiefs for the augmentation of the Air Force to a strength of 130 wings — 114 combat and 16 troop carrier. Acting at the time of the initial United Nations’ reverses in Korea, the Joint Chiefs on 1 September 1950 approved a buildup of the Air Force to a strength of 95 wings—80 combat and 15 troop car
