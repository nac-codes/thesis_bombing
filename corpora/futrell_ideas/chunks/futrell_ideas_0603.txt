Acting at the time of the initial United Nations’ reverses in Korea, the Joint Chiefs on 1 September 1950 approved a buildup of the Air Force to a strength of 95 wings—80 combat and 15 troop carrier — by 30 June 1954. In the emergency created by the entry of the Chinese Communists into the Korean War, the National Security Council (NSC) on 14 December recommended that the Air Force attain a strength of 87 wings by 30 June 1951 and 95 wings by June 1952.

To cover the additional costs of the Korean War and the expansion of military forces during the balance of fiscal year 1951, funds in the amount of $16.8 billion were approved in the Second Supplemental Appropriation Act of 1951, which became law on 6 January 1951. In the Fourth Supplemental Appropriation Act of 1951, which became law on 31 May 1951, Congress voted the Department of Defense an additional $6.4 billion to cover deficiencies in the pay and support of the increased forces. The appropriation brought the total amount appropriated to the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1951 to $48.2 billion.

In August 1950 Adm Forrest P. Sherman, chief of naval operations, stated that the requirement for a greatly augmented production of military aircraft was even greater than it had been in early May 1940, when the United States had markedly increased aircraft production to meet the needs of an impending World War tg Under Secretary of the Air Force John A. McCone also explained that the Air  317  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 339 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  Force wanted an immediate increas
