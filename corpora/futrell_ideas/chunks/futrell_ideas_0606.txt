In the 95- Sgt oup program, the provision of defense will still be, in my opinion, inadequate.""™~ To bulwark continental air defense, the 95-wing planning called for the rebuilding of 11 Air National Guard wings and their equipment with jet fighter-interceptors.1“  In comparison with fiscal year 1950, when only 1,246 aircraft had been authorized for its procurement, the Air Force’s expanded aircraft procurement funds of fiscal year 1951 permitted it to place orders for 8,578 planes. Included were 44 B-36Hs, 39 RB-36Hs, 532 B-47s, 52 RB-47s, 3,993 jet fighters, 130 RF-84F tactical reconnaissance planes, 22 SA-16A search and rescue amphibians, 231 KC-97 tankers, 656 cargo aircraft, 2,373 trainers, 182 helicopters, and 111 liaison aircraft.!> Even though the procurement program was greatly expanded, the Air Force had not been able to lay down a single new basic aircraft design since 1947, and the fiscal year 1951 procurements did not represent any substantial increases in the state of the aeronautical art. The B-47 jet bombers — ordered in substantial quantities as successors to B-29s—could cruise at 500 miles an hour, but their limited combat range would force them to operate from overseas bases.  The fighter-interceptors that were procured in quantity—the F-89, F-86D, and the F-94—were designed to counter a Soviet Tu-4 capability that probably would not be a major threat after 1954. The only long-range escort fighter that could be provided to the Strategic Air Command was the F-84F, which would have in-flight refueling capabilities. However, because of a pressing requirement for fighter-bombers in autumn of 1951, most of the Strategic Air Command’s fighter-escort wings were reassigned to the Tactical Air Command.  During fiscal year 1951 the Joint Chiefs of Staff were no longer limited by a dollar budgetary ceiling given to them in advance.
