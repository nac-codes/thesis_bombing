d’s fighter-escort wings were reassigned to the Tactical Air Command.  During fiscal year 1951 the Joint Chiefs of Staff were no longer limited by a dollar budgetary ceiling given to them in advance. Instead, as Finletter pointed out,  "as the Air Force went from 48 wings to 95, the number of Army divisions and of Navy warships went up apace. The Division-by-Services method continued to rule."!°7 In June 1950 the Army possessed 10 divisions, but during fiscal year 1951 it was authorized to expand to 18 divisions and separate combat elements equivalent to six additional divisions. The augmentation of the Army reflected war requirements in Korea, but on 9 September 1950 President Truman announced that the Army would send four divisions to Europe to bolster the two divisions that were already assigned to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.1® In fiscal year 1951 the Navy increased its operating force of large carriers from seven to 12 and its force of light and escort carriers from eight to 15. This immediate increase returned reserve fleet units to active service. But, recognizing that converted World War II carriers could not well accommodate the heavier aircraft that the Navy was developing, Congress authorized the construction of a 57,000-ton aircraft carrier that would serve as a prototype for future development. The Marine Corps also increased to a strength of two and one-third divisions and two air wings.  319  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 341 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  Added Requirements for Air Power  In discussing the Department of Defense buildup, Secretary Finletter was convinced that "the time is past when we can any longer go on with the idea that if one service gets something the other services must get, roughly speaking, a like amount."!”° The Air Force accepted the 95-wing program only because it included a broadening of the nation’s industrial base to support a future all-out mobilization. "We believe," Finletter explained, "that we can
