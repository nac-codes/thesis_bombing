es could easily and cheaply achieve qualitative superiority over a technically inept enemy was dispelled by the appearance and performance of MiG-15 aircraft in the air over Korea. 6 Vandenberg pointed out that the Soviet Union had engaged in a forced-draft development and expansion of its air power, with the result that the Red air force not only was quantitatively larger than the US Air Force but also converting to modern jet equipment more rapidly."~’ Speaking "not in prophecy but from facts," General Twining stated that the commander of the Soviet long-range air force had  323  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 345 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  several hundred Tu-4s at his disposal and that a new Soviet bomber of original design had been observed over Moscow in 1951. According to best estimates, the Soviet atomic stockpile would soon reach a level that could critically cripple the war-making capabilities of the United States. In 1950-51 the Soviets also rapidly expanded the radar-intercept and antiaircraft artillery defenses of their homeland. In addition to these augmentations, the Soviets increased the strength of their already powerful tactical air armies. As a result of a prodigious postwar effort plus aircraft remaining from World War II, the Soviet Union had about 20,000 aircraft in organized air units and an equal number in various forms of reserve. 8 Unless the size of the US Air Force and its rate of development were increased, Vandenberg predicted that the narrowing margin of air superiority it held "will shrink to nothing in another 6 years, and control of the air, with all that it implies, will then be within the grasp of the Soviet Union."  After what General Bradley described as "a very long study," the Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded that the Air Force was "assuming more than its share of the calculated risk" and agreed that the United States must increase its combat air power,” More specifically, the Joint Chiefs recommended that the
