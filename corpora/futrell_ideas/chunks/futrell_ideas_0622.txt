y maintained their existing force levels but continued force modernization during the year following 1 July 1952. For the Navy this force modernization included the continued construction of the second large aircraft carrier (the Saratoga) and the start of a second nuclear submarine2 After attaining its 95-wing strength in June 1952, the Air Force began to build toward the 143-wing objective. The controlling factors in the Air Force’s augmentation were the availability of personnel, equipment, and facilities, especially in overseas areas where airfield construction did not go as rapidly as anticipated. At the end of fiscal year 1953, the Air Force possessed 106 activated wings and an authorizeé total strength of 1,019,000.~"° In placing orders for aircraft procurement from fiscal year 1953 funds, the Air Force was affected increasingly by growing inflation—which accounted for an increase in dollar costs of 15 to 20 percent over 1950 levels — and by the high cost of complex modern aircraft.” " Upon meeting its requirement for large conventional strategic bombers, the Air Force ordered no additional B-36s, but placed 500 B-47Es, 65 RB-47s, and 43 RB-52Bs on order for the Strategic Air Command. The RB-52Bs ordered with fiscal 1952 and 1953 funds would later be redesignated as ZB-52Bs. The Air Force ordered 26 B-66Bs, 73 RB-66Bs, 191 B-57Bs, and 80 RF-84Fs for service in tactical air units. It also issued orders for 2,510 jet fighters, 262 KC-97G tankers, 418 cargo aircraft, 1,158 trainers, 193 helicopters, and 20 liaison aircraft.2%  Tactical Air and Air Defense Studies  Following the beginning of hostilities in Korea, Secretary Finletter and other Air Force leaders continued to give first priority to the development of the  327  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 349 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  Strategic Air Command; even though military appropriations were much larger, Finletter ruefully remarked that with the public and within the Department of Defense
