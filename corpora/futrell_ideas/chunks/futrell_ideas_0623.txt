Following the same research pattern that was being used to study national air defense requirements, the secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force early in 1951 asked the California Institute of Technology to study some of the problems of ground and tactical air warfare, especially as they would relate to the defense of Western Europe, and to report suggestions as to how the military establishment might improve its weapons, techniques, and tactics. To accomplish this study, called Project Vista, California Institute’s president Dr Lee A. DuBridge, who served as chairman of the project, and William A. Fowler, who acted as the project’s scientific director, built a scientific and technical staff of 113 members, of whom 39 were from the institute’s faculty. Several retired military officers, including Generals Wedemeyer and Quesada, participated in the nine-month study before it was completed and forwarded to the secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force on 4 February 1952,710  According to the Vista report, "any battle of Western Europe will ultimately be won or lost on the ground." Believing that it would be possible to defend Western Europe successfully prior to 1954, Vista recommended an augmentation of Army capabilities there and the adoptio
