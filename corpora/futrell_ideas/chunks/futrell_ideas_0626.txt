developing a NATO tactical air force — including a tactical atomic air force — and that Great Britain should assume responsibility for the operation of a NATO air defense force, the latter to operate in the zone beginning 150 miles behind the front lines. Vista proposed to recognize air transport and air reconnaissance as missions of essentially equal importance for planning purposes to the classical tactical air power missions of air superiority, interdiction, and close air support. In the initial stage of war, the tactical air force would be concentrated against Soviet air facilities, with secondary importance to be given to attacks against enemy forward supply depots, petroleum-oil-and-lubricant dumps, and high command headquarters. After the air battle had reached a conclusion, Army support operations and interdiction would be of major importance. Since the close integration of air and ground weapon systems would be important, Vista recommended major changes in air-ground doctrine. Although it recommended that the joint operations center at the tactical air force-field army level be retained as an allocating agency, Vista proposed that detailed control functions should be exercised by tactical air direction centers at the corps levels. The project report also proposed that, at a time directed by the supreme commander, approximately one squadron from the tactical atomic air force should be allocated to the mission control of each field army commander to accomplish ground support atomic delivery and reconnaissance missions. This mission control authority was to include  329  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 351 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  detailed target selection, attack timing, and "go" and "no-go" commands. Although the major contention of the report was that a sufficient tactical air force should be built to accomplish basic theater air missions, Vista recommended that the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) should be authorized t
