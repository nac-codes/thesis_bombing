t was that a sufficient tactical air force should be built to accomplish basic theater air missions, Vista recommended that the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) should be authorized to coordinate Strategic Air Command and naval air operations in the NATO theater.7!3 "We believe," Vista concluded, "that the United States, in collaboration with its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, can prevent the military conquest of Western Europe by the Soviet Union—and can do this in 1952 if necessary — if we try." :  According to an understanding between the Air Force and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the university had conducted an initial study, Project Charles, of the nation’s air defense requirements, which were to be further explored at a new electronics laboratory. The Air Force put up the money for the building of physical facilities near Bedford, Massachusetts; the Army, Navy, and Air Force jointly agreed on a charter for the laboratory, designated as Lincoln Laboratory; and the university was to be responsible for the day-to-day supervision of the laboratory. Much of the work of Lincoln Laboratory lay in the development of electronic equipment and techniques; but, in the summer of 1952, the laboratory’s steering committee invited a study panel, called the Summer Study Group, to take a look at air defense problems that might be encountered in the period 1960-70. The Summer Study Group included a number of scientists who had been on the staff of Project Vista. In its report, which was presented simultaneously to the National Security Resources Board and the Department of Defense in late August 1952, the Summer Study Group foresaw no effective defense against intercontinental missiles. However, it believed that the establishment of an air defense "of a kind and scale not hitherto required" could result in the interception and destruction of 85 to 95 percent of such hostile aircraft as might attempt to attack the United States.
