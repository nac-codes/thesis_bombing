an air defense "of a kind and scale not hitherto required" could result in the interception and destruction of 85 to 95 percent of such hostile aircraft as might attempt to attack the United States. Such a defense required three to six hours of early warning of approaching jet aircraft, and the Summer Study Group called for the establishment of a northward defense in depth. Included would be a distant early warning line— or DEW line—of radars to be sited as far north as the 75th parallel. Behind this line would be the double perimeter warning and control network that already was being established. At first the Summer Study Group estimated that the DEW line would cost $370 million plus $106 million in annual maintenance costs, but it later placed a $20-billion price on a total project that would include computerized air direction centers. The group recommended an all-out program to make the expanded air defenses operational by the end of 1954.21 During the summer of 1952, there was evidently some interchange of concepts between the Summer Study Group and the concurrently active Project East River, a civil-defense oriented study jointly sponsored by the National Security Resources Board and the Air Force. This latter study project was administered by Associated Universities, Incorporated, and was headed by Lloyd V. Berkner, a naval reserve captain who had been a member of the wartime Research and Development Board.

Specifically, an hour or more of early warning was required if a civil defense program was to be effective.716  The net effect of projects Vista and East River and of the Summer Study Group was to focus a substantial amount of attention upon the national defense strate
