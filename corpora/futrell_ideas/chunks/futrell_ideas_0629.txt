The reports challenged the Strategic Air Command indirectly. "We raise the question whether," stated Vista,  if the United States prepares to counter Soviet aggression solely through the use of strategic air power, we will not be weakening rather than strengthening the political and psychological positions of the free nations. The Western European nations surely fear that a strategic air attack on the USSR would result in a retaliatory attack on their citiesâ€”and would at the same time not stop the march of Soviet armies before they overran all of Europe. ...

Neither the Summer Study Group nor Project East River had any occasion to be concerned with the Strategic Air Command, but Berkner was critical of the strategic striking force. "The crux of our present danger," he stated,  is in our complete dependence upon the "Strategic Striking Force" as the principal element in our defense.
