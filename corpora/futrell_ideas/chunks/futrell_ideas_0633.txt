is its ability to keep a war from starting by making an attack a difficult and unattractive venture."“! Unlike other Air Force thinkers who assumed that there was a diminishing utility in expenditures for air defense, Maj Gen Frederic H. Smith, now the Air Defense Command’s vice commander, asserted: "There appears to be no leveling off of the curve of cost versus capability which would require the expenditure of enormous sums of money for a small increase in kill. The curve seems to be a relatively straight line, with air defense capability increasing proportionately as additional money is used." As an absolute minimum, Smith urged that sufficient funds should be allocated to provide "that defense necessary to ensure survival of our retaliatory air arm, our industrial potential, and our people’s will to fight. . . . It will be fatal if we rationalize ourselves out of providing a defense Which will assure survival of our offensive forces and the nation’s will to fight." ne  After five months of study in close association with Army, Navy, Air Force, and Weapons Systems Evaluation Group representatives, Doctor Kelly’s Citizens Advisory Committee completed its report in May 1953 and proposed an orderly development of an integrated air defense system for the North American continent. The report emphasized that the principal element of the air defense of the United States, both as a deterrent to war and as a counter to Soviet long-range air power, was the Air Force strategic air arm. It held that an air defense system could best be created by steady technological development supported by a stable and sustained research and development program. It warned that the technical resources for a near perfect air defense were not yet at hand. "So far as can now be foreseen," the Kelly committee reported, "any such level of protection is unattainable and in any case is completely impractical, economically and technically." Even though no system could provide a complete air defense
