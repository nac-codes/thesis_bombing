id, "is this: it is neglected." Looking to 1955, when the Soviets would have an absolute air atomic capability, the Strategic Air Command would need to be widely dispersed at many operational bases and would require a high-speed refueling capability superior to the conventional KC-97 tankers. Although the Air Force had awarded a development contract for the supersonic-dash B-58 Hustler jet bomber in 1952, Finletter felt that the nation was "failing to move as rapidly as we should into the successors of the B-52." There were indications that the Russians might be leapfrogging bomber development from subsonic aircraft equivalent to B-47s and B-52s to a force composed of bombers equivalent to B-58s. If this development were true, the United States would lose its quality advantage over the Soviets in bomber aircraft.â€œ~ In summary, Finletter  334  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 356 --- SOVIET NUCLEAR WEAPONS  recommended that the number one and number two national priorities for defense funds should be assigned to strategic air and air defense. He proposed that the third priority should be given to Army, Navy, and Air Force units needed to provide a force in being in NATO and in the "gray areas," his definition for the Asiatic perimeter running from Turkey to the Aleutians. He recommended that the last priority should be given to other general purpose forces, which would not be needed for A-day tasks but would be useful during the course of a general war or a limited war.2*  Global Air Power and the Korean Armistice  At the start of the Korean conflict in June 1950, General Vandenberg ordered that the Air Force do its best to meet the requirements of the Far East Air Forces, but he insisted that the Korean War be viewed as a part of a global problem rather than as an isolated situation. From the very beginning, the Korean War was fought under the shadow of the global atomic air capabilities of the Air Force, particularly those of the Strategic Air Command. In July
