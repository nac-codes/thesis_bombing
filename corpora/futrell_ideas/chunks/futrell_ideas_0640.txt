mistice negotiations and attempt to seize control of the air. In this event, he argued that Vandenberg should provide the Far East Air Forces with "the  336  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 358 --- SOVIET NUCLEAR WEAPONS  capability to absorb initial Chinese Communist Air Force attacks and immediately launch effective counterattacks." "The Korean war," Weyland concluded, "has demonstrated that air superiority is essential and the key to the success of military operations regardless of the numerical strengths of opposing surface forces and that air air, power is the most efficient weapon" for destroying opposing ground forces.  The Air Staff received Weyland’s requirements for additional forces sympathetically but had to continue to spread limited Air Force capabilities across a global spectrum. The rapid buildup of Chinese Communist air force strength to 1,050 aircraft including 415 MiG-15s posed an admitted threat to United Nations air superiority, but this force appeared to be intended for defense rather than for offense.”*> On the other hand, the buildup of NATO forces was going to be in a crucial stage early in 1952; those forces would be getting large enough to threaten the Soviet Union without being large enough to defend the NATO allies against a Soviet attack. The only way the Air Force could provide Weyland with the four additional fighter wings he required would be to take them from the Air Defense Command, the Strategic Air Command, or projected deployments to the United States Air Forces in Europe. Weyland could not be given the additional B-26 light bombers that he needed to bring his two light bombardment groups to war strength without robbing the night tactical reconnaissance wing and the light bombardment wing that were being readied for deployment to Europe. After studying the competing requirements, the Air Staff decided that in order to augment NATO, the Tactical Air Command would have to have the 49th Air Division with its atomic-capable B-4
