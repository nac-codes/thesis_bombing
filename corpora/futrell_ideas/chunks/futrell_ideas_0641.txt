to Europe. After studying the competing requirements, the Air Staff decided that in order to augment NATO, the Tactical Air Command would have to have the 49th Air Division with its atomic-capable B-45 light bomber and F-84 fighter-bomber wings in place in Great Britain by April 1952. On 17 July, Twining informed Weyland that Japan’s air defense would be augmented by the movement there of one F-84 wing that had been preparing to go to Europe. This action was all that the Air Force could do to meet Weyland’s requirements. "The vital object under the present conditions," Twining wrote Weyland, "is to maintain air superiority over Korea."  Unable to secure the additional air forces that he needed, and faced with the prospect of continuing to wage an air war during the ground stalemate, Weyland could see only two potential employments for United Nations air power. It could either be committed to close support strikes along the front lines where the enemy had dug in and was relatively invulnerable, or it could be concentrated against interdiction targets in the enemy’s rear areas. Weyland favored the latter employment and obtained agreement from Gen Matthew B. Ridgway, the commander in chief, United Nations Command, who was apprehensive that the Communists might take advantage of the respite in ground fighting during the truce negotiations to build up frontline stocks of supplies to be used in launching and sustaining a renewed ground offensive. Lt Gen James A. Van Fleet agreed to the interdiction campaign, provided his Eighth Army received 96 close support air sorties each day. At their headquarters in Korea, the Fifth Air Force and the Eighth Army collaborated in planning a comprehensive air interdiction campaign against North Korea’s railways.
