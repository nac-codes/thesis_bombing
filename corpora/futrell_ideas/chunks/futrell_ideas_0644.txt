22 October, however, Vandenberg directed the Air Defense Command to send 75 F-86s to Korea; on 1 December the Fifth Air Forceâ€™s second F-86 wing went into action. In mid-December the Communists abruptly abandoned their air-superiority campaign. The United Nations Command received reports that the Chinese Reds were moving their experienced air divisions from Antung and replacing them with new air divisions. The Reds had apparently decided to rotate new classes of MiG pilots through limited air operations over North Korea to give them training in active air combat.  After two months of success the United Nations Command comprehensive railway interdiction campaign became less successful. The Reds emplaced a growing amount of automatic weapons along their rail lines and exacted an increasing rate of losses and damages on attacking aircraft. Forced to fly at night and to give their attention to the enemy airfields, the B-29s were unable to keep their bridge targets interdicted. The conversion of the F-80 fighter-bomber wing into an F-86 interceptor wing reduced attack capability. On the ground, Communist rail-repair crews impressed local workers and were soon able to repair damaged rail track virtually as fast as the fighter-bombers could cut it. On instructions from Washington, the United Nations truce negotiators agreed to a proposition whereby the existing battle line would become the line of demarcation in any armistice agreement signed within thirty days after 27 November.

Confident that they had little to fear on the ground, the Reds withdrew troops to rearward positions where they could be supplied more easily, while along the inactive ground front they were able to regulate their supply requirements by varying their expenditures."
