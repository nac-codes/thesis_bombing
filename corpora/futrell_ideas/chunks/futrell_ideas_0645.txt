By the end of December 1951 the Fifth Air Force recognized that the comprehensive railway interdiction program was reaching a point of diminishing returns. On 5 January 1952 Brig Gen James Ferguson, vice commander of the Fifth Air Force, requested authority to attack North Korea’s extensive hydroelectric power generating plants — facilities that had gone virtually undamaged and which were providing power to factories in both Manchuria and North Korea.
