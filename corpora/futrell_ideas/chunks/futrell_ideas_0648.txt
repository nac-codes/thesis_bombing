ginning in July 1952, the United Nations air pressure operations were related closely to the state of the truce negotiations at Panmunjom and, when these were suspended, to diplomatic soundings of Sino-Soviet relations. With Weyland serving as coordinating agent, Far East Air Forces and the Naval Forces Far East aircraft made a massive 1,254-sortie day-long attack against military targets in the North Korean capital city of Pyongyang on 11 July.

At the same time that Sino-Soviet talks were under way in Moscow in late August and early September, United Nations air units prosecuted a series of air attacks against targets near the Manchurian and Siberian borders; on 29 August, these units teamed up for another massive assault against military targets in Pyongyang. When the Moscow talks ended and produced no apparent change in Communist attitudes at Panmunjom, the United Nations delegates suspended further negotiations on 8 October. Seeking to increase military pressure as the truce talks recessed, Clark directed the United Nations Command to intensify air operations, to begin limited ground offensives, and to undertake simulated airborne and amphibious operations against the east coast of North Korea. Begun on 15 October the intensified United Nations operations failed to evoke a response from the Communists. And the Eighth Armyâ€™s attacks against the limited objectives of Triangle Hill and Sniper Ridge touched off a bloody see-saw battle that saw this terrain change hands several times. As a result of these experiences, Clark judged that an amphibious operation against North Korea
