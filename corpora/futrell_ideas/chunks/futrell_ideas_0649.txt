l and Sniper Ridge touched off a bloody see-saw battle that saw this terrain change hands several times. As a result of these experiences, Clark judged that an amphibious operation against North Korea’s eastern coast "would have been most difficult." "We should not unless absolutely necessary," he told General Van Fleet, "initiate another action which may be a repetition of the bloody battle of Triangle Hill and Sniper Ridge.""47  "I concur in the concept," Clark informed the Joint Chiefs of Staff, "that maximum pressure, within the capability of my means and which can be justified by results, should be applied and maintained against the Communists. The capability for such pressure without unacceptable cost, lies in the air arm."~48 As commander of the Army Field Forces, Clark had insisted that an Army field commander should have operational control of the tactical air elements that were provided for the execution of a ground campaign. Looking toward such an organization on 1 July 1952, General Van Fleet proposed that three squadrons of Marine fighter-bombers should be placed under the operational control of the  341  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 363 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  Eighth Army and that these squadrons would be further controlled by the three corps commanders, each of whom would thus have an attached squadron to provide close air support.“"” Despite his earlier arguments, Clark turned down Van Fleet’s proposal. "With a specific job to do," he explained, "I had to maintain an air-ground team working as efficiently as possible,"2° After a careful study, Clark made his views on air-ground operations in Korea known on 11 August 1952. He concluded that "the theater commander, rather than any single service, bears over-all responsibility for successfully prosecuting the Korean war. Each component contributes its own specialized capabilities to the attainment of the theater commander’s overall mission and in so doing assists the other components; how
