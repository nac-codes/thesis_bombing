,672 automatic weapons, and 500 mobile search lights during the winter of 1952-53.~" Several factors, nevertheless, continued to work in favor of the United Nations Command. The Fifteenth Air Force maintained an atomic-capable medium bomber squadron and tanker detachment on continuous alert at Andersen Air Base on Guam. In December 1952, following the arrival of the hostile Il-28s in Manchuria, one of the Fifth Air Force’s most proficient fighter-bomber squadrons was pulled back to Japan to be equipped and trained for the delivery of tactical atomic weapons.>> Early in 1953, moreover, the Fifth Air Force was able to reequip two of its fighter-bomber wings with F-86F fighter-bombers (which could double as fighter-interceptors if needed), thus doubling its air-to-air fighting potential." In spite of their numerical superiority, the Red air forces operated under restrictions; although MiG flight leaders—many of whom were believed to be Russians — were frequently proficient, the majority of MiG pilots were poorly skilled in air combat. Only in the night skies over northwestern Korea during the winter months of 1952-53 did the Reds seriously challenge the operation of Far East Air Forces planes— once again the old B-29s. In November 1952 two Soviet night fighter squadrons operated over northwestern Korea; the FEAF Bomber Command lost five B-29s between 18 November 1952 and 30 January 1953. Vigorous mission study and analysis enabled the bomber command to keep operating. The Fifth Air Force also provided F-94C Starfire and F3D-2 Skynight all-weather fighters to fly cooperative barrier and overhead cover for the B-29s. Had the Reds seen fit to employ electronic-equipped all-weather fighters, they probably could have terminated B-29 operations. As it was, FEAF Bomber Command’s countermeasures were effective and no more medium bombers were lost to hostile night defenses after 30 January 1953.  When the truce negotiations indefinitely recessed in Korea on 8 October 1952, the
