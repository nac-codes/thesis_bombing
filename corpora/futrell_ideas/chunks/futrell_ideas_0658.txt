In writing on the major lessons that emerged from Korea, Weyland stated that:  One thing that should be clear to everyone by now is that air power is indivisible. It can put at risk all important elements of a national structure. Attempts to classify it by types of aircraft, types of operations, or types of targets have led to confusion and misunderstandings. For that reason I have tried to think of it in terms of objectives, threats, and opportunities. The results desired, balanced against threats and opportunities, determine the weight, timing, and phasing of air attacks.  In the FEAF Report, Weyland attributed most interservice problems affecting the employment of air power in Korea to the continuing lack of a properly established joint headquarters at the United Nations Command-Far East Command level.23 On9 April 1951, however, Weyland had been more critical of the lack of an overall theater control for available air power, and he had recommended that the final FEAF war report would carry the lesson that “all aircraft operating in a theater, except those performing Naval missions, be placed under the command of the air commander.”*”4 Although carrier-based air forces represented an important theater air force potential, Navy commanders in the Far East were slow to commit themselves positively to the collateral missions they believed might hinder their ability to maintain control of the seas. Thus, the agreement for air coordination in defense of the Far East theater signed on 26 March 1951 gave the Far East Air Forces air defense commander operational control over all shore-based Navy and Marine fighter aircraft in an air defense emergency. However, it provided that carrier-based fighter aircraft were an integral part of the fleet and no
