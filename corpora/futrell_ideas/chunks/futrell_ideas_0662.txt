used to expedite and improve ground combat procedures in forward areas of the battlefield. In addition to these planes, the Air Force would continue to provide liaison squadrons to support Army units. Based upon experience in Korea, both the Army and the Air Force effected new plans and ordered helicopters in larger numbers. Most Army helicopters were committed as organic aviation, but the Army also planned to establish helicopter transport companies, each able to lift an infantry rifle company. Since it was responsible for air-assault airlift, the Air Force planned to organize assault transport wings, each to include one conventional troop carrier group and one rotary-wing aircraft group. When not employed in air assault work, the helicopter group would accomplish frontline air transport functions. Early in 1951 the Army wanted to secure larger aircraft and helicopters, but the Air Force believed that such planes would infringe upon the Air Force’s air transport mission. Seeking to settle this controversy, secretaries Frank Pace of the Army and Finletter of the Air Force signed an agreement on 2 October 1951 that omitted references to the weight of Army aircraft and stated that the Army would possess organic aircraft required "as an integral part of its components for the purpose of expediting and improving ground combat and logistical procedures within the combat zone." The combat zone was understood to be an area from 60 to 75 miles deep behind the battle line.”®  In view of the Pace-Finletter agreement as well as a demonstrated need for increased Army mobility in Korea, General Ridgway recommended in November 1951 that the Department of the Army should procure enough cargo helicopters to allocate 10 helicopter battalions, each with three companies, to a typical field  348  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 370 --- SOVIET NUCLEAR WEAPONS  army. The Department of the Army was favorable to Ridgway’s proposal, but it approved a lesser allotment order by
