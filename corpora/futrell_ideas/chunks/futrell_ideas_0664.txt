r power lessons, which, albeit, tended to be obscured by the peculiar circumstances prevailing in Korea. The Strategic Air Command demonstrated well the flexibility and versatility of its force by employing medium bomber wings as a tactical bomber force, by committing one of its escort fighter wings for a time to an air-ground attack role, and by rotating fighter wings to the theater for the air defense of Japan. But the local peculiarities of the limited war did not permit a full exploitation of the strategic bombing function. Because of the artificial boundaries of the conflict, most of the production facilities that the Communists used to support their war effort could not be attacked. In the early months of the war, the few war-supporting industries of North Korea were easily destroyed; after this, very few targets could be found that would warrant a medium bomber formation large enough in size to provide the old B-29s with mutual self-protection. Early in the war many Air Force officers chafed at the employment of so-called strategic bombers in tactical air roles and vexed themselves over the question as to whether strategic targets even existed in Korea. General Stratemeyer had occasion to remark that strategic bombers could be freely diverted to ground-support purposes because the B-29s were available and because the ground situation was threatening, but he warned that it should not be assumed that such diversions superseded the real purpose of strategic aircraft. This same admonition held true throughout the war. m0  "There is little doubt in my mind," wrote General Weyland, "that the outcome of the conflict would have been vastly different had enemy domination of the air reversed the positions of the Communists and the United Nations Command.'"*‚Äù  349  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 371 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  At least one Navy officer concluded that the Korean War "clearly demonstrated that land battles can continue to be waged success
