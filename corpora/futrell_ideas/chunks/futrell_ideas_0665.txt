Although the Communist armies proved able to exist in a battle zone covered by conventionally armed United Nations air power, these forces were unable to use their superior strength to accomplish their military objectives. In the autumn of 1950, General Stratemeyer feared that the relative ease with which the Far East Air Forces gained air superiority might lead to an erroneous conclusion that such a feat could be duplicated at will in a future conflict. In the course of the war, a small band of Sabre pilots successfully shielded the United Nations Command against much larger numbers of Communist aircraft. In the course of their barrier patrols, the Sabres met and destroyed 810 enemy aircraft (including 792 MiGs) at a cost of a combat loss of 78 of their own number. But the fact that this smaller Sabre force was able to maintain air superiority had to take into consideration a recognition that the Communists were unable to use their superior air capabilities effectively.  "At any time since possibly the middle of 1951," stated Col James B. Tipton, an experienced Fifth Air Force wing commander, "I have seen no cogent reason why the Red Air Force Commander did not wipe out the United Nations Air Forces opposing him.'"”7!
