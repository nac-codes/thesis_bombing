ined the potential worth of close air support under various battle conditions. "In my opinion," he wrote,  close air support is of little use unless the associated army is ... on the offensive. When the army is holding along a riverline, or waiting for a supply buildup, or for strategic or political decisions to be taken, close air support does little more than keep the state of the art alive. . . . It should and must be used under such conditions as we faced in April and May 1951 when great hordes of Communist Chinese poured in against soft points in our lines. But, given relatively static conditions along a line of resistance, the most effective employment of tactical air is to range forward and seal off the projected battle zone, while maintaining control of the air and conducting long-range interdiction. . . . When the day does come for the all-out attack by our troops, every airplane of every category would participate in breaking the initial line of resistance and getting the offensive underway. From then on close support, close-in interdiction, and airfield sweeps all combine to keep the enemy off balance and to make the offensive an ultimate SUCCESS.  351  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 373 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  NOTES  1.
