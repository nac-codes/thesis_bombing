Under the new regulation no single Air Force agency was empowered to pass judgment on the content of manuals or review the whole field to ensure that manuals provided a comprehensive coverage. At no point in the new system was there a stated requirement for professional editors, writers, or illustrators.

N  Although the Air Force regulation of 26 April made Air Staff agencies responsible for manuals on doctrine, the Air Force, nevertheless, stated on 25 June 1948 that the Air University planning represented "an advance in simplification and condensation of Air Force manuals." Therefore, the Air Staff directed the Air University to continue preparation of the category 1, 2, and 3 instructions and suggested subjects for several specialized administrative manuals that the Air Force would require.“ At this juncture Colonel Carmichael again asserted the need for a single Air Force agency, under the vice chief of staff or able to speak with the authority of the vice chief, to provide a central direction for the planning, preparation, and revision of Air Force manuals.

He thought that the three principal deficiencies in the Air Force publications system — divided responsibility at the top, lack of a master plan, and insufficient professional assistance — sprang from a “lack of appreciation for the prodigious amount of thought and labor required to produce a good manual." "A manual," he said
