defeated by air attack, and it was chiefly concerned with amphibious landings of ground troops at an overseas objective.  Thinking that the armed services must have an agreement on future overseas operations but being unwilling to accept the jointly prepared manual, Maj Gen Otto P. Weyland, assistant chief of air staff for plans, proposed on 29 August 1946 that the Army Air Forces extend the same type of cooperative arrangements accepted in War Department Field Manual 31-35, Air-Ground Operations, to the field of amphibious operations. Following this line of reasoning, the assistant chief of air staff for operations, Maj Gen Earle E. Partridge, prepared a paper entitled "Joint Procedures for Tactical Control of Aircraft in Joint Amphibious Operations," which the Army Air Forces promptly submitted to the Joint Chiefs as its concept of the command and control of air power in joint operations. This paper stated, "The Joint Task Force is normally divided into air, ground, and naval components, each under its own commander. All components of the team are under the Joint Task Force commander who is responsible for the joint effort." In brief, the Air Force paper sought to secure a unity of air action by expanding the joint operations center already being used as the instrument of Army-Air Force cooperation to include a Navy operations section as well as the Army air-ground section and the Air Force combat operations section.  The Army informally concurred with the Air Force position, but the Navy preferred to look upon amphibious operations as a two-phase endeavor in which a fleet commander would command forces afloat and would pass command to the landing force commander when troops were set ashore. The Navy had already published its views in USF-6, Amphibious Warfare Instructions, and it looked upon the Air Force paper as containing "information which is contrary in many points to standard Navy doctrine and to experience gained in World War II." The Navy opposition made
