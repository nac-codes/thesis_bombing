erations."  The expansion of the Tactical Air Command in the late summer of 1950, together with the establishment of the Ninth Air Force (Tactical) at Pope AFB on 1 August 1950, represented an Air Force effort to provide a proper parallel organization with the Army at a working level. According to Maj Gen Willard R. Wolfinbarger, who assumed command of the Ninth Air Force, this "lack of parallel organization for both the Air Force and Army at a common working level has been a serious handicap in the promulgation of Joint Doctrine and in the supervision of Joint Operations to insure adherence to Joint Doctrine." But Wolfinbarger did not think that the new organizational pattern established the Tactical Air Command in a coordinate status with the Army Field Forces. As the primary Army agency for the supervision of operations and training within the zone of interior, the Army Field Forces were able to present the Joint Training Directive to Army service  377  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 399 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  schools and numbered armies as approved joint doctrine that would be taught and practiced. On the other hand, the Tactical Air Command could only present the Joint Training Directive as joint doctrine approved by the command with an expression of "hope that other activities will accept it as such until it can be properly coordinated and made official.""Â°  According to all reports the association between the Tactical Air Force (Provisional) and the V Corps as field agencies of the Tactical Air Command and Army Field Forces was generally harmonious, and General Collins apparently hoped that the establishments in the Pope Air Force Base-Fort Bragg area might grow into a joint center. Obviously moving toward this end in the autumn of 1950, the Army established the Army Airborne Center and the Army Air Support Center at Fort Bragg. These centers were parts of the Office of the Chief of Army Field Forces; each was headed by an Army major general. Go
