s committed to a theater should be prepared (1) to conduct air campaigns to satisfy theater requirements for security against the enemy air force or deployment of enemy ground forces; (2) to participate in such sea and ground campaigns as were conducted by the theater; and (3) to participate according to opportunity in air or sea campaigns charged to forces from outside the theater. Army and Navy forces also were to be committed to theater ground and sea campaigns and to participate in the air campaigns. Any doctrine for command and control of the Air Force — especially the theater air force —had to recognize that the lower the echelon of assignment the more limited would be the objective, hence the more limited the flexibility and usefulness of the air unit to accomplish multiple obligations. Decentralization in the command and control of air power could cause hazards within a theater. "Objection to this decentralization," Barker urged, "should not be considered just a fetish of the Air Force."  After stating the Air University’s concept of the relationship of theater air forces to the whole Air Force — the Air University preferred theater air forces to tactical air forces because the latter term had incurred adverse connotations — Barker made specific objections to the Joint Training Directive. "Basically, our objection to the doctrinal implications of the joint training directive," he explained, "is that it over-simplifies the problem of theater air forces. It leaves the impression that support of ground campaigns is the only reason for being of theater air forces. It implies that the gaining of air superiority is general support to the ground campaign without revealing the thought that the enemy air force is a matter of theater concern regardless of surface campaigns being conducted or contemplated." Making specific reference to several allusions in the Joint Training Directive to the supporting attributes of the tactical air force, Barker observed: "We feel tha
