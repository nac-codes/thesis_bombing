the one hand, and doctrines and principles on the other hand. It is difficult to differentiate between concepts which existed in the minds of some far-sighted individuals in the Air Force and the doctrine which was accepted as official by the War Department. . . . In the field of ideas there is evidently a degree of general acceptance ranging from the first nebulous ideas of an individual, up successively through concepts, doctrines, and principles. The point at which an idea becomes a concept, a concept a doctrine, and a doctrine a principle, is not always clear. Thus at any one time our Air Force doctrine may be said to be partly concept, partly doctrine, and partly principle.  Something of all of these thoughts went into the Air War College recommendations of the actions necessary to secure the results desired by the Air Force Council. General Edwards approved the study and sent it to Washington on 26 September 1951. Edwards recommended that a postgraduate study group be established in the Air War College "to provide a single Air Force agency whose principal objective is to formulate, establish, review, compile and distribute concept and doctrine and to develop officers highly qualified in the study of National Defense needs." The study of concept would "include future USAF positions in and responsibilities for national security and the determination of future USAF objectives." Edwards stated: "Operational doctrine . -. must derive from one common Air Force concept. ... The work of producing and maintaining current Air Force operational doctrine must be kept in harmony with the concept developed and appropriately both tasks should be assigned to the same agency." He noted that the Air Universityâ€™s failure to produce and distribute operational doctrine in the form of manuals was "due to a failure to assign the responsibility of producing and distributing manuals to this one agency of the Air Force." "We do not look upon this as a task," he continued, "which is to
