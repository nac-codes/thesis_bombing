On the other, he questioned the Air University’s statement of the national objectives, especially one which stated that the United States would "prevent any unacceptably dangerous increase in strength by a probable enemy." Craig pointed out that this objective, if it were true, would justify preventive war.! The Tactical Air Command’s USAF Air-Ground Operations School found the manual to be "a Doctrinaire statement rather than Doctrine." The faculty of this new school suggested:  Each of the three major combat commands presently operate under specific command doctrines, which guide all activities leading to Operational Readiness to fulfill their respective missions. These respective doctrines, which have evolved principally from battle experience, are comparable to basic religious tenets in each command. It is not believed any command would surrender its basic doctrine willingly, or shift from a major to a subordinate role, unless it is consulted beforehand and is prepared to accept as an emergency measure such overriding doctrine.  When it assembled on 8 February 1952, the Air Staff-Air University committee included Cols William B.

This committee took cognizance of all the recommendations made by the Air Staff and by the major commands and completed a draft manual on7 March that Edwards described as "the best of all previous efforts over the past five years."
