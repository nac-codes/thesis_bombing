Any further refinement should be limited to the Air Staff and the final review of the Air Council."”?  While the preparation of the basic air doctrinal manual was proceeding at higher levels, the Air War College Evaluation Staff had begun work on the plan to  389  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 411 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  produce four manuals deriving from the basic manual (theater air operations, air defense operations, air transport operations, and strategic air operations) and five manuals expanding the theater air operations manual (counterair operations, close-air-support operations, air interdiction operations, theater airlift operations, and theater air reconnaissance operations). At the request of the senior Air Force representative on the Joint Amphibious Board, who found himself unable to obtain guidance concerning Air Force positions with respect to joint amphibious operations, the Air University agreed early in 1952 to prepare an additional manual on the subject of air operations in conjunction with amphibious operations.” This series of manuals was a much less ambitious undertaking than the old air employment instructions had been, but the Air University now planned that the Evaluation Staff would produce these operational manuals by working in coordination with the responsible Air Force commands.  After nearly a year’s work on the operational manuals, Colonel Momyer reported some of the difficulties that the Evaluation Staff had encountered:  We have found from this past year of research that the writing of manuals is perhaps one of the most difficult tasks in the field of
