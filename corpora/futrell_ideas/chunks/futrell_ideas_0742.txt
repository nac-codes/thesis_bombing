ssigned in the doctrinal area in November 1952. As a result of this demonstration of deficiency, the Air Force brought the Evaluation Staff up to its assigned strength and desired experience capabilities early in 1953.7’ However, the Tactical Air Command still found it difficult to participate with the Air University in doctrinal endeavors. "As you probably know," General Cannon wrote Edwards on 29 December 1952, "my personal attitude toward the Air University is that it should confine its efforts to teaching, and leave such matters as the development of tactics and doctrine, and the preparation, of Air Force manuals to appropriate field commands and Headquarters USAF. an Both because of the unusual amount of interest in the field of tactical air warfare and because of lingering controversies with the Tactical Air Command, the Air University encountered exceptional difficulty in preparing and teaching a doctrine of theater air operations. The Air University’s contention that the term theater air forces should replace tactical air forces continued to draw opposition. Barker insisted that the use of the term tactical air operations focused student attention erroneously on the command relationship at the tactical air force-field army level. In an extension of the meaning of the term theater air forces, Colonel Momyer asserted that theater air forces could include Air Force tactical air units as well as Marine and Navy air units that might be assigned to a theater. He saw theater air forces as a more inclusive term, and he believed that the commander of the theater air forces ought to have a centralized command authority over all air units assigned to a theater. The Air University emphasized that a numbered tactical air force associated with a field army not only provided close combat air support to that particular field army but also participated in the counter air force and large-scale air interdiction operations under orders from the theater air force commander.” Ear
