lose combat air support to that particular field army but also participated in the counter air force and large-scale air interdiction operations under orders from the theater air force commander.” Early in June 1952 Barker’s explanation of the matter resulted in the withdrawal of an Air Force recommendation that the Air University return to the use of "tactical air force" instead of "theater air force."!° In a conversation with Barker in February 1953, however, General Kuter, then Air Force deputy chief of staff for personnel, once again brought up the subject of theater air operations, which the Air University conceived would be conducted under the central command of an area or a theater commander. Kuter was concerned lest the term area commander might be construed to mean an infantry division, corps, or army commander; he  391  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 413 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  argued in favor of continuing the use of strategic, tactical, and air defense. Barker was willing to delete references to the area commander, but he insisted that "the use of the words ‘strategic’ and ‘tactical’ hereinafter referred to as ‘them words’ has tended to compartment our operations." He continued, "The basic difficulty is the impossibility of finely defining ‘them words.’ We try to stress the need for unity of effort, singleness of purpose of all air forces, and find it difficult to do so if we divide operations into classes which are designated by undefinable words."  The Tactical Air Command did not like the term theater air forces and was skeptical of the Air University’s emphasis on the unity of air power; nevertheless, Cannon and Barker were able to achieve a meeting of mirids on some other basic concepts. As written in July 1948, the Air University’s draft of the air employment instructions manual entitled "Air Power and the US Air Force" had defined air superiority as "that degree of capability of one force over another which permits the conduct
