draft of the air employment instructions manual entitled "Air Power and the US Air Force" had defined air superiority as "that degree of capability of one force over another which permits the conduct of air operations by the former at a given time and place without prohibitive interference by the opposing air force. Air superiority is local and possibly temporary.‚Äù Early in 1952, however, Cannon and Barker drafted a paper that pointed out that local air superiority could no longer be accepted as a concept in an era in which the high speeds and long ranges of modern aircraft permitted an enemy to shift air forces quickly and over considerable distances to any target without necessarily changing bases. In view of modern capabilities, Cannon and Barker agreed: "Offensive operations designed to defeat the enemy air force and insure an adequate degree of security from hostile attack should not be limited to restricted areas, nor can they be planned or carried out profitably in an uncoordinated fashion by commanders having limited jurisdiction such as those at numbered air force-field army level."1%  Although the Dictionary of United States Military Terms for Joint Usage specified that the joint operations center manned by the numbered tactical air force and field army was a joint establishment, General Barker vigorously resisted a Department of Army position taken in December 1952 that the joint operations center "would retain over-all control of aircraft for air superiority, deep interdiction, and air defense." He already had made the case that the tactical air force received a part of its mission from the theater air force commander, and he now questioned whether the joint operations center was a joint establishment. Brig Gen Reuben C. Hood, who was commandant of the Air Command and Staff School at the time, pointed out, for example, that the joint operations center had no responsibility for planning ground operations and was actually an Air Force operations center wi
