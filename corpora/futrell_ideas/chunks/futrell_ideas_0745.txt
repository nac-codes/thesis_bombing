Command and Staff School at the time, pointed out, for example, that the joint operations center had no responsibility for planning ground operations and was actually an Air Force operations center with Army personnel present in what amounted to a liaison capacity. "The view," said Hood, "that close support missions are jointly planned and ordered is not believed consistent with practice.

Seeking to pry the manual loose, Edwards on 1 January 1953 reported that the lack of a basic doctrine manual was a major deficiency hampering the Air University’s accomplishment of its mission. This report of deficiency apparently got results since the Air Force director of plans was directed to turn out the manual as a matter of priority; an ad hoc committee within the Plans Directorate composed of Cols Harvey T.

The committee, nevertheless, included a new section discussing air forces and the principles of war
