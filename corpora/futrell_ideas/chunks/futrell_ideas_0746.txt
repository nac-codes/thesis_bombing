his committee’s work as being one of assembling parts of previous draft efforts into a new format. The committee, nevertheless, included a new section discussing air forces and the principles of war — subject matter that had been included in the Air University’s earliest draft of the category 1 "Air Power" manual but which had been subsequently omitted in later drafts because of a feeling that these principles were not a part of basic air doctrine.

Acting in General Vandenberg’s absence, Twining approved the draft on 13 March. However, he directed that comments would be collected on the manual for six months to a year and that it would be revised if the comments so warranted. Upon returning to Washington, Vandenberg also approved the manual.

The dynamic and constant changes in new weapons makes periodic substantive review of this doctrine necessary."  "I am disappointed with it," General Barker stated on 23 March after he had received and studied an advance copy of AFM 1-2. Barker considered that the Air University draft manual submitted on 25 June 1951 had presented "more clearly and more distinctly the why and wherefores of our doctrine" than did the approved manual, and he thought in terms of whether the Air University ought not to publish its own version of basic doctrine for the guidance of its personnel. Barker’s main complaint, however, was the amount of time that had been required to publish the basic doctrine manual. "It has taken the Air Force five tedious years," he pointed out to Lt Gen Thomas D. White, Air Force deputy chief of staff for
