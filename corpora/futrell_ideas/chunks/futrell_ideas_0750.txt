doctrine in broad terms. It was expected that the major commands would prepare command manuals describing how things were to be done.!!? However, the Air Force Directorate of Operations was not entirely satisfied with the operational manuals. Various officers pointed out that the manuals contained "background material . . . superfluous for doctrinal purposes," as well as material pertaining to "procedures and tactics rather than strictly doctrine." The doctrine on the command and control authority incumbent upon a theater air commander was more rigid than the Directorate of Operations believed to be justified. Air Force Manual 1-5, for example, specified that all theater air forces (Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Allied) would be under the operational control of the theater air commander. The Directorate of Operations believed that the theater air commander should have operational control of Navy, Marine Corps, Allied, and Army air forces only when they were conducting operations in furtherance of the theater air mission. Both Air Force Manuals 1-3 and 1-5 adamantly opposed the allocation of the control of aircraft to a surface commander. In the Far East in July 1952, however, Brig Gen Jacob E. Smart had proposed that the Fifth Air Force could allocate mission control over specific air units for a specific length of time to a surface commander (in this case an Army corps commander) who could exercise this control through an air operations officer. After returning from the Far East to become commander of the Tactical Air Command, General Weyland described this concept in a lecture during the summer of 1954. Weyland urged that this concept of last phase of control could give a surface commander the prerogative of designating tasks for specific air units for a specific time in furtherance of his surface campaign. The control of air power was not allocated piecemeal since the theater air commander would have allocated air units for such a purpose only after he had
