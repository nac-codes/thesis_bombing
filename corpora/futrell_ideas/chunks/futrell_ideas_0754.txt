Staff College, Sleeper organized and directed Project Control, which sought to determine whether the Royal Air Force techniques might have been used to advantage by the United States so as to have affected the course of historical events from the 1930s through 1945. Even though it produced 21 volumes, Project Control had not demonstrated fully that Sleeper’s thesis was completely applicable to contemporary national problems. Nevertheless, Project Control contributed to an understanding of the effect of air power on international relations both in times of peace and of war. 0  General Kuter believed that the Air War College Evaluation Staff ought to be made the center of doctrine and concept development. On 27 March 1954, he asked permission of the Air Force to disband the Graduate Study Group and to use its 10 colonel spaces to establish a long-range planning staff parallel to the Evaluation Staff within the Air War College. At first the Air Staff was unwilling to agree that a field agency should have any responsibility for the preparation of Air Force plans, but Kuter explained that the Air University did not intend to impinge on the Air Staff's business but rather to prepare "very long range studies in the field of strategy and doctrine." Evidently reassured, the Graduate Study Group was dissolved and its personnel allotments, which had never been filled, were transferred to the Air War College Evaluation Staff where a Long Range Planning Division was established.!24 Among the officers of the Graduate Study Group so reassigned was Col Richard P. Klocko. In a research study entitled, "Air Power in Limited Military Actions," published in August 1954, Klocko outlined a requirement for a combat-ready air task force that eventually would be developed as the Tactical Air Command’s Composite Air Strike Force. At the same time these changes were in the offing, the Air War College took another step originally  397  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 419 --- IDEAS
