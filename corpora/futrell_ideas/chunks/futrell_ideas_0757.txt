Thus, Giffin concluded that many of the persons who said they did not understand the writing in the draft manual were actually saying that they did not understand the doctrine. Page and Roussel also took note of the fact that the 4,100 words in the manual would be read in 20 minutes, but they suggested that informed readers would have to spend much more time in thinking about the manual than in merely reading it!’ Based on such analyses, the Air University declined to make changes in the style in which the manual was written.
