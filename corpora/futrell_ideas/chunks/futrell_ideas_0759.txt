independent explanation of AFM 1-2, "that control of the air can be exploited continuously, day and night, seven days a week, 365 days a year, under any conditions. This can be so because control of the air does not denote a continuous physical action against something." In an illustration, Page and Roussel drew from the lessons of Korea:  Our air forces in Korea were dropping bombs, fighting MiGs, attacking troops and gun positions, and a great number of other things actively. But these were not "separate" air forces fighting a "separate" war. They were part of our global air entity, and standing with them —although not used actively in Korea —was the tremendous additional power of this global entity. We must assume that much of the impact of our air power in Korea —much ofits influence —came from air forces that never dropped a bomb or fired a bullet in Korea.  In addition to these wartime applications of air power, the Berlin Airlift, the use of air transport planes to give relief from floods in Pakistan in 1954, and the "kinderlift" flights of underprivileged children out of encircled West Berlin for summer vacations in West Germany were illustrations of peaceful applications of air power. "A nation’s influence in international negotiations," the new doctrine states, "is strengthened or weakened by the state of its air forces. The capabilities of powerful air forces for achieving decision in major war are thus translated into a capacity for the maintenance of world peace.  As soon as AFM 1-2 was released, Air Force Magazine published the entire text and called it "one of the most important books in the world. "130 45 Air Force vice chief of staff, General White endorsed the new doctrinal statement because of its clear discussion of the role of air power throughout the entire spectrum of international conflict, because the doctrine established the worth of air forces without denigrating other forces, and because the emphasis of the inclusive nature of air power
