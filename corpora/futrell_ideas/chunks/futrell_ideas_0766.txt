ters were outside the purview of the board. Other attempts of the board to pursue projects were stymied by competition from other commands and by conflicting service positions.  The Tactical Air Command, for example, consistently outpaced the board in stating operational requirements for new equipment. A budding project looking toward the development of a doctrine for employing rotary-wing aircraft in joint operations was terminated when the Army ruled that it would use its own helicopters and had no requirements against which the Air Force should program units. Likewise, after long study, the board proved unable to agree on the subject of acommand structure for a joint airborne operation. 47 The Joint Chiefs of Staff, at the suggestion of the chief of naval operations, had directed the board "to  403  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 425 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  establish joint doctrine and procedures of governing command, employment and control of tactical air forces in support of ground forces." The Tactical Air Command opposed this directive because it believed that the wording of the directive implied that there was no extant doctrine on air-ground operations and because it believed that it could have secured an early agreement with the Army Field Forces for a revision of the Joint Training Directive if the problem had not been referred to the board. As it too was directed to do, the Joint Tactical Air Support Board prepared a draft manual, which included basic agreement between the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps and a dissenting Air Force position. The point in contention was the Air Force demand that the existing system of "unified command at theater level only and coequal status of component commanders at all echelons" should be retained, as opposed to the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps position that advocated that the command of air support aviation be delegated to the supported unit.18  The Joint Landing Board, established initially at Quanti
