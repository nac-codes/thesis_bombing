has only stimulated them to seize for their own element all of the air support which eloquence permits."!62 In negotiations within the Joint Amphibious and Joint Tactical Air Support Boards, Army and Navy representatives argued in favor of what they described as a "unity of command at the scene of battle." Prior to the emergence of air power as a major component of war, Air Force officers were willing to admit that there had been a certain logic to a self-sufficient force concept, but with the increased flexibility of aircraft they were agreed that it was mandatory that control of available air power should be retained at the highest levels practicable. "All of the various proposals advanced in furtherance of the outdated ‘unity of command at the scene of battle’ concept ...," stated the Tactical Air Command, "result in the segmentation and subordination of air power to the relatively localized surface battle despite the costly evolution of the proven centralized control concept."16  That the Army and Navy felt strongly in support of their desire to decentralize air power was also a matter of record. In June 1953 a Navy lecturer criticized the rigidity of Air Force doctrine. "Since local air superiority is temporary or harder to make effective because of greater destructive weapons," he said, "there is a tendency to ignore it... . Time and space factors are not yet instantaneous quantities, and by proper selection of opportunity and location, a force —air or sea—can argue or gain superiority for limited periods." Believing that the Air Force’s constant emphasis on centralization of control might arise from a lack of confidence that the other services might not employ air to its fullest advantages, this Navy lecturer expressed the hope that "as the Navy and Army demonstrate their awareness of air power and its best employment, operational control of air units can perhaps be centralized or decentralized as appropriate to the situation."
