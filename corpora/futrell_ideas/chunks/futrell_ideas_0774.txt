ate their awareness of air power and its best employment, operational control of air units can perhaps be centralized or decentralized as appropriate to the situation." Speaking to the USAF Scientific Advisory Board on 22 March 1954,  407  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 429 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  Lt Gen John E. Dahlquist summed up his view of the local command and control concept favored by the Army. "It is my conviction," he said,  that the commander whom we hold responsible for the land battle must be provided with the means to accomplish his mission and the authority to control those means. In the area forward of the Army rear boundary, the ground force commander must have authority to direct the employment of ground and supporting air and naval weapons simultaneously against his targets. . .. Control must include the authority to assign and suspend air and naval support missions. .. . The tremendous increase in the potential mobility of combat forces... makes the requirement fos command responsibility and decisive action more important today than ever before.  As the joint boards were breaking up, Army Chief of Staff Gen Matthew B. Ridgway announced on 31 January 1955 that the Joint Training Directive for Air-Ground Operations contained views on "command relationships and the responsibilities of supporting and supported forces" that the Army could not accept and that the directive accordingly "does not represent the views of the Department of the Army on doctrine for air-ground operations."1 Instead of resulting in the production of harmonious interservice doctrine, the joint board negotiations appeared to have widened the doctrinal divergencies of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.
