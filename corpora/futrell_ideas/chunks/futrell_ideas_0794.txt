Bradley called "the wrong war in the wrong place" while the Russians prepared to attack in Europe. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) believed that general war with Russia and Europe might be imminent. The Communist invasion of the Republic of Korea showed that the Soviets were willing to employ war as an instrument of aggression; and the Joint Chiefs of Staff looked on mid-1954 as a time of maximum danger. By this time the Soviets would possess a stockpile of atomic weapons sufficient to mount a devastating attack on United States military installations, industry, and population centers. The Soviets had produced enormous quantities of military equipment in 1946-47, and, if it were to be used, this equipment would logically be used in 1954-55 before it became obsolete. The rebuilding of Russian industry and the relocation of much of it beyond the Urals would be largely complete by 1954-55.
