commendations on the force levels to be developed in the next two years.”> Air Force planning was already well developed. General Twining had told a Senate committee in July that the Air Force was going to seek to attain its "ultimate goal of 143 wings," and he had directed the Air Staff to make a root and branch examination of Air Force requirements in the light of new weapons and new machines.” The Air Staff study showed that more powerful thermonuclear weapons would permit some reductions in the strategic air forces, though not substantial cuts since the number of thermonuclear weapons in the stockpile was still small. Substantial cuts could be made in medium troop carrier wings designed  425  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 447 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  for service in theaters of operations, since many Army units were to be returned to a strategic reserve in the United States. Air defense wings would have to be increased. The Air Staff study recommended a program objective of 127 wings in fiscal year 1956, which would be expanded to 137 wings by the end of fiscal year 1957. The 137-wing goal would include 7 heavy bombardment, 28 medium bombardment, 4 heavy reconnaissance, 5 medium reconnaissance, 2 fighter reconnaissance, and 8 strategic fighter wings in the strategic air forces; 34 fighter-interceptor wings in the air defense forces; and 2 tactical bombardment, 4 light bombardment, 21 fighter-bomber, 6 day-fighter, 5 tactical reconnaissance, 4 heavy troop carrier, and 7 medium troop carrier wings in the tactical air forces. In comparison with the 143-wing objective, the 137-wing program represented a reduction of 2 medium bombardment and 1 medium reconnaissance wing in the strategic forces; 1 light bombardment, 1 fighter-bomber, and 6 medium troop carrier wings in the tactical air forces; and an increase of 5 fighter-interceptor wings in the air defense forces.”  Early in December 1953 the Everest committee made its report to the Joint Chiefs
