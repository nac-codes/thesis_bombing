The report contained four separate views as to the force requirements for the following two fiscal years. In view of the split recommendations, as well as their recognition that the probable availability of personnel and money would be the controlling factors in fixing force levels, the individual chiefs were now required not only to analyze their own service needs but to recommend what they thought the other services ought to have. They laid great stress on improving continental defenses, and they laid out in considerable detail a defense program to be accomplished over a period of years. They also made efforts to define a "level-off position in defense forces which could be attained and maintained for an indefinite period of time." The Joint Chiefs accepted the concept that "the United States will emphasize the development of those capabilities for which we are best suited, while our allies will assume greater responsibilities for developing other capabilities for which they are best suited." They recognized that military strategy would need to place greater reliance on a maximum exploitation of atomic weapons, and they accepted the proposition that there would be no time for buildup in a future war.  Although the Joint Chiefs apparently had little difficulty outlining the strategic concepts springing from the NSC New Look directive, they had more difficulty recommending service force levels. At first the Joint Chiefs wished to cut off the Air Force program at 127 wings, to be attained at the end of fiscal year 1956. The Air Force, however, protested that the 127-wing program would have to be differently configured from a program that was conceived as a measured step toa balanced 137-wing program. In the end the Joint Chiefs recommended that the Air Force be
