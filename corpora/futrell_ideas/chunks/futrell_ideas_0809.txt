In the end the Joint Chiefs recommended that the Air Force be authorized to attain 137 wings by the end of fiscal year 1957. They also accepted a revised Navy program whereby the Navy would meet personnel and financial reductions by reducing its auxiliary and amphibious warfare vessels. It would keep 14 attack aircraft carriers and 16 carrier air groups on active service, and in the fiscal year 1955 budget it would receive funds to begin the construction  426  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 448 --- STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS  of a third Forrestal-class aircraft carrier and a third atomic-powered submarine.
