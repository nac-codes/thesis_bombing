that the United States should intervene in Indochina only as a part of a collective effort, that the French should take further steps to give complete independence to Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and that any ground forces employed in the war ought to be indigenous forces. When queried about collective action, the British were unwilling to make any undertakings in advance of the Geneva conference. In Paris on 23 April, French foreign minister George Bidault pled that an American air strike could still save Dien Bien Phu, but neither Dulles nor Radford could now agree with him, since Radford felt that the military situation had deteriorated too far. When Dien Bien Phu surrendered on 7 May, the way appeared open for the Communists to take over virtually all of Vietnam; but, possibly because they feared to go too far and provoke an American response, the Communists settled for less than they might have claimed. In the final Geneva protocol on 21 July, the French agreed to a supposedly temporary division of Vietnam at the seventeenth parallel pending a national plebiscite and the Reds agreed to withdraw their forces from South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.** Some critics of massive retaliation would later state that the policy met an almost immediate defeat in Indochina.*> However, the often critical Thomas K.
