Following closely after Geneva, the new American emphasis upon nuclear weapons and the reduction of manpower requirements permitted a reevaluation of the strategy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) along lines earlier suggested by Great Britain. Under the strategy visualized at Lisbon in 1952, the Strategic Air Command’s nuclear strikes would have been expected to delay a Soviet advance long enough to permit mobilization of the 96 divisions that would be required to stop the aggressor at the Rhine. To most European nations this objective had been too costly in manpower and too limited in scope to be acceptable, they had made little real progress toward fulfilling the program envisioned at Lisbon. In a new assessment of defense requirements in December 1954, the NATO Council resolved that member nations would plan on the use of nuclear weapons from the outset of a war. This decision to stockpile nuclear warheads, which would be readily available for the defense of the alliance in time of need, permitted a reduction in the size of the ground forces thought necessary. Under the new NATO strategy the local defense forces would provide a "shield" at the forward defense line in Europe while air atomic strikes flown by the Strategic Air Command (SAC), the United Kingdom Bomber Command, and American naval forces would provide the "sword." Best described by Gen Lauris Norstad, who became supreme allied commander in Europe in 1956, the NATO strategy included three objectives. "Our first task," Norstad explained  must be to create conditions—and this means by the availability of force—so if an incident should arise ... we could compe
