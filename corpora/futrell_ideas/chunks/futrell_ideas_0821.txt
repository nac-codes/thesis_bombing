expected that the national policy of exploiting air power — arrived at "through long and sometimes halting evolution of doctrine, and through exhaustive study and debate among experts in every field of the military art"— would result in the elimination of the old tendency "to build three self-sufficient services, each planning to win a war with different doctrines."  While Air Force officers were said to have regarded the New Look and massive retaliation as being "a major, strategic reorientation toward war," the implementation of the policy into strategy seemed none too certain. Taking a clue from Smith’s belief that armed service doctrines evolved upward and with general acceptance became "national policy," Col Paul C. Drozremarked that the executive policy of the New Look appeared to have "preceded rather than stemmed from plans and doctrine." 4 Col Wendell E. Carter made this same observation. "While some observers conclude that the dominant nature of air power has now been recognized in national policy," he wrote, "it is relatively certain that the wisdom of this decision (if it has in fact been made) has not fully percolated down to all the subordinates who contribute to planning activities. It is significant, too, that the national policy was set by the president on his own initiative and was not the result of the unanimous advice of his military advisers. This may have put the lid on the pot, but it is doubtful that the fire has been turned off under the bouillabaisse — or that it will be until the services have a more nearly common viewpoint."  Air Force Thinking on Counterforce and Air Power  In his commentary on the meaning of the New Look to the Air Force, General White asserted that the startling advances in the destructive power of air weapons had accentuated old truths: air forces must be combat ready; they must have central direction in order to complement each other (even the best air force, if divided or compartmented, would be vulnerable to piece
