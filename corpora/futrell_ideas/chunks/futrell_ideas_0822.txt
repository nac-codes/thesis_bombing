ated old truths: air forces must be combat ready; they must have central direction in order to complement each other (even the best air force, if divided or compartmented, would be vulnerable to piecemeal destruction); they must have a capability to inflict instant, effective retaliatory punishment upon an aggressor; and they must remain uncompromised in their ability to exercise a wide variety of persuasive actions. White asserted that hostile air forces would always be the primary concern and priority target of the total US air forces.” Gen Curtis E.

At a session of the USAF Board of Review for Tactical Operations in September 1949, Maj Gen David M. Schlatter had observed: "Our Strategic Air Command isn’t any m
