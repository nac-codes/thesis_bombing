argued that the  old counter-industry concept for the Strategic Air Command should be given up. There should be substituted for it what may be called the front-to-rear concept. Under this concept all targets from the enemy’s front lines, through his communication and supply lines, his airfields and storage, back to and including the sources of production and governmental direction would be the objective of Atomic-Air’s attack. In the time of atomic plenty there will be enough bombs to do all this. .. . The first emphasis would be on the enemy’s atomic air, on the fields, installations, planes and missiles from which his atomic attack on us would come. Once these are destroyed the emphasis would shift to the obliteration of the enemy’s military forces, his industry, and his ability to function as an organized state.  In a review of Finletter’s book, T. F. Walkowicz, a member of the USAF Scientific Advisory Board, agreed that mounting Soviet atomic capabilities were making the Soviet air forces rather than the Soviet economy the priority enemy target in the event of a war.” Ina major article published in February 1955 under the title of "Counter-Force Strategy," Walkowicz presented what he considered to be a comprehensive thesis on nuclear warfare. He reasoned that the possession of nuclear weapons by both prospective combatants had rendered obsolete any idea of using a mobilization base in war: either the United States or the USSR would win or lose a war with forces already on hand at the outset of hostilities. Since the United States and the Soviet Union each possessed combat ready forces able to destroy each other, a strategy of bombing cities or factories was impracticable. The United States, however, held a substantial advantage in its possession of a larger stockpile and a wide variety of atomic weapon systems. Walkowicz, therefore, urged that the United States should give priority emphasis to the development of both the Strategic Air Command and theater air fo
