Air Command would remain responsible for an important segment of the retardation missions, the targets SAC was scheduled to attack under the retardation objective were somewhat less than the counterforce concept seemed to contemplate. As a third priority, the Strategic Air Command also planned to systematically destroy the enemy’s war-sustaining resources. Said a SAC spokesman, "their steel plants, their heavy industry, and the goods of war will be destroyed so that they cannot fight." This third-priority task, moreover, would be accomplished almost simultaneously with the higher priority tasks since the Strategic Air Command — unlike the naval and theater air forces, which would retain some reserve of nuclear weapons — was committed to an immediate salvo of its nuclear stockpile as soon as possible after H-hour. Operational concerns had another important effect on the Strategic Air Command’s target planning: many targets fell within several of the common target categories and numerous separate targets commonly were found in the immediate vicinity of population centers. By increasing the size of the weapon delivered, the Strategic Air Command would be able to destroy several separate targets with one successful sortie, thus attaining a "bonus effect" from a single larger weapon.’ ’ At least two other reasons were given for the Air Force’s early hesitation about accepting counterforce as a strategy. The counterforce concept posed a requirement for a very large number of nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles— many more than the Air Force had programmed or could reasonably expect to obtain. 8 The counterforce concept also demanded an accurate identification and location of Soviet forces prior to H-hour. As of mid-1956 the Air Force did not yet have intelligence or reconnaissance capabilities that could provide such exact information.’ The Air Force considered the counterforce strategy to be basically sound and worth planning for, but it could not accept it in all of i
