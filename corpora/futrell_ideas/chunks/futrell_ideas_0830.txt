issance capabilities that could provide such exact information.’ The Air Force considered the counterforce strategy to be basically sound and worth planning for, but it could not accept it in all of its details.  Efforts to Define Air Power  The strategic requirements of the New Look— especially instant reaction to aggression and the corollary concept of instant readiness —touched off an active discussion on the need for the proper understanding of the characteristics of air power. As has been seen, Brig Gen William Mitchell in the early days of American aviation had defined air power as "the ability to do something in or through the air." Following this same dynamic definition, the Air Corps Tactical School had taught: "The air power of a nation is its capacity to conduct air operations; specifically, the power which a nation is capable of exerting by means of its air  437  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 459 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  forces. ... Air power is measured by the immediate ability of a nation to engage effectively in air warfare." ° While early air thinkers generally identified air power with the air striking force, the emphasis in the early 1940s on a mobilization base in the aviation industry led to a broadened definition of air power. Alexander P. de Seversky provided this expanded concept in his book, Victory through Air Power. Being, as he later said, "a Navy man by education," de Seversky adapted Admiral Mahan’s classic definition of sea power for his own purposes. "I automatically said," de Seversky recollected, "that air power means everything. The airplanes, the industries, the men, the materials, everything that produces the power in the air or power to navigate in the air constitutes air power." At the end of World War II Gen Henry H. Arnold accepted this broad definition of air power; in 1955 Air Force Manual 1-2, United States Air Force Basic Doctrine, stated: "The term ‘air power’ embraces the entire aviation capacity of
