nry H. Arnold accepted this broad definition of air power; in 1955 Air Force Manual 1-2, United States Air Force Basic Doctrine, stated: "The term ‘air power’ embraces the entire aviation capacity of the United States."  This broad definition of air power was accepted within the Department of Defense. When he justified reductions in the Air Force in June 1953, Secretary Wilson said that the Air Force’s wing strength was only "a segment of our air power" and asserted that if Navy and Marine air strengths were taken into consideration the "over-all air power" of the nation totaled 152 wings.® Disputing Wilson’s reasoning, General Vandenberg argued that naval air units were committed to a mission of controlling the seas and would not be available to assist with air missions until primary naval functions were accomplished. "In other words," Vandenberg said, "when the bell rings you would not, in my opinion, count upon the Navy to carry out its primary mission if, at the same time, it is required to help the Air Force carry out its own primary mission.""" In December 1953, however, Admiral Radford defined national air power as including the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Army aviation and "the tremendous aircraft industry and civil air transportation systems of the United States."  Believing that the New Look concept of air power as manifest in the fiscal year 1955 defense budget was only "an optical illusion—the same old numbers racket," de Seversky began to change his mind about his definition of air power. In an April 1954 article he pointed out that from its share of the defense appropriations the Air Force "not only has to build an Air Force to fulfill its primary mission to destroy the enemy and to protect the continental United States, but it also has to build an enormous tactical air force, and transport and cargo planes in support of and for use by our Army." De Seversky now maintained that aviation designed to support the Army should be budgeted to the Army
