e that air power if properly used does lie in the Navy as well as in the Air Force, and perhaps eventually in the Army."  Although the discussions of air power appeared academic, the emphasis placed on the unitary nature of national air power stimulated thought about the internal organization of the Air Force. Even though Air Force doctrine had accepted the fact that air units might be placed under diverse air commanders to simplify span of control, it emphasized that air power must not be compartmented but must be wielded as a unitary force for the prosecution of the global air battle. In view of the increasing threat of a Soviet atomic attack by air and the requirement for unitary command and control of air power, there was a question as to whether the Strategic Air Command and the Tactical Air Command (TAC) ought to continue  440  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 462 --- STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS  to be separate establishments. As early as March 1953, Brig Gen James Ferguson suggested that the Air Force was not entirely without blame for prevalent compartmentations of air power. "We have permitted," he pointed out, "internal segregation of partition of air power at a time when technological developments least warrant such action. By such partition we invite the wedge which will split apart such aircraft assigned to TAC for special use as long range artillery at a time when this tactical portion of our air force may very well play an important role in the strategic mission." As has been seen, Finletter proposed in Power and Policy the need for a merger of all air units with atomic weapons under a single command that might be called the strategic-tactical air command or simply sTAc)%  In the postwar years, when no hostile nation had possessed air capabilities sufficient to destroy the United States, General LeMay had been willing to believe that the United States "could afford the luxury of devoting a substantial portion of our Air Force effort to support
