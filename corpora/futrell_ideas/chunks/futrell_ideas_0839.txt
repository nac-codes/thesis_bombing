f effort."2°7 In spite of these beliefs, he took a firm stand against LeMay’s concept of a single offensive force. Weyland favored a single service that would integrate the offensive capabilities of all the armed forces, thus permitting a single-uniform military force to exploit the national air capabilities; but he did not expect to see sucha single service mature in his time. Under the existing command organization, theater commanders had legitimate area responsibilities in which theater air forces assumed major importance for general war and for contingencies short of general war. Unless the Air Force was prepared to risk the danger that forces of the Strategic Air Command might be placed under theater control, Weyland argued that the Air Force must proceed very cautiously toward amalgamating tactical and strategic air forces. "We must face, too," he continued, "the inalterable fact that the forces of the Strategic Air Command are dedicated to a single and inflexible purpose—the prosecution of an all-out war. Their people and their equipment simply are not capable of or familiar with the many contingencies which may arise short of that general conflict." Weyland favored the establishment of a single commander with authority to control or coordinate worldwide tactical air resources. He thought that many of the advantages supposedly inherent in a single commander of an air offensive force could be attained through a centralized authority to direct targeting and to coordinate the timing of all air strikes in case of a general war 2%  In offering his proposal for an air offensive command, General LeMay assumed that the Army would be quick to develop surface-to-surface missiles and to undertake its own close-support and interdiction efforts. Despite General Taylor’s remarks, however, the Army followed a very cautious approach designed to ensure that Air Force support capabilities would be reduced only gradually as Army missile capabilities increased.!” The growth of A
