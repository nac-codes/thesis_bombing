As early as November 1953, Rear Adm Arleigh A. Burke, who would become the chief of naval operations in June 1955, pointed out that the armed services needed anew strategic concept to meet the divergent requirements of "preparation for vast retaliatory and counteroffensive blows of global war and of preparation for the more likely lesser military actions short of global war." Burke visualized naval and air forces capable of coping with special situations and the maintenance of "strategic reserve ground forces—not large—but in a high degree of combat readiness—so trained—constituted and equipped—that they can move immediately into any area to support Allied forces in those military actions which cannot be handled solely by local forces supported by our Naval and Air Force."}97 The Navy was alerted early in 1954 during the Indochina crisis; its aircraft carriers provided a backdrop of strength early in 1955 when the Chinese Communists brought pressure to bear against Quemoy and Matsu.!3° In their force requirements for fiscal year 1956, the Joint Chiefs of Staff raised the Navy’s requirement for attack aircraft carriers from 14 to 15 without, as General Twining noted, specifying what kind of carriers they would be or how large. Early in 1956 Admirals Radford and Burke both pointed out that aircraft carriers could project air power into areas of the world where the United States had no airfields.'*” While Navy officers seldom failed to stress the versatility of sea power in any type of war, the Navy’s concern was manifestly most intense on the problem of a general war. In June 1956 Admiral Burke told the Symington committee that he did not believe that the Soviet leaders would initiate general war, but he hastened to add: "At the same time, you can never count for sure on that.
