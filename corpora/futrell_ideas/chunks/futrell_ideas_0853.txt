s seek to develop political and military stability in free world countries around the Communist perimeter. Since the Soviet Union was the only air adversary who could seriously threaten free world aerial operations and since any extended involvement with Soviet air power would inevitably expand the local conflict, Klocko thought that friendly air superiority could be assumed in limited actions, which would mean that both land-based tactical air units and aircraft carriers could bé freely employed in limited air actions. Sea-based air power promised to circumvent awkward international questions regarding foreign base rights. The effectiveness of air power in limited military actions would vary directly with the degree of organization and centralization of the hostile forces. Klocko pointed out that limited air operations could take many forms such as transportation, destruction, neutralization, blockade, or interdiction. All forms of military forces ultimately might be useful in limited operations; the essential factor was air power’s uniquely rapid ability to deploy to an area of crisis. However, a lack of prior funding had hindered postwar deployments of air power to crisis areas; to minimize such a cause of delay, Klocko proposed that the Air Force should establish and fund a "Ready Air Fleet" within  449  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 471 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  the Tactical Air Command. Based in the United States this ready air fleet would be an integrated self-supporting organization that could immediately deploy to a crisis area and operate until such time as normal operational forces could be moved into the area to augment or replace it 47  After extended correspondence, the Air Force permitted the Tactical Air Command to activate the Nineteenth, Air Force as an operational headquarters at Foster AFB, Texas, on 8 July 1955.\8 In announcing the establishment of what would be called the Composite Air Strike Force, General White pointed out
