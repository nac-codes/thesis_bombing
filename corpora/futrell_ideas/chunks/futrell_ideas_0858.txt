orces of the United States could be called upon to provide forces to resist local aggression and to end it quickly before it could spread. "If we wanted to," he added, "we could even use part of the strategic force for rt jobs like that. It would of course depend upon the area, and the job to be done." 8 Accepting the position that the Air Force as a whole rather than any special part of it would deter or win small wars, Maj Gen John D. Cary, Air Force director of plans, stated in March 1957 that "the Air Force believes that local war is best prevented by the same means as general war." The Air Force, thus, recognized that tactical air forces deployed in overseas theaters might well be the first military force that could be brought to bear on an aggressor and that tactical air forces were cheaper than strategic air forces on a wing-for-wing basis. In any allocation of scarce resources between strategic and tactical air forces, however, the Air Force had to admit that tactical air forces had three disadvantages: tactical air units would be vulnerable because of their proximity to the enemy; the limited range of tactical aircraft would curtail the number of targets they could be programmed against and would hamper their global mobility; and tactical air forces (except for the tactical Matador missile) would lack appreciable all-weather strike capabilities.  Emergence of Flexible Response as a Strategy  When Army leaders began to convert their frame of reference from general to limited war during 1954, they found some comfort in the writings of "unofficial critics of national defense." Gen Maxwell D. Taylor stated that George F. Kennan’s book The Realities of American Foreign Policy and Bernard Brodie’s article "Unlimited Weapons and Limited War" constituted the "first public questioning of the validity of the New Look policy of Massive Retaliation.""” A new version of Army Field Manual 100-5 published in September 1954 gave predominant attention to the Army’s role in
