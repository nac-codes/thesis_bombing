Taylor reasoned that in the approaching era of atomic plenty the Communists will probably be inclined to expand their tactics of subversion and limited aggression." He thought that the military requirements of the United States would be to maintain military technological superiority; a deterrent atomic delivery system capable of retaliation; an effective continental defense system; adequate Army, Navy, and Air Force units capable of intervening in local aggressions; and other ready Army, Navy, and Air Force elements that could reinforce forces deployed abroad in general war or that would intervene in local aggressions. Taylor also called for the development of indigenous defense forces, reserve forces in the United States, stockpiles of material to meet war requirements until wartime production became adequate, and a war production, mobilization, and training base to support an atomic general war. "The acceptance of such priorities of effort," he subsequently observed, "would have resulted in added attention to so-called limited-war forces and would have placed them in virtually equal priority with the atomic deterrent forces."!74  The suggested strategy of flexible response was not acceptable to Secretary Wilson, who considered that the free world had to rely on its collective strength "not only to beat back any local aggression but to deter the aggressor from broadening the conflict into global war." Wilson also believed that the "problem of deterring small wars cannot be considered separately from the problem of deterring war generally" and that the "capability to deter large wars also serves to deter small wars."!‚Äù Since there had been no a
