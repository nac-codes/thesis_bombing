rring small wars cannot be considered separately from the problem of deterring war generally" and that the "capability to deter large wars also serves to deter small wars."!” Since there had been no apparent change in the international situation and since the original New Look program could achieve stabilized combat forces by fiscal year 1957, Wilson announced in October 1955 that there would be no major change in the level of military spending or the size of the military force in the fiscal year 1957 budget. For fiscal year 1957 the Army was thus budgeted for a force of 19 divisions, 10 regimental combat teams, and 144 antiaircraft battalions.!

"I feel," he said, "that we have made a great deal of progress in developing an atomic air deterrent. I think now that our program needs to be bent a little—perhaps more than a little —in order to focus attention on the danger of the small war which seems to me to be coming to the forefront all the time as the greatest danger we are facing." Taylor discounted the assumption that a general war would begin with all-out nuclear attacks. "It seems more likely," he continued, "that a combat situation might be created anyplace around the globe, smoulder for a while with local combat only occurring, and then widening by other factors to the point that the decision is taken—to go for keeps.""Our Army mission," he said, "is to destroy an enemy on the ground anyplace, anywhere." "There is no reason to say," he urged, "that we are hopelessly out-numbered and that our defense on the ground m
