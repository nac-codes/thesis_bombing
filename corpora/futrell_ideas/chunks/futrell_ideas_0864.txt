"Our Army mission," he said, "is to destroy an enemy on the ground anyplace, anywhere." "There is no reason to say," he urged, "that we are hopelessly out-numbered and that our defense on the ground must be obtained indirectly from atomic superiority in the air. I am convinced that our Army, equipped with the weapons which we are now developing and supported by well-trained allies, can maintain deterrent strength on the ground sufficient to hold the Communist armies in check." In 44 countries around the world the United States was assisting its allies in developing more than 200 divisions. In addition to this force, Taylor estimated that an optimum US Army strength based on purely military considerations would be "around 1.5 million men with an active combat force of about 28 divisions."  The Armyâ€™s new concept of limited war was presented to the public at an inopportune time. Believing that no useful purpose would be attained by questioning national strategy, the State Department looked with disfavor ona draft article that General Taylor proposed to publish in Foreign Affairs spotlighting nuclear stalemate and the likelihood of limited Soviet aggressions. The Soviets were clearly building atomic forces rather than ground strength for limited aggressions; they announced a major reduction of 640,000 men in their military force in August 1955 and another cut of 1,200,000 men in May 1956.1 Charged by Secretary Wilson to examine future military requirements for the three years following fiscal year 1957, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met in seclusion at Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico, from 3-9 March 1956, General Taylor introduced his paper calling for the development of flexible response; he later recorded that his colleagues "read this Army study politely and then quietly put it aside." Again, according to Taylor, the Joint Chiefs finally recommended that military programs should continue at approximately current levels for the three years after mid-1957. To maintain such force l
