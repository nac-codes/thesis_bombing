supported from available stocks and facilities, provided some minimum calculated risks were assumed; that a local war could spread into a general war and that failure to make such an assumption could bring about such an expansion; and that the almost infinite variety of possible local war contingencies required the tailoring of effort in the light of specific situations and resultant national objectives. The position paper noted that the Air Force possessed varied forces with adequate backup able to meet many likely local war situations. These forces included the Tactical Air Command, which was prepared to redeploy rapidly by air to participate in local wars with little advance notice, and the Strategic Air Command, which was prepared to participate in local war situations from general war positions to an extent not appreciably affecting its general war posture. These forces were under the control of the Air Force chief of staff and should so remain when used in a local war situation. The composition of air forces initially involved in a local war would generally be dictated by the situation but would consist of the best forces that could be made available at the earliest time.  In an address to the USAF Scientific Advisory Board on 4 December, General White elaborated on the Air Force position and philosophy on local wars. He noted that the national policy toward local wars was to deter such conflicts, but failing that to cope with them successfully. The military contribution to deterrence hinged on three generally agreed essentials: adequate armed force, manifest determination to use the force, and a potential aggressorâ€™s belief that the force and determination existed. "It is the Air Force view," White said, "that just as nuclear delivery capability constitutes a deterrent to general war, so can this total firepower deter local war. The right measure of this total firepower can, in turn, resolve local conflict if we fail to deter the aggression. . .. We deter wi
