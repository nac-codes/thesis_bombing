ffective use of these weapons required new formations, force structures, and tactics.  The new body of literature on the subject of limited war reinforced the Army position on strategy and may well have affected the thinking of Navy leaders. Although the Navy strongly supported strategic deterrence during the early years of the New Look, Navy leaders, following the retirement of Admiral Radford as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 15 August 1957 and the appearance of the Soviet Sputnik on 4 October 1957, became strong advocates of preparedness for limited war.

In an article prepared for publication in Foreign Affairs, which was released on 18 September 1957, Dulles expressed a belief that the development of small and clean nuclear weapons would benefit free world defenses. "In the future," he wrote,  it may thus be feasible to place less reliance upon d
