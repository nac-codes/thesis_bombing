vertheless, desired that the strength of the NATO ground, sea, and air shield forces should be increased. To this end the United States was prepared to make available intermediate range ballistic missiles to the NATO countries and to participate in a NATO atomic stockpile program, whereby nuclear warheads would be deployed under United States custody at agreed upon bases where they would be released to the NATO commanders for employment by nuclear capable forces at the outset of hostilities. NATO units would be equipped and trained to use the nuclear warheads when they were released to them at the appropriate time.

To effect the decisions, the NATO standing group in Washington worked out a plan known as MC 70 that required the creation of a minimum ground force of 30 divisions; these units were to be regarded as essentially nuclear forces. Some 22 of the NATO divisions were to be, available by 1960-61, about halfway through the five years covered by the plan?â€œ Even though this acceptance of the force goals of MC 70  466  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 488 --- STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS  as a planning objective promised to increase the effectiveness with which the shield forces could perform their mission, there would be no relaxation on the requirement for the strategic nuclear deterrent. After its regular meeting in Paris in December 1958, the North Atlantic Council reaffirmed "that NATO defensive strategy continues to be based on the existence of effective shield forces and on the manifest will to use nuclear retaliatory forces to repel aggression."  After reading the Dulles article in Foreign Affairs, General Taylor had great hope that the State Department would support an expansion of the Army and agree "that limited-war forces had the active role to play in future military operations, the atomic retaliatory forces a passive role."
