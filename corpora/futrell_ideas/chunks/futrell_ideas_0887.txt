expansion of the Army and agree "that limited-war forces had the active role to play in future military operations, the atomic retaliatory forces a passive role." When he presented the strategy of flexible response to the National Security Council at a January 1958 meeting, however, General Taylor observed that there was animated conversation, but "Secretary Dulles and his advisers did not provide the strong support for a new strategy which I hoped." Le © Taylor evidently had misread Dulles’s writings and it was soon evident that Dulles continued to think of defense as a combination of collective local defense and strategic retaliation. In an executive session of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 9 January 1958, Dulles made it evident that he was not prepared to endorse a limited-war program that called for large-scale spending and committed the United: States to local defense in peripheral areas. Dulles warned that any attempt to finance the extra military effort by cutting economic aid—as some members of Congress had suggested — would be "reckless folly."  NOTES  1.
