lery even beyond the Wasserfall ground-to-air antiaircraft missile and the V-1 and V-2 offensive projectiles. Arnold believed that the United States had "shown a dangerous willingness to be caught in a position of having to start a war with equipment and doctrines used at the end of a preceding war." In his final war report, Arnold visualized the employment of projectiles that might have velocities of 3,000 miles per hour. Such weapons could be launched from "true space ships, capable of operating outside the earth’s atmosphere."  Genuinely interested in intercontinental air warfare and wishing to initiate new research projects before plentiful wartime funds dried up, Arnold withheld three $10-million items from the Army Air Forces’ fiscal year 1946 procurement budget and committed the money to long-range developmental projects such as AAF Project MX-791, which committed $10 million to the Douglas Aircraft Corporation for a three-year study of future warfare. This contract marked the genesis of the nonprofit Research and Development (Rand) Corporation, which split away from Douglas in 1948. Completed in forced draft on 2 May 1946, a Rand study entitled "Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship" demonstrated that American engineers and engineering skills were capable of orbiting a 500-pound satellite by 195 1.6 Other portions of the fiscal year 1946 funds that Arnold diverted to development were committed to some 26 projects dealing with four categories of missiles: air-to-air for the protection of bomber forces and for use by fighter interceptors; surface-to-air for use against invading aircraft and missiles; air-to-surface as standoff weapons for employment by bombers; and surface-to-surface for use in both short-range tactical and long-range strategic employments.’ ¢  The Army Air Forces planned a wide range of exploratory projects and intended that only those projects that showed definite promise after preliminary study would be continued.”
