ces."4 The first organization dealing exclusively with guided missiles was established early in 1945 by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the purpose of reviewing projects concerned with the development of rockets comparable to the German V-1s and V-2s. The Committee on Guided Missiles existed to review programs and recommend action. Long familiar with the arsenal system of development, the Army Ordnance Department began research on artillery-type missiles at Fort Bliss, Texas, and White Sands, New Mexico, before the end of World War II. A Wac-Corporal research rocket was fired at White Sands in September 1945, and in the autumn of that year Dr Wernher von Braun and about 120 other German scientists were brought to Fort Bliss to assist with experimental firings of captured V-2 missiles. The main objective was a high-altitude research program, but the Fort Bliss group was given an additional task of developing a small research vehicle called the Hermes II. Looking back at his work at Fort Bliss, von Braun would  479  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 501 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  describe the general attitudes as being: "The war is over; let us utilize these interesting new toys that we imported from Europe, and let us put them to use for high-altitude researc n16 Early in 1946, the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics awarded four research contracts for feasibility design studies of space vehicles, and in August 1946 the Naval Research Laboratory contracted with the Martin Company for an improved research version of the German V-2 called the Viking.  Looking toward the coordination of research and development activities the secretary of war and the secretary of the Navy established the Joint Research and Development Board on 6 June 1946 under the chairmanship of Dr Vannevar Bush, who had headed the wartime Office of Scientific Research and Development. The Joint Research and Development Board promptly established a Committee on Guided Missiles.!Â® In view of a further need
