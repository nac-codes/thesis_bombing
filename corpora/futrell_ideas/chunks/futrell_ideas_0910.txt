ush, who had headed the wartime Office of Scientific Research and Development. The Joint Research and Development Board promptly established a Committee on Guided Missiles.!® In view of a further need to clarify arguments as to what the jurisdiction of the Army and the Army Air Forces would be for missile development, the War Department on 7 October 1946 made the Army Air Forces responsible "for the research and development activities pertaining to guided missiles." Three days later the War Department provided that this assignment of responsibility was only research and development and should not be necessarily applicable to the assignment of operational responsibility for such guided missiles as were developed and procured. ° The enactment of the National Security Act of 1947 vested overall review authority for national military research and development in the National Military Establishment’s Research and Development Board. Doctor Bush remained its chairman until 5 October 1948; the Committee on Guided Missiles continued to function as a board activity. In the separation of the Air Force from the Army, the Air Force was relieved effective on 19 July 1948 of its responsibility for the guided missiles research and development program required to accomplish roles and missions of the Army.”  By committing a total of more than $34 million of its fiscal year 1946 funds to research in missiles, the Army Air Forces appeared to have solidly grounded its future on new technology. The decision to award the missile development contracts rather freely also reflected an appreciation of the fact that the United States lacked basic technical knowledge on the subject and that World War II had knocked out Western Europe’s capacity to provide basic technological knowledge for some years to come. 1 Almost at once, however, the most imaginative item of the Air Force research program — the 5,000-mile MX-774 Hiroc intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), whose study contract had been
