to come. 1 Almost at once, however, the most imaginative item of the Air Force research program — the 5,000-mile MX-774 Hiroc intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), whose study contract had been allocated to the Consolidated-Vultee Aircraft Corporation— began to experience problems. As previously noted, Doctor Bush, while testifying before the Senate Committee on Atomic Energy in December 1945, completely discounted the technical feasibility of ahigh-angle intercontinental rocket.“ The technical problem was indeed a large one. The early model atomic bomb weighed a little over five tons and had a half-mile kill radius. The Hiroc would thus have to be a very large missile with an extremely powerful thrust, but even this would not solve the problem of accuracy. The average accuracy possible with a Norden bombsight was 15 mils. Thus, a Hiroc fired from a distance of 5,000 miles could theoretically miss its target by about 75  480  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 502 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  miles. In view of the half-mile kill radius of an atomic warhead, this degree of "accuracy" was not very attractive.  The missile also presented technical difficulties. The specific impulse of the oxygen and alcohol fuels was too low to give the missile a 5,000-mile range. The warhead would encounter very high temperatures when it reentered the earth’s atmosphere. Some scientists suggested that the Air Force was proposing to develop a meteor that would burn upon reentering the atmosphere.“" Based on the technology of 1945 (which many scientists later would declare made Bush’s negative evaluation of the technical feasibility of an intercontinental ballistic missile entirely sound at the time), Bush continued to suspect both pilotless aircraft and guided missiles. In his book, Modern Arms and Free Men, published in 1949, Bush pointed out that the German V-1 pilotless aircraft fired against London had been easily countered. "When the defense dispositions reached their climax,"
