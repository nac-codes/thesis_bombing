development of the very long-range very-heavy bomber as a primary weapon of our long-range striking force but we should, as a wise precaution, spend the necessary experimental funds to insure that we are the first in the field with a long-range guided missile which may be the primary weapon at some future date, but probably not within 15 years."  Although the Army Air Forces (AAF) had assumed that some of the missile projects established in 1945-46 would prove infeasible and would be dropped after a year or two, it was not prepared for the reductions in research and development funding that would occur in fiscal year 1947. As has been seen, the Bureau of the Budget impounded and transferred Air Force research and development funds. In the guided missiles field, the reduction in funds from $29 million to $13 million that took place in December 1946 forced the Army Air Forces to terminate some 11 of 28 guided missile projects, even though it had not received the technical data it needed to make well-advised decisions. The reduction was especially ill-timed because some missile contractors were progressing from a study phase to one of testing small-scale missile mock-ups. In an effort to establish guidelines for a drastically reduced missile program, Maj Gen Benjamin W. Chidlaw, the Air Materiel Command’s deputy commander for engineering, recommended on 6 May 1947 that the Army Air Forces "should concentrate on those missiles which show greatest promise of early tactical availability." Chidlaw envisioned that missile projects should be established for phased development in a relatively few companies, thus reducing a rather high cost arising when a number of companies attempted to expand their engineering and scientific staffs to handle individual projects. Since the 5,000-mile MX-774 intercontinental missile did not promise "any tangible results in the next eight to ten years," Chidlaw recommended that it be deleted from the Army Air Forces program.” In Washington a s
