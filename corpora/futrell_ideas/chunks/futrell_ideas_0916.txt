ile research and development program to the support of a strategic bomber offensive. The reorganization of the headquarters of the Army Air Forces that took place on 10 October 1947 with creation of the Air Force manifested a similar preoccupation with the preparation of a force in being. For the next several years, the policy on guided missiles included the twin precepts that the Air Force would program guided missile units into its forces only after determining the extent to which the guided missile units could supplement or replace manned aircraft units and that guided missiles would be handled like any other piece of Air Force hardware.”! When appropriations were reduced in the spring of 1947, the Air Materiel Command promptly dropped the contract for the MX-774 intercontinental ballistic missile. The Consolidated-Vultee work had arrived, nevertheless, at three important innovations: the use of the missile body as the wall of the fuel tanks as a weight-saving measure, the employment of swiveling rocket engines to provide directional control in flight, and the development of a nose cone that could be separated from the main missile body. Enough money remained when the project was canceled to permit the contractor to test three single stages of the missile during 1948. The results were so favorable that Consolidated-Vultee and its successor, Convair Division of the General Dynamics Corporation, kept the key members of the MX-774 engineering team together to continue studies of ballistic missile systems.°” Following the demise of the MX-774, the Air Force missile program was reduced progressively to the Falcon air-to-air interceptor missile, the Rascal standoff bomber missile, and four pilotless aircraft missiles —the Matador, the Snark, the Bomarc, and the Navaho.  When it became responsible for coordinating military research and development programs in 1947, the National Military Establishment’s Research and Development Board recognized that guided missile progra
