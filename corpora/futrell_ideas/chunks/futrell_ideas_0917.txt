en it became responsible for coordinating military research and development programs in 1947, the National Military Establishment’s Research and Development Board recognized that guided missile programs represented a relatively new technical field in which little was known and took a fairly relaxed view toward service projects that were in some competition with one another. While the Air Force was working on the Falcon missile, for example, the Navy was developing the Sparrow air-to-air missile; the two missiles involved different approaches to the same problem.” In another respect, however, Doctor Bush was less liberal. While the reductions of funds for research and development in fiscal years 1947 and 1948 were a part of general reductions in postwar military appropriations, Bush arbitrarily limited the total defense research and  483  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 505 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  development budget beginning in fiscal year 1949 to approximately $500 million a year. Believing that only so much technical talent was available, Bush insisted that larger expenditures automatically would produce waste and poor results by forcing much research and development work into the hands of mediocre personnel. Dr Karl T. Compton, who succeeded Bush as chairman of the Research and Development Board in October 1948, believed that the Defense Department could spend wisely an annual research and development budget of $650 million a year, but the precedent of the $500-million budget had been set. In fiscal year 1950 the Department of Defense spent about $550 million in research and development, less than four cents out of every dollar appropriated for the defense establishment. :  Facing the need to conserve scarce defense research and development funds and acting under the direction of the secretary of defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff reviewed missile research and development projects in the autumn of 1949. As a result of this examination, primary respons
