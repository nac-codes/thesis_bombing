whether it should attempt to build and staff laboratories for Air Force research. After careful study, Dr Louis N. Ridenour advised Lt Gen Earle E. Partridge, who had taken command on 24 June 1951, that "the primary mission of the ARDC in  486  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 508 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  the field of research is to connect the Air Force with pertinent research being done elsewhere, and to stimulate work that appears to be of direct interest to the Air Force." Expanding on that guidance, Partridge stated that ARDC would handle both research and development "out of shop" when contract operations were proper and feasible. "The ARDC," Partridge stated, "favors contract operations when such contract operations are to the advantage of the US Government."  While the Air Force was expanding its research and development organization, the beginning of the Korean War loosened budget purse strings. The Air Force received $238 million for research and development in fiscal year 1950; annual and supplemental defense appropriations made $522.9 million available to the Air Force for such purposes in fiscal year 1951.47 With more money available President Harry S Truman wanted to see the missile programs move along faster, with special emphasis on the development of defensive missiles. On 30 August 1950, Truman invited K. T. Keller to a conference at the White House and requested that Keller, an experienced engineer, see what he could do to advance the guided missile program. After receiving this presidential mandate, Keller began a 90-day fact-finding tour of the military’s research installations and contractor facilities, including the Army’s Redstone Arsenal at Huntsville, Alabama, where the Army had drawn together its missile research and development from White Sands, New Mexico; Fort Bliss, Texas; and other installations. Keller determined that about 4,000 military and 11,000 contractor personnel were working on missile programs. He concluded that the best
