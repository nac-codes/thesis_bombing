is understanding that highest priorities should be given to the development of air defense missiles, Keller picked out the Nike, Terrier, and Sparrow as programs for expedited development.  487  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 509 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  Speaking of Keller, Dr Wernher von Braun, who had moved to the Redstone Arsenal as director of development operations, recalled: "When he came in things began to move.” Limited toa range of 25 miles, the Army’s Nike-Ajax antiaircraft missile did not significantly compete with the Air Force Bomarc. However, the Army soon began to develop the Nike-Hercules, which would have a range of 75 miles.*° Apparently with Keller’s enthusiastic support, the Army initiated development of the Redstone missile with a range of 450 miles in 1951.°" Although the range of the Redstone was reduced to about 200 miles when it was programmed for a heavy thermonuclear warhead, the success with the program indicated that it would be equally feasible to develop another missile derived from the Redstone that would have a range of about 1,500 miles. Believing that the Army might want to deploy its tactical support missiles far to its rear, perhaps a thousand miles or more, Maj Gen James M. Gavin, who was serving as the Army’s assistant chief of staff for plans and operations, recommended that the Army should seek to develop a 1,500-mile ballistic missile.”  To the Air Force and to the Rand Corporation the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile would serve two useful purposes. It would provide an offensive weapon system, and the boosters employed for the intercontinental missile would also be powerful enough to place military earth satellites in orbit. Even though the Air Force canceled work on the MX-774 Hiroc, General Vandenberg signed a space policy statement on 15 January 1948 that read: "The USAF, as the Service dealing primarily with air weapons — especially Strategic—has logical responsibility for the satellite."
