denberg signed a space policy statement on 15 January 1948 that read: "The USAF, as the Service dealing primarily with air weapons — especially Strategic—has logical responsibility for the satellite."°> Apparently as the result of continued Rand studies, General Saville late in 1950 directed that a long-range rocket study be reinstituted. In view of Convair’s earlier work with MX-774, the Air Force awarded a study contract to Convair on 31 January 1951 to investigate the relative merits of glide and ballistic missiles capable of attaining a 5,500-mile range and carrying an 8,000-pound warhead. This study contract soon was limited to an intensive investigation of a ballistic missile. In view of favorable results reported by Convair and evidence of Soviet progress toward the development of high-thrust rockets, the Air Research and Development Command suggested in March 1952 that the MX-1593 research missile — now called Atlas — be reissued in the form of a general operational requirement for the development of such a ballistic missile. However, the Defense Research and Development Board did not approve the continuation of studies on the missile and development of components for it.  The initial studies of the intercontinental Atlas missile visualized large and heavy atomic warheads. However, in the winter of 1952-53, the Atomic Energy Commission’s advances in the development of new nuclear weapons pointed the way to the design of small high-yield warheads. In December 1952 the USAF Scientific Advisory Board pointed out that the substantially increased warhead yields meant that accuracy requirements and guidance developments could be somewhat relaxed. By the summer of 1953, Convair was able to show that many of the design characteristics of the Atlas could be met by existing technology.
