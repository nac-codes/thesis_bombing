Convair estimated that the Atlas could be made operational by 1962; but, in Washington, General Yates, Air Force director of research and development, called attention to the fact that the Atlas development program would be extremely expensive. Whereas the Air Force had received $525 million in new obligational authority for research and development for fiscal year 1953, the new Eisenhower military budget for fiscal year 1954 allotted only $440 million of new money for such expenditure. "It is extremely important,” Yates ordered in reference to Atlas, "that this expensive program be carried on at a relatively slow rate with increases planned only on the accomplishment of the several difficult phases of the program."  At the same time that the Air Force was making a decision to go slow in developing the Atlas, other events were occurring that would make it necessary to speed it up. Early in 1953, after taking office as special assistant for research and development to Air Force Secretary Harold E. Talbott, Trevor Gardner actively supported the development of an intercontinental missile. Effective on 30 June 1953, Reorganization Plan 6 abolished the National Defense Research and Development Board and the Office of Director of Guided Missiles and vested these responsibilities in a new Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Development. Based on a request received from Gardner, the Department of Defense Armed Forces Policy Council ordered the establishment in June 1953 of a study group of the nation’s leading scientists to evaluate strategic missile programs. To perform this task, Gardner assembled a group of scientists under Prof John von Neumann, which would be known as the Air Force Strategic Missiles Evaluation Committee
