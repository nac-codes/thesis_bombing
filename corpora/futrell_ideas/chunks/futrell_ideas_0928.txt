te strategic missile programs. To perform this task, Gardner assembled a group of scientists under Prof John von Neumann, which would be known as the Air Force Strategic Missiles Evaluation Committee or less formally as the Teapot Committee. Holding the first of three meetings in November 1953, the von Neumann committee undertook to examine both the impact of the thermonuclear breakthrough upon the development of strategic missiles and the possibility that the Soviet Union might be somewhat ahead of the United States in developing ballistic missiles. Later evidence made it apparent that the Soviet Union had addressed itself as early as 1946 to the problem of transporting a 10,000-pound atomic warhead over intercontinental distances. The Soviets had captured the German rocket center at Peenemiinde and had taken many German technicians to the USSR, but these technicians were not permitted to participate in the Soviets’ advanced development programs. The objective of these programs evidently was to design rockets that could boost five-ton warheads over intercontinental distances. By 1953 many of the German technicians were being allowed to return home; they brought reports of the intense Soviet interest in all phases of missile technology. In the course of its investigation the von Neumann committee got four separate and different intelligence estimates, still Gardner noted that the "lump impression . . . is that the Soviets are significantly ahead of us in the strategic missile field.""°  While the von Neumann committee was at work, the Rand Corporation provided it with technical assistance; Rand also prepared an independent report that was transmitted to the Air Force on 8 February 1954. When the von Neumann  489  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 511 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  committee report was submitted on 10 February, it was prefaced by the observation that  unusual urgency for a strategic missile capability can arise from one of two principal causes: A
