PTS, DOCTRINE  committee report was submitted on 10 February, it was prefaced by the observation that  unusual urgency for a strategic missile capability can arise from one of two principal causes: A rapid strengthening of the Soviet defenses against our SAC manned bombers, or rapid progress by the Soviet in his own development of strategic missiles which would provide a compelling political and psychological reason for our own effort to proceed apace. The former is to be expected during the second half of this decade. As to the latter, the available intelligence data are insufficient to make possible a precise estimate of the progress being made by the Soviet in the development of intercontinental missiles, but evidence exists of an appreciation in this field on the part of the Soviets, and of activity in some important phases of guided missiles which it is natural to connect with the objective of development by the Soviet of intercontinental missiles. Thus, while the  evidence may not justify a positive gpatiesion that the Russians are ahead of us, a grave  concern in this regard is in order>  In its review of the Air Force missile program, the von Neumann committee noted that the employment of thermonuclear warheads would permit significant relaxations in requirements for missile thrust and orders of guidance accuracy. The committee concluded that new warheads would make it possible to redesign the Atlas and develop it for operational use in five or six years if the Air Force gave the ballistic missile program overriding priority and centralized directing authority and if the Air Force provided exceptionally competent scientific guidance. Not content merely to limit itself to generalities, the committee made an important study of Air Force research and development management procedures. In developing the B-58 bomber and Matador missile, the Air Force had employed an existing company as the single prime contractor; but the committee stated unequivocally that no si
