ncluding ground support for it, and to recommend operational, logistic, and personnel system concepts for the program. Since procurement and contracting for the Air Force was the mission of the Air Materiel Command, this command on 15 August established the Special Aircraft Project Office (later the Ballistic Missiles Office) on the field location at Inglewood.  Seeking to preserve the scientific talent available in von Neumannâ€™s committee, Gardner persuaded many of the men who had served on this committee to continue to function as the Atlas Scientific Advisory Committee. At a meeting on 20-21 July the committee again considered the weapon system responsibility for Atlas and again recommended that no existing airframe manufacturer, including Convair (which wanted to assume the role of single prime contractor for the Atlas weapon system), was strong enough in scientific depth and experience to discharge prime contractor responsibilities. In August the Western Development Division determined that systems responsibility could be placed either with an airframe contractor, a university laboratory, an Air Force organization, or a specially qualified contractor who would be independent of the contractors supplying missile components. A contractor of the latter type was already in existence: in September 1953 Simon Ramo and Dean Wooldridge, who had done pioneer management work with the Hughes Aircraft Company in developing the Falcon air-to-air missile, had formed the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation. General Schriever was impressed with the new corporation and recommended that it be granted the technical direction and systems engineering responsibility for the Atlas program. After being authorized to take the action on 3 September 1954, the Ballistic Missiles Office negotiated a contract with Ramo-Wooldridge to provide the scientists and engineers needed to analyze complex technical and scientific questions and direct systems engineering for the several associated contractors
