tactical ballistic missile with a range of 1,000-2,000 miles. Schriever feared that the development of a tactical missile would compete for the use of existing test facilities, thereby delaying the Atlas strategic missile. He also suggested that a tactical missile might become a natural fallout from one of the stages of an intercontinental missile.  Early in January 1955 Ramo-Wooldridge provided Schriever with a favorable analysis of the prospects for developing a two-stage, conventional structure intercontinental ballistic missile. On 12 January, Schriever formally asked approval for the alternate strategic missile, pointing out that such a program would provide desirable second sources for subsystems that might be interchangeable between the Atlas and the new missile. By early March the Air Research and Development Command and the Air Materiel Command developed a proposal that went forward to Washington. On 28 April, Secretary Talbott approved a second source for intercontinental missiles, with the understanding that the missile would be constructed well away from either seacoast. The new missile, designated as the XSM-68 Titan, would include a configuration that could be adaptable to exploitation as a tactical ballistic missile. From proposals submitted by several aircraft companies, an Air Force source selection board recommended that the Martin Company appeared best qualified to develop the missileâ€™s airframe. A letter contract was issued on 27 October 1955 authorizing Martin to design, develop, and test the airframe for the two-stage XSM-68 and to plan a program for developing the complete weapon system. The Western Development Division and the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation management team was made responsible for weapon system engineering for the Titan.  Atthe same time that the Air Force directed the Western Development Division to proceed with the Titan, it directed the division to study and evaluate all possible approaches to the tactical ballistic missile.
