e time that the Air Force directed the Western Development Division to proceed with the Titan, it directed the division to study and evaluate all possible approaches to the tactical ballistic missile. In line with this directive, Schriever directed his subordinates to look into earlier research studies concerned with solid-propellant technology. Based on this preliminary work, the Air Force contracted in April 1956 for three studies looking toward the development of solid-propellant rocket motors. During this year both the Tactical Air Command and the United States Air Forces in Europe submitted requirements for a tactical ballistic missile that could be launched quickly in response to a battlefield threat, but the Air Force could not validate the requirements because it had to devote its limited funds principally to the development of the intercontinental missiles. A working group headed by Lt Col Edward N. Hall, nevertheless, put together a concept of a three-stage, solid-propellant missile that possibly could be employed by stages for either tactical or strategic purposes. Such a missile would need to be relatively cheap, available in quantity, and capable of rapid launch from hardened ground silos. Because of this growing Air Force interest in such a second-generation ballistic missile, General Schriever designated the working  492  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 514 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  group in September 1957 as a small weapon system office for what was first called Weapon System Q, later Sentry, and, finally, Minuteman.©  The operational concepts for the Minuteman missile drawn up by Colonel Hall’s group visualized a simple, reliable, rugged missile with a long storage life and simplified maintenance requirements. The missiles could be deployed in underground silos that were spaced far enough apart and sufficiently hardened so that an enemy warhead could destroy no more than one missile. The missiles could be maintained in constant readiness to fire,
