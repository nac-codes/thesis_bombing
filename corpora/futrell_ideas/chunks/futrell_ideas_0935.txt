round silos that were spaced far enough apart and sufficiently hardened so that an enemy warhead could destroy no more than one missile. The missiles could be maintained in constant readiness to fire, and a given complex of missiles could be controlled by an automatic monitoring and launch system. This missile would not be able to carry as heavy a warhead as the Atlas or Titan, but Ramo-Wooldridge argued that "by keeping the missile small and the weapon system cost low, we can more readily afford to size the force so that a sufficiently large portion of the force will survive, irrespective of actions taken by the enemy."  Soviet Threats Speed Missile Development  As late as the spring of 1955, the Eisenhower administration apparently assumed that the Soviet Union would not have the technology to counterbalance American strategic superiority until late in the 1960s. Based on new information, however, the Technological Capabilities Panel of the President’s Science Advisory Committee—called the Killian committee after its chairman, James R. Killian— reported to President Eisenhower on 14 February 1955 a deep concern about the vulnerability of North America to surprise attack. To enable the United States to meet this threat, the Killian committee recommended that the Air Force give top priority to developing intercontinental missiles and that the Air Force proceed with developing intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs). The committee argued that the latter action was essential to the national security. Lending support to the new strategic estimates of the increasing threat to US security, the Soviets displayed enough type-39 heavy jet bombers at the 1955 May Day celebration in Moscow to make it evident that these equivalents of the Air Force’s B-52 had been in quantity production as much as a year earlier than anticipated. In October 1955 the National Security Council accepted much of the Killian committee’s report, which recommended the highest national priority
