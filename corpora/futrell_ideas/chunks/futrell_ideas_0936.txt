y production as much as a year earlier than anticipated. In October 1955 the National Security Council accepted much of the Killian committee’s report, which recommended the highest national priority be extended to the development of the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and additionally recommended that land- and ship-based intermediate range ballistic missiles should be considered essential to the national security. By December, President Eisenhower had assigned highest priorities to the Atlas, Titan, Jupiter, and Thor programs.  In March 1955 General Gavin already had recommended to Gen Matthew B. Ridgway that the Army proceed with the development of a ballistic missile with a 1,500-mile range; however, Ridgway turned the proposal down because he anticipated that the Army could not get the money for such a program.” In November 1955 the Joint Chiefs of Staff studied the matter of intermediate range ballistic missiles and, with Gen Maxwell B. Taylor dissenting, advised Secretary of  493  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 515 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  Defense Charles E. Wilson that the Navy had a valid requirement for a ship-based intermediate range ballistic missile and that the Air Force had a similar requirement for a land-based intermediate range ballistic missile but the Army had no valid requirement for such a capability.” Wilson was unwilling to accept this guidance. On 8 November he ordered that an Army-Navy team work together on an intermediate range ballistic missile that would be modeled largely after the Army’s Redstone rocket and that the Air Force independently develop another intermediate range ballistic missile. Even though he established a Department of Defense Ballistic Missiles Committee to coordinate the separate programs, Wilson frankly expected that interservice competition would continue. Nevertheless, he felt that this interservice rivalry would hasten the development of an intermediate range missile. Wilson realized
