ce in the future," Gardner resigned as assistant secretary of the Air Force for research and development and presented his views in a series of magazine articles early in 1956.” Viewing the Wilson decision in retrospect, Secretary of the Army Wilber Brucker later remarked that giving the Army the authority to develop an intermediate range ballistic missile stirred "another one of the services," which was "not interested except passingly in the IRBM," into immediate action and the competition between these two services accelerated progress on the missile program, with the Army moving forward on some of its plans "a year to a year and a half" earlier than originally scheduled.“ At Redstone Arsenal, Maj Gen John B. Medaris had already been designated to command an expanded Army missile activity in October 1955; the Army Ballistic Missile Agency was officially established there on 1 February 1956. Studies on the Army’s Jupiter missile had gotten under way in  494  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 516 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  the summer of 1955 and, following the Wilson decision, plans to develop the Army IRBM went forward rapidly. The Jupiter would use the same engines that the Air Force had developed for the Navaho booster and that the Air Force would use in the Atlas. Based on the belief that nuclear warheads smaller than those planned for land-based IRBMs and ICBMs could not be made available, the Navy participated in the initial planning for the Jupiter. In September 1956, however, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) advised the Department of Defense that even smaller warheads could be developed. As a result of this information, the Navy sought permission to withdraw from the liquid-fueled Jupiter program to develop a smaller solid-propellant fleet ballistic missile that would be called the Polaris. Wilson gave his approval in November 1956 and the Navy completely withdrew from the Jupiter program on 10 December 1956.” In keeping with the Army’s arsenal concept, t
