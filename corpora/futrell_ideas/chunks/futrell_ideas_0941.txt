on the matter. The Air Force possessed reconnaissance, intelligence, and ancillary capabilities required to employ a 1,500-mile-range missile. As explained by a defense spokesman, a 1,500-mile missile "gets into the strategic mission — strategic as distinct from the tactical part of the battle.""“ Announcing his decisions in a major policy document issued on 26 November 1956, Secretary Wilson ruled that the Army would continue to develop surface-to-surface missiles for the close support of Army field operations but that the Army’s zone of operations would be defined as extending not more than 100 miles beyond the front lines and normally about 100 miles to the rear of the front lines. The dimensions of the Army combat zone, thus, would place a range limitation of about 200 miles on the design criteria for Army missiles. Wilson ordered that operational employment of land-based intermediate range ballistic missiles would be the sole responsibility of the Air Force, that operational employment of ship-based intermediate range ballistic missiles would be the sole responsibility of the Navy, and that the Army "will not plan at this time for the operational employment of the Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile or for any other missiles with ranges beyond 200 miles.""°  Decisions for Production and Deployment  With the exception of the Army’s Nike-Ajax and Redstone, the Air Force’s Matador, and the Navy’s pilotless aircraft called the Regulus, Department of Defense missiles had not progressed beyond the research and development stage by the spring of 1957, Initially because of budgetary limitations and then because of the impact of the Soviet Sputnik, the Department of Defense faced many moments of truth during fiscal year 1958 when decisions had to be made on the acceptance or rejection of new weapon systems that were approaching readiness for production and operational deployment. These decisions would be agonizing at best and the decisionmaking process would be compli
