or rejection of new weapon systems that were approaching readiness for production and operational deployment. These decisions would be agonizing at best and the decisionmaking process would be complicated by interservice rivalry— which, though it may have proved useful in hastening research and development, may have resulted in a maze of claims and counterclaims as to the advantages or disadvantages of particular systems.  496  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 518 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  In July 1958 the Air Force faced the problem of maintaining a force in being that would deter large and small wars, while simultaneously bearing the expense of developing missiles for future employment within a fiscal year 1958 expenditure ceiling of $17.9 billion.™ Monetary considerations forced a sweeping reconsideration of the Air Force missile programs. As has been seen, Air Force developmental planners had assumed in the late 1940s that there would be a gap between the time when piloted aircraft would become obsolete and would be replaced by ballistic missiles; these planners expected that air-breathing pilotless missiles would be valuable weapons in the transitional phase. To meet this latter requirement, the Air Force had put the SM-62 Snark, the SM-63 Rascal, and the SM-64 Navaho under development. Following then current logistical concepts, the Air Force had designated an aviation company as the single prime manager for the Snark, Rascal, and Navaho. The Air Force had intended to pursue a "fly-before-buy" policy, but many factors other than management were involved and each of these programs slipped badly. None of the programs were operational by the middle 1950s. The elapsed time from program approval to the first operational unit deployment of the Snark was 13.4 years. With all-out developmental priorities, including prime weapon systems management by the Western Development Division and Ramo-Wooldridge team and a new concurrency concept of development, the c
