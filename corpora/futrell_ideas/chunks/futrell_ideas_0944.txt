Although it would not be as efficient as a manned B-52, the Snark ensured against a loss of aircrews, had quick reaction time, and could be programmed for low-level attack. Weighing these factors, the Air Force made the decision to reduce the objective of the Snark program from one wing with 120 missiles to a group with 30 missiles; the Air Force scheduled the unit to be activated in August 1959. Technically the world’s first intercontinental missile after its successful 4,400-mile test flight on 31 October 1957, the Snark was considered to be a complement to the manned bomber force since it would compound an enemy’s defense problem.®”  On the basis of the high development priorities that President Eisenhower had extended to the intercontinental and intermediate range ballistic missiles, the Air Force and the Western Development Division — which was designated as the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division on 1 June 1957— assumed that the Atlas, Titan, and Thor would be programmed for full weapon systems development during fiscal year 1958. Alarmed about budgetary ceilings, however, the secretary of defense sent the National Security Council a list of proposed changes in the ballistic missile program. In August 1957 the National Security Council and President Eisenhower concurred in the secretary’s recommendations. In brief, only Atlas would cont
