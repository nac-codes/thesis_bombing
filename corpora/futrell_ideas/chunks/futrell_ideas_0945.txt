f proposed changes in the ballistic missile program. In August 1957 the National Security Council and President Eisenhower concurred in the secretary’s recommendations. In brief, only Atlas would continue in weapon system production, while Titan would continue in a status of alittle more than development. A Defense Department committee would evaluate Thor and Jupiter to determine which would continue in development.® In the summer of 1957, Secretary Wilson promised to make the choice between Thor and Jupiter before retiring from office. This and other decisions, however, were going to be made by Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy, who succeeded Wilson on 9 October 1957, just in time to have to reevaluate US missile programs in the light of the Soviet Sputnik L?  In the aftermath of the Soviet’s successful launch of the world’s first satellite, Secretary McElroy accepted Air Force plans for some acceleration of Atlas production and for programming the activation of nine Atlas squadrons. However, he chose to continue to evaluate the Titan, Thor-Jupiter, and an antimissile defense system. The Thor-Jupiter problem continued to be greatly complicated. In General Taylor’s mind the assignment of operational Jupiter missiles to the Air Force amounted "virtually to killing the Program, because this Army-built weapon has never appealed to the Air Force. "90 General Irvine, on the other hand, thought that the Thor and Jupiter were "about as alike as the Ford and the Chevrolet," and that one but not both of them ought to be selected for production. To produce both would wastefully duplicate training and ground support equipment. Irvine argued that the Thor had been developed with "hard tooling" and was ready for production, whereas Jupiter was still an "experimental and prototype missile. "1 After deliberation, Secretary McElroy evidently felt that the combination of the two IRBM programs would accelerate the accumulation of knowledge in an area where  498  Google  File: ---
