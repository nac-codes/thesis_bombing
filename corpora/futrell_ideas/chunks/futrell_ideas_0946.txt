"1 After deliberation, Secretary McElroy evidently felt that the combination of the two IRBM programs would accelerate the accumulation of knowledge in an area where  498  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 520 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  little background was available. On 25 November he decided that both Thor and Jupiter would be produced for the operational inventory. At this time McElroy directed the Air Force and the Army to produce and deploy four Thor and four Jupiter IRBM squadrons to NATO nations between December 1958 and March 1960.’* This decision did not immediately end the interservice difference over the concept as to whether the intermediate range ballistic missiles should be employed from a fixed, but semihardened emplacement as the Air Force conceived or from mobile field positions as the Army wanted. The Army continued to program Jupiter for field mobility until November 1958, when the Air Force concept prevailed.”  In its post-Sputnik proposals for an accelerated intercontinental ballistic missile program, the Air Force recommended that the Titan be expanded into a full-scale weapon system and that Minuteman be put into development. On 12 December, the Department of Defense gave its approval for a nine-squadron Atlas force and a four-squadron Titan force.”” On 27 February 1958 the Department of Defense also authorized the Air Force to proceed with research and development on the SM-80 Minuteman missile, but DOD now appeared reluctant to proceed with the authorized weapon-system status for Titan possibly because of the expectation that the second-generation Minuteman would prove to be a superior missile. At any rate, the Department of Defense demanded many studies of the Titan as compared with the Atlas. As a result of these studies, which it made during the summer and early autumn of 1958, the Air Force admitted that the cost for the logistical support for two ICBM systems would be about $200 million more than for a single system,
