ich it made during the summer and early autumn of 1958, the Air Force admitted that the cost for the logistical support for two ICBM systems would be about $200 million more than for a single system, but the Air Force maintained that the Titan held many potential advantages. It had more growth potential than the Atlas both for the extension of its range and for an increase in its payload, and the solid-structured Titan promised to provide a better vehicle for space exploitation purposes. Bringing both Atlas and Titan into the combat inventory would provide more missile units in a shorter time and would maintain a larger production base for missiles. Neither Atlas nor Titan had been fully tested, and the Air Force was reluctant to risk the security of the nation by adopting a single system until complete research and development proved it to be irrefutably superior. The task of hardening the Titan promised to be easier than would be the case with the thin-skinned Atlas; Titan would use storable liquid fuel, thus giving it a better reaction time.  Jolted as much as the other military services by Sputniks I and II, the US Navy promptly instituted an independent reevaluation of the Polaris intermediate range ballistic missile program that had gotten under way in December 1956. This program involved the deployment of solid-fuel Polaris missiles aboard nuclear submarines. The Navy originally had planned to have the Polaris-equipped nuclear submarines ready for operations in 1963, but the Navy believed that it would be possible to accelerate the program and move deployment up to 1960. Secretary McElroy approved this accelerated program in early December 1957.6 The Polaris program involved a marriage of solid-propellant missiles that were equipped with lightweight, high-yield thermonuclear warheads, which had not  499  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 521 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  been perfected, with nuclear submarines that would have to be built.
