hermonuclear warheads, which had not  499  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 521 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  been perfected, with nuclear submarines that would have to be built. Still the Department of Defense considered Polaris to be a low-risk program. The lightweight warhead had been guaranteed by the Atomic Energy Commission, the solid-propellant missile had benefited from earlier technology, guidance systems were well under way because of the Atlas program, and the nuclear submarine Nautilus had been at sea for some time. The only uncertainty was whether or not a submarine would be able to launch the Polaris missiles from under the surface of the sea: if this proved impossible it would still be possible for the submarine to "pop up" and launch its missiles.  Interservice Disputes about Antimissile Defense  Only a small suspicious cloud in the early 1950s, a divergence of Army and Air Force concepts of air defense stormed up rapidly with the development of what appeared to be competing technological capabilities but which were actually, as Gen Thomas D. White pointed out, "a disagreement or different point of view on what is the proper and most economical defense, point defense or area defense." As viewed by General Taylor, the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreement of 1949 that allocated primary responsibility for the development of short-range surface-to-air missiles to the Army and Navy was predicated on the understanding that the line of demarcation in air defense research efforts "was that the Army was interested in extending its traditional antiaircraft artillery role, which is largely point defense of vital targets, whereas the Air Force’s legitimate interest was more in the interceptor role, so that the missiles they would go for would perform interceptor-type missions."””  As previously noted, the Air Force discontinued its research on short-range surface-to-air missiles after 1949 and began to put together the semiautomatic ground environment (S
