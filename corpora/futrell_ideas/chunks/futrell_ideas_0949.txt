ptor-type missions."””  As previously noted, the Air Force discontinued its research on short-range surface-to-air missiles after 1949 and began to put together the semiautomatic ground environment (SAGE) systems needed to control an area defense of the United States by fighter-interceptor aircraft and Bomarc ground-to-air pilotless interceptor missiles. Even though an earlier Project Wizard conducted by the University of Michigan Air Research Center revealed no promising technological developments for a defense against a hostile ballistic missile attack, the Air Research and Development Command on 6 July 1953 directed its Cambridge Research Center-Lincoln Laboratory team to prepare a plan (Project Wizard 3) for defense against intercontinental ballistic missiles. Based on the preliminary findings the Air Force awarded three contracts to three aircraft electronic company teams for the purpose of identifying the means needed to detect or identify and to intercept and destroy hostile ballistic missiles. On the basis of these reports, the USAF Scientific Advisory Board concluded that any quick-fix solution, such as the use of modified Talos or Bomarc missiles against hostile missiles, would be greatly expensive and not apt to succeed. Although Wizard 3 did not succeed in its main purpose, it produced important bonus technology in the form of a high-powered radar with a detection range up to 3,000 miles and computers that would permit a quick determination of a ballistic missile’s trajectory.

The production and deployment of the Army’s Nike-Ajax ground-to-air antiaircraft missile beginning in 1953 did not contravene the Army-Air Force understanding about air defense since the Ajax was clearly a point-defense weapon with a range of about 25 miles.
