le who then would have at least a little time to take cover.’” Other than this plan, General White was willing to admit that the nation’s air defenses were not what they should be. "The active air defense," he said, "is a can of worms, to be real honest; there are so many different kinds of weapon systems. We have got the Nike; we have got the Bomarc; we have manned interceptors; we have the radar for not only the early warning but the actual tracking and control of fighters and of Bomarcs."  Expressing a lack of enthusiasm for the area and point-defense concepts of air defense, Secretary McElroy established the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) within the Department of Defense on 7 February 1958 and charged it with providing unified direction and management of the antimissile programs and for outer space projects./!1 Before the establishing ARPA, McElroy already had directed the Air Force on 16 January to continue as a matter of urgency that portion of the Wizard program which would perfect early warning radars, tracking and acquisition radars, communications links between early warning radars and the active air defense system, and the data-processing components required to form an integrated system. Simultaneously, he directed the Army to continue its  502  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 524 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  development effort on the Nike-Zeus as a matter of urgency in order to concentrate efforts on developing a system that would demonstrate the feasibility of achieving an effective anti-ICBM system that could discriminate against electronic countermeasures and decoys. The Army was to limit itself to working on the missile and launch system and to developing of acquisition, tracking, and computer components required for an integrated missile system. In effect McElroy’s directive made the Army responsible for designing an antimissile missile, while the Air Force was charged to create an effective missile detection system.) Although McElroy stat
