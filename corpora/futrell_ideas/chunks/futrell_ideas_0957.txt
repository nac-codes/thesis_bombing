r to be overcome was not of sound, or heat, but of the mind, which is really the only type that man is ever confronted with anyway." Hall noted that the armed services were compelled "to justify their development activities in terms of the economic validity of the gains to be achieved. No new weapon, however spectacular, can really be justified," he said, "unless it promises to perform military tasks at a lower gross cost than will any weapon system preceding 1  At the same time that new weapons had to be justified in terms of lower gross costs, they also had to be justified within the Air Force in terms of operational suitability. To some extent the concept of force modernization made for a dichotomy between operational concerns and the need for combat readiness on the one hand and research and development on the other; this gap was closed only gradually. The original definition of the Air Force guided missile projects in  504  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 526 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  1945-46 was generated by a small group of men within the Air Staff who were almost entirely concerned with an expansion and exploitation of technology. Senior Air Force officers accepted the proposition that the Air Force must develop experimental missiles, but they believed that push-button warfare was far from a reality. In consolidating its missile development projects in May 1947, the Air Force gave priority to missiles that could support or defend against a strategic air offensive. The Air Force also accepted the decision that missiles would be integrated into the force structure as an evolutionary undertaking. This policy required the Air Force "to program guided missile units in addition to its manned aircraft units, and as the effectiveness of the missiles is established the extent to which they will replace or supplement manned aircraft units may be considered."! In spite of this decision, the Air Force did not form operational concepts for missiles until 1952,
