some of its wings while others continued to maintain combat readiness. The success of these procedures, however, demanded that new equipment should be virtually combat ready before it was assigned to strategic air wings.!2? As the result of the requirement established in 1944, the Air Force elected to develop a Boeing six-engine, medium-range B-47 jet bomber. The plane made its first flight in 1947 and entered production in 1948; the Strategic Air Command received the first operational aircraft in 1951. The B-47 became the standard aircraft for replacing the old B-29s and B-50s and equivalent reconnaissance types in the 26 medium bombardment and five medium strategic reconnaissance wings allocated to the Strategic Air Command in the Air Force 137-wing program.  Although design studies had begun in 1945, the Boeing eight-engine, long-range B-52 did not attain a final design configuration until 1950. Produced from a contract issued in February 1951, the first B-52 flew in April 1952. The first operational B-52 was delivered to a SAC combat unit in 1955, and B-52s and RB-52s were programmed to replace B-36s and RB-36s in the seven heavy bombardment and four heavy strategic reconnaissance wings allocated to the Strategic Air Command in the 137-wing program.)?  In the original planning for the 137-wing Air Force expansion, the Strategic Air Command was allocated eight strategic fighter wings and two strategic fighter reconnaissance wings, but how these wings would be employed or what their equipment would be remained in doubt. In March 1951, the McDonnell Aircraft Corporationâ€™s XF-88A won the design competition for a long-range fighter. After substantial modification and redesignation as the F-101A Voodoo, this plane was slated for procurement and delivery to the Strategic Air Command in a fighter and reconnaissance configuration in the 1956-60 time period. What the Strategic Air Command actually wanted was an intercontinental range fighter that could precede bombers to
