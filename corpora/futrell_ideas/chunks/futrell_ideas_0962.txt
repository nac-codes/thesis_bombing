ecember 1954, a Strategic Air Command representative liked the supersonic capabilities of the aircraft but bluntly stated that the plane’s lack of intercontinental range was somewhat less than what SAC desired for a replacement for the B-47 medium bomber. The Strategic Air Command continued to have reservations about the B-58 even after it was first flown in November 1956. Whether the Air Force would order procurement of the relatively expensive B-58 remained in doubt through most of 1957, pending performance tests of the prototype model!  As soon as the B-52 was committed to production, General Power, then vice commander of the Strategic Air Command, requested on 30 March 1953 that for the 1960-65 time period the Air Force undertake developmental studies for a new high-performance intercontinental bomber that should "embody the longest range, highest altitude, and greatest speed (in that order of priority) [possible] in the time period under consideration and consistent with requirements of military payload and defensive systems." Power pointed out that missiles would have to attain a high degree of accuracy and reliability before they could replace or supplement manned aircraft units. He further noted: "Regardless of the missile program, it is the opinion of this headquarters that the continued advance in the art of manned flight to high altitudes and long ranges should be at all times a priority objective of the Air Force’s development program."/93  Even though Air Force aircraft had always utilized petroleum fuels, the Boeing Company, when given a one-year contract to study Power’s request, proposed a new approach to the twin requirements of speed and endurance. The application of nuclear energy had been under study since 1946, and more recent investigations promised to develop a new high-energy chemical fuel. Boeing proposed to develop a nuclear cruise bomber that would utilize high-energy chemical fuel for a high-speed dash. In mid-1954 both the Joint Congress
