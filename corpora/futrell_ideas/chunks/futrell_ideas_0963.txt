d to develop a new high-energy chemical fuel. Boeing proposed to develop a nuclear cruise bomber that would utilize high-energy chemical fuel for a high-speed dash. In mid-1954 both the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy and the Air Force Council were enthusiastic about the importance of  507  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 529 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  nuclear power for aircraft and accordingly included a requirement for extensive studies on weapon system 110A (advanced strategic weapon system), a nuclear cruise-chemical dash bomber. In July 1954, however, the Air Force ordered that as a hedge against the failure of the development of a nuclear power plant, parallel development would be devoted to a weapon system designed only for chemical power. After additional study the Air Research and Development Command in April 1955 effectively divided the two power projects: weapon system 110A became the chemical-powered bomber and weapon system 125A was established for the development of a nuclear-powered bomber.’  In the autumn of 1950 when it became apparent that research and development might soon provide strategic missiles, the Strategic Air Command established a guided missiles project office in its Directorate of Plans. The Strategic Air Command’s criteria for pilotless aircraft were soon stated to be reliability, accuracy, minimum vulnerability, and operational suitability. On 17 August 1951 General LeMay stated that the Strategic Air Command’s policy was "to get into the guided missiles business at the earliest possible date and further to get guided missiles into the war plans at the earliest possible date. These two objectives are to be accomplished without sacrificing combat capability." "It is only by staying ahead," wrote Brig Gen R. M. Montgomery, SAC’s chief of staff, on 2 October 1953, "that we can stay on top." Montgomery, nevertheless, expressed SAC’s concern that the Air Force appeared to want to program the Rascal missile
