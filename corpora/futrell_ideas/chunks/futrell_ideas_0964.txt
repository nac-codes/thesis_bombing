M. Montgomery, SAC’s chief of staff, on 2 October 1953, "that we can stay on top." Montgomery, nevertheless, expressed SAC’s concern that the Air Force appeared to want to program the Rascal missile into SAC’s wings before the Rascal demonstrated any operational capability; he pointed out that SAC could not afford to modify B-36s or B-47s for a capability that appeared to be of questionable operational worth.” In response to an Air Staff request for an exact statement of SAC policy on guided missiles, Montgomery stated on 18 April 1954: "the nature of the mission assigned to the Strategic Air Command by the Joint Chiefs of Staff requires the maintenance of a constant state of combat readiness. This, in turn, established a firm requirement for any weapon system which is integrated into the SAC inventory to possess a proved .and demonstrable combat capability in terms of range, accuracy, and reliability." At this time the Strategic Air Command could see some compatibility between the Rascal and the B-36. However, it believed that, if the B-47s were required to carry the standoff missile, they would be seriously degraded in range and in altitude characteristics. The Strategic Air Command was even more skeptical about the potential operational worth of the Snark: in its existing configuration the Snark appeared to have little potential as an operational weapon system.  In the Air Force in the early 1950s there were predictions that guided missiles would be the "exclusive vehicle for future air war" and that the Soviet Union might skip the jet bomber stage of aircraft development and jump directly into guided missiles. Brig Gen Dale O. Smith argued against the first prediction in November 1953. Smith believed that the art of war would continue to be "a contest of wills, strategy, and quick decision based upon fragmentary information." Only a pilot in a manned air vehicle would be able to appraise situations that could not be predicted in advance.”~” The second predictio
