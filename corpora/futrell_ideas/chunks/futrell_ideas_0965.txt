Only a pilot in a manned air vehicle would be able to appraise situations that could not be predicted in advance.”~” The second prediction appeared invalid when the Soviets  508  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 530 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  gave no signs of skipping jet bombers and developing missiles. On May Day 1954, in the fly-by over Moscow, the Soviet air force openly paraded new Tu-16 Badger medium jet bombers, which evidently were in quantity production, and a single type-37 Bison heavy turbojet bomber, which apparently was a prototype of an intercontinental aircraft needed to attack the United States.!”° Following an Air Research and Development Command briefing on new weapon systems late in 1954, General LeMay accepted the proposition that the ICBM would be the ultimate weapon in SAC’s inventory. However, he asserted that manned bombers would be the primary weapon for a long time to come. He urged the assignment ofthe highest priority possible to the development of weapon system 110A together with penetration aids to include an air-to-surface missile and early development and production of an air-to-surface missile for the B-52. LeMay recommended discontinuation of the Rascal program and elimination of the Snark if it detracted from weapon system 110A."*! In a study prepared for the Air Research and Development Command on 27 May 1955, General Yates described the deficiencies in guided missile programs as tracing back to a superficial recognition at top levels of the government of the potential dominance of missiles and to the relative underemphasis on guided missile development within the Air Force that stemmed primarily from a preoccupation with manned aircraft.  In the spring of 1955 American intelligence continued to be fearful of Soviet aircraft development. At the 1955 May Day celebration in Moscow, the Soviets displayed 13 type-37 Bisons and at least three (some observers counte
