erican intelligence continued to be fearful of Soviet aircraft development. At the 1955 May Day celebration in Moscow, the Soviets displayed 13 type-37 Bisons and at least three (some observers counted nine) turboprop Tu-95 Bear heavy bombers. This display indicated that the Soviets had put the intercontinental Bison into production fully a year before predicted and that the even more formidable Bear also might be in production. At this same air show the Soviets displayed 43 twin-plate, all-weather Flashlight jet interceptors, enough to make it evident that these very dangerous, swept-wing fighters were already operational in air defense units.“? These aircraft sightings demanded an immediate reassessment of Air Force capabilities. The size and composition of the Strategic Air Command had been computed early in 1954 on a wargaming of the then existing JCS target list and expected combat attrition rates. Based ona floating D-day, B-52 production rates were fairly leisurely and were predicated on a 40-hour week without overtime at Boeing’s plant in Seattle. To reduce the potential vulnerability of a single-source production of B-52s the Air Force had already asked for a second source of production. When he received the news of the Soviet aircraft sighted over Moscow, Secretary Wilson acted swiftly to expand B-52 production and to bring a second Boeing plant into operation in government-owned facilities in Wichita, Kansas. In an expeditious action, Wilson secured Eisenhower’s approval for the action within the National Security Council and bypassed the Bureau of the Budget. On 26 May, Secretary Talbott and General Twining appeared in executive session with the Senate Armed Services Committee and received approval for accelerating B-52 production by 35 percent. Emergency budget actions added some $356 million for increased aircraft procurement to the budget for fiscal year 1956.4  509  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 531 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  Even
