dget actions added some $356 million for increased aircraft procurement to the budget for fiscal year 1956.4  509  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 531 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  Even though Secretary Wilson supported the expansion of B-52 production, he announced his opposition to any enlargement of the Air Force beyond its goal of 137 wings by the end of 1956." 5 Since 137 wings had become a magic number representing the ultimate in air power, the Strategic Air Command had to effect changes within its internal force structure in order to schedule more bombers against an expanding target spectrum. Although SAC had programmed seven heavy bomber wings and four heavy reconnaissance wings as separate functions, it quickly determined that the requirement for bombs on targets would be more important than poststrike reconnaissance and secured authority to shift reconnaissance wings into bombardment work on 1 October 1955. This action represented a more than 50-percent increase in long-range B-52 bombardment capability.â€™ As soon as it got operational experience with B-52s, the Strategic Air Command found it feasible in the spring of 1956 to program 45 B-52s per wing as opposed to the former allocation of 30 B-36s per wing. 47 Based on these actions and counting additional planes allotted for combat support and testing, the Air Force ended up with a total authorization for 603 B-52s. jag  In spite of the authorized augmentations of the Strategic Air Command, General LeMay was anything but optimistic when he appeared before the Symington committee hearings on air power in April 1956. LeMay explained that to get the best results from a small number of well-qualified technical personnel, SAC formerly had concentrated its air units on a few air bases. Now LeMay emphasized that SAC would have to expand its base system to reduce its vulnerability. Pending a new wargaming of Soviet capabilities, LeMay was not prepared to say how much larger the SAC force should be
