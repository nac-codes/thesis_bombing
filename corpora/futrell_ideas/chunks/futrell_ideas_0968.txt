asized that SAC would have to expand its base system to reduce its vulnerability. Pending a new wargaming of Soviet capabilities, LeMay was not prepared to say how much larger the SAC force should be but he knew that it should be larger. He wished the Air Force to press forward with the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile, but he doubted that the first models of these weapons could be as efficient as manned bombers. "I think," he said, "it is reasonable to say that the first ICBM will augment the manned bomber force; and at some later date will supplant a portion of the manned bomber force. But I do not believe that in the foreseeable future the ICBM will replace all of the manned bomber force." LeMay urged that the ICBM be developed "with the utmost urgency" and that a follow-on manned bomber to the combination of the B-52 and KC-135 be produced "at the earliest possible time," but "before then," he said, "we need more B-52s.""? In meetings in Omaha and Washington on 6 and 13 June 1956, LeMay and key SAC officers stated the following priorities for production and development: (1) B-52s, (2) B-52s plus penetration aids, (3) weapon system 110A, (4) weapon system 110A plus penetration aids, (5) Navaho, (6) Atlas, and (7) weapon system 125A. LeMay stated that even after the Navaho and Atlas were fully developed, the Strategic Air Command still would require manned bombers to strike the targets designated for it.  Although the basic idea had long been tacitly accepted, the Air Force definitely announced in 1956 that it would adhere to a concept of maintaining a mixed force of manned air vehicles and guided missiles, In an article published in September 1956, Maj Gen Richard C. Lindsay, Air Force director of plans, pointed out that  510  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 532 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  missiles had unique characteristics but were still characterized by relatively large circular error probabilities and would be operationally inflexible onc
