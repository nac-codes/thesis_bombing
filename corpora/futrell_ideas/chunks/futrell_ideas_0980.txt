ssiles would be vitally important. However, because of uncertainties about reliability, accuracy, flexibility of employment, and relative immobility, the use of missiles would be limited, initially at least, to unhardened and accurately located targets. The manned bomber system would provide the only known means of destroying smaller, more fugitive hardened targets that required accurate attacks with high-yield weapons. The manned weapon system would be usable in major conflict, in a limited war with limited weapons, and in lesser conflicts where a simple show  516  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 538 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  of force would be sufficient. "In addition," as Maj Gen James Ferguson, Air Force director of requirements, pointed out,  man provides discretionary capabilities for target discrimination, malfunction correction or override, timely evasion maneuvers and judgment in selection and employment of penetration aids. These attributes, coupled with the bomberâ€™s flexibility of employment (heavy payloads with mixed weapons, intelligence collection, damage assessment, best altitudes, and penetration routes, recallability and recoverability) are important considerations to the probability of success in a strategic campaign.  Speaking of the B-70 and the Atlas in March 1958, Lt Gen Charles S. Irvine, deputy chief of staff for materiel, explained:  We think we need both. We think we cannot afford to pin the hopes of the nation on just one machine and one solution to the military mission. ... From the standpoint... of what it costs to take out a target, it costs you more to take it out with an intercontinental ballistic missile than it does to take out a number of targets with bombers, plus, the fact that you have control of the bomber force. You can start bombers toward the target and call them back. . .. I do not know how to show your teeth with a missile, particularly when you have it in the silos, and you do not want the enemy to know where they are.
