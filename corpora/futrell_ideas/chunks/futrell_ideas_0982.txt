r, did not accept this request as a priority item and accordingly did not include it in the supplemental request for fiscal year 1958 funds.  The subject of aircraft modernization plans for the Strategic Air Command came under debate during the consideration of the military budget for fiscal year  517  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 539 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  1959. Already reduced to a total of 44 combat wings, SAC stood in danger of being "caught with 10-year-old B-47s and B-52s." Since SAC’s B-52 strength was fixed at 11 wings, the B-52 production line at Wichita was slated to close after fiscal year 1958 procurement orders were delivered. The last B-47 was delivered to the Air Force in 1957. The Strategic Air Command also had limited numbers of tankers. While in command of SAC, LeMay had proposed that new KC-135 tankers should match the new B-52 bombers on a one-to-one ratio. However, in view of budget limits and with the expectation that with a little warning some bombers might be able to operate from overseas bases, LeMay reluctantly had agreed with the Air Staff decision to procure B-52s and KC-135s on a three-to-two ratio. Even if the Air Staff had agreed to the one-to-one ratio, moreover, the ratio would have been difficult to attain since the KC-135 was put into production about a year and a half behind the B-52.!*! At a meeting of the USAF Aircraft and Weapons Board in June 1957, aSAC representative continued to reject the proposal that his command be scheduled for six wings of the limited-range, but supersonic B-58s. The board supported the B-58 because it was the nation’s only hope for attaining a supersonic bombing capability prior to 1966 and because it feared that the B-52 might not be able to penetrate hostile defenses in the early 1960s. At another meeting of the board in November 1957, however, the Air Force Directorate of Operations recommended additional B-52s rather than B-58s. General LeMay also indicated that he favored t
