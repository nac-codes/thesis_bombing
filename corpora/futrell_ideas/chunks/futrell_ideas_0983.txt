1960s. At another meeting of the board in November 1957, however, the Air Force Directorate of Operations recommended additional B-52s rather than B-58s. General LeMay also indicated that he favored the B-52 over the B-58 because it could carry more electronic equipment and had an intercontinental range. The Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) had ruled against procurement of additional B-52s, however. On 26 December General White made the final decision that SAC would receive some B-58s, the final number to be determined after operational testing. As a result of these decisions, the Department of Defense budget for fiscal year 1959, submitted to Congress in January 1958, contained no funds for additional B-52s but included the purchase of 47 B-58s at an estimated cost of $796.6 million. This initial order was intended to be a test quantity rather than a production order, and because of increased cost quotations the number of aircraft to be procured had to be reduced to 36 planes. While the budget hearings were in progress, LeMay emphasized that SAC ought to have one KC-135 tanker for each B-52 bomber, but the Air Force continued to program the three-to-two bomber-tanker ratio.182  At least a part of the Office of Secretary of Defense opposition to the procurement of additional B-52s arose from the belief that these planes would be vulnerable to Soviet missile defenses. Early in 1958 two separate developments promised to reduce B-52 vulnerability. The Strategic Air Command demonstrated that it would be feasible to conduct low-altitude attacks with the B-52s, thereby reducing the effectiveness of Soviet antiaircraft defenses. Following the award of a research and development contract on 16 September 1957, moreover, the North American Aviation Company made rapid progress in developing the GAM-77 Hound Dog missile. This turbojet missile would allow B-52s to deliver nuclear warheads against hostile targets or defenses without entering defended areas. The B-52s would be
