in developing the GAM-77 Hound Dog missile. This turbojet missile would allow B-52s to deliver nuclear warheads against hostile targets or defenses without entering defended areas. The B-52s would be able to carry Hound Dog missiles on pylons under their wings, thus  518  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 540 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  augmenting their armament. On the basis of these new developments, the Air Force was authorized to submit an amendment to the fiscal year 1959 budget on 2 April 1958. As subsequently approved by Congress, the amendment authorized the procurement of 39 additional B-52G aircraft at an estimated cost of $300.5 million. With these planes the Air Force was able to schedule one of the B-47 wings for conversion to B-52s, and the purchase order continued production lines in being for a possible 1960 reorder of additional aircraft.!8  When it was tested during 1958, the B-58 Hustler proved potentially useful. Although the supersonic-dash B-58 could not be adapted to air-alert tactics such as were being worked out for the B-52 force, SAC conceived that the B-58s were suited admirably for Reflex operations. They could be deployed rapidly to forward airfields overseas, from which by virtue of their high speed they could get over their assigned targets very quickly. The principal drawback to the B-58 continued to be its high unit cost. To conserve funds, the Air Force Directorate of Operations recommended cancellation of B-58 purchases in August 1958, but by this time General Power was willing to inform General White that "the B-58 is a program vitally important to SAC and the nation."!  In an effort to clear up what appeared to be an apparent indecision as to its requirements, the Strategic Air Command stated on 7 July 1958 that basic Air Force programming ought to pursue objectives designed to modernize the bomber force, attain an effective ICBM capability as soon as possible, secure the aggressive support of research and development of
