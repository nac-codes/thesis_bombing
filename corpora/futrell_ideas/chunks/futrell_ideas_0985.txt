rce programming ought to pursue objectives designed to modernize the bomber force, attain an effective ICBM capability as soon as possible, secure the aggressive support of research and development of the most promising systems for the long term, and attain compatible alert and dispersal programs to ensure maximum response to any situation. At this time SAC criticized "the spoon feeding of many weapon systems in an attempt to satisfy the projected requirements of all agencies." Although it recognized that parallel missile development programs might have been necessary to advance the state of the art, SAC now recommended that the time had come for the immediate termination of such programs as the SM-62 Snark, the GAM-63 Rascal, and the SM-78 Jupiter. In consonance with its force objectives, SAC recommended that the priorities in the procurement of weapon systems should be: (1) KC-135 tankers, (2) B-52G bombers with Hound Dog missiles, (3) B-58 bombers, (4) B-70 bombers, (5) SM-65 Atlas missiles, (6) SM-68 Titan missiles, and (7) Minuteman missiles.! Lending emphasis to this command letter, Power stated in February 1959: "[The] no. 1 priority in SAC—and I am talking about the immediate future and taking full consideration of time — in buying this country military posture of deterrent value, is the KC-135 B-52G combination with the Hound Dog missile."  During the summer and autumn of 1958 the Air Force accepted only a part of the Strategic Air Command’s recommendations. Unable to forecast the exact capabilities of intercontinental ballistic missiles, General White preferred to pursue a somewhat loose bomber procurement program that would add B-52s and B-58s to the SAC inventory in annual procurements, with two wings of B-47s to be retired for each modern B-52 and B-58 wing that could be organized. These annual procurements of modest numbers of B-52s and B-58s would ensure that the  519  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 541 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  pro
