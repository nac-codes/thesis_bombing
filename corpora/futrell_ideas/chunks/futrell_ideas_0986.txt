that could be organized. These annual procurements of modest numbers of B-52s and B-58s would ensure that the  519  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 541 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  production lines were kept open. General Power was not happy with this program. He had conceived that the Strategic Air Command might have to stress an air-alert rather than a ground-alert posture, and he wanted 20 wings of B-52s as soon as possible rather than the stretched out Air Force program. a Although the initial operational date slipped to December 1960, General White wanted to have one squadron with 30 Snark missiles in place at Presque Isle, Maine, because the Snark would be the world’s first operational intercontinental missile and because it would confuse enemy defenses. As SAC had long urged should be done and in view of the fact that it would be phasing out B-47s, the Air Force canceled the SM-63 Rascal program in November 1958; this program had cost $448 million and had not provided a useful air-to-surface missile. Further development on the ground-launched diversionary SM-73 Bull Goose missile — which had cost $136.5 million—was canceled in December 1958. This missile would have been fired while the B-52s were proceeding to their targets and would have compounded the identification problems of Soviet air defense radars; it would not be useful if the B-52s began to operate from an air-alert posture since once launched the missile could not be recalled.!® In a speech delivered in September 1958, General White summed up the Air Force response to the missile crisis. "First," he said,  the missile threat did not invalidate our bomber strike force. For a long time to come, this force with its great range, its capacity to carry nuclear weapons of various size and yields, and its improved electronic countermeasures, could still perform the job it was designed to do. Furthermore, because of the human intelligence factor aboard, the bomber strike force has the added
