missiles," but he thought that in the air defense mission guided missiles "may be capable of taking over a greater percentage of the job than in any of the other areas." Appreciation for the unique qualities of the Matador tactical air missile led to its production and deployment to oversea theaters beginning in 1954. During this same year, the Air Force began research and development on an improved version of this weapon system, which was designated as the TM-76 Mace. Speaking of the Matador in May 1956, however, Gen Otto P. Weyland said: "It is a supplement to, adds to, the flexibility, but it certainly does not replace the manned airplane.""*“ But a month later General Taylor visualized that "the trend will be toward the substitution of the missile, the Army-controlled missile, for what we call close support of ground forces."’’~ Asked to speculate on the future of manned fighter aircraft in February 1958, General LeMay replied: "I think their importance is going to diminish in the future, particularly in the tactical role—the fighter-bomber types, for instance. I think we are Going to require a manned vehicle in the air defense role for some time to come."! Only two months later, General Ferguson wrote:  Toan airman, the need for manned aircraft in tactical air operations is obvious. Tactical war is a war of movement. After fixed targets have been attacked, the problem is to seek out and destroy the moving targets. Often these targets are fleeting. They must be attacked as soon as they are observed, or they are gone. Here, missiles are of very limited use without necessary reconnaissance. The manned aircraft, on the other hand, carries with it both a reconnaissance capability to find the target and weapons to destroy it. The tactical fighter bomber is designed with the flexibility for attacking not only the fixed and pinpointed target, but also the target that must be located.  In April 1958, Weyland had occasion to repeat what he described as his "long-held co
