the flexibility for attacking not only the fixed and pinpointed target, but also the target that must be located.  In April 1958, Weyland had occasion to repeat what he described as his "long-held conviction that tactical surface-to-surface missiles, ballistic or cruise, can only be considered as a supplementary and secondary offensive tactical weapon to the manned airplane. Their actual tactical usefulness will be limited, will complicate the enemies’ defense, but will be more psychological than tangibly destructive in value."  One of the chief reasons for the confused thinking about the comparative values of missiles and manned aircraft in the air defense and tactical air missions arose from the fact that technological potentialities in both media were developing rapidly and posed a constant strain upon the limited research and development funds that could be made available. In the early 1950s both air defense and tactical air units were equipped with first-generation jet aircraft that were procured in quantity during the Korean War. Possibly because of difficulties and costs arising from the quantity production of the F-100 Super Sabre before the plane was adequately tested, the Air Force pursued a very cautious program of procuring new fighter aircraft, which Trevor Gardner described as a fly-before-you-buy philosophy.!”” Because it had great confidence in the North American Company, which had produced the F-86 Sabre, and because it needed an improved day fighter to oppose vast numbers of Soviet MiG-15s, the Air Force put the F-100 Super Sabre  521  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 543 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  into quantity production in mid-1953 before it was adequately tested. Since the fire control system on the Sabre had been satisfactory, it was assumed that a similar system would be acceptable in the F-100 and no complete weapon system specification was written for the F-100. This was not to be the case; trouble with the Super Sabre’s fi
