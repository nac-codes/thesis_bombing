By June 1958 Air Force Strength was reduced to 117 wings, includin 2, 28 air defense and 45 tactical air wings; continuing reductions were planned.  The Air Force did not attempt to defend the reduction in air defense in terms of the development of either Nike or Bomarc missiles.” ~ The severe cuts in tactical air strength, however, closely followed the Wilson memorandum of 26 November 1956, which stated that the Army should reexamine its requirements for air support as it continued to develop surface-to-surface missiles for employment within the battle zone.
