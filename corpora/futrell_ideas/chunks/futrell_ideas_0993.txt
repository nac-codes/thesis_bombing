as able to attain and maintain air superiority and to win the counterair war. Although initiating an attack is not recommended, an operational concept that will give friendly forces a chance of survival during the initial phase of a nuclear war is very much needed.  Based on the lessons of Korea and projected tactical requirements for air atomic warfare, the Tactical Air Command conceived the need for the employment of a family of tactical air fighters in a forward area: fighter-bombers, day fighters (air superiority), and fighter-interceptors (all-weather). Experience indicated that each type of these planes ought to perform the other’s missions in the event of an emergency, but the same experience also indicated that it would be difficult, costly, and perhaps impossible to design and procure an all-purpose fighter.21° In 1952, for example, the Tactical Air Command placed a requirement for a lightweight, high-performance day fighter that would be cheaper, yet able to out-perform heavily stressed fighter-bombers in air-to-air combat.7! The conceptual difference between the tactical day fighter and the air defense fighter involved  523  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 545 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  building into the former an ability to close on and destroy multiple air targets in fighter sweeps; the air defense fighter required all-weather capabilities and a high probability of single-pass destruction of hostile bombers and fighters”! The fighter-bomber weapon system was designed to destroy enemy targets during daylight hours and in good weather, but its limited night, all-weather, and ordnance carrying capabilities established a companion requirement for a tactical bomber weapon system that would provide a capability to perform missions previously handled by light bombardment and night intruder aircraft.21> The Tactical Air Command also had a requirement for "a reconnaissance version of the latest day fighter .. . to obtain critical visual and/or p
