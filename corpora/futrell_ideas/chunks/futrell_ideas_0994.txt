led by light bombardment and night intruder aircraft.21> The Tactical Air Command also had a requirement for "a reconnaissance version of the latest day fighter .. . to obtain critical visual and/or photographic reconnaissance of targets, such as airfields and missile sites located in highly defended areas." Even though tactical air forces had in the past needed a reconnaissance version of a light bomber to perform all-weather and electronic reconnaissance, the Tactical Air Command believed that the advancing state of the art could enable these functions to be performed by an all-purpose reconnaissance fighter.214  Even before Sagebrush, the Tactical Air Command recognized that any aircraft based on forward airfields would be extremely vulnerable to enemy air attack, especially since the enemy would have the opportunity for the first strike. This vulnerability could be reduced by new concepts of tactical employment and by the development of new tactical air equipment. The new tactical approach to the problem involved establishing forward and rear bases with a minimum number of high alert air units in the forward areas and the bulk of the air units located at safer rear-area bases. Beginning a scheme of operations similar to the composite air strike force (CASF) concept in 1954, the Tactical Air Command kept two fighter squadrons of a fighter group in the United States and rotated a third squadron from the group to such combat airfields in Europe as Dreux and Chaumont in France and Aviano in Italy. Weyland felt that at the outset of hostilities in an oversea area, "one combat squadron, without its dependents, will actually have more combat capability than the entire wing would if it had the families and children around there to worry about." In an emergency or at the outbreak of hostilities, the Tactical Air Command planned that the two squadrons from the United States would immediately join the single squadron that was on the alert in the forward area.‚Äù The chief di
