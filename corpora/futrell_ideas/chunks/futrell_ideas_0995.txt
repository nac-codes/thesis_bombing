break of hostilities, the Tactical Air Command planned that the two squadrons from the United States would immediately join the single squadron that was on the alert in the forward area.” The chief difficulty in developing this concept to its fullest was a deficiency in suitable tanker aircraft. To implement the CASF concept, the Tactical Air Command secured KB-29 boom-type tankers that were released as the Strategic Air Command converted its force to KC-97 and KC-135 tankers. The KB-29s that had been employed by SAC were not completely satisfactory: the Strategic Air Command could well employ flying-boom refueling equipment since its tankers normally refueled a single bomber at one time, but the Tactical Air Command needed drogue-type refueling that would permit several fighters to refuel from a tanker in one rendezvous. As soon as possible, the Tactical Air Command secured KB-S0 tankers equipped with multiple refueling drogues. All of the tankers allocated to the Tactical Air Command were conventional aircraft, and, just as was the case with the Strategic Air Command, the Tactical Air  524  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 546 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  Command’s jet fighters actually needed jet tankers to accomplish refuelings at jet speeds at altitudes up to 35,000 feet. The jet fighters needed to operate at higher altitudes, and at altitudes where weather would not interfere with refueling operations.  The development of new equipment offered some prospects for reducing the vulnerability of tactical air forces. As has been seen, Weyland considered that the Matador missiles that were deployed to Germany and Taiwan and the follow-on Mace missiles that were slated for service in Germany and Okinawa added to the flexibility of tactical air forces since they could be directed at fixed targets such as ports and airfields and could be employed as necessary at night and in bad weather. But Matador and Mace were air-breathing buzz bombs that could be intercepte
