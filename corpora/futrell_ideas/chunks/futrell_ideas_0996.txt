uld be directed at fixed targets such as ports and airfields and could be employed as necessary at night and in bad weather. But Matador and Mace were air-breathing buzz bombs that could be intercepted and destroyed by an alert enemy. Weyland also favored the development of tactical ballistic missiles, but these missiles lacked flexibility and he could not consider them as substitutes for manned tactical aircraft.“"" The developmental concepts of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), short takeoff and landing (STOL), and zero launch (ZEL) aircraft promised to reduce the vulnerability of tactical air units, since these aircraft could be widely dispersed. Weyland was willing to accept the possibility that such aircraft might be developed eventually, but he was not too sanguine about it. By the mid-1950s tactical aircraft already were up to a Mach-2 airspeed; none of the "tail-sitter" aircraft (missiles) could promise anything like this potential performance.7/®  On the basis of a great amount of thinking, Weyland believed that the Tactical Air Command had visualized an evolutionary program that would enable it to continue to perform tactical air missions in a nuclear age.71? The success of the program would depend on a continuing modernization of the force with new aircraft and with an appropriate expenditure of research and development effort. Seen in retrospect, however, the Tactical Air Command’s program required too many different types of aircraft, especially since research and development allocations for tactical air weapon systems enjoyed very poor priorities.““ As nearly as could be computed, only 8 percent of the Air Force research and development effort was assigned to tactical air weapons in fiscal year 1959221 Up until 1958 most fighter-bomber and tactical reconnaissance units were equipped with F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash planes. As a result of Weyland’s strong protest that the F-84F required more powerful engines to perform an atomic deliv
