nnaissance units were equipped with F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash planes. As a result of Weyland’s strong protest that the F-84F required more powerful engines to perform an atomic delivery mission, the Republic production line was changed over in 1955 and the remaining planes on order there were turned out as F-84J Super Thunderstreaks.7” Although the F-100 was originally designed as a day fighter and the F-100A and F-100C continued in this role, the Air Force decided in 1955 to develop an F-100D that would have added provisions for the delivery of external ordnance and would serve as a fighter-bomber The fact that F-100Ds could double as day fighters made the designations fighter-bomber and day-fighter wings questionable. In the autumn of 1957, moreover, the Tactical Air Command was committed to deploy a fighter-bomber unit on rotation to Europe but was compelled to substitute a F-100D day-fighter unit. For these reasons, effective in  525  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 547 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  July 1958, the Air Force dropped the day-fighter and fighter-bomber nomenclature in favor of tactical fighter. The mission of a tactical fighter wing became one of either attack or defense™ Released when the Strategic Air Command no longer required escort fighters, the long-range all-weather F-101C Voodoo and the RF-101 Voodoo photoreconnaissance aircraft entered the operating inventory of the tactical air forces in May 1957. First flown in February 1954, the lightweight, high-performance F-104 Starfighter air superiority fighter came into use in the Tactical Air Command in 1958.  Although the trend apparently was not identified when it began in the post-Korean War years, the Air Force practice in selecting tactical air weapons moved away from the concept that produced aircraft designed and optimized for specific roles toward a principle of versatility in mission capability. Looking toward an all-weather tactical bomber and reconnaissa
