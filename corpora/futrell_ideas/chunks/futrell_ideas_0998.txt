from the concept that produced aircraft designed and optimized for specific roles toward a principle of versatility in mission capability. Looking toward an all-weather tactical bomber and reconnaissance plane that could be available at an early date, the USAF Aircraft and Weapons Board recommended in November 1951 that the Air Force use a modified version of the Navy’s A-3D attack bomber. The Air Force issued quantity procurement orders for this plane in 1952 and it was designated as the B-66/RB-66.-° On the basis of a response to a qualitative operational requirement issued in April 1952 for a new tactical bomber to replace the B-66 in the 1958-63 time period, a development contract for an XB-68 was awarded to the Martin Aircraft Company.227 The action was entirely unrelated at the time to the tactical bomber program, but in February 1952 the Republic Aviation Company proposed to develop an improved F-84X fighter-bomber. So many configuration changes were specified that the plane was designated as the F-105 when the Air Force awarded Republic a contract for its development in September 1952. Although the F-105 thus came into being without a preceding general operational requirement, it was expected to be the first aircraft specifically designed as a fighter-bomber. It was to have a Mach-2 airspeed and an ability to carry either nuclear or conventional weapons. A reconnaissance version of the plane was planned, and both versions were to be operational in 1958.28  When necessary design changes were made, the B-66/RB-66 emerged as a virtually new airplane, bearing only a superficial resemblance to the Navy A-3D. But the changes were not all satisfactory: an already developed K-5 bombing system, for example, had to be fitted into the already firm airframe, and the plane would never be suited for low-level operations. After poor results attained in the plane’s maiden flight on 28 June 1954, and given the necessities for many modifications, program slippages, and shaky
