ould never be suited for low-level operations. After poor results attained in the plane’s maiden flight on 28 June 1954, and given the necessities for many modifications, program slippages, and shaky accomplishments, the B-66 program was on the verge of cancellation in May 1955. Finally in January 1956 the Air Force elected to procure only enough B-66Bs to equip the light bombardment wing serving in Europe and to outfit the remaining aircraft on the order as RB-66 reconnaissance aircraft.““” In these same years the RF/F-105 development program progressed slowly because of scant funding and program reductions, but the YF-105A performed well on its first flight on 22 October 1955 and was heartily endorsed by the pilots who subsequently flew i Seeking to find some suitable all-weather bombing aircraft after the Air Force restricted procurement of B-66s,  526  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 548 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  Weyland proposed in June 1956 that the F-105 be developed in a two-place version with a modified K-5 bombing system in order that it might serve as an interim all-weather attack aircraft until the XB-68 was available.”*!  Based on the decision to develop intermediate range ballistic missiles, the Air Force reviewed requirements for light bombers and canceled the Martin XB-68 project on 3 January 1957. Weyland strongly protested against the elimination of all-weather attack capabilities in theater air forces, but General White reminded him that the Air Force could not invest in duplicative capabilities. White believed that tactical missiles should be employed against most fixed targets in a theater and that strategic bombers could destroy such targets as were not susceptible to attack by theater air forces. "Rather than develop a separate tactical air force all-weather bombing capability," White wrote on 17 May 1957, "I feel that a plan of complementary operations between tactical and strategic forces must be perfected, that we must orient our
