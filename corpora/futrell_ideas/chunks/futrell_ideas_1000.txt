air force all-weather bombing capability," White wrote on 17 May 1957, "I feel that a plan of complementary operations between tactical and strategic forces must be perfected, that we must orient our concept of operations to integrate the capabilities of our allies, and that policies and guide lines must be accordingly revised." After a running exchange of correspondence, Weyland salvaged some concessions. As long as replacement parts permitted, one wing of B-57s and one wing of B-66s could continue in the tactical air inventory, The Air Force also agreed to provide F-105s with all-weather attack capabilities. 32 Based on these decisions the F-105 Thunderchief was put into large-scale production in the summer of 1957 as the designated replacement aircraft for F-84s, B-57s, B-66s, and F-100s.73  Although he yielded some points to General Weyland during 1957, General White continued to question whether the tactical air forces would have a continued validity in a missile era. Justifying the action by citing the increased effectiveness as well as the increased cost of tactical aircraft and the planned activation of four Army missile commands, White announced early in 1958 that the Air Force would be reduced from 117 to 105 wings during fiscal year 1959, mainly through the inactivation of tactical air wings. At the same time that these reductions were put forth, Air Force program planners offered an informal proposal for a worldwide reorganization of tactical air forces. This study visualized that at the outbreak of a general war, up to 500 tactical fighters and 144 tactical reconnaissance aircraft assigned to the Tactical Air Command might well be isolated in the United States and unable to deploy overseas or to contribute substantially to the war mission. The study recommended that the Tactical Air Commandâ€™s assigned units be severely reduced, that overseas tactical air forces be augmented, that rotation of tactical air units from the United States to overseas areas b
