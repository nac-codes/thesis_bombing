plateaus of Soviet offensive capabilities. Since they were unable to forecast future technological capabilities, the air defense planners saw little choice other than to credit the Soviets with the ability to possess offensive capabilities that would be roughly equivalent to those that would be possessed by the United States at predictable intervals in the future. Air defense doctrine taught that the four major functions to be performed for a successful accomplishment of the mission were detection, identification, interception, and  528  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 550 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  destruction. These functions would have to be accomplished in the minimum possible time since air defense planners had to accept the probability that the Soviets would achieve tactical surprise and that the first warning of an impending attack would be generated within the air defense system.‚Äù Predicated upon national aims and objectives, the Air Force accepted the concept of providing an area defense for the continental United States that would: (1) provide for the earliest tactical warning of impending attack to permit deployment of alert strategic offensive forces and to alert active and passive defenses, (2) maintain continuous surveillance of attacking forces throughout the area of combat, (3) apply maximum effect weapons at the maximum possible distance from target areas, (4) employ continuously increasing numbers and types of defensive forces as the attack progressed from a penetration of the combat zone toward the target areas, and (5) provide centralized control of the air battle over large geographical areas.  During World War II the P-47 Thunderbolt and the P-51 Mustang had served as all-purpose fighters. In January 1949 the Air Force Senior Officers Board had believed that it would be impossible to develop all-purpose aircraft in the future. The board pointed out that F-80 and F-84 fighters already were marginal in their capability to intercept airc
