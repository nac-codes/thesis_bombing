hters for the Air Defense Command. The F-94 and the F-86D were adaptations of existing aircraft.”  The Air Force description of the pure interceptor aircraft that would be needed for service in 1954 as issued for design competition on 18 August 1950 contained uncertainties as to the type of ground electronic environment in which the new plane would be employed. The design requirements described a single-place plane  529  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 551 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  to counter a Soviet threat from B-47 or B-52 type aircraft (Badgers or Bisons) and that could operate in either local or area defense from 5,000-foot runways, have a radius of 375 nautical miles, and be capable of an altitude of 60,000 feet. The requirements description noted that manual techniques of aircraft warning and control would impose intolerable delays in a jet age but did not attempt to describe the new ground environment that would be needed.“~ When the design competition was completed, the Convair Aircraft Corporation was given a contract to develop a prototype for the 1954 all-weather interceptor weapon system in July 1951. Late in 1951 the Air Force recognized that the design specifications for the 1954 interceptor were so advanced that they could not be attained by 1954, and it accordingly directed Convair to work toward the development of an interim interceptor to be known as the F-102A and to continue work toward an ultimate aircraft that would later be designated as the F-106.  While work was beginning on the 1954 interceptor, the United States substantially broadened the ground environment electronics systems in which interceptors would be expected to work. Many of the decisions about the ground environment were intergovernmental decisions, which could not be foreseen exactly in military planning. To provide additional early warning, the Air Force won the right in 1951 to procure Navy-developed RC-121 airborne early warning and control aircraft that co
