be foreseen exactly in military planning. To provide additional early warning, the Air Force won the right in 1951 to procure Navy-developed RC-121 airborne early warning and control aircraft that could cover the Atlantic and Pacific sea approaches to North America. To push radar defenses farther northward, Canada and the United States agreed in October 1953 to proceed with the construction of a mid-Canada radar line. After extended study and controversy over cost, the United States decided early in 1954 to build the distant early warning line within the Arctic Circle.“™ The DEW and mid-Canada lines were planned for warning rather than for the control of interceptor aircraft, but it was apparent that the ground electronic environment was being spread out over an area that could not be covered with a 375-mile radius-of-action F-102. The short-range interceptor fitted into "island defense" rather than a broad-area air defense. Recognizing these facts, the Air Defense Command and the Air Research and Development Command began to visualize a requirement for a two-place long-range jet interceptor. On 19 February 1954 the Research and Development Command recommended that the single-place F-101 Voodoo, originally programmed as a long-range escort fighter for the Strategic Air Command, be adapted into a long-range interceptor. The Air Defense Command was willing to accept the F-101, but the Air Force preferred to delay a decision until it could hold a design competition to get information on the possibility that an optimum long-range interceptor could be developed. Held in the summer of 1954 this design competition would stimulate interest that would eventually yield the design of the F-108, but it promised nothing that could be available soon. The Air Defense Command apparently wanted more than industry could provide prior to 1960, unless the Air Force would be willing to accept a four-engine fighter of virtually the same size as an airborne early warning aircraft.
