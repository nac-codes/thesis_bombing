evelopment of the follow-on F-106 Delta Dart was slowed by the attention given to the F-102. The F-106A made its first test flight on 26 December 1956; the two-place F-106B was first flown on 9 April 1958. The F-106 was placed in quantity production in fiscal year 1957 when F-102 production was closed out.  Viewed in retrospect the F-102 story revealed a long gap between perception  of need and program accomplishment. The time from the establishment of the requirement in 1948 to the completion of the program in 1958 was ten years. The cost of the F-102 program was some $2.3 billion, and at least $30 million worth of tooling was said to have been discarded in the process of developing this plane. In view of the gap that was going to exist before the F-102 and F-106 could become operational, the Air Defense Command accepted another interim interceptor â€” the F-104 Starfighter. The F-104 had not been designed as a fighter-interceptor and possessed electronic equipment that was not compatible with the semiautomatic ground environment that the Air Defense Command was installing. Although reluctant to take the day fighter, the Air Defense Command recognized that it could get the F-104 without great delay, and in April 1956 it asked for six squadrons of the plane. Although the F-104 was a flashy performer, it never met air defense requirements. In August 1957 the Air Force limited F-104 programming to only two wings of aircraft and canceled further production of the plane. At this time the Air Defense Command was rescheduled to receive only four squadrons of F-104s.%8  At the same time that it was seeking an optimized interceptor aircraft, the Air Force was visualizing the requirements for a ground control environment that could handle a jet air battle. A modern jet bomber could cross the entire area covered by one radar in a very few minutes. The air defense rule of thumb thus  531  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 553 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  visualized
