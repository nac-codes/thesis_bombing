The old procedures by which personnel passed aircraft plots by voice and displayed information manually would be too slow for the jet age.2? Accepted conceptually by the Air Force in April 1953, the Lincoln Laboratory’s semiautomatic ground environment (SAGE) system was built and tested in the Cape Cod area in 1953-54 and accepted for deployment throughout the United States. The Air Defense Command’s SAGE plan looked toward the division of the continental United States into eight air defense regions with eight SAGE combat operations centers and 32 air defense sectors with 32 SAGE direction centers. The first SAGE installations were located in the northeastern United States, then in the midwest, and then in the northwest and on the west coast. Next, the remainder of the northern and west-central states were provided with SAGE installations, then the southeastern, the southern, the southwestern, and finally the central portions of the United States were filled in. In view of the time and expense involved to do otherwise and given the probability that an enemy would direct first strikes against US strategic retaliatory forces, the Air Defense Command elected to locate its SAGE installations in shock-resistant, reinforced concrete buildings located above ground.
