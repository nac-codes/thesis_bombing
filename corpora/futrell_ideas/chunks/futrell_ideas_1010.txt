strikes against US strategic retaliatory forces, the Air Defense Command elected to locate its SAGE installations in shock-resistant, reinforced concrete buildings located above ground. Following the Air Defense Command plan to provide priority protection to the heavily industrialized sections of the nation, the first SAGE direction center became operational at McGuire AFB, New Jersey, in 1957 and the entire SAGE system was completed in March 1962. Utilizing large digital computers and digital data transmission equipment, the centralized SAGE system received, displayed, and stored information from many radars and flight control centers. The SAGE system provided air defense commanders with the capability to direct hundreds of interceptors and missiles against hundreds of targets.?>  In the same years that new interceptors were under development and a modern ground system was being laid out, the Air Defense Command increased its unit strength and moved toward the attainment of a family of four basic weapon units to be employed against any type of hostile airborne threat. The family was to include long-range interceptor, medium-range interceptor, medium-range interceptor missile, and short-range surface-to-air missile squadrons—all to operate within the SAGE.” The Air Force 137-wing program included 34 wings (102 squadrons) of fighter-interceptors, of which 23 wings (69 squadrons) were assigned to the Air Defense Command and the others were committed to theater air forces. As the Air Force momentarily attained its 137-wing program in June 1957, the Air Defense Command attained its planned strength (but two fighter-interceptor wings were deleted from the program) aes During 1953-54 the Air Defense Command maintained that it would require, in addition to its manned  532  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 554 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  interceptor squadrons, 53 Bomarc missiles squadrons for deployment around the nation’s perimeters.
