In the first firm planning in 1955, the Air Force and the Air Defense Command agreed that 40 Bomarc squadrons was a practicable objective. At Air Force prodding, the Bomarc objective was reduced to 36 squadrons in 1957, some of which were to be located outside the United States.  By 1954-55 the potential scientific advances in air defense appeared to promise a substantial breakthrough in the whole field of activity. "Our objective," stated General Yates in March 1954, "is to develop a completely integrated and automatic air defense network, including interceptor weapon systems, which will provide as effective a defense as is technically possible."~” Speaking early in 1955 Maj Gen Frederic H. Smith, Jr., visualized an annual expenditure of $7 billion for air defense and a total expenditure of $42 billion for that purpose by 1960. "Such a defense system against manned and unmanned air-breathing weapon systems should inflict an attrition rate of greater than 90 percent upon attacking forces of sizes up to 4,000 flying objects, unless the enemy achieves qualitative surprise.">° Shortly before his retirement as commander in chief, Continental Air Defense Command, Gen Benjamin W. Chidlaw was similarly optimistic in a letter to General Twining. "I am convinced," he wrote on 28 May 1955, "that an air defense capability which will furnish a comparable deterrent to aggression to that posed by SAC can be achieved, if we put our heart into it."~" By 1955 the Air Defense Command possessed a good system to meet the threat of the Tu-4 offensive, and there was optimism that the air defense system could continue to outdistance the Soviets.  However, the Soviets achieved qualitative surprise and demonstrated on 1 May 1955 that their offensive capabilities had risen to a new plateau much sooner than had been anticipat
