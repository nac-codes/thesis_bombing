a subsonic long-endurance control and warning Missileer aircraft that were to be equipped to launch high-performance, long-range air-to-air Eagle missiles.” The Air Force had this same option to develop a huge missile-firing interceptor as a remote air defense weapon system, but Partridge questioned whether anyone could determine how to employ an air defense plane outside the air defense ground environment.“ The North American Aviation Company had been studying the problem of remote air defense for several years; when its approach appeared feasible, the Air Force awarded the company a letter contract on 1 June 1957 to begin development of a long-range Mach-3 jet interceptor. This plane was designated the F-108 and, as it was conceived, was to be a two-place, two-engine stainless steel plane that would maintain a Mach-3 speed. It would be designed to carry a pair of new guided aircraft rockets (GAR-9 missiles), which could be fitted with either nuclear or conventional warheads. The F-108’s range and speed would give the ability to police the DEW lines, but it would have an electronic system that would work either inside or outside the ground environment. If operated beyond the ground environment, several F-108s would probably fly together in a line-abreast formation, separated by about the range limits of their self-contained airborne intercept radars. From this disposition the individual planes would pick up anything ahead of them, lock onto their targets, and shoot down the targets with  534  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 556 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  - their missiles” The problem of combating Soviet bombers at longer ranges and at lower altitudes affected the Bomarc development program. The Bomarc A was conceived to be a missile with a 125-mile range that would be effective up to 60,000 feet but would be relatively ineffective at low altitudes. While the Bomarc A continued in development, the Air Force directed that a Bomarc B also be developed that would hav
