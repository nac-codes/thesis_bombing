e effective up to 60,000 feet but would be relatively ineffective at low altitudes. While the Bomarc A continued in development, the Air Force directed that a Bomarc B also be developed that would have a range of action of over 400 miles and would be capable of dealing with a low-altitude threat.2  When Partridge retired and yielded command to Lt Gen Laurence S. Kuter on 1 August 1957, the North American Air Defense Command was well on its way to being able to counter the Soviet Bison and Bear threats. The DEW line was nearing completion, SAGE was becoming operational in the northeastern United States, and the Air Defense Command was converting to century-series jet interceptors. Because of the added expense of these planes as well as their greater combat capabilities, the Air Force programmed a cut in its air defense strength to 28 fighter-interceptor wings (83 squadrons) by 30 June 1958. And, since four Bomarc A missile squadrons were scheduled to become operational in fiscal year 1959, the Air Force planned to reduce the air defense fighter-interceptor strength to 27 wings (80 squadrons) by30 June 1959.67 To permit this reduction, the Department of Defense had agreed to a plan whereby 12 Air National Guard wings would be equipped with all-weather interceptors and eight with day fighters to augment the Air Defense Command.” Once again the United States air defense proved to be a step behind Soviet technological capabilities, since the Soviets’, Sputnik I revealed that the enemy could soon possess an intercontinental ballistic missile capability. Quite shortly, moreover, American intelligence recognized that the Soviets had concentrated on the development of missiles and had never produced the number of Bisons and Bears that had been within their capability to produce after 1955-562?  In response to Sputnik the Air Force immediately began the construction of two ballistic missile early warning system (BMEWS) sites at Point Clear, Alaska, and Thule, Greenland. Other
