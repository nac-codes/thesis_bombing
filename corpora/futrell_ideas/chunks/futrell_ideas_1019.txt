orce fighter-interceptor squadrons over the next several years; the reduction of Bomarc to atotal of 16 squadrons in the United States and two in Canada, all to be deployed in a peripheral setting rather than in depth; and a limitation of SAGE to eight supercombat centers and 22 direction centers. The master plan recommended that the Army’s Nike-Zeus antimissile be continued in research and development and that a third BMEWS installation be constructed at Flyingdales, England.2”” The Air Force did not object to the master air defense plan, but another development in the summer of 1959 caused General White "many sleepless nights." In Department of Defense budget guidance for fiscal year 1961, White was told that funds could not sustain the development of both the F-108 Mach-3 interceptor and the B-70 Mach-3 bomber, if indeed they could support the development of either of them. When presented with the problem, the Air Force Weapons Board recommended that the F-108 be continued in development, but the Air Force Council subsequently reversed the recommendations of the board and recommended that the B-70 should be funded for continued development. General White reasoned that a long-range fighter-interceptor would be needed as long as the Russians had a capability to make bomber attacks with standoff missiles, but he decided that the F-108 would be canceled and the B-70 kept in development. Explaining his decision, White said: "I based that largely on what would be the greatest threat to the Soviet Union, and, hands down, the B-70 wins that argument."28 Even though the F-108 was technically feasible and a long-range interceptor would be vital to continental air defense, the Air Force canceled the F-108 development program on 23 September 1959. Development of the fire control system and the GAR-9 missile continued on a reduced scale for possible use with some other airframe.  "Somewhat of a revolution," General White noted, "took place in the air defense field under the D
