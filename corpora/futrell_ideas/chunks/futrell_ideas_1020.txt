system and the GAR-9 missile continued on a reduced scale for possible use with some other airframe.  "Somewhat of a revolution," General White noted, "took place in the air defense field under the Department of Defense master air defense plan. . .. I think the No. 1 point . . . is that the technology and the enemy threat are constantly changing. I think it is fair to state it takes time, maybe too much time, for some of the implications to seep into all the brains that have to work on these things." White noted that in a strict sense the commander in chief, North American Air Defense Command, should have borne the responsibility for making necessary weapon systems recommendations to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But, General White also asserted, "somebody has to step up to these problems, and it devolves in a military sense upon the Chief of the service to take the initiative . .. in the light of the overall picture —the integrated threat; the moneys available; the weapon systems which  537  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 559 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  are present and forthcoming; and the light of other threats."° Based on this reasoning, the Air Force increased the effort to translate the master air defense plan into system requirements. White charged Maj Gen H. M. Estes, Jr., Air Force assistant deputy chief of staff for operations, to study changes in air defense programs necessary to respond to the master plan. In this evaluation Estes drew heavily for technical assistance upon the Air Defense Systems Integration Division, MITRE Corporation.* Individuals from the North American Air Defense Command and the Air Defense Command provided technical information, but Estes observed: "We did not ask them specifically for their detailed ideas for the very simple reason we knew already their ideas would not coincide with ours with reference to reductions."  Beginning in mid-February 1960, Estes assembled the some 100 technicians who had been working upon
