some quick stops ... marked by a series of efforts to close gaps — gaps that have been created by advances in offensive weapon systems." As he looked backward Kuter observed that air defense had been moving rapidly ahead in 1957 and had almost closed the gap on Soviet offensive capabilities, but he thought that these efforts to comprehend Soviet offensive capabilities had been suddenly halted in 1959, Kuter argued that the nation could produce, and urgently required, a long-range Mach-3 manned fighter-interceptor. He also felt that the  540  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 562 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  Army’s Nike-Zeus missile be put into production for operational deployment, since it was the nation’s only available anti-ICBM defense system. "We know full well," he said, "that we must have complementary strategic offensive and North American defensive forces to present a credible deterrent or to ensure national survival should general war occur."  Origins of Aerospace Doctrine in the Air Force  In a reminiscent remark about pre-Sputnik days, Maj Gen Bernard Schriever recalled that "‘space’ was a nasty word in certain circles."“”" Initially in the post-World War II period, the subject of space was more amusing than anything else, at least to the public. When Secretary James V. Forrestal disclosed in his first annual report as secretary of defense during 1948 that the Air Force and Navy were studying earth satellite vehicles, amused journalists asked: Will America possess moons of war?” As has been seen, the first Rand study completed for the Air Force in 1946 indicated the feasibility of an earth orbital satellite that would be launched by the MX-774 Hiroc missile. However, these early Rand studies emphasized the scientific value of earth satellites rather than their military worth. Believing that progress in booster technology might reduce the individual cost of satellites, General Vandenberg signed a policy statement that the Air Force had "logical res
