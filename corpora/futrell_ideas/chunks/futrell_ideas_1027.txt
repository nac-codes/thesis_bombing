han their military worth. Believing that progress in booster technology might reduce the individual cost of satellites, General Vandenberg signed a policy statement that the Air Force had "logical responsibility for the satellite." After reviewing Air Force and Navy satellite studies, however, the Defense Research and Development Board’s Committee on Guided Missiles reported on 29 March 1948 that insufficient thought had been given to the military worth of such vehicles and that, in any event, the cancellation of the development of the MX-774 missile would delay orbital flight. The committee further recommended that "the only activity directed toward satellite vehicles as such should be a continuation of the Project RAND studies of the utility of a vehicle.""°  Authorized to continue satellite studies, the Rand Corporation was able to report by April 1951 that "pioneer reconnaissance and weather reconnaissance are suitable with the resolving power presently available to a satellite television system."2?7 In view of the reinstitution of the long-range ballistic missile development program in 1951-52, the Air Force directed Rand to proceed with studies of components for a satellite reconnaissance system and, on 16 March 1955, it issued a general operational requirement for the development of WS-117L, a strategic reconnaissance weapon system.“ After receiving and evaluating proposals from several major contractors, the Air Force selected the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation as the prime manager for WS-117L and issued a contract in 1956.” Other factors were involved, but the need to establish military worth was significant cause for the nearly 10-year lapse between first conception and initiation of research and development on a satellite reconnaissance space system.  Another line of development that would lead the Air Force to the fringes of space originated in the waning months of World War II from a general recognition that the nation lacked basic knowledge about supers
