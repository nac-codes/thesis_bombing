rmy or the Navy would fund research vehicles, the contractor would provide initial flight tests, the Army or the Navy would determine the military applicability of the vehicles, and, after that, a test vehicle would be turned over to NACA in order that its tests might provide data to be published for the entire aviation industry. In order to begin supersonic flight probes, the Air Technical Service Command authorized two supersonic airplane projects on 5 and 6 March 1945. The first project authorized the Bell Aircraft Company to fabricate three test aircraft that would have speeds greater than Mach 1 and would be powered by alcohol-liquid oxygen rocket motors. The second project with the Douglas Aircraft Corporation involved a design study of a supersonic airplane.  The Bell plane, which would subsequently be known as the XS-1 and later the X-1, was to be the first of an X or research series of aircraft.°°! Launched from an airborne B-29, the X-1 made its first powered flight on 9 December 1946, Further refinements enabled the conventionally structured X-1 to break the sound barrier on 14 October 1947 with Capt Charles E. Yeager as its pilot. Learning lessons from the X-1, the Army Air Forces contracted with Bell on 27 November 1945 to build two X-2 test planes, with Monel Metal fuselage and stainless steel sweptback wings that would permit them to attain very high speeds. The first X-2 accidentally exploded in the bomb bay of a B-50 on 13 May 1953. In later test flights at Edwards AFB, California, the second X-2 exceeded speeds of 1,900 miles per hour and attained an altitude of 126,000 feet. In this same period the Douglas Aircraft Company built several models of a D-558 Skyrocket plane under Navy contract. These rocket-powered planes were tested at Edwards and eventually turned over to NACA.
