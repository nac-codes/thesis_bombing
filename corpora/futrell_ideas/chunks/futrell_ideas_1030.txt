As a result of these studies, the Committee on Aerodynamics endorsed a proposal to build a Mach-7 research airplane that could explore the fringes of space. Since NACA was not authorized to procure such an experimental plane, Dr Hugh L. Dryden, who was now its chairman, proposed to the Air Force and Navy on 9 July 1954 that these services should procure the plane for cooperative testing. Reacting favorably to the project, the Department of Defense authorized the Air Force and the Navy to finance the needed aircraft development. After a design competition, the Air Force issued a letter contract to the North American Company on 18 November 1955 providing for the purchase of three rocket-powered X-15 aircraft and for modifying a B-52 to be used to launch them. The memorandum of understanding regarding the X-15 provided that NACA would exercise technical development with advice and assistance from a Research Airplane Committee that included Air Force and Navy representatives. The development of the X-15 was extremely costly, and the Air Force was called upon to provide the great majority of the needed funds. Following delivery to Edwards AFB, the X-15 made its first powered flight on 17 September 1959. Equipped with alternate engines, an X-15 flown by Air Force Maj Robert M. White attained a record altitude of 314,750 feet on 17 July 1962. Another X-15 achieved a speed of 4,105 miles per hour on 27 June 1962. Each X-15 flight furnished data for the design of high-altitude hypersonic operational aircraft and also provided data
