uly 1962. Another X-15 achieved a speed of 4,105 miles per hour on 27 June 1962. Each X-15 flight furnished data for the design of high-altitude hypersonic operational aircraft and also provided data on the physiological and psychological reactions of man in flights along the fringes of space.  While the X-series aircraft were not designed in any way to become weapon systems, Air Force developmental planners were familiar with work that had been conducted in Germany during World War II by Dr Eugen Sanger and his assistant Dr Irene Bredt. Working independently of the Peenemiinde ballistic missile people, Sanger had prepared plans for the use of a V-2 rocket as a second stage for a boost-glide manned vehicle that would be launched from Germany, rise above the atmosphere, and then glide back into the atmosphere; it, thus, could become avery long-range bomber capable of circumnavigating the earth and bombing New York. The German government did not give serious consideration to the boost-glide rocket bomber, but both the Russians and the Americans captured interesting data relative to the Sanger concept. Employed as a consultant to the Air Materiel Command in 1947, Dr Walter Dornberger carried the boost-glide concept to the Bell Aircraft Company in 1950 when he left Air Force employment and entered private enterprise. In 1952 Bell approached the Air Force with a proposal to undertake research on a manned, boost-glide bomber-missile, called Bomi. After considerable argumentation within the Air Force, the Wright Air Development Center completed a contract with Bell on 1 April 1954 calling for a study of an advanced bomber-reconnaissance system.  543  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 565 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  Based on favorable results from the Bell study, the Air Force issued a general operational requirement for a hypersonic strategic bombardment system on 12 May 1955; nevertheless, research and development planners doubted the advisability of investi
