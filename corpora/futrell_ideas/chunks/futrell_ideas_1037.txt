Doctor von Braun charged in December 1957 that military requirements for missiles were conceived narrowly in terms of "a limited end item" and that such development became "a dead-end street." As warheads got lighter the trend in the Department of Defense was to build smaller, less-powerful boosters. "It is very significant... ," von Braun thought, "that the development of... large rocket engines .. . was not approved by anybody simply because there is no need for these engines within the framework of the existing and approved missile systems." He urged that large and powerful rocket engines, which could not be immediately justified in terms of military worth, would be required to boost manned vehicles into outer space. elt Secretary McElroy on 29 January 1959, however, the fact that Soviet rockets had more thrust than American missiles seemed "beside the point" from a military point of view, but he agreed that "it was significant in regard to space." "We have an adequate thrust," McElroy said, "to take a warhead on an ICBM range to selected targets in the Soviet Union. If you have twice that much thrust, it doesnâ€™t help you, from a missile standpoint. It does,  546  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 568 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  of course, help you from an outer Space standpoint .. . but it is not of real importance in the ICBM capability. a  At the same time that the Department of Defense favored the commitment of defense research and development money to the perfection of low-risk weapon systems of definite military worth, President Eisenhower also hoped that a peaceful regime could be maintained in space. Before and after becoming president, Eisenhower often expressed 2 an ideal of enforced peace through arms limitations and disarmament. Accepting an arms control concept that the United States should retain its nuclear power and yet make clear that its purposes were peaceful, Eisenhower took advantage of an assembly of world leaders at the Geneva Summi
