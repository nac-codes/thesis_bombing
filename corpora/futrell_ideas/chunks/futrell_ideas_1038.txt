control concept that the United States should retain its nuclear power and yet make clear that its purposes were peaceful, Eisenhower took advantage of an assembly of world leaders at the Geneva Summit Conference in July 1955 to propose a worldwide inspection plan for the prevention of surprise attack. At the conference table Eisenhower proposed that the United States and the Soviet Union would exchange "a complete blueprint" of their military forces and each would facilitate the other’s aerial reconnaissance of their countries. Eisenhower believed that such a step would "convince the world that we are providing as between ourselves against the possibility of great surprise attack, thus lessening danger and relaxing tension."*!8 Bisenhower’s "open skies" proposal at Geneva assumed an immediate relationship to proposals that had been made in October 1954 by a committee of the International Council of Scientific Unions for the launching of small scientific satellites during the international geophysical year (IGY), which would begin on 1 July 1957 and conclude on 31 December 1958. The Soviet Union had announced on 15 April 1955 that it had established a Special Commission for Interplanetary Communications and would produce "a remote controlled laboratory to circle the earth as a satellite and establish opportunities for observation of a hitherto inaccessible character." After Eisenhower returned from Geneva, the White House announced on 29 July that in 1957-58 the United States would launch small space satellites, probably instrument-bearing, that would circle the earth each 90 minutes at a height of 300 miles. a7  Critical of the open skies proposal from the first, the Soviets finally rejected it early in 1956 when disarmament negotiations reached another stalemate. While the open skies proposal was in conception and under consideration, however, it had important effects upon US space policy. In view of the growing interest in scientific satellites, von Braun had pro
