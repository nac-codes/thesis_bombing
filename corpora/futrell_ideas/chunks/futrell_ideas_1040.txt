f success, but it respected the Air Force belief that such an employment of the Atlas would interfere with the ICBM program. The majority of the committee recommended use of an improved Viking missile that would be known as Vanguard. A minority of three committee members recommended that the booster system for the IGY satellite should use the existing Army Redstone rather than depend on a development of the Vanguard The Department of Defense approved the Vanguard proposal over the objections of the Army, which warned that time consumed in developing the missile might enable the Soviets to launch the first satellite. Following procurement of a test quantity of improved Redstone missiles, known as Jupiter C, General Gavin again proposed that one of the missiles be used to launch a scientific satellite. On 15 May 1956, however, Gavin received a personal admonition: "The Redstone and Jupiter missiles will not be used to launch a satellite.">  Even though the Soviets refused to accept the open skies proposal, Harold Stassen, who was serving as Eisenhowerâ€™s special assistant for disarmament, continued to believe that some measure of aerial inspection could contribute to the control of arms. "I do believe from our studies," he said in June 1956,  that if a measure of inspection, particularly against surprise attack, can be obtained, on a basis that must be mutually lived up to or its violation would be immediately discovered, that such a system combined with a moderate, sustained alert, armed strength will give a greater likelihood of security and peace than either an all-out arms race on the one extreme or a complete inspection system and comprehensive disarmament on the other.  In August 1956, Col Martin B. Schofield of the Air War College Evaluation Division completed a study entitled "Control of the Use of Outer Space." Schofield pointed out that the "use of an earth satellite as a reconnaissance vehicle would provide intelligence data of the highest order of coverage
