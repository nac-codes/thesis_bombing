ituation was perilously close to that of 1945-46 when the Soviets rejected Bernard Baruch’s plan for the control of atomic weapons, an action that had led to an international nuclear arms race. He hoped that the same mistake would not be made in the development of space vehicles, which would involve an equal and perhaps an even greater danger to mankind 26  In his Air War College study on space, Colonel Schofield had believed that the United States was in a position to adopt a positive stand on international control because it "presumably enjoys a lead in the current evolution of scientific achievement."**’ The Soviets not only displayed little interest in establishing international controls over space during 1956-57, but they would be the first nation into space effective with the orbital flight of Sputnik I on 4 October 1957. The real tragedy of the situation was summarized by General Gavin: "We have the scientific talent and we have the brainpower, the industrial capacity. ... The failure was in decision-making, making the wrong decisions.">”* In the opinion of Dr Clifford C. Furnas, who had become assistant secretary of defense for research and development on 22 November 1955, the Soviets had been permitted to get ahead of the United States in space because of the decision to develop a "peaceful" Vanguard rather than to use the "military" Redstone as a booster for a scientific satellite. Even with maximum effort Furnas believed that it would have been difficult to expedite the Vanguard program, but he later remembered that the Department of Defense had not considered the Vanguard IGY satellite project to be of "first importance" and had allowed only a"dribbling release" of requisite funds to it.  A Concept of Space Superiority  Apparently failing to recognize that administrative policy favored the establishment of international controls to secure a peaceful regime in space, General Schriever forcefully asserted in an address at San Diego in February 1957 that th
