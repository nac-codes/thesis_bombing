of the control of air and the control of space, I want to stress that there is no division, per se, between air and space. Air and space are an indivisible field of operations. ... It is quite obvious that we cannot control the air up to 20 miles above the earth’s surface and relinquish control of space above that altitude —and still survive.  In numerous appearances before congressional investigating committees in the winter of 1957-58, White continued to emphasize the continuum of air and space. He foresaw the use of weapons in space, both offensive and defensive. Although he confessed no "personal expertness in the matter," he believed it would be possible for aman to goto the moon.>”? In similar appearances, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Research and Development) Richard E. Horner and Lt Gen Donald L. Putt, Air Force deputy chief of staff for research and development, strongly argued that the moon possessed valuable potential as a military base. "We should not regard control of the moon," Putt added, "as the ultimate means of insuring peace among the earth nations. It is only a first step toward stations on planets far more distant —in turn, from which control over the moon might then be exercised." In summation, Putt said: "The conquest of space—or, at least, its denial to an enemy — is vital to continued United States security. . .. Within the framework of deterrent force as we exercise it today, space flight soon will be employed to great advantage. And presiually, space superiority will become the primary factor in assurance of world peace.  To the leaders of the Air Force, space technology represented a logical progression in the development of Air Force technology. "The Air Force," said Secretary Douglas, "has been engaged in explorations of outer space and all of the associate technical fields since the end of World War II. ... The techniques and actual developments involved in the X-15 are one path to man’s flight into space." Douglas recalled t
