I look upon the Air Force’s interest and ventures into space as being logical and natural as when men of old in sailing ships first ventured forth from the inland seas.  As these ancient seafarers’ knowledge of the inland seas increased and they learned more about the elements, they built larger ships and ventured farther away from land. The achievement required men who had learned the many things there were to know about the inland seas. Similarly, ventures into outer space require men who know the air. There are no barriers between air and space. Air and space are an indivisible field of operations.  The Air Force progress toward space has been evolutionary —the natural development and extension of speed, altitude, and sustained flight. These qualities have been our stock in trade throughout the fifty years of Air Force history. We have strived continually to fly faster, to fly higher, and to remain airborne longer... .  The evolutionary process which has brought the Air Force to its high state of development is not going to change in direction because there are additional challenges in space. Aeronautics and astronautics are closely allied. ... 1 feel that a dangerous trap lies ahead of us if we partition our space efforts. We must have centralized direction of our national efforts to attain the best results from available resources, talent, and experience. Excessive duplication of effort would not only be a most severe economic drain on our country, but would waste energy and time. ...  Once we attain the space capability, a lack of centralized authority would certainly hamper our peaceful use of space and could be disastrous in time of war. Failure to properly
