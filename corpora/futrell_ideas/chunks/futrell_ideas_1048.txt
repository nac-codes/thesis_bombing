Failure to properly coordinate peaceful space activities under common direction could cause confusion, might result in wrong decisions, and would be a safety hazard. In war, when time is of the essence and quick reaction so necessary, centralized military authority will surely be mandatory.  A strong consideration as far as military space operations are concerned will always be the necessity for the failsafe concept. A substantial proportion of our forces must maintain the capability to make last-second decisions. This is one reason Iam convinced that man in space will be a most important factor.  Ninety-nine percent of the Earth’s atmosphere lies within twenty miles’ altitude above the Earth. To assure effective operations, there can be no division in responsibility between the control of the air up to twenty miles above the Earth’s surface and the space above it. Air Force facilities, communications, and experience exist now for centralized control of operations in the Earth’s atmosphere. This capability can easily be extended beyond the Earth’s atmosphere as our operations in space develop.  Before I close, I want tostress that I cannot conceive that mechanical gadgets will control space. Man will develop the equipment, send it off, and bring it back. On many occasions, and probably more than we envision now, man will fly the equipment. The point here is that man’s judgment and skills will always be needed.  552  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 574 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  In his address White also pointed out that "the United States’ capability to control space could ultimately approach absolute deterrence" because reconnaissance eyes in outer space would permit "immediate warning of hostile action on the surface of the Earth" and would allow "much faster reaction on our part .. .
