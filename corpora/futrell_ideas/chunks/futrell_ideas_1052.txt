December 1959, the Air Force stated: "Aerospace is an operationally indivisible medium consisting of the total expanse beyond the earth’s surface. The forces of the Air Force comprise a family of operating systems—air systems, ballistic missiles, and space vehicle systems. These are the fundamental aerospace forces of the nation."  Except for the recognition that control in aerospace was apt to require different techniques from those practiced in gaining and maintaining control of the air, the Air Force viewed the atmosphere and space as one realm and saw no reason why the Key West definitions of strategic roles and missions should not continue to guide the organization of the Armed Forces. The Department of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and significant portions of the civilian scientific community differed with the Air Force positions on aerospace and aerospace power. The resolution of these diverse views would have a substantial impact on national organization for defense and for the utilization of space.  554  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 576 --- MISSILE TECHNOLOGY  NOTES  1.
