Twining warned that each service was attempting to attain  574  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 596 --- IMPACT OF MISSILES AND SPACE  "service self-sufficiency," whereas most tasks were becoming the common objectives of all three services.

He doubted that they would be accepted except as a war-induced emergency measure. His main hope for increased service unification lay in the establishment of unified commands.

In this respect, they differ from requirements that develop when you try to plan for meeting all kinds of war, in all areas, with all kinds of weapons." Twining favored the creation of additional unified commands: a joint Strategic Air Command, for example, should be established along the lines of the Continental Air Defense Command. In unified commands, men of all services could become identified as members of a common mission— men of an oriented force.  In its report of Twining’s address, the Washington Daily News asserted that the Air Force had begun "blowing the bugles for closer unification and eventual merger of the Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force." This assertion appeared to have some validity. In his testimony before the Symington subcommittee in April 1956, retired Gen Carl Spaatz had stated that the Department of Defense should be organized "with a single military chief of staff under the Secretary of Defense plus a general staff."* In a speech in San Francisco on 1 June 1956, Gen Thomas D. White, the Air Force vice chief of staff, pointed out that new weapons were causing the roles and missions of the services to overlap more and more. To provide a military organization "that will help us all to be free of conflicting
