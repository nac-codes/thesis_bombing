technology has virtually destroyed the traditional basis for services organized around strategic land, sea, and air missions. ... There is historical irony in the fact that the Air Force achieved its organic separation from the Army at the threshold of the decline of airpower and the rise of missile power."  Ina study entitled "Service Roles and Missions in the Future," completed in May 1958, the Air War College Evaluation Staff had noted that the media of operations  585  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 607 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  originally had determined the strategic functions of land, sea, and air forces. The emergence of new weapon systems, however, had reduced the effect of media on operations. The Evaluation Staff, therefore, had recommended that "we must begin to relate task or mission to weapon system and to arrange weapon systems into appropriate groupings for management purposes.""* In a high-priority project assigned on 14 May 1959, the Evaluation Staff prepared a detailed study looking toward the implementation of a single-service concept. The study was completed in basic form on 31 July 1959 and was transmitted to the Air Force plans directorate, which bound extracts from it with other "think papers" in standard black binders and circulated the package for comment. The study also was published in the Air University Quarterly Review during the summer of 1960. Entitled "Study on Single Service," the article proposed that the Department of Defense could move toward a single service in five evolutionary steps and that the beginning of the evolutionary changes could be made under authority permitted by the Defense Reorganization Act of 1958. In a preliminary step, a joint reorganization task force should be established to prepare basic planning. In an activation step, the Joint Chiefs of Staff should be divorced from service affiliations and used as the nucleus for a national military council that would advise a single chief of staff of the ar
