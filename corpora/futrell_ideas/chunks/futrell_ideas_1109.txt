"We have very little duplication now left in the services," Admiral Burke testified. "What could happen is the elimination of one whole element, so you donâ€™t have that element at all, and thereby leave yourself wide open, betting that just one thing is going to happen."  In its support for the Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1958, the Air Force had assumed that the new organization would increase the importance of unified commands and, by vesting primary responsibility for stating force requirements in the unified commanders, would permit a more realistic allocation of available defense dollars.

Thus, even though they were theoretically reduced in stature by the defense reorganization, the military departments continued to exercise the power of the budget. In explaining the problem, General White observed that "as a service chief, I am always trying to get the best I can for my service." But within the Air Force, White had to resolve the competing requests for funds submitted by the Strategic Air Command, the Air Defense Command, and the Tactical Air Command.
