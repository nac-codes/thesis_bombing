General White saw a good possibility that the Tactical Air Command and the Continental Army Forces might well be placed in a single unified command.

With the advent of missiles, such existing methods of coordinating strategic attacks would be adequate only in the unlikely circumstance that the United States would exercise the initiative and could carefully determine and prepare every facet of the operation in advance.” In context with the defense reorganization of 1958, the Air Force also assumed that a unified strategic command might well be organized to control both the Air Force’s strategic air and missile forces and the Navy’s Polaris- equipped submarine forces.
