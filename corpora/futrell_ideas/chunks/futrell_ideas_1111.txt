ositive decision, General White formally requested the establishment of a unified US strategic command. He urged that both the Strategic Air Command and a Polaris submarine command would be subordinated to the unified strategic command. General Power supported this proposal. "I think," he said early in 1960, "that all strategic weapon systems should be under one central command, whether it is commanded by an Air Force officer, naval officer, or Army officer is a moot question."”” Admiral Burke, on the other hand, described the Air Force proposal as "unsound and impractical." He argued that it would not be practical to take operational command of Polaris vessels away from fleet commanders since the movements of these submarines would have to be coordinated with those of many other naval vessels that would be operating in the same waters at the same time. Once a Polaris submarine had fired its strategic missiles, moreover, it would be expected to operate on missions similar to those of other submarines. "The Navy," Burke emphasized, "has behind it generations of experience in the operation of sea-based weapons systems. To depart from the principle of the integrated, balanced fleet at this critical time in history by assigning Polaris submarines to a command charged with operating land-based strategic bombers and missiles would weaken our Nation’s ability to strike back."”2  The unified US strategic command was not established. Instead, the question of operational control of Polaris submarine forces was decided on 17 August 1960 when Secretary Gates established the Joint Strategic Target Planning Agency and designated General Power as director, strategic target planning. A Navy admiral  588  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 610 --- IMPACT OF MISSILES AND SPACE  was designated as deputy director, strategic target planning, and the agency comprised officers from each of the services, representatives from the unified commands, and a liaison group from the joint staff
