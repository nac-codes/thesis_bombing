to one of the services for production and employment. McElroy announced that responsibility for the development of an antimissile missile would be assigned to the agency, and he implied that responsibility for other missiles might have been assigned to the special agency except that these programs were too far along.’°  These sweeping decisions by the secretary of defense were not entirely agreeable to some highly placed defense officials, who recognized a need for a defense office with authority to make policy decisions but objected to establishing a defense agency that would have development and contractual powers. Believing that there was need for a staff organization to handle research and development in space flight, the Air Force deputy chief of staff for development established a Directorate of Astronautics on 10 December 1957. However, McElroy rejected recommendations opposing the special defense agency, and the Air Force order establishing a Directorate of Astronautics was revoked on 13 December, reportedly because of pressure from Holaday and Quarles.’’ When he appeared before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on 9 January 1958, however, Maj Gen Bernard A. Schriever emphasized that the Air Force already possessed capabilities to initiate an astronautics development program with no dilution or diversion of its ballistic missile programs. Schriever saw a need for a defense authority that would formulate policy and approve programs, but he warned that "any program to establish a separate astronautics management agency would result in duplication of capabilities already existing in the Air Force ballistic missile programs at a cost in funds and time similar to that already expended on these programs."  Overruling service objections, Secretary McElroy proceeded with his plans for the organization of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). With Eisenhower’s approval, funds for ARPA research and development were included in the fiscal year 1959 defens
