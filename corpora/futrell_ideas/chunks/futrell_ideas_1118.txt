at, in certain cases, that these combat missions of the Air Force will be taken over, to a large extent, by what you would call space weapons systems — ballistic missiles, satellites, and space craft." Schriever also argued that a separation of research and development from operations prevented an employment of the principle of concurrent development that had so greatly compressed the time required to establish an initial operational capability with ballistic missiles. Responding to a pointed question, Schriever recommended that ARPA be liquidated as of 30 June 1959, that policy guidance and program approval be centered in the Office of Director of Defense Research and Engineering, and that space research and development projects be returned to the military services.  In an appearance before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Army spokesmen posited: "Space is a newly entered, largely unknown medium which transcends the exclusive interest of any service or even of the Department of Defense." Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker emphasized the Army position that space exploration was a national effort, and he believed that ARPA had served to prevent "cutthroat" competition in the field. 87 Before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, Lt Gen Arthur G. Trudeau, chief of Army research and development, argued that since no single service had been assigned sole responsibility for military space activities ARPA filled "a very great need, and should not be eliminated. "88 Dr York also foresaw a continuing requirement for ARPA. "Since it is envisioned that military space activities will cut across all military operations," he reasoned, "it would be difficult to attempt to assign all military space operations to any one military service."®  The position of the Navy in regard to ARPA appeared to be somewhat between those of the Army and the Air Force. Secretary of the Navy Thomas S. Gates, Jr., stated that "the Navy’s aim
