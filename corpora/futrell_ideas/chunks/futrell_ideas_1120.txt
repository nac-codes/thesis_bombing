ng into being, operationally, the particular system required to provide the service." When developed, operational military space systems would be turned over to existing unified or specified commanders.“ Holaday, who had now been named chairman of the NASA-DOD Civilian-Military Liaison Committee, also recommended that "military operations in space must come under a unified or specified command."  In a formal memorandum for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 18 September 1959, Secretary McElroy ruled that a joint military organization with control over operational space systems did not appear to be desirable at that time. In this memorandum McElroy further expressed his opinion that the number of military satellite vehicles that would be launched in the next several years would not be very large and that the utilization of the existing organization of the military departments appeared preferable to the establishment of a joint military organization to control operational space systems. McElroy, therefore, made the Department of the Air Force responsible for the development, production, and launching of space boosters and the necessary systems integration of payloads incident to this activity. He announced impending transfers of developed systems from ARPA to the military departments: the Air Force would be assigned responsibility for Samos (Sentry) and Midas; the Transit navigational satellite would be assigned to the Navy; and the Army would receive operational charge of the Notus communications satellites, including Courier (a delayed repeater communications system) and Advent (an active instantaneous relay system). These systems would remain under ARPA until development was completed, and, even after the systems were transferred, McElroy indicated that ARPA would continue in being as the Defense Department’s agency for advanced military research.  In accordance with McElroy’s decision the Air Force was assigned responsibility in November 1959 for the pro
