would continue in being as the Defense Department’s agency for advanced military research.  In accordance with McElroy’s decision the Air Force was assigned responsibility in November 1959 for the production of Samos and Midas and also for Discoverer, the latter being a project to test components, propulsion, and guidance systems to be used in other satellite projects and to develop techniques for the recovery of space capsules. Secretary of Defense Gates was subsequently asked to reconsider the McElroy decision on space systems; but on 16 June 1960 Gates, too, determined that the establishment of a joint military organization for the control of operational space systems did not appear necessary or immediately desirable. Secretary Gates further directed that the services would make provisions  593  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 615 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  looking toward an orderly transfer of space systems to using unified or specified commands, thereby accepting by inference the Air Force position that the systems should be so assigned.” With the passing of time virtually all defense space projects were taken out of the hands of ARPA and transferred to the individual military services. ARPA continued to conduct projects of very broad interest such as research on materials, solid propellant chemistry, detection of nuclear tests, long-range studies on antimissile defense, and research in the fields of toxics and energy conversion.  In the period of crisis in the autumn of 1957, the Department of Defense had made decisions on the subject of space organization on the basis of a belief that space was a vast unknown that lay outside existing roles and missions of the armed services. From this position the Department of Defense gradually moved toward acceptance of the proposition expressed by General Schriever: "Space ...is a medium in which many military missions can be accomplished more effectively. Actually, it can be better understood when it is viewed a
