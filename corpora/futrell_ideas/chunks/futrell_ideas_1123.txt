One of Killian’s first tasks was to visualize a national space program; he later noted that he approached the task with already firm ideas.

This is true because space exploration involves numerous activities and objectives that are outside the defense domain.!  As has been seen, President Eisenhower’s report to the American people, which he made less than a week after Killian took office, stated distinctive criteria for space projects that were undertaken for scientific and defense purposes.
