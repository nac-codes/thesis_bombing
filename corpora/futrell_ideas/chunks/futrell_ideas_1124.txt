arms control in space related back to a belief that international control of the military use of atomic energy, as a State Department spokesman said, "could have been attained with relative ease" in 1946. As has been seen, the United States pursued this line of diplomacy throughout 1957 and President Eisenhower continued to advocate it during the spring of 1958. On 12 January 1958 Eisenhower wrote Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin saying: "I proposed that we agree that outer space should be used only for peaceful purposes. We face a decisive moment in history in relation to this matter. Both the Soviet Union and the United States are now using outer space for the testing of missiles designed for military purposes.

In another letter to Bulganin on 15 February 1958, however, Eisenhower renewed his plea: "A terrible new menace can be seen to be in the making. That menace is to be found in the use of outer space for war purposes. The time to deal with that menace is now. It would be tragic if the Soviet leaders were blind or indifferent toward this menace as they were apparently blind or indifferent to the atomic and nuclear menace at its inception a decade ago." Although the Soviets were not immediately responsive to these proposals, the US State Department accepted them as a sincere objective. "The most immediate problem in the field of space foreign policy," a State Department official said on 14 May 1958, "is how to ensure that outer space is used for peaceful purposes only."1°  In connection with a study of space science and technology that it was making at Eisenhower’s request, the President’s Science Advisory Committee headed by Doctor Killian prepared a brief report, "Introduction to Outer Space," which was released on 26 March 1958. The panel of scientists dist
