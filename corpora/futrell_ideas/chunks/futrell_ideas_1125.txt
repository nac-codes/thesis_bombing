s request, the President’s Science Advisory Committee headed by Doctor Killian prepared a brief report, "Introduction to Outer Space," which was released on 26 March 1958. The panel of scientists distinguished four factors that gave "importance, urgency, and inevitability" to the advancement of space technology. These factors were said to be "the compelling urge of man to explore and discover," "the defensive objective for the development of space technology,"  595  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 617 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  "the factor of national prestige," and the fact that "space technology affords new opportunities for scientific observation and experiment which will add to our knowledge and understanding of the Earth, the solar system, and the universe." The scientists noted that the development of military rockets had provided the technological base for space exploration, but they believed that the important and foreseeable military uses for military space vehicles lay in the fields of communication and reconnaissance. Visualizations of satellite bombers or military bases on the moon did not "hold up well on close examination or appear to be achievable at an early date." Such military developments would become technologically possible in time, but they would be "clumsy and ineffective ways of doing a job." "In short," the report concluded, "the Earth would appear to be, after all, the best weapons carrier." This report apparently reinforced President Eisenhower’s conviction that the world bore a great responsibility to promote the peaceful use of space. "I recommend," Eisenhower informed Congress on 2 April 1958, "that aeronautical and space science activities sponsored by the United States be conducted under the direction of a civilian agency, except for those projects primarily associated with military requirements." 3  During the early months of 1958, proposals were made looking toward the establishment of an international space agency
