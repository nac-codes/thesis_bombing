recommended that the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 be amended to add a division of outer space development to the Atomic Energy Commission, or that an entirely new commission on outer space be established following the precedent of the Atomic Energy Commission.!®  596  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 618 --- IMPACT OF MISSILES AND SPACE  In a speech in Washington on 14 January 1958, retired Air Force Gen Orval R. Cook, president of the Aircraft Industries Association, apparently first proposed the seemingly simple solution that the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) already provided an existing organization capable of accelerating space exploration. 7 Two days later a meeting of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics resolved that the NACA statutory authority to "supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight, with a view to their practical solution" was broad enough to cover spaceflight as well as atmospheric flight and that NACA had "an important responsibility for coordinating and for conducting research in space technology either in its own laboratories or by contract, and, therefore, should expand its existing program and add supplementary facilities to those now available as necessary." Following these suggestions, President Eisenhower, in his message to Congress on 2 April 1958, recommended the establishment of a new national aeronautics and space administration into which NACA would be absorbed. When he signed the Space Act into law, Eisenhower remarked: "The present National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, with its large and competent staff and well-equipped laboratories, will provide the nucleus for NASA. The NACA has an established record of research performance and of cooperation with the Armed Services. The coordination of space exploration responsibilities with the NACA’s traditional aeronautical research function is a natural evolution."!°  The Eisenhower proposal for the legislation, which would be
