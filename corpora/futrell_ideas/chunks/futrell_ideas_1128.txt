e coordination of space exploration responsibilities with the NACA’s traditional aeronautical research function is a natural evolution."!°  The Eisenhower proposal for the legislation, which would be known as the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, was drafted by NACA and Doctor Killian. Since the president was said to be eager to have the legislation go to Congress prior to its Easter recess, the draft bill was sent to the Department of Defense for review and comment on 26 March, with a deadline for receipt of replies set at noon on 31 March. Inside the Pentagon, the Department of the Air Force and other military agencies were given 24 hours to study and comment on the proposed law, identical copies of which were introduced into the Senate and House on 2 April!

The exceptions were that the management of NASA would be vested in a single director, there was no provision for a military liaison committee, and there was no legislative oversight committee as was the case with the Atomic Energy Commission.“~ In NACA, control had been exercised by a 17-member committee (including two members from the Navy, two from the Air Force, and six from other specified federal agencies), which elected a director. In the proposal for NASA, the president would appoint the administrator and an advisory National Aeronautics and Space Board with a maximum of 17 members, of whom not more than eight (including not less than one from the Department of Defense) would be from government departments or agencies. NASA was to have wide authority for developing, testing, launching, and operating aeronautical and space vehicles. The proposed legislation also provided that NASA would exercise "control over aeronautical and space research sponsored by the United States, except insofar as  597  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 619 ---
