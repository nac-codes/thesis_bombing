cy," and "that we should have one space program."!3! General Schriever differed with both of these opinions. "I feel," he said, "that the world in which we live — being what it is our national security must have first priority. In other words, our ability to maintain the peace has to have first priority. Therefore, I can only conclude that the important military programs should have first priority." The most important equation in research and development was management as a function of time: the best means of beating the clock was the concept of concurrency that had permitted rapid acceleration of the intercontinental ballistic missile capability. Already, Schriever said, NASA was placing competitive orders with contractors working for the Air Force. Schriever considered that the most serious threat to concurrency, however, was the idea being suggested that NASA "could become a ministry of supply type of organization which develops complete systems and turns them over to the military." Believing firmly in the concurrency concept whereby weapon systems were developed by the operating service, Schriever firmly opposed any idea that NASA  601  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 623 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  should be designed to become a national space commission and allowed to develop space weapon systems for operation by the military services. }°? Although Schriever apparently feared the effect of NASA’s competition on military space programs, the official Air Force policy sought to get an acceleration of aerospace hardware even if it had to divert key officers from its own programs. In March 1959 General LeMay stated that the Air Force would make its personnel freely available for service in agencies of the Department of Defense concerned with space activities and in NASA.  Only mildly apparent in the spring of 1959, discontent with the National Aeronautics and Space Act among certain elements within the Department of Defense burst into full flame in
