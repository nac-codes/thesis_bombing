Up until this time the Saturn program had been replete with starts and stops, allegedly because of a feeling within Defense Department scientific circles that there was no military requirement for ballistic missiles larger than those programmed and that there would be no necessity for a military space platform. As a part of the continuing evaluation of the large multithrust booster problem, Doctor York convened a review committee in September to study the three planned boosters—Titan C, Saturn, and Nova. As a result of this study Doctor York was said to have agreed that the Saturn should be continued under development but that the project would have to be transferred to NASA since the Department of Defense could not finance it within its budgetary limitations. On 21 October President Eisenhower announced that he would transfer the Army’s rocket development team and the Saturn booster to NASA. The commander of the Army Ordnance Missile Command, Maj Gen John B. Medaris, described the Army’s agreement to the transfer of the Saturn and the von Braun missile team to NASA as a Solomon’s choice. "First," he said, "by the assignment of the space vehicle development, production, and launching mission to the Air Force, and secondly, the Army’s total inability to secure from the Department of Defense sufficient money or responsibility to do the Saturn job properly, we found ourselves .. . in the position of either agreeing with the transfer of the team, or watching it be destroyed by starvation and frustration."">> In the middle of this winter of Army discontent, President Eisenhower sent Congress a message on 14 January 1960 proposing amendments to the National Aeronautics and Space Act.
