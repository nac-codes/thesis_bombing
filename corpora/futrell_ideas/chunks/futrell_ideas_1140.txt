ropulsion Laboratory, agreed that the nation required a single space program; but he asserted that the program should be attained by strengthening NASA "to the point where it effectively controls a complete national space program." Pickering charged that the divided authority in the space field was powerless to "prevent military space systems of only peripheral value from demanding such a large share of research support in both the Department of Defense and perhaps the NASA that these efforts dominate the space program to the detriment of our real objectives." His concluding remarks summarized his position:  603  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 625 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  I feel that at the present time it is more important that the primary effort in space be civilian oriented rather than military oriented. In other words, my feeling is that the military applications of space are not clearly defined at this time, that this may very well develop; in fact, past experience would say almost surely that it will develop, but I would regard this as being a natural development out of a program which is oriented in the direction of a civilian space program.  In their testimony, Under Secretary of the Air Force Joseph V. Charyk, General White, and General Schriever opposed all of the proposals to establish "a single monolithic space agency." "From a national standpoint," Schriever stated, "progress in space research is essential for both security and prestige. Civilian and military space operations complement each other, and both should be pursued vigorously." Asked to explain the thoughts behind his assertion that NASA and national defense objectives in space were divergent, Schriever explained that this divergence had been obscured by the fact that NASA was compelled to use military rockets as boosters. Looking toward the future, he pointed out that NASA would develop unique experimental equipment that might be used for only a few scientific probes under
