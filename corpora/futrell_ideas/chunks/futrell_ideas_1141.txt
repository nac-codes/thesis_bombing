compelled to use military rockets as boosters. Looking toward the future, he pointed out that NASA would develop unique experimental equipment that might be used for only a few scientific probes under controlled circumstances. Most NASA probes would be handled by temporary task force organizations, and NASA would not require a large and permanent field organization. Military space systems, on the other hand, would be required in quantity, would have to be simple and reliable, and would need to be standardized and made capable of fairly long employment life. The defense systems would have to strive to reduce the cost per launch, while NASA could afford to pay larger prices for the lesser numbers of scientific probes that it would mount.!° Based on this line of reasoning as well as the fact that the Air Force was enjoying harmonious relations with NASA, Schriever interjected "that we are fast approaching the old, very good relationship that we had with the old NACA." Thus, the Air Force was not only eager to continue the existing space organization but was also entirely willing to support Eisenhower’s proposed amendments to the Space Act.“  The statements of Charyk, White, and Schriever in support of the existing NASA-Defense Department relationship apparently indicated that the Air Force policy of cooperation had borne positive results. Schriever’s earlier fears that NASA and the Department of Defense might compete for the services of scarce space technologists had apparently not materialized. In reference to this widely expressed belief that the nation’s technological resources could not support two space programs, Dr Simon Ramo, vice president of the Thompson- Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, pointed out that there was no shortage of national technical resources to support a vastly increased and even duplicative missile and space program. Ramo said: "If we chose to do so—and this is only a slight exaggeration —we could almost have space probes or ICBM’s coming out of o
