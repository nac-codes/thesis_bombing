a vastly increased and even duplicative missile and space program. Ramo said: "If we chose to do so—and this is only a slight exaggeration —we could almost have space probes or ICBM’s coming out of our ears." By the spring of 1960 Brig Gen Don R. Ostrander and several other Air Force officers had been assigned to NASA. In the same period that the congressional hearings were under way on the proposed reorganization of the  604  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 626 --- IMPACT OF MISSILES AND SPACE  national space effort, NASA requested the assignment to it of still more key project officers from the Ballistic Missiles Division— men whom Schriever considered to be greatly needed for his own developmental programs. Learning of Schriever’s reluctance to assign the men to NASA and concerned about the proposals to reorganize NASA along the lines of the Atomic Energy Commission, General White believed that the time was right for "a sermon from the Chief of Staff to his staff." On 14 April 1960, White issued a memorandum saying:  Iam convinced that one of the major long range elements of the Air Force future lies in space. It is also obvious that NASA will play a large part in the national effort in this direction and, moreover, inevitably will be closely associated, if not eventually combined with the military. It is perfectly clear to me that particularly in these formative years the Air Force must, for its own good as well as for national interest, cooperate to the maximum extent with NASA, to include the furnishing of key personnel even at the expense of some Air Force dilution of technical talent.  White later explained why he had issued the memorandum. "The sole purpose," he said, "of this memorandum —and I think I stated it very clearly—is that I want to make it crystal clear that the policy is we will cooperate with NASA — and to the very limit of our ability and even beyond, to the extent of some risk in our own programs."
