tal clear that the policy is we will cooperate with NASA — and to the very limit of our ability and even beyond, to the extent of some risk in our own programs."  In the early stages of the hearings of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Deputy Secretary of Defense James H. Douglas expressed support for Eisenhower’s proposed amendments of the Space Act. He agreed that the Civilian-Military Liaison Committee had been ineffective and ought to be eliminated, but he still wished to see effective liaison established between the Department of Defense and NASA. Accordingly, on 14 March 1960 Douglas proposed that cooperation between the Defense Department and NASA be attained by establishing an aeronautics and astronautics coordinating board; the deputy administrator of NASA and the director of defense research and engineering would serve as co-chairmen of the board, with supervision over subordinate board panels that would be established from NASA and Defense Department managerial personnel to handle matters of mutual interest. Under Secretary Charyk warmly supported this proposal, which he described as a broader projection of the Air Force-NASA discussions looking toward the establishment of a committee of responsible people to handle launch vehicle matters.""’ Doctor Glennan agreed that much of the improvised coordination that already existed between the Defense Department and NASA would well be formalized; he also announced his support for the establishment of the aeronautics and astronautics coordinating board.!8 When it reported out the space organization bill in the first week of May 1960, the House Committee on Science and Astronautics added a provision establishing the Aeronautics and Astronautics Coordinating Board."*  After the matter had been further discussed Glennan and Douglas signed an administrative agreement on 1 July 1960 that established the Aeronautics and Astronautics Coordinating Board (AACB).
