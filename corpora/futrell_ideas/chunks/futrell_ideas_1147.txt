But we feel that under those circumstances, all-out war would probably not break out, because no man would deliberately throw us into that sort of a holocaust where he and everything else would be destroyed."»> For some time General Taylor believed that the Navy and the Marines had been moving closer to the Army position that nuclear stalemate was likely and that the United States should emphasize developing forces for limited war. In the winter of 1957-58 Taylor observed that "the Navy and Marine Corps were ready to join in recommending changes that would take into account the implications of nuclear parity, establish finite limits on the size for atomic retaliatory force, and in general make for a flexible strategy for coping with limited aggression."~” "Given a shield of mutual deterrence," said Secretary of the Navy Gates, "power to prevent limited aggression and win limited war becomes decisive."97"A general nuclear war now means," agreed Admiral Burke, "that both the United States and Russia would be most severely damaged. Under these circumstances, initiation of a general war by Russia seems unlikely so long as we have the capability of destroying her.""’” In appearances before congressional committees early in 1958, Burke pointed out that aircraft carriers were useful to  607  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 629 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  both general and limited war and that Polaris submarines, which promised to be "invulnerable to preemptive action by an enemy," would be a positive deterrent to war.
