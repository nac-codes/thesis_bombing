ll not rationally decide to start a war." td  Many civilian strategists accepted the concept of a nuclear stalemate and the requirements for limited war forces. Governor Rockefeller and the Rockefeller study panel "felt that there was increasing possibility that as the Soviets and ourselves reached equal capabilities of destruction there might — under the cover of our reluctance to use all-out force to oppose an action which did not seem warranted now knowing that such all-out action would bring major destruction in this country — be a nibbling away at the periphery by small wars [and] that we would not want to use all-out retaliation to oppose." 0 In January 1958 Paul H.

Nitze’s proposal was not so much concerned with deterring war as in confining war. He considered that the requirements for graduated deterrence involved the maintenance of a superior western nuclear posture; the meeting of aggression without the use of atomic weapons where this was possible; the determination not to extend geographically limited hostilities to other areas unless the situation could not be resolved effectively otherwise; an avoidance of attacks against industrial and population centers and the use of atomic weapons against military objectives primarily for attainment of control of the air; and the building of western nonatomic elements of strength in order to reduce the extent to which security would depend on atomic weapons.  In discussions as early as 1956, General LeMay had been willing to admit in theory that a smaller size force might present a deterrent effect upon an enemy, but he still held to his definition that effective deterrence required the United States to maintain a force strong enough to absorb the losses from a Soviet surprise attack and then to inflict damage that would be "unacceptable" on an
