that effective deterrence required the United States to maintain a force strong enough to absorb the losses from a Soviet surprise attack and then to inflict damage that would be "unacceptable" on an enemy. "It is reasonable to assume," he observed, "that the original force without losses should certainly be initially stronger than the Soviet force." Speaking in August 1956 Secretary of the Air Force Quarles believed that "the problem before the world today is a problem of deterrence" and that "the build-up of atomic power ...makes total war an unthinkable catastrophe." Quarles proposed that the relative force strength of the United States and the Soviet Union was less important than "the absolute power in the hands of each, and in the substantial invulnerability of this power to interdiction." He argued that it was necessary only to maintain a level of strength which he called "mission capability" and pointed out that it was "neither necessary nor desirable . . . to maintain strength above that level." Quarles’s statement was useful in explaining why the Air Force could safely reduce its force from the 137-wing level, which had been justified as critical to the security of the nation; his statement seemed to equate deterrence with the maintenance of capabilities for massive retaliation. Also speaking in 1956, while he was still Air  608  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 630 --- IMPACT OF MISSILES AND SPACE  Force chief of staff, General Twining emphasized counterforce rather than massive retaliation when he said: "If we are attacked, the Air Force’s main job is to knock out the Russian long-range air force and their capability to deliver strikes against the United States."  Partly to cause uncertainties among the enemy, neither President Eisenhower nor Secretary of State John Foster Dulles ever exactly defined massive retaliation. As has been seen, the acceptance of massive retaliation in 1954 did not lead the Joint Chiefs of Staff to change the categories of
