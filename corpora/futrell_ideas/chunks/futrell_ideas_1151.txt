after having been hit first, to strike back, "retaliate," with sufficient atomic power to wipe out the enemy’s major urban centers. This is massive retaliation. The targets are cities; the forces used are those that survive the initial attack; and the objective is to devastate the enemy nation to the extent that it would not be able to capitalize on its act of aggression. . . . Now, the ability to destroy cities—the main target of massive retaliation — may constitute a deterrent to surprise attack against the United States. It does not, however, in any way deter aggression anywhere in the world, including NATO. What has deterred aggression in Europe and in other vital areas for the past ten years has been primarily the counterforce aspect of the general-war capability backed up by the expressed willingness to use any and all forces to defend the free world if it should become necessary.°  On the conceptual level, General Walsh reasoned in December 1957 that Air Force thinking had turned full circle away from the Mitchell-Douhet doctrines of waging strategic air war against enemy industrial capabilities and had returned to the older doctrines of Carl von Clausewitz and Alfred von Schlieffen that considered enemy military forces in being as the prime objectives of war effort.1©” Seen in terms of a counterforce strategy the requirements for strategic air striking  609  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 631 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  forces had to be calculated in terms of its capabilities and vulnerabilities in destroying hostile target systems — not in terms of the residuum that might remain after an enemy surprise attack. By early 1959 the United States air war plan was based upon an analysis and screening of over 20,000 targets in Soviet-bloc nations. Although nothing was immediately published on the extremely sensitive subject, air targeting apparently became much more exact in the years after 1955-56 when the very high altitude U-2 reconnaissance a
