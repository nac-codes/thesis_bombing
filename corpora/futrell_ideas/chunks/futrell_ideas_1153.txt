While he granted that limited conflict "could occur in primitive countries," he argued that the United States would never consider a Soviet attack against NATO as a limited war. "We better never let anyone," he said, "get the mistaken idea that we are not going to use our big weapons if they are needed."2”1 Speaking as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Twining said: "I personally do not believe you can say that any particular form of war is more likely than any other."
