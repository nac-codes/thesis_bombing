mitted under questioning that no Army forces would have been required in a Formosan operation. "If we had to go into Formosa in sizable strength," he said, "... it would be largely an air and naval operation." As he looked at the problem of limited war, however, Taylor saw "primarily an Army requirement related to sustained combat on the ground, which is an Army task." Viewing the problem of limited war in this light, he urged a five-point program to improve limited war capabilities; namely, the modernization of appropriate equipment, the improved strategic mobility of limited war forces, the use of preplanned airlift and sealift, expanded joint planning and training, and the advertisement of such limited war strength once it was a reality.!8  While the national military leaders tended to draw different lessons from Lebanon and Quemoy, there were some essential elements of agreement. In its report of the fiscal year 1959 military budget, the House Committee on Appropriations had called for a new study of the role of the super aircraft carrier in modern warfare. After Lebanon and Quemoy, Admiral Burke could state that "the deployed attack carrier task force with modern aircraft—teamed with a marine landing force —is the logical ready military force to counter the threats of limited war in many areas of the world."'®” Without derogating the importance of the aircraft carrier, General Taylor’s personal opinion was that "we have an ample number of carriers."
