limited war give us the greatest possible opportunity to win such wars at a minimum cost to us and to the country we may be defending against aggression, but that it is highly probable that without the use of such weapons our chances of winning in many areas are slim indeed." Smith ruled out the possibility of a limited war in Europe, but he suggested that tactical nuclear weapons could have been precisely employed with great effect in Korea and in Indochina without serious danger of having provoked all-out war. To prevent haphazard employment of nuclear weapons in a limited war, he stated that higher authority would have to provide a local war commander with explicit objectives, including a restriction on strikes outside a delimited zone of hostilities. He noted that new criteria for tactical nuclear targets needed to be developed: these could include "situation-control" targets such as narrow gorges in mountains that could be closed by landslides or forest cover which could be defoliated with nuclear weapons, thus denying concealment to an enemy. "We must achieve through education and through the development of clear-cut, logical tactical doctrine," Smith concluded, "a general acceptance by the United States of the requirement for the use of nuclear weapons in limited war. This country cannot afford the tremendous outlay in dollars, resources, and men needed to defeat aggression by man-to-man combat on the ground, supported only by high-explosive bombs and rockets, napalm, and machine-cannon fire delivered from the air," Although General Smithâ€™s article was well reasoned, the Lebanon and Taiwan crises, nevertheless, had demonstrated that American political and military leaders were reluctant to commit nuclear weapons to limited wars. After a study of the matter, Col Albert P. Sights, Jr., concluded: "The crises in Lebanon and in the Taiwan Strait ... marked a turning point in relying on nuclear weapons for limited wars. Thereafter planners were more inclined to a
