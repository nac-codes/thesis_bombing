neral Taylor, who in an unpublished article prepared in 1956, expressed the view that:  The avoidance of deliberate general atomic war should not be too difficult since its unrenumerative character must be clear to the potential adversaries. Although actual stockpile sizes are closely guarded secrets, a nation need only feel reasonably sure that an opponent has some high-yield weapons, no matter how indefinite. their exact number, to be impressed with the possible consequences of attacking him.2”  In his appearance before the Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations on 29 January 1959, General Taylor first informed the public of the schism in strategic thought within the Department of Defense. Taking note of the fact that he would retire as Army chief of staff on 30 June, Taylor stated flatly that the nation had an excessive number of strategic weapons and weapon systems in its atomic retaliatory force—the aggregate of bombers in the Air Force, the Navy, and the oversea American and allied commands; the ICBMs and IRBMs in the Air Force; and the Polaris system in the Navy. Taylor reasoned that it was  possible to establish the fact Taylor reasoned that it was possible that "x" targets successfully attacked with "y" megatons is equal to the destruction of the enemy. ...Then, having determined the bombs required on target, you can calculate all the possible losses due to enemy action, aborts, ineffectiveness of the weapons, and so forth, and determine how many delivery vehicles are required. When such a computation is made, you end up, in my book, not with thousands, but with hundreds of vehicles as a requirement.
