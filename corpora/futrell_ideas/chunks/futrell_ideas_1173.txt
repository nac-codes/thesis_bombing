spokesmen found it difficult to engage in a many-faced discussion of a new strategy without disclosing security aspects of the existing United States war plan. As the Department of Defense pointed out, moreover, it was practically impossible to answer General Taylor’s question: How much is enough? This question had always been one of the most difficult ones faced by military planners and was under constant study. But it was impossible to determine standards of sufficiency in neat categories of force commitments and still preserve the versatility and flexibility requisite to the fact that there was no clear line of demarcation that would be drawn between limited war forces and general war forces in all cases.“ Under these circumstances Air Force spokesmen found it necessary to debate the proposed new strategy in detail rather than in its generalities.  The central theme of the new deterrent strategy was the proposition that a general nuclear war had lost its utility as a means of resolving international conflict. "A nuclear war," the proponents of finite deterrence warned, "is too horrible to contemplate, too mutually annihilating to consider." For many years the Strategic Air Command had used the motto Peace is Our Profession, and a ranking Air Force commander had said, "if nuclear war breaks out, SAC has failed in its mission." General White, however, was unwilling to agree that all participants in a nuclear war would be defeated. "I think," he said, "nuclear war is something that is horrible and difficult to £ontemplate, but I am afraid that is the sort of thing civilization is faced with."*!° White consistently maintained that the United States and its allies "must possess combat capabilities which can deter or—if necessary — defeat" Soviet aerospace forces.“’ In briefings and papers prepared at the Rand Corporation and published as a book entitled On Thermonuclear War, physicist Herman Kahn presented the case that thermonuclear war was not unthinkable but proba
