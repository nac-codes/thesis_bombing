iefings and papers prepared at the Rand Corporation and published as a book entitled On Thermonuclear War, physicist Herman Kahn presented the case that thermonuclear war was not unthinkable but probable, and he reasoned that with proper precautions the United States could survive such a war even though great casualties were incurred.2!8 While many Defense spokesmen began to vistialize the prospect that the United States would seek to "prevail" rather than to "win" in a thermonuclear war, an Air Force policy paper submitted to Congress i in March 1960 insisted that the nation must possess a "war-winning capability."22 ° The Air Force considered that there were sound strategic reasons for maintaining a war-winning capability in its strategic striking forces. Retired Air Force Brig Gen S. F. Giffin also suggested that the rationale ofa military man required a concept that conflict could be resolved. "The military mind," he wrote, "cannot but accept General MacArthur’s dictum that there is no substitute for victory. Yet the meaning of victory in a total nuclear war would be more in terms of the survival of the United States as a self-determining power—and the elimination of the present principal threat to the integrity of the United States—than in terms of classic military triumph. 220  In view of the long-standing policy that the United States would not strike the first blow in a war, the Air Force had followed the policy during the 1950s that strategic capabilities must be prepared to accept the enemy’s first strike and then be able to strike back effectively. As long as the Strategic Air Command was the  621  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 643 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  nation’s main deterrent force, the matter of first or second strike was relatively unimportant since the maintenance of the command at a level of strength needed to survive a hostile first strike ensured that it would possess capabilities needed for a first strike.
