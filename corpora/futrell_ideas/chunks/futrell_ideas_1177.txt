As for the overkill charge, Power estimated that the Strategic Air Command received about 18 percent of the defense dollar while it carried more than 90 percent of the responsibility for deterrence. "If that is babying and pampering," he concluded, "I do not agree with you."  Although the Air Force began to advance counterforce as a more desirable alternative than finite deterrence, Air Force leaders were initially unable to provide a complete rationale for a counterforce strategy. At least at first, counterforce evolved not as a positive statement but in opposition to the "counter-city" aspects of finite deterrence. Writing in March 1959, as has been noted, Colonel Richardson determined that the counterforce aspect of the United States general war capability—rather than the massive retaliation aspect which would have been directed against Soviet cities—had been the effective deterrent to Soviet worldwide attack. "Failure to maintain the flexible counterforce capability we now have in our strategic effort," Richardson wrote, "will lead to establishing unlimited requirements for local defense operations. This is a policy which could lead to political, economic, and military bankruptcy, and which would almost inevitably spell defeat."“" Again, as has been seen, General Schriever informed a congressional committee of the need not only for a first-strike force but also for a positive deterrent force that could knock out "every military target which has the capability of waging total war against this Nation." Treading lightly in discussing a sensitive area, Schriever observed that because "we may not know where some targets are located today, it does not follow that we may not know where these targets are at some future date."227  In an Air Force anniversary statement in September 1959, General White categorically disagreed with the overk
