it does not follow that we may not know where these targets are at some future date."227  In an Air Force anniversary statement in September 1959, General White categorically disagreed with the overkill arguments. "Our strategic objective, in the event of global war," he said, "is to eliminate an enemy’s war making capacity in the minimum period of time. In determining the force requirements needed to do this, we must take into account not only the number, location, and vulnerability of the targets but the reliability, accuracy, and warhead yield of our weapons — as well as countless operational variables and our evaluation of expected enemy defenses." During the winter of 1959-60 the Air Force accepted the position that an effective force was a force in being, a force in place, and a force of such size and capability that, when measured against enemy surprise attack, retaliation by that force would be sufficient to ensure clearly unacceptable damage to the enemy; that it could destroy the enemy’s nuclear delivery capability in the event the United States was forced to take the initiative; and that it would ensure that the United States would prevail regardless of the circumstances under which deterrence might fail. Even though Air Force leaders now made a clear distinction between deterrence and war-winning capability, they continued to explain counterforce by revealing the  623  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 645 --- IDEAS, CONCEPTS, DOCTRINE  fallacy of minimum deterrence. If the United States limited the size of its long-range nuclear delivery force to a capability that would do nothing more than destroy some 100 Soviet cities, the US forces might be able to deter attack against the United States proper. However, if the Soviets attacked an ally of the United States, the possession of a minimum deterrent force would not permit the United States (even if it possessed strategic warning) to launch its forces against Soviet cities, thereby exposing its
