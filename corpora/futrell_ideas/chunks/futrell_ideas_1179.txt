United States, the possession of a minimum deterrent force would not permit the United States (even if it possessed strategic warning) to launch its forces against Soviet cities, thereby exposing itself to Soviet attack with forces that were undamaged by US strikes. On the other hand, if the United States finite deterrent failed and the enemy attacked, his first targets would doubtless be the US strategic forces. The enemy would do this to reduce the US ability to strike back, and he could well afford to save American cities as hostages for later attacks. With a minimum deterrent attrited by the enemy’s first strike, the United States would lack strength for any kind of counterforce effort. If the few remaining US forces attacked Soviet cities, the Soviets could return and easily destroy American cities. "Finite deterrence," the Air Force reasoned, "is purely a bluff strategy and does not include the capability for military victory. On the other hand, the clear capability to attain military victory would be the most reliable, longest lasting, and most widely applicable deterrent that the enemy could face. Thus we must plan a counterforce strategy and back it with the weapons systems needed in the amounts needed." At least three civilian strategists found reason in the Air Force arguments, for Robert Strausz-Hupe, William R. Kintner, and Stefan F. Possony soon described the strategy of finite deterrence as "a mutual suicide pact."20  Because they appeared to offer economy, a check on the arms race, and reduction of devastation, the proposals for minimum deterrence plus limited war and arms control were said to have been accepted by many intellectuals interested in military affairs, a vast majority of foreign and domestic lay analysts, and many military planners.”*!
