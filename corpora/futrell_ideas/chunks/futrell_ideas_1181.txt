well as for limited war capabilities and other purposes." Although the goal of maintaining an effective first-strike force would become increasingly difficult and even undesirable in terms of strategic stability, there were several reasons for making a continued effort to maintain counterforce capabilities. First, if a local or limited war should break out, the United States would be severely handicapped in its choices of action if it had no means of hitting elements of the enemy’s strategic force, while the enemy had substantial counterforce capabilities. Second, in a general nuclear war following a hostile first-strike, counterforce capabilities would enable the United States to conduct militarily useful operations and to minimize the damage to its population and industrial centers that might be inflicted by subsequent Soviet strategic strikes. Third, only by continuing research in counterforce weapons could the United States ensure against still unforeseen technological developments that might upset the strategic balance. Finally, American possession of counterforce weapons would force the Soviets to divert funds to expensive defense efforts that might otherwise be expanded for the creation of an overwhelming Soviet first-strike counterforce capability. In the chaos and confusion attending the launching of a second strike following an initial Soviet attack, the United States would quite probably attack both city and counterforce targets. The study, nevertheless, recommended that "in order to maximize the military value of such a strike and to minimize the dangers to civilian populations, a major effort can and should be made to direct the retaliatory attack against the enemy’s strategic forces and targets as much as conditions permit."  If the proponents of finite deterrence expected a change in security policy when newly appointed Secretary Gates began to put together the defense budget for fiscal year 1961, they were doomed to disappointment.
