ust bombing Russia for retaliation purposes. . . . The validity of our deterrent must be of such a character... that an enemy will believe his military power will be devastated.  In his appearances before congressional committees during the early months of  1960, Gen Lyman Lemnitzer, the new Army chief of staff, voiced his personal belief that the Soviets and the free world were approaching a period when both would possess "a virtually indestructible nuclear capability" and that this situation would render limited war more likely. "Under such circumstances," he remarked, "it seems to me that the most likely form of conflict may well involve the use of integrated land, sea, and air forces in their modernized, yet basically traditional, roles." Lemnitzer was not as adamant on the subject of overkill as his predecessor had been: he recognized that the development of highly effective Soviet surface-to- cair missile defenses promised to increase the attrition of American bombers.””° Appearing before these same committees, Navy officers continued to argue the case for finite deterrence and to stress overkill. Admiral Burke subscribed to all the statements he had made on these matters a year earlier, and he still felt that the United States was overconcentrating in retaliatory forces, although the balance was getting better. Just as he saw no reason why the United States should build overkill forces, he professed not to fear Soviet overkill. "No matter what Russia does," he said, "there is no possibility she can avoid destruction. She is going to get a terrific beating if she starts a war, no matter how or when. . If she builds 500 missiles or 2,000 missiles and does it in 7, 8, 10, ns 15 years, sometime in the future, it does not affect our deterrent capability." 7 Speaking even more positively than previously, Admiral Hayward asserted that if he could have his way he would put the entire deterrent force at sea. He specified the total number of megatons placed on targets
