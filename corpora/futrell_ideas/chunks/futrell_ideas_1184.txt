ven more positively than previously, Admiral Hayward asserted that if he could have his way he would put the entire deterrent force at sea. He specified the total number of megatons placed on targets in Russia that he considered to be adequate as a US deterrent. Although this total was not disclosed in the public record, Hayward noted that 45 Polaris submarines would " come close" to providing the total deterrent that the United States needed.”  In stating the Air Force requirement for a first-strike counterforce capability, General White characterized finite deterrence as equating with the abandoned Fortress America concept. He pointed out that finite deterrence would be extremely dangerous since such a posture would not provide the military forces needed "to minimize the damage on the United States under any circumstances." He also found finite deterrence inconsistent with requirements of modern war. "Modern warfare," he said, "has as its objective—No. 1, the destruction of the enemy’s capability to fight; and secondly, his will to fight." Finally, White pointed out that a finite deterrent posture would strip the United States of its influence in the world.

Destruction which does not affect the outcome of the war in one’s favor is irrational and politically and morally unjustifiable."
