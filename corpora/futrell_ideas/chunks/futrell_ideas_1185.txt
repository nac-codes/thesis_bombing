Although the strategic bombing campaigns of World War II had been directed against hostile industry for good reason, production and mobilization would contribute little or nothing to the outcome in an atomic war. "Today," he wrote, "victory lies not in the ability to destroy the enemy industrial and manpower potential but rather in the ability to destroy his existing capability for delivering destruction." As for the allegation that Soviet missile sites could not be targeted, Richardson pointed out that new intelligence techniques should provide knowledge of the construction of hardened missile sites, that the vulnerability of mobile missiles to slight overpressures should allow them to be targeted and attacked on an area basis with the help of reconnaissance, and that within the time frame of concern the United States would have constant satellite surveillance that should provide intelligence on missile movements or site construction. "The minimum-deterrent strategy sought by critics of the existing counterforce deterrent capability," Richardson wrote i summary, “is one which would lead to unlimited requirements for limited war."  While Admiral Burke was presenting the case for finite deterrence to the House Subcommittee on Appropriations in January 1960, Congressman Daniel J. Flood exclaimed: "This theory I do not believe. This is terrible."“41 When it reported the defense budget bill out in April, the House Committee on Appropriations expressed disbelief in finite deterrence.
