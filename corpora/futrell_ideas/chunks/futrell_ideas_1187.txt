e lack the forces needed to replace the so-called ‘massive retaliation’ policy." On the other hand, the Naval Warfare Analysis Group issued a "Résumé of Major Strategic Considerations" on 17 October 1960 that continued to argue for a finite level of deterrence. Distributed by Navy officials and said to represent a good summary of naval views, the résumé argued that United States efforts to build counterforce capabilities, to harden missile sites, or even to construct civilian defense shelters would accelerate the arms race by forcing the enemy to develop additional overkill capability, and might even cause the enemy to fear that the United States was preparing to attack and to unleash a preemptive strike, thus starting a war rather than deterring conflict.47  During 1958 and 1959 the Air Force advanced counterforce as an alternative and wiser strategy than finite deterrence, but the full implications of a damage-limiting, no-city counterforce war did not become exactly evident until the early months of 1960. Working in the Pentagon, Brig Gen Noel F. Parrish, assistant for coordination to the Air Force deputy chief of staff for plans and programs, and Lt Col Donald F. Martin began to wargame existing strategic plans as opposed to a new strategic concept that made the most scrupulous efforts to employ appropriately sized weapons only against purely military targets. The new concept made sense in its own right since a good many missiles would be required to kill enemy military forces in the first place, but the real surprise was that a no-city attack plan promised a tremendous saving of civilian life in the event of a thermonuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. War would remain horrible, but it would not necessarily be suicidal. Taking their scratch-pad figures to General White, Parrish and Martin obtained approval to wargame the no-city counterforce strategy onthe Air Force’s air-battle-model computer. No matter how the situation or the force lev
