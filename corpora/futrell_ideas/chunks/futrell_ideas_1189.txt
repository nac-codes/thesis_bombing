ty wargame studies, Martin presented a comparison of the costs of the finite deterrence-terror strategy as opposed to a warfighting counterforce strategy. If an aggressor launched an attack against United States military forces and the United States responded against the enemy’s military forces, some 5 percent of the US population would not survive. On the other hand, if the aggressor launched an attack against United States military forces and the United States retaliated against hostile military forces and cities, some 90 percent of the US population would not survive a counterattack against US cities. Looking ahead to 1965 when increased numbers of nuclear weapons would be available, the counterforce strategy would result in 5 percent destruction of US industry while thé terror strategy would lead to the destruction of 50 percent of the industry of the United States. "The foregoing," Martin observed, "are powerful arguments for accepting a counterforce strategy favoring survival rather than a strategy tantamount to suicide. The difference in the strategies can be measured in terms of this Nation’s continued existence."»! The Air Force had provided a conceptual justification for a counterforce strategy, but acceptance or rejection of it would await the new national administration that would take office early in 1961.
