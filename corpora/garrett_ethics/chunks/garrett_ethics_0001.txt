I had during a trip to Europe several years ago. The first occurred during a visit to the Franconian city of Würzberg in Germany. Located along the river Main and founded in the eighth century, Würzberg has been called a rococo jewel box. It is also sometimes referred to as "the town of Madonnas," based on the numerous replications of the city's patron saint found in niches of old homes. The university at Würzberg is some 400 years old, and is today one of Germany's leading educational institutions. The city perhaps achieved its greatest prominence during the 18th century, by which time the prince-bishops who governed Franconia had established their presence in the famed Residenz. This town palace consti- tuted one of the most ornate and extravagant Baroque creations of the period and was visited by all the leading personalities of Europe. Built over a period of 24 years by the famed court architect Balthazar Neumann, the Residenz is set amid extensive gardens and is a virtual fairyland of marble busts, columned vestibules, glittering chandeliers, white and gold stucco work and statuary, and gold-encased mirrors. Numerous murals are to be found in the spacious rooms spread throughout the structure. Particularly notable is the ceiling fresco by the Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo entitled The Four Continents, depicting hundreds of men, women, children, angels, and animals as well as a good part of the history and geography of the world. When I observed to a docent at the Residenz that all this seemed to be in a remarkable state of preservation, he commented evenly that actually much of it was a restoration. Most of the Residenz, he said, had been destroyed in a British bombing raid on the night of March 16, 1945.
