lready had some famil- iarity with the general details of that policy (who has not heard of Dresden?), but I began to read into the literature concerning British air policy in a more systematic fashion. In doing so I noticed that there were consistent references to the moral issues involved, but that these were generally offered only as asides or as a small part of the overall analysis. Given the fact that the British assault on German cities seemed a pretty important event in the evolution of ideas concerning ethics in wartime, this seemed to be a surprisingly casual and/or at least incomplete way of approaching the matter. Indeed there didn't seem to be any single study that tried to address the moral questions raised by the bombing as a topic in itself. Thus the genesis of what is offered here: certainly not a full history of British air policy in World War II, but an attempt at systematically examining the moral issues presented by the British bombing offensive against German cities in the period 1939-1945. It should be clear from the outset that this is a basically critical look at Bomber Command, at least insofar as the ethical implications of its work are concerned. Yet the spirit of the enterprise is not so much prosecutorial, the simple levying of moral condemnation, as it is an attempt to let both the supporters and the opponents of British strategy speak for themselves and to arrive at a reasonably fair assessment of the viewpoints presented. A particular point of concern is to establish why apparently humane individuals agreed to the systematic destruction of hundreds of thousands of German civilians and what lessons we may draw from this fact. There are a few preliminary observations about British policy at the time that may be appropriate in establishing a sense of the issues involved. During the first few months of the war, British long-range bombers did little more than make occasional forays over the Ruhr valley dropping propaganda leaflets (althoug
