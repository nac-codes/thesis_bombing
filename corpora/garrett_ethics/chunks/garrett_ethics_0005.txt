sense of the issues involved. During the first few months of the war, British long-range bombers did little more than make occasional forays over the Ruhr valley dropping propaganda leaflets (although there were a few strikes against German naval facilities on the Baltic). The atmosphere at this point was perhaps reflected in the  Ethics and Airpower in World War II xii Preface astonished reaction of one high-ranking British official to the idea that German industrial facilities should be attacked. Quite out of the question, he insisted, since after all these facilities were private property. British restraint during this period may be accounted for in part by her relatively limited technical capability for massive air strikes against Germany. There was also concern about German retaliation in kind if the informal proscription against large-scale city strikes was abandoned. Also important, however, was the principle that civilized states were bound, even in wartime, to observe the crucial distinction between combatant and non-combatant. The indiscrimi- nate bombing of German cities evidently would represent a total rejection of this traditional credo. Having considered the initial British stance on strategic bombing against Germany, it is instructive to consider the events of the night of July 27, 1943. That evening 787 British bombers attacked the center of the German city of Hamburg with a combination of explosive and incendiary bombs. It had been a hot and dry summer in northern Germany, and this fact, combined with the unusually tight concentration of the bombs on the working class districts of the city, produced a firestorm that eventually covered an area of about four square miles. Temperatures at the center of the firestorm reached about 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit, accompanied by winds of hurricane force. One British pilot described the scene: "It was as if I was looking into what I imagined to be an active volcano. . . . Our actual bombing was like putting an
