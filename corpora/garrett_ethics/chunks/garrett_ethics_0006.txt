Our actual bombing was like putting another shovelful of coal into the furnace." Over 40,000 people died on that evening in Hamburg within a period of about two hours.3 The transition in British policy from a rejection of "indiscriminate bomb- ing" to an apparent embrace of precisely this concept resulted over the course of the war in the progressive destruction of large areas of almost every major city in Germany.
