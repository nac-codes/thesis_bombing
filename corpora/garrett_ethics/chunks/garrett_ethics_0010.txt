as in a sense only a logical extension of methods used in World War I, in particular the German use of submarine warfare against xv civilian shipping and the British de facto policy of trying to starve the German people into surrender by instituting a naval blockade of Germany. In the American case, the use of atomic weapons against Hiroshima and Nagasaki (which, ironically, might be regarded as a logical extension of British area bombing) presumably conditioned American opinion to the notion of using-or threatening to use-airpower as a fundamental ingre- dient of national strategy, no matter what its implications in terms of traditional standards of civilian immunity in wartime. This book is divided into three sections. Part I briefly discusses some of the developments in the use of airpower, and theories as to its use, prior to World War II. This is followed by a summary description of the British strategic air offensive during the conflict itself. Part II focuses on the reactions of various individuals and groups in British society to the bomb- ing campaign against German cities. Part III attempts to offer a general moral critique of the area offensive and concludes with some general observations about what British air policy in World War II may have ultimately signified. I make no claim here that this is an exercise in primary research on the details of British bombing. There are a number of fairly exhaustive studies that have plumbed the relevant data to the extent that it is unlikely any genuinely new or startling information will come to light at this point on the subject. Nor is this a formal essay in moral philosophy on the relationship between ethics and violence. There is a literature in its own right on that topic. Instead what I have tried to do here is something in between: to take the standard evidence that does exist on the British strategic air offensive in World War II and to subject it to a special form of inquiry using some basic propositions in
