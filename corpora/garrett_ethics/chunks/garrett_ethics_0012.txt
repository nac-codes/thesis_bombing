r Pope This is a book about the evolution of an idea: the use of airpower by one country to impose its will on another. We might begin with two historical references. On June 23, 1812, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Russia. In the ensuing weeks his soldiers routed all the opposition that the regime of Alexander I offered to them. As Napoleon approached the outskirts of Moscow, the Russians tried an entirely novel tactic to slow the inexorable march of the Grand Army. They attempted to use a balloon filled with explosives to stem the advance of the French forces. There is no record of this innovation having produced any noticeable results. Napoleon occupied the Russian capital a few days later. A little over 132 years later, British and American military planners proposed the following scheme, codenamed Thunderclap, for bringing the war against Germany to a successful conclusion. Thunderclap envisioned a joint assault by several thousand British and American bombers on the German capital of Berlin; there would be round-the-clock bombing over a period of four days and nights. The explicit military premise behind Thun- derclap was that much if not most of Berlin would be reduced to smoking rubble. The expectation was that this type of cataclysmic assault would totally shatter the German people's will to continue the war. For a variety of reasons Thunderclap was never fully implemented. However the distance that warring powers had traveled from the first abortive use of "airpower" by the Russians in 1812 to the awesome deployment of  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 4 5 The Crescendo of Bombing armadas of strategic bombers in World War II represents perhaps one of the most striking developments in the history of armed conflict. It is instructive to consider how all this came about, both in terms of the march of technology and even more in terms of the march of ideas as to how war could success- fully-and legitimately-be waged.
