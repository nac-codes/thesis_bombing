his came about, both in terms of the march of technology and even more in terms of the march of ideas as to how war could success- fully-and legitimately-be waged. THE PAST AS PROLOGUE The experiment by Imperial Russia with airborne bombing was to find little further reflection in military tactics for almost a hundred years, save for an equally fruitless effort by the Austrians to use balloons to drop explosives on Venice in 1849. The first generally recognized use of bombing from the air in the modern period came only with a fairly haphazard use of Italian aircraft in the Italo-Turkish war of 1911-1912 (the bombs were flung over the side of the aircraft after the pilot had pulled their pins with his teeth In this instance the Italians launched several air strikes against Arah villages in Libya as part of their campaign to liberate that country from the Ottomans.1 It was not until World War I that the application of aerial attacks on an enemy's homeland was introduced as a regular part of the strategy of the warring powers. Aircraft specifically designed for such missions came undes development, including the necessary bombsights and directional devices a well as bomb racks themselves with ordnance designed to fit them. Begin ning in 1916, French aircraft launched strikes against several German cities in retaliation for enemy assaults on Paris and other French towns. The British undertook a series of raids on zeppelin factories and other military targets in Germany in the area of the Saarland, Mannheim, and Stuttgart. It was the Germans, however, who led the way in demonstrating how aircraft could he used against the enemy's own territory. From January 1915 to November 1916, zeppelins were employed to attack targets in the north of England and the Midlands as well as in the British capital. Beginning in May 1917, the so-called Gotha raids against London and other cities were initiated. These involved genuine bomber rather than airships, and their employment served t
