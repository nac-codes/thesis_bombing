the British capital. Beginning in May 1917, the so-called Gotha raids against London and other cities were initiated. These involved genuine bomber rather than airships, and their employment served to reinforce the earlier impression of a basic threshold having been crossed in the means of modern war. Overall there was a total of 208 airship and 435 airplane sorties undertaken against England by the German air force. About 300 tons of bombs were dropped, killing around 1,400 people and wounding another 3,400.2 Compared to the figures that were to be produced by the next great war, these may have been relatively modest results, but they established an ominous precedent. The notion that civilians could be a legitimate and even important target of air strikes seemed to have acquired at least a tentative acceptance. As one authority on the use of airpower in World War I wrote, "One principle seems to have been followed [which was] that military objectives could be bombed wherever found, regardless of their location, and, it seems, regardless of the injury to non-combatants and private prop- erty."3 The fact that an expanded utilization of airpower was now an accepted item on the agenda of defense planners in Great Britain as well as elsewhere was reflected in the establishment of an independent British bombing force in April 1918, and even more in the amalgamation of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service into the Royal Air Force in the same month. By the end of the war, the new service could claim some 300,000 officers and enlisted personnel, which represented a 150-fold increase of its strength as of 1914. Even more impressive was the fact that in the period 1914-1918 Britain built almost 50,000 flying machines of all types.4 In the interwar period a heated and generally rather abstract debate developed over what the experience of World War I had to say about the potential of strategic bombing. In the generic sense the strategic application of airpowe
