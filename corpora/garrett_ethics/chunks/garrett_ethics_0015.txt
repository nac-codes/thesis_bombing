ed and generally rather abstract debate developed over what the experience of World War I had to say about the potential of strategic bombing. In the generic sense the strategic application of airpower simply meant the use of aircraft for direct assaults on the enemy's homeland and his fundamental capacity to make war (as distinguished, for example, from the use of aircraft in tactical support of ground forces). The discussion remained somewhat abstract because there was, after all, a rather slim body of actual evidence on which to base conclusions. This did not prevent such distinguished voices as that of the military historian Sir Basil Liddell Hart from arguing that strategic bombing might prove the decisive weapon in a new war. Liddell Hart was persuaded of the merits of such bombing in part because of his desire to develop a military alternative that would avoid the mindless slaughter of the trenches in World War I. He argued somewhat plaintively that when it was realized that strategic bombing would inflict "a total of injury far less than when [a war was] spread over a number of years, the common sense of mankind will show that the ethical objection to this form of war is at least not greater than to the cannon-fodder wars of the past."5 From an operational point of view, Liddell Hart based his support of strategic bombing on the supposed fragility of civilian morale in wartime. Drawing in part on his analysis of the effects of the limited German bombing campaign against British cities in World War I, he focused on the spirit and will of societies as a whole in supporting the military in the field. Defeat in  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 6 7 The Crescendo of Bombing war, he claimed, "is the result not of loss of life, save, at the most, indirectly and partially, but by loss of morale."6 The quickest way to undermine or destroy this morale, he claimed, would be by a sustained campaign of strategic bombing. This was an argument that was to prove critical
