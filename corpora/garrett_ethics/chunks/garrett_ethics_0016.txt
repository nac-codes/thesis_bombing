ially, but by loss of morale."6 The quickest way to undermine or destroy this morale, he claimed, would be by a sustained campaign of strategic bombing. This was an argument that was to prove critical to the subsequent British bombing offensive against Germany in World War II, and it was elaborated on at the time by the famous Italian airpower theorist, General Giulio Douhet. Douhet's approach to the significance of the bomber offensive may be taken as a particularly unvarnished summary of the view of many bombing advocates before World War II. His essential proposition was that a massive air attack by a fully-developed strategic bomber force at the outbreak of hostilities would prove decisive to the outcome of any war. A complete breakdown of the social structure cannot but take place in a country subjected to this kind of merciless pounding from the air. The time would soon come when, to put an end to horror and suffering, the people themselves, driven by the instinct of self-preservation, would rise up and demand an end to the war-this before their army and navy had time to mobilize at all!7 Douhet impatiently dismissed any notion that such an attack might be regarded as unduly harsh. Indeed he echoed Liddell Hart in arguing that "mercifully, the decision will be quick in this kind of war, since the decisive blows will be directed at civilians, that element of the countries at war least able to sustain them." Thus a conflict fought in these terms might yet "prove to be more humane than wars in the past in spite of all, because they may in the long run shed less blood."8 Within British official circles the leading voice in the interwar years arguing for the primacy of a strategic bombing capability for Britain was undoubtedly that of Sir Hugh Trenchard, the first chief of the Air Staff for the RAF. Trenchand waged an untiring campaign to obtain what he considered adequate support for his airmen and even more to fight off the doubts of the more senior services abou
