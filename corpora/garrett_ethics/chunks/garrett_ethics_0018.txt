ugh Trenchard's confident predictions about the effect of a modern strategic bombing campaign was hardly translated into a commitment of resources to the RAF at the time by his superiors in the British government. Between 1920 and 1938, the RAF received on average only 17 percent of extremely limited defense expenditures of less than $1 billion. Even so, both the Government and the British people in general tended to nurse rather apocalyptic images concerning the probable effect of air strikes during the first days of a new war with Germany. The widely held belief was that the Germans would initiate hostilities with massive bombing of vulnerable British cities. Winston Churchill himself estimated that under a continuous air assault on London at least three or four million people would be driven out into the surrounding countryside. On the eve of war in 1939, the government was prepared for about a quarter of a million casualties in the capital alone for the first three weeks of air attack, along with three million psychiatric cases, an equivalent number of refugees, and up to 50 percent destruction of property. Upon the declaration of war, the Ministry of Health issued a million burial forms to local authorities.10 Ironically, it seems that at the same time as the RAF was denied the resources to build itself up, the essential arguments of Liddell Hart, Douhet, and Trenchard concerning the potential of airpower had received wide acceptance. The fears expressed were given a certain degree of impetus by the scattered examples of air strikes against cities that had taken place in the years after 1918. The Italians bombed the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa in 1936, the Japanese devastated Nanking in China in 1937, and in the same year there was the attack of the German Condor Legion on the undefended Basque town of Guernica, in which about 1,000 people were killed and 70 percent of the buildings destroyed. To be sure, each of these attacks took  Ethics and Airpower in
