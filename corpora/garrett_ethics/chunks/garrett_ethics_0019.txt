To be sure, each of these attacks took  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 8 The Crescendo of Bombing place against relatively primitive or even non-existent air defenses, but they seemed to cast a sinister shadow nonetheless. It was against this background that the British government was finally led to make some firm decisions on the future strength of the RAF as the prospect of war with Germany steadily increased in the late 1930s. On the basis of a report from a Joint Planning Committee submitted to the cabinet and the Committee of Imperial Defence in the spring of 1937 the decision was to give primary emphasis to building up British fighter defenses in order to blunt the anticipated German aerial assault on Britain should war come. The British bomber force during this period was ex- pected to concentrate its efforts largely on attacking German airfields and giving support to ground operations in Western Europe. There was, how- ever, some guarded language in the decision suggesting that Bomber Command (established as a separate unit of the RAF in 1936) would also have responsibility for a broader campaign of strategic bombing of Ger- many as the war progressed. 11 This may have provided some satisfaction to Trenchard and his support- ers, but the essential fact was that Bomber Command at this point hardly had a significant capacity for undertaking any kind of sustained strategic air offensive. It is true that in 1936 the Air Ministry authorized plans for the development of a fleet of large four-engined bombers, and designs were approved for aircraft that later evolved into the Stirling, Halifax, and Lan- caster. As of 1939, however, only 17 of the 33 operational squadrone scheduled for Bomber Command were equipped with aircraft even theoret. ically capable of strikes against European targets from England.
