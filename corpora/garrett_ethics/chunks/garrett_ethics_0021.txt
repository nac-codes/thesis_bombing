bound for Germany. Their targets were a half-dozen cities in the Ruhr valley and the Baltic ports of Bremen and Hamburg. Shortly before daybreak, nine of the ten bombers returned to base (one aircraft landed in France). Their 13-ton payload had consisted of nothing more lethal than some 5.4 million propaganda leaflets, meant to impress on the German people that victory by the Allies was inevitable and inviting them to overthrow the Hitler regime.14 Given the extensive attention paid to the possibilities of strategic bombing prior to 1939, it was rather bizarre and certainly ironic that the first assault on Germany in World War II by British Bomber Command should have consisted of nothing more than a shower of paper. Sir Arthur Harris, who was later to achieve fame (and notoriety) as head of Bomber Command, spoke for many British airmen when he dismissed such efforts as essentially frivolous. "The only thing achieved," Harris commented, concerning this and later leaflet exercises, "was largely to supply the continent's requirements of toilet paper for the five long years of war." He was presumably just as dismissive of another operation of Bomber Command at this time, which involved dropping huge quantities of teabags over Holland to demonstrate that beleaguered Britain still possessed sufficient comforts to be generous with them. Despite this supposed commitment to using air strikes against on traditional and essentially tactical military targets, the siren call of a decisive strategic air offensive against Germany still had its adherents in Great From early September to about the middle of May 1940, Bomber Com- mand divided its time between dropping still more leaflets over the German Reich, occasional attacks on naval and other "precise" military targets, and a distinct concern about avoiding any unnecessary harm to enemy civilians. For example, in November 1939, the War Cabinet secretly considered a plan for bombing targets in the Ruhr in response to a German in
