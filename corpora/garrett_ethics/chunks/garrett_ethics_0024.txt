ister himself. As far back as July 1940, he had written to Lord Beaverbrook, Minister for Aircraft Production, that there was only one thing that would bring Hitler down, and that was "an absolutely devastating exterminating attack by very heavy bombers from this country upon the Nazi homeland."19 Several months later Churchill expanded on this theme in a statement to the War Cabinet, which suggested that "whilst we should adhere to the rule that our objectives should be military targets, at the same time the civilian population around the target areas must be made to feel the weight of war."20 Churchill's chief of the Air Staff, Sir Charles Portal, also was increasingly persuaded of the merits of area bombing. Portal suggested that 20 to 30 towns and cities should be selected as potential targets for Bomber Command, with the primary aim being the deliverance of very heavy material destruction and a demonstration to the enemy of the expanding power and severity of air bombardment from Britain. As one individual privy to the discussion on bombing policy at this point put it, "the moral scruples of the Cabinet on this subject have been overcome."21 The government's wavering between an ostensible program of precision bombing and an increasing tendency toward area bombing was resolved finally in a policy statement of February 14, 1942. The bomber offensive, according to Directive No. 22 issued to Bomber Command, was now to be "focused on the morale of the enemy civil population and in particular of the industrial workers." In case there was any doubt at Bomber Command headquarters about what was now intended, the chief of the Air Staff sent a follow-on communication the next day: "Ref the new bombing directive: I suppose it is clear that the aiming points are to be the built-up areas, not, for instance, the dockyards or aircraft factories. . . . This must be made quite clear if it is not already understood."22 Sir Arthur Harris, who was to become head of Bomber Command
