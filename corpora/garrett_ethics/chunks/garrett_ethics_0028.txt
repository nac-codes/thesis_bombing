cept of the shattering of the German people's morale, and thus of Germany's will or ability to continue the war, was enshrined henceforth as one of the guiding premises of British bombing policy. As the official history of Bomber Command puts it, "Because of the position which he occupied and the time at which he submitted his minute, Lord Cherwell's intervention was of great importance. It did much to insure the concept of strategic bombing in its hour of crisis."25 There were, to be sure, other rationales brought forward to justify the bombing of German cities aside from its putative effect on morale. One of these was that it would help to divert German resources from the Russian campaign and the Middle East in order to provide for the air defense of the Reich. Moreover, since German industry was naturally concentrated in and around the major German cities, even so-called indiscriminate attacks on these places was bound to damage or destroy some of the relevant factories. Such attacks would also lead to a shattering of the whole fabric of German civil life, which in turn would create a basic dislocation in war production 1  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 14 15 The Crescendo of Bombing and the German home front's ability to support the Reich military machine Sir Arthur Harris was particular ardent in advancing these propositions. He even went so far as to suggest that if the British government gave its full support to the bomber offensive, Germany could essentially be defeated by airpower alone. 26 THE AREA BOMBING OF GERMANY: THE FIRST PHASE Sir Arthur Harris did not wait long after assuming leadership of Bombe- Command before he began his long campaign to demonstrate that the theon of area bombing could be translated into a productive reality. The Baltic port city of Lübeck provided a convenient early test case. An old medieval tow constructed largely of wood ("built more like a fire-lighter than a humo habitation," as Harris observed), Lübeck was attacked o
