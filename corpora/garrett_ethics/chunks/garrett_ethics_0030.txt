More than 45,000 people were rendered homeless, and the roads out of Cologne were clogged with a massive exodus of refugees. When Harris reported the results of Millenium to Churchill, he was gratified by the Prime Minister's reaction.

Even so there was to be a period of some months before Bomber Command actually entered into a sustained campaign of destroying German cities. One problem was the lack of sufficient numbers of aircraft to sustain such a campaign. Despite the thousand-bomber raid against Cologne (achieved by
