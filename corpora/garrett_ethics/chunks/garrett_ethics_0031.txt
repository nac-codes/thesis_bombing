a sustained campaign of destroying German cities. One problem was the lack of sufficient numbers of aircraft to sustain such a campaign. Despite the thousand-bomber raid against Cologne (achieved by using every available aircraft at Harris's disposal, including even training units), Bomber Command on an average daily basis had at its disposal only 261 bombers as of the end of 1942. Equally important was the slow introduction of the Lancaster, perhaps the best heavy bomber on all sides in the war, but not available in any quantity until early in 1943. There was also the challenge of developing adequate guidance systems for Bomber Command's attacks against the German heartland. Even given the less stringent standards of accuracy required for area bombing, it was not until the end of the year, with the arrival of Oboe and H2S as navigational aids, that the British could feel a renewed confidence about hitting their aiming points in the areas being attacked.30 Also important in supplementing the new navigational technology was the development of the Pathfinder Force, which consisted of elite Bomber Command crews whose task it was to identify and mark the target for the bombers that followed. One of the most successful innovations of the air war, the Pathfinders, together with the other developments in equipment and navigation, now made a full area offensive conceivable.31 In January 1943, the British Prime Minister and the American President, together with their principal advisers, met in Casablanca to consider the  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 16 The Crescendo of Bombing future of the strategic bombing of Germany. The Casablanca Conference. and the subsequent Washington Conference in May of the same year. provided an overall framework for a Combined Bombing Offensive (codenamed Pointblank) against Germany. The directives that issued from these meetings were regarded by Bomber Command as final authorization for a general assault against German cities. In actuali
