noise of exploding bombs and the death cries of martyred human beings as well as in the big silence after the raids. Speech is impotent to portray the measure of the horror, which shook the people for ten days and nights and the traces of which were written indelibly on the face of the city and its inhabitants.35 The devastation of Hamburg was henceforward referred to by the Germans simply as Die Katastrophe. The final significant event in the first phase of the area offensive against Germany was the Battle of Berlin. This began on the night of November 18 and continued for four months until the end of the following March. During this period some 35 raids of more than 500 bombers each were launched against the German capital as well as other cities. Sixteen of the missions were directed at Berlin itself, which represented the greatest single focusing of Bomber Command's efforts since the beginning of the war.36 Arthur Harris had begun the Battle of Berlin with high hopes. In a typically self-confident communication to the Prime Minister, he had asserted that "we can wreck Berlin from end to end if the US Army Air Forces will come in on it. It will cost between us 400 and 500 aircraft. It will cost Germany the war."37 As it happened there was only marginal American participation in this enterprise, and the results of Bomber Command's own efforts proved to be a great disappointment. For various reasons far less devastation was delivered on Berlin than in the raids against Hamburg (only about one-third of the acreage destroyed as compared to  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 18 The Crescendo of Bombing the earlier attacks). Moreover these results had to be balanced against the increasing losses that Bomber Command was now suffering in its cam- paign against Berlin and other major cities. The potency of the German night-fighter force, as well as of their anti-aircraft defenses, was reflected in an average loss rate for British bombers on the order of about 5.0 perce
