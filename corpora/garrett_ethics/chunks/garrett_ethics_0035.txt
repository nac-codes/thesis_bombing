other major cities. The potency of the German night-fighter force, as well as of their anti-aircraft defenses, was reflected in an average loss rate for British bombers on the order of about 5.0 percent Sometimes it was even more severe: in an attack on Nuremberg in March 1944, some 94 bombers were lost and another 71 damaged out of a total force of 795 employed. 38 This level of attrition could not be long sustained, and in view of the rather problematical effect that area bombing seemed to be having on the German ability to maintain her war effort, something of a crisis of confidence developed at Bomber Command and amongst others in authority about the future of the air offensive. As it happened, however, the doubts that had now arisen became submerged in the planning for D-Day, the Allied invasion of Europe. In what, under the circumstances, may be regarded as a blessing in disguise for Bomber Command, Harris was now ordered to divert virtually all his aircraft from the bombing of Germany to more direct support for the coming landings in Normandy. Over the next several months, Bomber Command devoted the brunt of its operations to attacks on the German ra system in France and the Low Countries in order to disrupt German transpor of reinforcements and materiel to the front after D-Day. They did so with admirable success, and the evidence in fact suggests that the combined British and American assault on these targets played a critical role in the successful Allied invasion. By late May, traffic on the railway network in France had declined to 55 percent of the January figure, and by D-Day itself had fallen to only 30 percent of the earlier figure.39 THE AREA BOMBING OF GERMANY: THE SECOND PHASE By September 1944, Allied forces had not only firmly established themselvesin France but were making rapid progress against the increasingly shattered Ger man defenses. At this point, the debate resumed over strategy for Bombe Command in its attacks on Germany itself. There
