e most famous (or notorious) of these attacks was undoubtedly the raid on Dresden on the night of February 13. It has already been remarked how  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 20 The Crescendo of Bombing Arthur Harris insisted on continuing his area offensive despite pressure from higher authority to focus on more precise targets. It is thus more than a little ironic that perhaps the most dramatic single bombing attack of the war was spurred on by direct instructions from the British War Cabinet itself. The ostensible rationale for the raid on Dresden had much to do with the Russians The attack would help to relieve German pressure on the Eastern front and convince Stalin that despite some recent Allied difficulties, in particular the Battle of the Bulge, his Western partners were still doing their fair share in defeating the Nazis.

Estimates on casualties vary widely, from a minimal guess of about 35,000 to a more drastic figure of over 200,000. In order to prevent the spread of disease, the authorities cordoned off the center of the city and constructed 25-foot-long grills where thousands of the victims were cremated. 42 The British official history describes the Dresden raid as "the crowning achievement in the long, arduous and relentless development of a principle of bombing [the area offensive]"43 At this point Prime Minister Churchill evidently decided that Bomber Command's "crowning achievement" should be left to speak for itself, and in perhaps the most controversial reference to the area offensive that he offered during the war, he wrote to the chief of the Air State along the following lines: It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror, though under other pretexts, should be reviewed.
