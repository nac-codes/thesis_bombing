lines: It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror, though under other pretexts, should be reviewed. Otherwise we shall come into control of an utterly ruined land. We shall not, for instance, be able to get housing materials out of Germany for our own needs because some temporary provision would have to be made for the Germans themselves. The destruction of Dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing. I am of the opinion that military objectives must henceforward be more strictly studied in our own interests rather than that of the enemy. The Foreign Secretary has spoken to me on this subject, and I feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives such as oil and communi- cations behind the immediate battle-zone, rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction, however impressive.44 Sir Charles Portal was greatly offended by Churchill's reference to "terror" as a previous goal of British strategy, and in response the Prime 21 Minister delivered a revised minute that dropped such sensitive references and instead concentrated on the pragmatic benefits to be obtained from a cessation of the area offensive. Having said this, it is striking that whatever qualms were now being felt did not prevent area attacks on German targets being continued virtually to the last days of World War II. Thus WÃ¼rzberg was devastated on March 16, 1945, two days later the city of Witten was two-thirds destroyed, and a month later there was a further raid on the Berlin suburb of Potsdam by 500 Lancasters, resulting in about 5,000 civilian fatalities.45 In a sense all this could be considered as simply reflexive actions of the vast machine of destruction that Bomber Command had become by this point. At long last, however, the RAF Air Staff issued a directive on April 16 that officially ended Bomber Command's strategic air offensive against Germany. Ha
