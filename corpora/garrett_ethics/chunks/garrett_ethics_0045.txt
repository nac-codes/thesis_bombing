Even so, the deliberations at the Hague had set out a code of aerial warfare that represented a combined juridical and military judgment from representatives of the most important air powers of the day. From this perspective they had considerable influence, even if not officially ratified, and as one leading authority put it, constituted "an authoritative attempt to clarify and formulate rules of law governing the use of aircraft in war."5 The other major international attempt during the interwar years to deal with the issue of permissible conduct in air operations came at the Geneva Disarmament Conference in 1932. In this instance there was a renewed emphasis on limiting the capabilities of the powers for city bombing rather than on trying to hold them to legal standards of discrimination, even though the conference did state that air attacks on civilian populations were in violation of the laws of war. Discussion thus focused on restricting the size, bombload, and range of operation of aircraft and there was even serious consideration given to the total abolition of long-range bombers, except for a residual force to be under the direct control of the League of Nations to enforce sanctions against aggression. This received surprising political support in Great Britain, save for the Air Ministry, who favored retention of a bombing force for policing the Empire.
