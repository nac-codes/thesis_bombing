rmally binding, as long as others did so. Thue Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain issued the following guidelines to Bomber Command in June 1938: 1. It is against international law to bomb civilians as such and to make deliberate attacks on the civilian population. 2. Targets which are aimed at from the air must be legitimate military objec- tives and must be capable of identification. 3. Reasonable care must be taken in attacking those military objectives so that by carelessness a civilian population in the neighbourhood is not bombed.9 In the same month, he observed publicly in the House of Commons tha even though there was no "international code of law with respect to aerial 29 warfare which was the subject of general agreement," there was at the same time "rules of international law which had been established for sea and land warfare. These rules, or the principles which underlay them, were applicable to aerial warfare, and were not only admitted but insisted upon by his Government." Most important of these was the illegitimacy of any policy "to bomb civilians as such and to make deliberate attacks on the civilian population." Chamberlain went on to summarize the case against area bombing with admirable directness. We can strongly condemn any declaration on the part of anybody, wherever it may be made, that it should be part of a deliberate policy to try to win a war by the demoralization of the civilian population through the process of bombing from the air. This is absolutely contrary to international law, and I would add that, in my opinion, it is a mistaken policy from the point of view of those who adopt it, but I do not believe that the deliberate attacks upon a civilian population will ever win a war for those who make them.10 What is interesting about Chamberlain's stance on airpower is his com- mingling of both a legal/moral argument and a practical one. In the time- honored phrase, area bombing, from Chamberlain's point of view, was more than a crime,
