rlain's stance on airpower is his com- mingling of both a legal/moral argument and a practical one. In the time- honored phrase, area bombing, from Chamberlain's point of view, was more than a crime, it was also a mistake. The Prime Minister reiterated his position on the matter even after war had broken out. "Whatever be the lengths to which others may go, his Majesty's government will never resort to the deliberate attack on women and children, and other civilians for purposes of mere terrorism."11 The only fair conclusion to be drawn from the discussion in the previous chapter is that, as things turned out, the British government did indeed resort to a policy of area bombing in World War II that had as at least one major objective the "mere terrorism" of the German civilian population. Some might want to dispute the notion that such a goal was inherent in the new policy, but it seems hard to mistake that the concept of undermining German morale depended basically on terrorizing the population into abandoning their support for the war effort. Churchill himself admitted as much in his famous minute after the bombing of Dresden, when he referred to the "bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror, though under other pretexts." If the basic proposition is accepted, then, a rather momentous question presents itself. Given the existing strictures of the war convention and, perhaps even more, the stated policy of the British government prior to and even during the early days of World War II, how did the principal figures involved in organizing and carrying out the area  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 30 The Masters of the Realm offensive confront the evident contradiction between what had been said and accepted prior to the conflict and what actually was undertaken during the course of the struggle?
