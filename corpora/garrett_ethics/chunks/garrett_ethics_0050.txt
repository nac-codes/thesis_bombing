out the war to deny or at least not to admit to the reality of area bombing. One of the most astute and fair-minded historians of the area offensive summarizes governmental policy this way: In some ways, area bombing was a three-year period of deceit practised upon the British public and on world opinion. It was felt to be necessary that the exact nature of R.A.F. bombing should not be revealed. ... the impression was usually given that industry was the main target and that any bombing of workers' housing areas was an unavoidable necessity.
