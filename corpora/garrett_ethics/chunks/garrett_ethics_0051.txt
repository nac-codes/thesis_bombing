Thus after the early raids against LÃ¼beck and Rostock in the spring of 1942, Secretary of State for Air Archibald Sinclair insisted that the attacks had been directed at "armament factories" rather than simply "dwelling houses," although he conceded that "it is impossible to distinguish in night bombing between the factories and the dwellings which surround them."16 A year later he continued to adhere to this position, saying that Bomber Command had been given no leave to engage in area bombing and that its targets "are always military."17 Sinclair was far from being the only govern- mental spokesman to take this tack with Parliament.

Of course the Germans began it, but we do not take the devil as our example. Of course all these criticisms may be groundless, but if not, issue fresh confidential orders, I hope. In a rather significant afterword, Salisbury cautioned, "Please remember that we can say nothing in publi
