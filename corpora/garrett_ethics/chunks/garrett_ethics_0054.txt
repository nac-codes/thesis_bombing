nuing concern about how to present the "facts" about the bomber offensive, rather astonishingly assumed that Harris himself could be persuaded to accept the fiction that was being presented to the general public.22 Air Marshall Harris may have thought there was nothing to be ashamed of with respect to the area bombing offensive, but the only reasonable conclusion is that for many in authority there was a considerably greater reluctance to submit the details of the offensive for general public inspection. This may suggest that at least some within the government themselves had doubts about the legitimacy of what Bomber Command was doing, and thus they chose to obscure what was indeed being done. For the great majority of those involved in directing the area offensive, however, the issue was not any personal moral qualms they may have felt about the bombing of German cities but their perception that the British people would have such qualms if they knew the full details of the area offensive. In order to avoid unpleasant and possibly disruptive questioning of the government's air strategy, there- fore, it was best from their point of view simply to conceal the essentials of the bombing of Germany. What is particularly interesting in this regard is the assumption on the part of leading figures that the public was morally sensitive to indiscriminate air attacks on Germany and would protest if their existence were revealed.
