bombing similar to that which the United States had organized (the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, or USSBS). When the British Bombing Survey Unit was finally established over his objections, it was granted few resources, and its final report was withheld from public inspection, even though the USSBS's findings became available almost at once. As one fervent supporter of Arthur Harris put it, "One can only conclude that there was a desire on the part of the Government to deny to the British public, firstly, the truth about the contribution of Bomber Command to victory and, secondly, any knowledge of the greatness as a commander of Sir Arthur Harris."25 There does indeed seem to have been a reluctance at the time to consider these matters in any detail. Even when there was some attention given to the contribution of Bomber Command by governmental figures in the postwar period, the tone of the analysis was remarkably elliptic. A representative example was a presentation by the Under-Secretary of State for Air, Mr. John Strachey, to the House of Commons on March 12, 1946. His remarks consisted in part of a general survey of the role of Bomber Command in World War II, and in this connection it is remarkable how Bomber Command's emphasis on area bombing was virtually ignored. Instead, the stress was on their success in undertaking precision air strikes against oil and transportation targets in the latter stages of the war (the sort of panacea targets that Arthur Harris had always deprecated). The success that greeted these efforts, Strachey enthused, "I shall always regard . .. as the very greatest achievement which Bomber Command made in the whole course of the war."
