plaque honoring the pilots of Fighter Command who died in service, listin them all by name. The much heavier losses incurred by Bomber Command resulted in no such plaque nor any other recording of individuals who made the supreme sacrifice. Then there is the treatment of Harris himself. Given the fact that he was one of the half-dozen principal commanders of British forces in the we it might have been expected that he would have received honors equal those bestowed on other famous captains in the great struggle, such Montgomery, Alanbrooke, and Alexander. In the event, Harris was unin in not receiving such recognition from the British government. On the occasion of Harris's death some thirty years later, an obituary in a leadin British newspaper commented on "the sad truth ... that when the war ende and bombing turned out no longer to be a political asset, those whoh decided upon the strategy of heavy bombing and had chosen him as the 37 man to carry it out now turned their backs on him."28 It is true that Churchill recommended that Harris be given a Peerage for his service as head of Bomber Command, but the Labour government of Clement Atlee rejected this proposal. Harris remained in Britain for a time after the war, but when he was offered no continuing employment in the RAF he left for South Africa at the end of 1945 in a not surprising mood of bitterness and feeling of betrayal. It was not until 1953 (when Churchill was back in power) that he finally received a baronetcy, a relatively minor honor usually bestowed on obscure luminaries such as long-serving members of Parliament.
