.'s wishes [concerning the honours list] cause consternation-especially baronetcies for 'Bomber Harris' and Louis Spears.29 The stance taken by the British government toward Harris is further illustrated by the fact that his final Official Dispatch, unlike others, was never published, and only introduced into a very limited circulation some three years after it was written. Even then it was available only when accompanied by a long, written rebuttal from the Air Ministry of much of what he had written, particularly concerning his claims about Bomber Command's suc- cess in reducing German war production. The Air Ministry's critique also strongly suggested that Harris's superiors in the war had always regarded area bombing as only a temporary measure until precision bombing was technically feasible, but that Harris's obstinacy had prevented such a change in strategy being introduced when the possibility existed. Undoubtedly sensitive to the treatment being meted out to him and to Bomber Command generally, Harris rushed into print in 1947 with the first published account by a senior British commander of one part of the nation's war effort. Bomber Offensive received decidedly mixed notices, and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), the premier defense institute in Great Britain, declined even to review it.30 All of the above seems to admit of only one conclusion: after the war there was at a minimum considerable embarrassment in official circles about the conduct of Bomber Command. The uneasiness that was felt resulted in a calculated effort not to bring attention to either Bomber Command itself or to its former chief in the form of honors and recognition, since this would have the effect of focusing and perhaps intensifying public debate on the activities of the organization and the man.31 What we had here, in effect, was a tacit admission that Britain had seriously violated the war convention and that those in authority knew she had done so.
