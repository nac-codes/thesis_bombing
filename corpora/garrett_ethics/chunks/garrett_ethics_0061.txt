nization and the man.31 What we had here, in effect, was a tacit admission that Britain had seriously violated the war convention and that those in authority knew she had done so.  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 38 The Masters of the Realm THE MEN OF ACTION These efforts at obliterating, or at least obscuring, the past do raise the rather tricky matter of responsibility. However one may feel about Harris and the strategy of area bombing, it remains that he was hardly a free agent during the war (nor was his aircrew). In a system in which civil authority was acknowledged to be supreme over the military, there always existed the possibility-some might say, the duty-for the former to assert its power over the latter and simply order the end of area bombing. In the event, such instructions were never issued, or at least never enforced, and the spectacle of officialdom, once victory had been achieved, basically washing its hands of Harris and all that he had wrought is not a particularly redeeming one The question of responsibility is so important to any critique of the area offensive, in fact, that it merits a good deal more detailed consideration. We do so here by taking a closer look at the principal players in the formulation and conduct of British bombing policy, the relationships that existed among them, and the roles that they adopted in the formulation of strategy. The True Believer: Arthur Harris Air Marshal Sir Arthur Travers Harris was one of those men who seemed almost determined to provide a continually fresh list of reasons for disliking or even detesting him.
