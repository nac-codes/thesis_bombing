Official History of Bomber Command ironically offers one of the most compelling warts-and-all descriptions of Harris's character: Sir Arthur Harris made a habit of seeing only one side of a question and then exaggerating it. He had a tendency to confuse advice with interference, criticism with sabotage, and evidence with propaganda. He resisted innovations and he was seldom open to persuasion. He was skeptical of the Air Staff in general and of many officers who served upon it he was openly contemptuous. Seeing all issues in terms of black and white, he was impatient of any other possibility, and having taken upon himself tremendous responsibilities, he expected similar powers to be conferred 32 Added to this was a personality that in its daily manifestations was a model of crudeness, rudeness, and insensitivity to elementary human values.
