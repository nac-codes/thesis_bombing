more judicious leader might not have been capable of doing. As a general matter, his aircrew were drawn from British lower-middle class, and Harris's willingness, even enthusiasm, for n the slaying sacred cows of the British establishment right and left contributed to his popularity. His personal clerk (perhaps not an unbiased witness) com mented that "we would have crawled on our hands and knees from High Wycombe to London had he asked us."37 Moreover Harris's unqualified insistence that Bomber Command was performing a critical role in the war effort went a long way toward convincing his men that their lives were not being put at risk in vain. Also essential to the sustaining of Bomber Command morale was the perception by mostof its personnel that Harris was genuinely concerned about their fate and that he would do all in his power to provide the best equipment to insure the survival. On one occasion at the Ministry of Aircraft Production, he furious demanded the rapid replacement of the Stirling bomber by the more effective Lancaster, saying "it's murder, plain murder to send my young men out to 41 die in an aircraft like that [the Stirling]."38 There is considerable irony in this emotional umbilical cord between Harris and his flyers, for he was on a day-to-day basis a quite remote figure who virtually never left High Wycombe to mingle with ordinary aircrew. If the test of wartime leadership, however, is the ability to inspire men to the importance of their actions and to suggest a common bonding of purpose and spirit between the ranks and their commander, then Harris deserves some praise for his performance. Harris may not have been a man of outstanding intellectual gifts, and he could be maddeningly obtuse at times, yet he wasn't totally insensible of the charges of immorality levelled against him both during and after the war. Even though they comprise only a tiny part of his memoir of Bomber Command, ethical issues are addressed by Harris in a few places in
