have such a mindset. It is hard to envision someone being able, on a daily basis, to make the sort of brutal decisions involving life and death that Harris was charged with if at the same time he constantly was agonizing over the moral parameters of his actions. Perhaps one way in which to assess Harris properly is to draw an analogy between him and another famous air force commander, the American Curtis LeMay. The latter achieved fame as head of the Twenty-First Bomber Command in the Pacific during World War II; it was he who ordered the devastating firebombings of Tokyo in March 1945, in which more than 100,000 people died When asked later by an Air Force cadet about his moral feelings on this occasion he replied calmly: "Killing Japanese didn't bother me at that time. It was getting the war over with that bothered me. So I wasn't particularly worried about how many people we killed in getting the job done."42 After the war LeMay rose to become chief of staff of the Air Force, and a man noted for his unvarnished views on airpower stated in unsentimental terms (in the late 1960s he advocated a strategy of "victory" in Vietnam by "bombing North Vietnam back into the Stone Age.") LeMay was head of the Air Force during the Kennedy administration, and the President was asked by one of his aides why he kept on a man whose views seemed so primitive and out of touch with the spirit of the New Frontier. Kennedy's response was that he didn't intend to ask LeMay for his advice on American foreign policy, but that if it ever became necessary to use American airpower in a war 43 situation he wanted LeMay in operational command because of his profes- sional expertise. This seems like a reasonable attitude to take toward Harris, yet even in its own terms it leaves us with a highly troubling issue, which has to do with Harris's "professional expertise." Accept for the moment that we can't have expected Harris-or, perhaps more strongly, wanted Harris-to worry about the ethics of
