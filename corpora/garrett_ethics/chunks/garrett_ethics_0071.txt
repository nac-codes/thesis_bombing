War I, he had written in a letter to the First Lord of the Admiralt that he did not believe civilized nations would ever resort to submarine warfare (that is, unprovoked attacks on civilian ships). In 1935 he expressed his outrage that "it is only in the twentieth century that this hateful conditio of inducing nations to surrender by massacring the women and children has gained acceptance."44 He continued to denounce the concept of "terror" bombing in an article for the American magazine Colliers in June 1939 Even after hostilities had broken out, Churchill seemed at times to hesitate about the indiscriminate bombing of enemy civilians.

This was an admirable defense of standards of discrimination in wartime, and Churchill appears admirable for having offered it. Unfortunately, he didn't stop there.
