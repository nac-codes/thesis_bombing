wards ever-growing, ever more accurate and ever more far-ranging bomber attacks on Germany."53 As of January 1943, there were 31 heavy bomber squadrons with some 338 aircraft available to Arthur Harris. Quarterly heavy bomber production was about 232 machines. Two years later, Bomber Command had 80 heavy squadrons with over 1,300 aircraft, and quarterly heavy bomber production was approx- imately 450 machines.54 49 There is some dispute over how best to calculate the share of the national output that Bomber Command received in comparison to the other services, but one estimate is that about one-third of Britain's total war effort was devoted to the bombing offensive. Bomber Command absorbed resources roughly equal to those given to all British land forces, and received as well the cream of British wartime high technology. The degree to which the needs-or demands-of Sir Arthur Harris received priority over other claim- ants is reflected in the fact that during the war Britain was forced to buy all of its transport aircraft, most of its landing craft, a high percentage of its tanks, and huge quantities of ammunition from the United States. The reality, then, is that right up to the closing days of the war Bomber Command-de- spite Harris's constant complaints about lack of men and materiel-received what can be considered a quite disproportionate share of Britain's wartime output. How to account for Churchill's acceptance of this policy? Three possi- bilities suggest themselves. We have seen how, in the dark days after the fall of France, Churchill viewed the bombing offensive as the only visible alternative for carrying the war to Germany and potentially achieving victory. Decisions on research and development as well as procurement were taken at the time that reflected this belief, and given the relatively long lead-time necessary to bring new bombers and equipment on line, the effect of the earlier judgments on resource allocation began to be heavily felt only toward
