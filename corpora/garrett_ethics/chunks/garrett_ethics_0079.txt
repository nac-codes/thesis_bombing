is belief, and given the relatively long lead-time necessary to bring new bombers and equipment on line, the effect of the earlier judgments on resource allocation began to be heavily felt only toward the end of 1942 and beginning of 1943. Even though Churchill had acquired new doubts about the effectiveness of Bomber Command by this point, the fact is that he may have been in some measure a prisoner of the earlier decision to give priority to the bombers. To reverse course at this stage of the war, to preside over a fundamental reallocation of resources away from Bomber Command, would have called into ques- tion the legitimacy and even rationality of his previous strategic judgments. Under the circumstances, it may have seemed best to Churchill not to open a Pandora's box by altering the course previously chosen. His concern about protecting his (and his government's) reputation for effective pros- ecution of the war effort is reflected in a memorandum he wrote to the Secretary for Air in April 1942: We are placing great hopes on our bomber offensive against Germany next winter, and we must spare no pains to justify the large proportion of the national effort devoted to it. The Air Ministry's responsibility is to make sure that the maximum weight of the best type of bombs is dropped on the German cities by the aircraft placed at their disposal. Unless we can insure that most of our bombs  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 50 really do some damage, it will be difficult to justify the pre-eminence we are according to this form of attack. 55 The Masters of the Realm There is also the fact that, for much of the war, the efforts of Bomber Command were by far the most visible evidence to the British public of the government's resolute prosecution of the war effort. This concern about public morale has to be distinguished from satisfying the putative calls for revenge against Germany described earlier. Aside from Montgomery's defeat of Rommel in the African desert, and
