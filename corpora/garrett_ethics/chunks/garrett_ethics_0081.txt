It was a testimonial to the Americans that even though London might be loath to undertake an early invasion of Europe, she was still committed to a vigorous pursuit of the t of the war effort against Germany. This was an important consideration, since there were some fears in the British Government that the United States would turn its major efforts to the war against Japan-particularly given the outrage occasioned by the attack on Pearl Harbor-if the British were seen as laggard in the campaign against 51 the Nazis. It was also necessary to convince Stalin that Great Britain was making a serious contribution to the war effort, all the more so since there were continuing concerns about Moscow's willingness to sign a separate peace with Germany should she perceive that her Allies were content to have her do the bulk of the fighting with Hitler. The key fact was that a Second Front against the Germans in Western Europe was not established until June 1944, some three years after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. As early as March 1942, Churchill pushed for the bombing of Germany as a way of "taking the weight off Russia by the heaviest air offensive against Germany which can be produced, having regard to other calls on our air power." In his meeting with Stalin in August 1942, the Prime Minister proclaimed that Britain "hoped to shatter almost every dwelling in almost every German city."

In effect, Churchill was willing to accept the progressive devastation of German cities if it wou
