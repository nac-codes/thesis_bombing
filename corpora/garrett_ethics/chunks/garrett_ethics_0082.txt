sufficiently that British casualties in the eventual invasion of Europe would be measurably lessened. In effect, Churchill was willing to accept the progressive devastation of German cities if it would limit in any way British losses after D-Day. A. J. P. Taylor, in a (perhaps) more supportable argument concerning Churchill and area bombing, sug- gested that the bombing was only a new version of the so-called insular strategy in which Churchill had always believed. "British industrial power was to produce the bombers needed for victory, as in earlier times it had produced the Royal Navy .... The mass army of the First World War would not be needed. The British Army would enter the continent only to restore order when Germany had already collapsed."57 One can argue about princi- ples of proportionality here, to wit, how many German civilians was it legitimate to kill in order to save an indeterminate number of British lives? Yet the basic concern was not in itself ignoble or hard to understand. There is another aspect of Churchill's minute of October 7, 1941, that deserves consideration, however. The Prime Minister suggested that Bomber Command might prove to be an even more significant force in the war should the enemy's air defenses be so shattered that precision daylight bombing of arms factories became a real possibility. In the event, this is precisely what happened during the spring of 1944, particularly with the introduction of long-range fighter escorts such as the Mustang. Following the success of the D-Day operation, German air defenses became even more enfeebled. Yet Bomber Command was allowed in September 1944 to resume much of its massive area offensive against Germany instead of being forced to concentrate entirely on precision daylight strikes against  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 52 The Masters of the Realm specific military targets such as the German arms industry, petroleum facilities, and the transportation network.
