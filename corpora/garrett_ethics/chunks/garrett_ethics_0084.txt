ghest levels of command-notably the directive of February 14, 1942-and passed on to Harris in his capacity as head of Bomber Command. We have seen how Churchill, at least in the early years of the conflict, seemed to be committed to strategic air power, and both Portal and Sinclair also paid ritualistic obeisance on various occasions to the potential of the area offensive. Naturally Harris found these views entirely congenial to his own thinking, but the point is that during a major part of the war there was at least a broad area of agreement between Harris and higher authority on basic strategy. Having said this, it is also apparent that Harris consistently interpreted his orders in a manner that accorded with his own views on the details of strategy. Even given the overall posture of the British government in favor of the area bombing offensive, there was always a good deal of ambiguity and even 53 disagreement in various quarters about targeting and allocation of Bomber Command's resources. In every instance Harris exploited this ambiguity in a way that, not surprisingly, reinforced his own predilections. In effect he simply chose to ignore those directives, or portions of such directives, that he found objectionable. A prime example of this modus operandi was his reaction to the decisions reached at the Casablanca Conference. It will be recalled that the meeting of Allied leaders at Casablanca established the framework for a combined bombing offensive against Ger- many and resulted in the following instructions to Harris and his American counterpart, General Ira Eaker: Your primary object will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic system, and the undermining of morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened. Within these general terms, the directive said, the primary objectives of strategic bombing should be, in order of priority, "the German submarine
