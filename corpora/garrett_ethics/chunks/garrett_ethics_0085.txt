r capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened. Within these general terms, the directive said, the primary objectives of strategic bombing should be, in order of priority, "the German submarine construction yards, the German aircraft industry, transportation, oil plants and other targets in enemy war industry."58 The above wording represented basically a compromise between British and American theories as to the strategic air offensive, but examined in their own terms they clearly implied that future bombing should concentrate on specific targets of special importance to the German war effort.

He says that "the subject
