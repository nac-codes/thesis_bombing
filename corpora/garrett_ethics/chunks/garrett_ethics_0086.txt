and Airpower in World War II 54 The Masters of the Realm the Air Staff."60 In his memoirs, Harris was even more disingenuous about the intent of the Casablanca instructions. He says that "the subject of morale had been dropped, and I was now required to proceed with the general 'disorganization' of German industry ... which gave me a very wide range of choice and allowed me to attack pretty well any German industrial city of 100,000 inhabitants and above."61 It was in the last year of the war, however, that the gap between Harris's interpretation of his orders and the evident intent behind those orders became strikingly apparent. The crucial fact was that by the spring of 1944-particularly after the doubtful results of the Battle of Berlin-there was a growing body of opinion within the Air Staff and other relevant quarters that questioned whether a general area offensive was the most efficient application of Bomber Command's resources. At this point it wasn't just a question of Harris's tailoring rather vague instructions to suit his own purpose. Instead there was a seemingly flat contradiction between Harris's own ideas on the employment of Bomber Command and the new consensus that was developing within higher authority on the matter. Harris seemed unconcerned about this anomaly. As Anthony Verrier suggests "Who ran the show ostensibly was of little moment [to him] since he believed that he ran a large chunk of it in reality."62 The basic political strategy of the head of Bomber Command at this point seemed to be to keep his superiors sullen but not mutinous. The climax in this struggle of wills came in the fall of 1944. We have already described the virtual collapse of German air defenses by this time the availability of long-range fighter escorts, and the indubitable success that Bomber Command had had in attacking precision targets both before and after D-Day. Given these factors, the prevailing view within the British government was that Harris's aircrew could
