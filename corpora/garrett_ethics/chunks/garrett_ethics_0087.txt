success that Bomber Command had had in attacking precision targets both before and after D-Day. Given these factors, the prevailing view within the British government was that Harris's aircrew could now make a truly decisive contribution to victory by focusing their efforts on certain critical chokepoints in the German war effort. The Chiefs of Staff, in their directive of September 25 to Bomber Command, stressed that oil was to be the sole first priority, with transportation links and tank and vehicle production as a second priority. Gone was the equivocation of the Casablanca instructions. and it seemed as if even Harris could hardly fail to respond to this very specific set of orders. In actuality, Bomber Command continued to put primary stress on general area attacks against German cities, leaving it to the Americans to undertake the majority of the effort against oil and transportation. In attempting to deal with this rather bizarre situation in which Bomber Command was being ordered to do one thing and in reality did another, the chief of the British Air 55 Staff, Sir Charles Portal, alternated between polite requests that Harris adhere to policy, somewhat sterner reminders that he was not doing so, and finally rather abject pleading that Harris follow his instructions. On November 5, 1944 (in response to a protest from Harris about the suggested "diversion" of his resources to precision targets and the abandon- ment of the area offensive "just as it nears completion"), Portal wrote the head of Bomber Command that "at the risk of your dubbing me 'another panacea merchant,' I believe the air offensive against oil gives us by far the best hope of complete victory in the next few months." Harris paid dutiful lip service to this observation even while giving no indication that he planned to change his operational orders to his aircrew. A week later Portal responded with some further gentle nudging: You refer to a plan for the destruction of the sixty leading Germ
