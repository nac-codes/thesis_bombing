ircle, believed that "he never cared for Harris as a person," perhaps because of Harris's rather narrow personality and lack of intellectual interests outside technical problems of bombing German cit- jes.66 One seemingly trivial factor that may have helped to maintain Churchill's support for Harris was the circumstance of High Wycombe's being quite near to the Prime Minister's country retreat at Chequers. This meant that Harris could easily visit Churchill in order to press his views on bombing policy in person.

Even more important was the fact that Harris had been built up as one of the great captains of Britain's war effort-a role very much assigned to and created for him by Churchill himself. To dismiss Harris would thus reflect on Churchill's own judgment and perhaps erode public confidence in the competence of Britain's war- time leadership.
