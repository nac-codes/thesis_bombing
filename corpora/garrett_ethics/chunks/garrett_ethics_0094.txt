jective evaluation would have suggested that this reputation hardly rested on concrete achievements by Bomber Command. Very few people at the time, how- ever, had any clear sense of the actual results of the area offensive, and the constant barrage of publicity given to the aircrew of Bomber Command and their chief predisposed a majority to accept that Harris was indeed overseeing a significant part of the war effort. In these circumstances it would have been expecting a lot of Portal to dismiss Harris simply because of his wayward reading of his instructions. Personality factors also played a part in the relationship between Harris and Portal. The chief of the Air Staff was a rather austere and patrician figure, who, as a matter of instinct, strove to avoid embarrassing and painful confrontations with those around him. Once the war was clearly being won, Portal was all the more inclined to grin and bear Harris as long as he didn't go to really quite extraordinary lengths in defying policy. This seems to be the only ready explanation for the capitulation that Portal offered to Harris at the end of 1944, when the head of Bomber Command was clearly ignoring the spirit, if not the letter, of the instructions given to him concerning targets to be attacked in Germany. Portal's somewhat ambivalent attitude toward Harris was also a reflection in part of his ambivalent attitude toward area as opposed to precision bombing.
