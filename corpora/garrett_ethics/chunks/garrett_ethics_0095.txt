area offensive. The official history records that Portal, as head of Bomber Command in early fall 1940, "believed that the time had come to launch a direct attack on the German people themselves. He believed that this course had been justified by previous German actions, and that it would be justified as a strategy in the outcome."10 A year later, as chief of the Air Staff (a post he had assumed the previous October), Portal was a major proponent of the "4,000 bomber plan," which was offered as a scheme by which to defeat Germany singlehandedly by air power.  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 60 The Masters of the Realm As the war progressed, however, he did increasingly come to favor precision bombing, e.g., synthetic oil facilities, the German transportation network, and so forth. Moreover, he suggested that bombing was hardly likely to gain victory over Germany by itself. At Casablanca he stressed that it was necessary "to exert the maximum pressure on Germany by land operations; air bombardment alone was not sufficient."71 Nevertheless, even in the last year of the struggle, Portal occasionally reverted to his earlier predilection for area bombing. It was he, for example, who was the main driving force behind the planning of Thunderclap, and even during his disputation with Harris in the fall of 1944 he suggested that it might be desirable very soon "to apply the whole of the strategic bomber efforts to the direct attack on German morale."72 The point is that because Portal was somewhat unresolved in his own mind about the merits of area versus precision bombing, it was all the more difficult for him to confront Harris about his commitment to the area offensive. Part of Portal always was drawn to the notion of a truly devastating assault on German urban centers. If Portal's relations with Harris were somewhat complex, the same cannot be said for Sir Archibald Sinclair's association with the chief of Bomber Command Sinclair had been the prewar leader of the Li
