If Portal's relations with Harris were somewhat complex, the same cannot be said for Sir Archibald Sinclair's association with the chief of Bomber Command Sinclair had been the prewar leader of the Liberal Party, and had served as Churchill's second-in-command in the Sixth Royal Scots Fusiliers in 1916 (which Churchill led for a brief period after being dismissed from the govern- ment). Sinclair almost never could bring himself to confront Churchill person- ally, even when it would have been most useful to do so, and even then only after "considerable stiffening" from Portal. He was effectively excluded from broad questions of strategy and detailed matters relating to aircraft production, and in the process he became a rather marginal figure. The evidence, in fact, rather convincingly suggests that Sinclair was a man who was considerably out of his depth, who was overawed by the single-mindedness of Arthur Harris, and who saw it as his function to deflect whatever criticisms might be advanced-both within and outside his Ministry-concerning the suitability of Bomber Command's strategy. Symptomatic of Sinclair's pliability was his position early in the war that we "could not gain a decision against Germany by bombing of the civil population. We achieve nothing by promiscuous bombing." After the War Cabinet had opted for the unrestrained area offensive, however, he became a fervent supporter of what he had earlier rejected.73 One of Churchill's aides described Sinclair as being a "high-minded and patriotic" man but an individual who "could seldom, when the time eventually came, stand up to the stronger personalities with whom it was his fate to contend."Lord Beaverbrook, in his typically caustic manner, described the Air Ministry 61 as being quite rotten and he added that Sinclair was "a thoroughly bad Minister who was hoodwinked by his subordinates."74 Beaverbrook had few qualms about the area bombing offensive, but he certainly would have counted Harris among the sub
