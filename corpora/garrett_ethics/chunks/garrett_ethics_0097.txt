Sinclair was "a thoroughly bad Minister who was hoodwinked by his subordinates."74 Beaverbrook had few qualms about the area bombing offensive, but he certainly would have counted Harris among the subordinates who hoodwinked Sinclair on a regular basis. In raising moral questions about the area offensive, what are we left with then after this discussion of the relationship between Harris and his superi- ors? If an indictment is justified, Harris may (as we have already argued) be rightly included among the accused, even if he can claim extenuating circumstances. His unwillingness to consider any reasonable alternative to the area offensive, indeed his virtual obsession with continuing urban attacks until the very last days of the war, is hard to defend or explain away. It is not enough simply to say that Harris's "character" was such that he could not have acted in any other way. His personality flaws, while they might command sympathy in another context, contributed to a degree of unneces- sary and inexcusable human suffering such that he must bear his share of guilt for British bombing policy. Even so, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the ultimate moral culpability for the inhumanity of the area offensive must lie at the feet of those who had the power, not just in theory but in actuality, to force a change of policy. Harris did the work of his masters in the way they wanted it done, at least in the earlier phases of the war, and the fact that they allowed him to retain command even after he entered into a period of defiance of orders from above could reasonably be interpreted as at least indirect complicity in his methods. To be sure Churchill had overarching political considerations in retaining Harris, Portal was a victim of his own mixed attitudes toward bombing strategy, and Sinclair was ill-suited as a general matter to exercise control over strong personalities. Yet none of this gainsays the fact that Harris was ultimately only a tool, ordered to-or
