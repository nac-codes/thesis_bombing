d has worked as a member of Jason, which, as Dyson describes it, is a "group of scientists who work on technical problems for the Depart- ment of Defense and other agencies of the American government." For our purposes, there is one other item in Dyson's resum√© that is of particular  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 64 65 The Servants of the Realm interest: during World War II he worked for the British Royal Air Force in the area of operations research.

The first concerns retrospective admissions of moral culpability. One might well challenge the relevance, even the moral consistency, of Dyson's offering an apology for his actions some 40 years after the event.
