consistency, of Dyson's offering an apology for his actions some 40 years after the event. An even harsher verdict might be that the author is citing a moral anguish now that he did not really feel, at least in the same degree, in the original circum- stance. There is also the matter of equating Bomber Command and the Eichmann organization. The former, it may well be argued, was created precisely to combat the evil that Eichmann represented; indeed, the former was made necessary by the latter. These are not small objections, but it is not the purpose here to offer a detailed moral or political critique of Dyson's writings (such as Weapons and Hope. which in fact impresses as a book of considerable power and integrity). Instead, his comments are offered by way of introduction to an assessment of the British scientific community's role in the strategy of area bombing. Certainly as far as aerial combat was concerned, the British struggle against Germany could in some real sense be called the "war of the boffins," the latter a generic term used to describe civilian specialists advising the Royal Air Force on technical matters Scientific talent was systematically recruited from the universities, industry, and various branches of government to contribute to the development of Bomber Command and its tactics, and scientists became important players in various types of operational decisions. They were involved in calculations on the lethality of various types of bombs, the properties of different metals for aircraft, communications, and navigational devices, and alternative targeting strategies. Aside from specific technical contributions (the most famous being the development of radar, which was actually achieved before the war broke out), perhaps the most salient role of the scientists was in the new field of "operations research." As a discipline, operations research purported to use methodology employed by various of the sciences to construct a rational overall plan for
