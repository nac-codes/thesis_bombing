scientists was in the new field of "operations research." As a discipline, operations research purported to use methodology employed by various of the sciences to construct a rational overall plan for the development and deployment of military resources. Science in War, an influential tract issued by 25 prominent British scientists in 1940, described operations research this way: "The waging of warfare represents a series of human operations carried out for more or less definite ends. Seeing whether these operations actually yield the results expected from them should be matter of direct scientific analysis."3 The whole idea of operations research was to make systematic in military decision-making what had previously been based largely on received wisdom or personal judgment. As the war progressed, each of the branches of the RAF (Bomber Command, Fighter Command, Coastal Command) developed their own operational research units. The issue that Dyson's plaintive lament raises is simply this: how common was his anguish among other of his fellow scientists, particularly those who were engaged in some form of operations research, which was the scientific endeavor that had the most direct connection to the area bombing of Germany? More generally, what stance did the British scien- tific community take toward the moral questions raised by the area bomb- ing offensive of Germany? There is an interesting analogy to their situation in the case of the Manhattan Project, the code name for the development of the atomic bomb. In 1940 a young American scientist, Dr. Volney Wilson, was asked to prepare a report on whether a chain reaction could be produced using ordinary uranium. Wilson worked intensively for two months and finally submitted a positive report on the matter. At the same time, he delivered himself of the following comments: "I believe it can be done, and if so it will be of great importance. But please take me off this job. It is going to be too terribly destructive.
