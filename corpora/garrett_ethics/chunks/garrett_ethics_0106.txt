he had gravitated into the study of primates and in particular the sexual and social life of apes and monkeys, from which two books resulted Because of his background in experimental work, he was called on in the early days of the war to undertake tests of the physical effects of blast and high-velocity fragments on living creatures (he used goats as particularly useful human approximations in these researches). Zuckerman was subsequently assigned to a broader study of the effect of German bombing raids on Great Britain and in particular the physical and morale impact of German attacks on Birmingham and Hull, the results of which were used (or abused) by Lord Cherwell for his own purposes. Eventually Zuckerman found himself in North Africa as scientific adviser to RAF Marshal Arthur Tedder, in which capacity he remained, even while assuming other responsibil. ities, for the rest of the war. It was when he joined Tedder's staff that his contribution to bombing strategy emerged in a pronounced way. Based on his analysis of the effect of Allied bombing in the North African campaign, Zuckerman developed some strongly held ideas as to how to maximize the effectiveness of airpower, particularly in support of the land campaign. In essence he became a strong supporter of precision bombing and one of those panacea merchants that Arthur Harris so constantly bewailed. An early test of his theories came with Allied air attacks on the island of Pantelleria, for which he was assigned considerable responsibility. Pantelleria was a small but heavily defended island that had to be occupied before the Allied forces could proceed with the invasion of Sicily. The bombing of Pantelleria was, as Zuckerman recalls, "planned down to the smallest detail, and I remember waiting for the reconnaissance photographs after each raid so that we would find out whether each bomb had or had not gone down exactly where we planned that it should go." The defenders of Pantelleria surrendered without a
