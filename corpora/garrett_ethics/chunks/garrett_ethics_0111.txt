engaged in area bombing against Japan with a fervor matching that demon- strated by British Bomber Command against Germany. In sum, it is clear that Zuckerman, now as then, feels no need to offer moral mea culpas for his role as scientist in British bombing strategy in World War II. In an earlier book on the relationship between the scientific community and military operations, he states flatly that "we cannot invest pure scientific knowledge with any inherent moral direction. That is imparted by the way science is used." He makes much of the fact that the seat of effective power is elsewhere and that it is there that moral considerations in policy-making (to the extent that they may be relevant) ought to be consid- ered.19 In adopting such a view, Zuckerman apparently reflected the prevail- ing mood of the British scientific community during World War II. Freeman Dyson, in fact, emerges as a relatively rare creature among the boffins. For the vast majority, the challenge of operational research was simply another scientific problem that engaged their intellectual curiosity. Indeed the war seems in many instances to have been something of a tonic to their scientific creativity. Zuckerman comments (without seeming irony) that "a state of war can stimulate the scientist to great feats of the imagination and to great practical achievement," especially since in wartime scientists enjoy "re- sources on a scale they had never dreamed of in peace."20 It is only right to recognize that the stance of British scientists was reinforced by a belief that they were part of a truly just war and were contributing to the vanquishing of an undoubted evil. As one of the main historians of the role of British science in the war has stated, there was an unusual consensus concerning the military conflict with Germany, "largely, no doubt, on account of the political and ideological beliefs of  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 72 73 The Servants of the Realm the enemy."
