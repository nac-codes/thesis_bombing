The Nazi regime was essentially anti-scientific in its orienta- tion and, even worse, used racial criteria in judging scientific talent (e.g., the obsession with developing a purely "Nazi physics" that would be uncontaminated by non-Aryan thinking). "Whatever the colour of a British scientist's beliefs in 1939 he was therefore united with his colleagues against the common enemy in a way that might not have been so certain had the enemy been a different one."21 Among the principal British scientists of World War II, Professor P. S. M. Blackett may perhaps be taken as a final example of the prevailing ethos within the scientific community. Blackett was widely regarded as the father of operations research on the British side in World War II. He served as an operations research specialist to RAF Coastal Command and later to the Admiralty, where his most renowned accomplishment was the development of the convey system to defeat German submarines. After the war, he acquired additional fame for his research in nuclear physics. Blackett was hardly unfamiliar with the world of military realities. As he once commented. "During nearly twenty years of my lifetime of sixty years, I [was] either training for war, fighting wars, or studying and thinking about them."22 It was Blackett, of course, who protested vigorously at Lord Cherwell's attempt to justify the area offensive by his calculations on the effect of dehousing German workers. Moreover, Blackett suggested that the bombing offensive appealed in a perverted way to what he called the "Jupiter com- plex" in Great Britain (as well in the United States), in which the Allies saw themselves as righteous gods, raining retributive thunderbolts on their wicked enemies.23 He denounced what he called a policy based on "gusts of emotion" that promised
