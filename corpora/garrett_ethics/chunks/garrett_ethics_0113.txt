ates), in which the Allies saw themselves as righteous gods, raining retributive thunderbolts on their wicked enemies.23 He denounced what he called a policy based on "gusts of emotion" that promised great things yet provided little if any standard by which realistic measurement of results could be obtained. Finally, Blackett was quite critical of the decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan. In a book written shortly after the war he even went so far as to suggest that the bomb was used primarily for political and not military reasons, particularly in order to impress the Soviet Union with the overwhelming power of the Western Allies. He suggested in this regard that "many American scientists undoubtedly felt morally distressed at finding the results of their brilliant scientific work used in a way which seemed to many of them [and, by inference, to Blackett] to lack adequate moral or military justification."24 Blackett was considered by his colleagues to be something of a radical in his politics and this may account in part for his attitude toward the use of the atomic bomb. Even so he does emerge as one of the f the few major scientists who, in the heat of the conflict, did manage to ponder some of the im- plications of what was being done in the name of the struggle against the Axis. Yet it is well once again not to make too much of his moral doubts about the area offensive. His attitude toward Hiroshima and Nagasaki was, after all, shared by a good many others who nevertheless felt that Allied bombing policy had been fundamentally legitimate. The issue here was complicated by the fact that Japan may have been on the verge of surrender even before the dropping of the bomb. Moreover, Blackett's stance on the area offensive was heavily influenced by his conviction that British airpower could be much more effectively deployed against the German U-Boat menace (particularly in the critical years 1942-1943). Blackett by this time was scientific adviser to the Adm
