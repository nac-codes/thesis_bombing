scientific officer on the staff of the Air Ministry-recalls, "this aroused much resentment among the aircrew, who thought that the Air Staff must doubt whether they had actually gone in to attack their targets. Ultimately, they were convinced that no one had doubted their courage."26 There was also another, rather bizarre example of an underlying tension between the cool calculations of the scientists and the folk wisdom of the aircrew. The idea had developed among the pilots that by turning on their IFF (Identification Friend or Foe), a radar pulse designed to separate friendly from hostile aircraft, they could incapacitate German searchlights who had  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 74 75 The Servants of the Realm caught a plane in their light. R. V. Jones recalled that doing so was actually counterproductive and possibly dangerous and that the practice should be most emphatically discouraged. At a major conference of Bomber Command staff attended also by various pilots, Jones laid out the scientific evidence arguing against this use of IFF. To his amazement, the pilots continued to insist that it was an effective tactic. Later the operational research section of Bomber Command was formally charged with determining if using IFF in this way had a beneficial impact. The conclusion was that it had no effect one way or another. Bomber Command argued, however, that it was good to have the pilots believing in it, since otherwise they might abort their missions if caught in the glare of the German searchlights. As Jones says, this "was a thoroughly immoral argument."27 Eventually, the aircrew and the leadership of Bomber Command (some- times grudgingly) accepted that the boffins did have something to offer in terms of making their missions both more efficient and more safe, even if the underlying prejudice against the supposed ivory-tower abstractions of the scientists continued to linger.
