signed to their roles as technicians of violence may provide a mixture of satisfaction and dismay to moral critics of British area bombing. On the one hand, it exculpates the fliers from the grosser charge that they actively "enjoyed" what they were doing or took positive satisfaction in the deaths of thousands of German civilians. On the other hand, the critics might want to feel that the aircrew themselves had moral doubts about their actions, which would only add support to an ethical indictment of the basic strategy itself. One of the prevailing myths about the American use of the atom bomb against Hiroshima, for example, is that one of the crew of the Enola Gay was so morally shattered by what he had done that it had a permanent and ruinous effect on his subsequent life. Even though the evidence for this assertion later proved to be quite dubious, it has often been cited in condemnations of the bombing of Hiroshima.39 The reality, fortunately or unfortunately, was that most fliers in Bomber Command were simply indifferent to the moral debate. Even the most sensitive aircrew generally found that they "felt no guilt or dismay at dropping bombs, simply because [their] fear entirely submerged any more noble or humane motive."40 One survivor of the bombing of Dresden recently wondered why there weren't any humane bomber crews who simply dropped their bombs off target in order to avoid the moral atrocity of attacking Dresden. The reason most aircrew would have given was that such an action might have at least slightly delayed the war's end and thus extended their own period of personal danger.41 At times Bomber Command pilots even offered a mocking assessment of the supposed moral issues raised by the area offensive. Thus two officers from 617 Squadron wrote a sardonic letter to The Times following the famous raid on the Mohne dam in the Ruhr Valley in May 1943. The letter denounced the dams raid because a pair of "ring-necked whooper swans" nested regu- larly on the
