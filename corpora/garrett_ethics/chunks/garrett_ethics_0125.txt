quicker than might have been expected the hard skin of callousness with which, quite naturally it seemed, most of us had so long covered our emotions. 43 Samuel Johnson once commented that the prospect of being hanged in the morning concentrated the mind wonderfully. In the case of Bomber Com- mand, the daunting challenge of surviving in the skies over Germany did seem to lead to a shuffling off of other considerations. It is a fine question whether any blame should attach to the aircrew for the fact that they generally had few moral doubts about their wartime operations. A first principle of the Nuremberg trials was that superior orders are not in themselves a defense for an individual soldier committing acts in violation of the laws of war and humanity, although the existence of such orders could be considered a mitigating factor in assigning punish- ment. Even so loathsome a figure as German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels rather bizarrely insisted on this principle (although somewhat less so with airmen in the Luftwaffe): "The pilots cannot say that they as soldiers acted upon orders. It is not provided in any military law that a soldier in the case of a despicable crime is exempt from punishment because he blames his superior, especially if the orders of the latter are in evident contradiction to all human morality and every international usage of warfare."44 Perhaps Bomber Command aircrew should have questioned more stringently the legality and ethics of what they were doing, but the argument is a rather problematical one when we consider that the area bombing of Germany was in accordance with specific directives from the highest political authority and was constantly defended as being crucial to Perhaps our focus here should be not so much on the (unsurprising) failure of Bomber Command personnel to question area bombing on moral grounds, but rather on another issue: the numbing effect that modern military technol- ogy has on those assigned to employ it.
