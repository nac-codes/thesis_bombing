e years after the war. He recalled that his one clear memory of being briefed to bomb whole areas was at Essen in July 1943. "At that point we were not aware that we were bombing civilians as such, because we had always been given an aiming-point like the docks, or a rubber factory or railway yards. But on this occasion the briefing said that we were to bomb the workers' houses or residential quarters and this came as some- thing of a personal shock."47 The point is that whatever moral doubts aircrew may have felt were assuaged by assurances that their aiming points were critical German military installations. In reinforcing Clausewitz's assertion about depersonalized violence, it is instructive to consider an example of a situation in which a pilot was not able  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 82 83 The Servants of the Realm to depersonalize what he was doing. The Master Bomber (basically the target indicator) for the RAF's second attack on Dresden was a very experienced pilot with more than three tours under his belt. In November 1944, about three months before the Dresden raid, he had been asked to serve as Master Bomber for an attack on Freiburg im Bresgau. He declined, since he had studied at the university there and had many friends in the area around the Freiburg Cathedral, which was the aiming point selected for this particular assault. However, he had never been to Dresden, and even though he regretted the destruction of such a fine city, he went ahead with this assignment, since he could offer no compelling personal reason for not carrying it out. 48 As this incident suggests, it would be a mistake to leave the impression that the moral issue never impacted on the consciousness of the fliers in Bomber Command. Perhaps their engagement with the matter was a lot less than critics of the area offensive would have hoped for, but what is striking from a somewhat different perspective is the degree to which the ethical question did emerge from time to time.
