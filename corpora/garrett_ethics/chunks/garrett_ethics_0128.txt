lot less than critics of the area offensive would have hoped for, but what is striking from a somewhat different perspective is the degree to which the ethical question did emerge from time to time. The evidence on this score is scattered but nevertheless suggestive. A former navigator recalls, for example, that after a briefing on an apparently non-military target, someone in the back of the room called out, "women and children first again" (a comment which was studiously ignored). Air-gunner Geoff Parnell remembered his feelings during the great raid on Hamburg in July 1943: "There were people down there being fried to death in melted asphalt in the roads, they were being burnt up and we were shuffling incendiary bombs into this holocaust. I felt terribly sorry for the people in that fire I was helping to stoke up."49 There is also this recollection from a long-serving Pathfinder navigator who touched both on his own qualms and on the difficulties of giving them practical expression: Area, or town bombing, upset many of the aircrews, myself particularly. I always hated the thought of indiscriminate bombing and always thought of women, children, hospitals and suchlike. But to whom could you express such doubts? Raids on our cities helped to still the small voice of conscience but it worries me still to this day. Had the Germans won the war, should we or ought we to have been tried as war criminals? If we believed it morally wrong, should we have spoken out to our squadron commanders and refused to participate? What would have been the result? Court martial! It would have needed much more courage to have spoken out on this matter than the mere fact of continuing to fly on operations. So no one voiced his reservations but the thoughts live with me to this day.50 In May 1943, some members of 76 Squadron, based in Yorkshire, expressed their unhappiness with attacking Wuppertal simply because, as their intelligence officer told them, they would be able in doing so to c
