1943, some members of 76 Squadron, based in Yorkshire, expressed their unhappiness with attacking Wuppertal simply because, as their intelligence officer told them, they would be able in doing so to catch thousands of refugees crowded into the area after an earlier Bomber Command assault on the Ruhr. As German air defenses drastically declined in late 1944, an increasing number of British airmen were sufficiently relieved of their fear for survival to develop a pity for the fate of those below. For some of the aircrew of Bomber Command, as for many others, the attack on Dresden seems, for example, to have represented at long last a step too far. One reflection of the disapproval was symbolic in nature: certain of the squadrons assigned to attack Dresden voted to forgo a customary ritual-the dropping of bits of concrete and other junk intended as an insult to the Germans. There is also the comment from one of the men involved in the Dresden raid that "for the first time in the war I truly felt sorry for the people below."51 It is interesting to note that even though they may have felt no qualms themselves, certain major figures in authority during the war worried that the aircrew might become infected by moral criticism of their activities, and thus they attempted to shield them from such talk as much as possible. Arthur Harris, for one, constantly fretted that the relatively unfettered British press might undermine the morale of his personnel by giving space to the ethical musings of area bombing opponents. We have previously referred to his objecting to Archibald Sinclair and others dissimulating as to the real character of the area offensive; such a stance, he thought, might lead his aircrew to conclude that they were being asked to do things that the Air Ministry was ashamed to admit. A member of Parliament who also happened to be a flight-lieutenant in the RAF spoke for many when he deplored all the statements calling into doubt the purpose of the bomber offensi
