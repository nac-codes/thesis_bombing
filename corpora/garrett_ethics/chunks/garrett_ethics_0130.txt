ashamed to admit. A member of Parliament who also happened to be a flight-lieutenant in the RAF spoke for many when he deplored all the statements calling into doubt the purpose of the bomber offensive. "It is tough to ask these chaps to undergo great dangers and perils, which they do cheerfully and bravely, unless they are convinced . . . that it is worth doing."52 The concern that existed about the sowing of ethical doubts among the aircrew was well-illustrated by an incident that took place at High Wycombe and involved the socialist Minister of Aircraft Production, Sir Stafford Cripps.

In case his point was missed, he reminded the fliers that "even when you are engaged  85 The Servants of the Realm Ethics and Airpower in World War II have failed to have at least some effect on many of those who had served in the bombers.

The meeting was called to an abrupt halt by the chairman. Churchill soon learned about this curious session and expressed his displeasure. He was d
