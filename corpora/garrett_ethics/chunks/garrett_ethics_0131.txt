He was described as "incensed with Stafford Cripps for making a speech about brotherly feelings for the Germans." In the typical Churchillian fashion, he said that he "might agree with such sentiments when victory is won, but not with a great battle raging and the Huns shooting captured soldiers in cold blood."54 The sensitivity that existed on this matter could be seen in the angry comment offered by one of the chief defenders of Bomber Command to the effect that "no chivalrous airman wants to slaughter grandmothers or ba- bies."55 If there was this degree of concern about the receptivity of aircrew to the moral question, one can only conclude that either the problem was greatly exaggerated or that alternatively-and more interestingly-there was perhaps a greater degree of moral uneasiness among the fliers than might be apparent from the surface evidence. The Legacy of Guilt There is a final point to be made concerning the men of Bomber Command. Even if it is assumed that most aircrew were relatively free of moral doubts while they were undertaking their missions against Germany, they can have hardly been impervious to the widespread moral questioning that was levied against their activities after the war. Particularly bitter must have been the comments of fellow airmen who now denounced their comrades' former behavior.
