least some basis in fact, it is a matter of considerable interest to evaluate the general reaction of the British citizen to the area bombing offensive against German cities conducted in his or her name during World War II. In what follows there will be a focus on groups and individuals from various walks of British life. They can be considered together in the sense that none were directly involved in the strategy or operations of Bomber Command. Some held official posts outside the inner circle of decision-makers involved in directing the war effort, i.e., backbenchers in Parliament. Others were prominent in the religious community or in various literary or social realms. Attention is also given here to British society as a whole, since the views of the average citizen concerning the strategy of British arms were ultimately of considerable import- ance in a political system that remained basically responsive to popular will. A few preliminary observations are in order.
