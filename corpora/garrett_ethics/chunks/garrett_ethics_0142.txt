st chapter reflects Spaight's fundamental thesis: "The Bomber Saves Civilization." Spaight goes out of his way to assure his readers that he is not an unfeeling man and that he is as sensible as the next person Despite this bow in the direction of moral rectitude, Spaight's references to the supposed ethical issues raised by the area offensive are essentially pro forma, using language that was commonplace in virtually everything written or said by the Cromwellians. The real thrust of his analysis is to dismiss the idea that there was actually any issue to be debated concerning the area offensive.

He stressed that Hitler's supposed conversion to humanitarianism (his protests against British terror bombing) was no more than an attempt to blunt the extraordinary effectiveness of Bomber Command's campaign over Germany. This argument for bombing on utilitarian grounds also contained a warning to his audience that British civilians would themselves pay the price of any "forbearance shown by our airmen," which implied that a curtailment of the area offensive would prolong the war and cause further suffering for the British people.

If any were left unconvinced by his dismissal of moral problems in the area offensive, Spaight added that what the Germans were doing to others was more terrible than anything the British were doing, which supposedly exculpated Great Britain from any putative viol
