in the area offensive, Spaight added that what the Germans were doing to others was more terrible than anything the British were doing, which supposedly exculpated Great Britain from any putative violation of humanitarian prin- ciples in the conduct of the war. What is especially striking about Bombing Vindicated is how the author- who, given his professional background, presumably had accurate informa- tion on Bomber Command's strategy-consistently denies that his country was actually targeting the urban population in Germany. In a chapter entitled "The Bombing of Civilians," Spaight simply rejects the notion that there was any plan for the bombing of civilians. Indeed he accepts that "indiscriminate bombing is certainly not justified," yet suggests that this is not a matter that  95 The Subjects of the Realm Ethics and Airpower in World War II 94 need engage the concern of his readers since such was not being pursued. Certainly there was some unintended death and destruction visited on German cities, but military industries and workers, as well as famous cultural sites, were unfortunately generally located in the middle of urban centers. Spaight especially denies that German morale was anything other than a quite incidental object of British bombing. None of these claims, of course, were in any way reflective of the fact that morale indeed was mentioned prominently in various directives given to Bomber Command during the war, that Arthur Harris's own statements described his aircrew as simply aiming their bombs at the middle of German cities, or that German military industry was generally located not in the center but on the outskirts of the cities. Spaight's dissimulation on this score was, to be sure, reflective of the public relations stance taken by official governmental spokesmen, for example, Archibald Sinclair, con- cerning Bomber Command's tactics. Perhaps the fact that Spaight felt it necessary to engage in such a deception, even while extolling the great
