was a good deal more ambiguous and contradictory than might have been expected. Certainly there was general support for the notion that this was after all a just war and that the Nazis represented a fundamental threat to basic Christian values that could only be defeated by force of arms Yet this stance must be set alongside a fairly lively debate evident amongst various Anglican luminaries as to what means were legitimate in the prose cution of this particular just war. At the very least, Church of England clergy tended to avoid the fairly unsubtle linking of God's will with English interests that characterized their behavior in World War I. One reason for so doing may have been their perception that the Church's credibility had been undermined-particularly among the young and the better-educated-by the unabashedly propagandistic stance taken by clergy in the earlier struggle. Perhaps as one consequence of this alienation. organized religion was at relatively low ebb on the outbreak of World War II. On Easter Sunday, 1940, for example, only 6 adults in 100 took commu nion in Anglican churches. A subsequent survey indicated that six of ten in Britain never went to any church at all, and a third of those under 40 describe themselves as non-believers. The nonconformist churches (Methodist, Bap- tist, Congregationalist) had their own fall-offs in membership, with a decline of about 50 percent from 30 years earlier.21 To the extent that there was a debate among religious leaders about the means (although not the ends) of the war effort, the primary focus clearly seemed to be on strategic bombing, and in particular the area bombing of German cities. It needs emphasizing that only a handful of the clergy objected outright to area bombing. George Bell, Bishop of Chichester, was the most prominent and his case will be considered in detail later on. The Bishop of Birmingham, the Moderator of the Church of Scotland, and the Methodist leader Donald Soper were others who expre
