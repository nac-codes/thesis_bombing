has it, he was the "quintessence of compromise . . . firmly in the centre of British politics." Churchill himself was initially rather doubtful about his appointment, since Temple had formerly been a member of the Labour Party and was identified with quite progressive social views, expressed in books such as Christianity and Social Order, but in time he too came to appreciate the qualities of the new Archbishop of Canterbury.23 As the champion of compromise, and perhaps even more as the presumed spiritual leader of the British people, Temple trod a very delicate path during the war whenever questions of military policy arose. He echoed with ap- proval the old saying that "it is the duty of Lambeth [the Church] to remind Westminster that Westminster is responsible to God; but this does not mean that Westminster is responsible to Lambeth." Translated into concrete terms. this attitude seemed to suggest that the Church had no right to criticize the government over area bombing, even though there might be some standards of restraint to which the government should be sensitive. Temple's attitude on military matters could at times be exceedingly opaque. With respect to the British naval blockade of Germany, for example. he said that "it seems to me that in the phase the war has now reached [June 1942], to object to the blockade on the ground presumably of the suffering that it will cause is stark materialism."24 The "materialism" referred to presumably reflected the German civilians' desire to continue to eat and be clothed.
