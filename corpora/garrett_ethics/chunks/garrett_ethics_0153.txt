a crisis. Their chagrin was reinforced when the Church, after the war, seemed to accept belatedly that city bombing was after all quite unacceptable. In a report by a Church commission appointed by the Archbishop of York and the Archbishop of Canterbury (now Dr. Fisher, who had succeeded Temple in 1944 after the latter's death), the following judgment was rendered: "The commission is agreed that 'obliteration' bombing of whole cities ... must be condemned. It is inconsistent with the limited end of a just war; it violates the principles of discrimination which we have established; and it is not necessary for the security of the attacking aircraft. In fact it constitutes an act of wholesale destruction that cannot be justified." One of the leading opponents of the area offensive commented sourly at the time that the isolated protests of the tiny Bombing Restriction Committee would have been enormously helped if the members of the commission had taken this stance during the war. Of the sixteen eminent churchmen involved, however, only the Archdeacon of Stoke had spoken up while the bombing was going on.27 Perhaps one could have expected William Temple and others in the church to be more forthcoming in their opposition to area bombing, yet it is well to remember the pressures under which they were operating. It bears repeating that if truth is the first casualty of war, the willingness, even the ability, to oppose one's government on a major issue of wartime policy is perhaps the second. One authority on the role of the church in wartime summarizes the factors that seemed to dictate a cautious attitude by clergy: [Their] reticence is usually explained in terms of 'prudence' as manifested in a desire to avoid making a 'rash judgment' based on only partial access to the facts; a desire to avoid subjecting the Church and its individual members to the persecution that would almost certainly follow such a denunciation; and, finally, a desire to avoid placing the individual
