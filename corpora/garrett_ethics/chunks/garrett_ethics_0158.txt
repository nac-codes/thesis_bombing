Voices are already heard, crying that mercy must temper justice, that vengeance belongs alone to God. ... All these sentimental appeals are bunkum and hypocrisy . . . whether they come from a familiar prelate or some unsuspected quisling." Especially virulent in their support of the area offensive were the Beaver- brook newspapers, for which a typical headline was, "Why all this bosh about being gentle with the Germans after we have beaten them when ALL GERMANS ARE GUILTY!"31 Even when this type of flamboyant language was avoided, a consistent pattern in the popular press's treatment of the air war was the use of sporting metaphors and rather flip characterizations that were as offensive to critics of Bomber Command as the more overt chauvinism often seen on the front pages. An early example was this headline following one of the major engagements in the Battle of Britain: "Theirs, 78, Ours, 17," which implied that the killing overhead was not very different from a cricket match. Another headline in July 1943 read, "Hamburg has been Hamburgered" (a variation of "Coventried" to describe the devastation of Coventry). One officer in the RAF reacted to what he called this coarsening of rhetoric by saying that "the tragic evolution of war was commented on in the language of a gang fight in a school playground."32 At the same time, there were occasional, more temperate voices in the press who, even while giving support to the war effort, raised some troubling questions about air strategy.
