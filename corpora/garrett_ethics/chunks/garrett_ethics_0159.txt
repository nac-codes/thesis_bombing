The Economist, a highly regarded journal dealing with international affairs, also questioned some of the particulars of Bomber Command's activities. To be sure, such commentary was in the distinct minority, but it did exist and offered at least some comfort to the equally small minority among the public who were openly critical of the area offensive.

These individuals were against all war, however waged, and area bombing was seen as only a particularly repugnant example of the larger evil. Others, however, favored military resistance to the Nazis but stopped short of sanction for air attacks on German cities. Then there were those who seemed to underpin their moral outrage with a pragmatic judgment: they asserted that area bombing was not militar- ily efficient and consequently it was not morally justifiable. In many ways the debate between these latter two groups was the most interesting.
