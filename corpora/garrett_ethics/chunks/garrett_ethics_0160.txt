ad to oppose it. There was a final difference in the behavior of the dissenters that merits attention here. Some attempted to work essentially through "back-chan- nels," that is, via private communications to those in authority. Typical was the Marquess of Salisbury, and not surprisingly those who took this route tended to have prominent Establishment positions that gave them some inherent credibility with the decision-makers. Others, such as the writer Vera Brittain, took a more public route and again for somewhat understandable reasons: Brittain had no cachet with Churchill's inner circle, and moreover she had an instinctive faith in the morality and good sense of the average British citizen. In these circumstances, it was natural that she should use her published writings and public speeches to press her views. There were still others who employed both public and private avenues, such as Bishop George Bell. Because of his ecclesiastical posi- tion, not to mention his seat in the House of Lords, he had ample opportu- nity to preach on the immorality of area bombing. At the same time, again because of his relatively exalted status, he attempted to sway the views of other notables in more discreet ways. One may debate whether, as a general matter, it is most effective to go public or private in dissenting against government policy, and each of the individuals to be examined no doubt had his or her own theory as to the right way to proceed. At the same time, it is unmistakable that their strategy depended at least in part on their opportunities-those on the outside attempted to speak to the broader society, those on the inside endeavored to 105 use their contacts to influence policy. The only ultimate test of strategy here remains the relative effectiveness of the different methods pursued. As it turned out, none of the protesters against the area bombing of Germany found a way to have a major, or even a minor, impact on policy. This does not mean, however, that the
