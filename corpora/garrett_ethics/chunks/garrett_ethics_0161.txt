ent methods pursued. As it turned out, none of the protesters against the area bombing of Germany found a way to have a major, or even a minor, impact on policy. This does not mean, however, that the efforts and the anguish of several of the most prominent dissenters do not merit closer examination. An awareness that there are individuals who have the courage to oppose the (often passing) wisdom of the many is rewarding in itself. The Military Historians Perhaps the most surprising source of dissent against the area offensive came from the British strategic analyst Captain Sir Basil Liddell Hart, who was extremely influential in the interwar years and was sometimes described as a shadow CIGS (chief of the Imperial General Staff) It was he who, in the 1920s, had been one of the most prominent voices arguing for an emphasis on the strategic air offensive. At the time Liddell Hart had also expatiated on the comparative humanity of fighting a war through strategic bombing. His theory was that such bombing was likely to produce victory far more quickly than the land operations of World War I and thus on balance would save lives. He argued that this might be especially so if the bombers employed gas rather than high explosives. "Gas may well prove the salvation of civilization from the otherwise inevitable collapse in the case of another world war."33 In his memoirs Liddell Hart recalls how impressed Sir Hugh Trenchard, chief of the Air Staff, was with his analysis, and how Trenchard ordered a number of copies of Paris, or the Future of War for his senior officers and for the new RAF Staff College.34 Trenchard presumably would have been somewhat less pleased with Liddell Hart's reaction to Bomber Command's attacks on Rostock, Cologne, and other German cities in 1942. In a Reflection that he wrote at the time, Liddell Hart delivered himself of the following sentiments: It will be ironical if the defenders of civilization depend for victory upon the most barbaric, and unski
