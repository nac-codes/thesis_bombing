r of strategic bombing to captious critic?36 In any such transforma- tion there is bound to remain an element of puzzle, and for the cynic, grounds for skepticism or even derision. It is curious in this regard that in his memoirs Liddell Hart is virtually silent in explaining why his views did change so greatly. He devotes a few offhand remarks to relatively minor technical matters involving strategic airpower in World War II but says nothing at all about his condemnation of the area offensive as immoral, or, for that matter, as militarily ineffectual. Since his memoirs appeared some 20 years after the end of the war, perhaps he thought it best to let his seemingly contradictory position on the air offensive simply remain a moot point. In hunting about for an explanation of Liddell Hart's dramatically altered view on airpower, it seems evident that even before World War II he had come to have serious doubts about the strategic bombing force's technical ability to actually locate and hit defined targets, at least with a weight of bombs sufficient to affect morale and arms production in any decisive way. Moreover, he seemed to feel that Germany, not Britain, would have the advantage in any mutual competition in strategic air strikes, and that modern air defenses would in any case likely prove far more effective than could have been anticipated in the 1920s. In a reflection of his changed strategic analysis, Liddell Hart in the late 1930s strongly urged that Britain concen- trate on building up its fighter defenses against possible German air attacke rather than devote major attention to Bomber Command.37 It also seems unmistakable, however, that part of the basis for Liddell Hart's condemnation of the area offensive in World War II had to do with specifically moral concerns. He seemed to be genuinely appalled by the continual "Cologning" of German cities and, paradoxically, his ethical outrage could perhaps be seen as consistent with his earlier support of the air off
