He seemed to be genuinely appalled by the continual "Cologning" of German cities and, paradoxically, his ethical outrage could perhaps be seen as consistent with his earlier support of the air offensive. That position after all had been heavily influenced by his revulsion at the mindless trench slaughter of World War I (he himself served for some months at the front and participated in the Battle of the Somme) and more generally by his virtual obsession with finding a means of conflict that would avoid the slide from limited to total war. To be sure, Liddell Hart had seemed to condone area attacks in his earlier writings, but only on the basis that these might prove militarily decisive and in a short period of time. Given his later conclusions that Bomber Command's operations were not There are two other aspects to Liddell Hart's views on the area offensive that, for some, might call into question his being awarded the moral high ground.
