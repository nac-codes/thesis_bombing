In any case, Liddell Hart's distaste for the Prime Minister was returned in full measure. Churchill commented at one point that the military analyst seemed "more a candidate for a mental home than for more serious action."39 Perhaps what Churchill had in made when he offered this remark was Liddell Hart's attitude toward Hitler and the German threat generally. His position here was the other point that might give some pause in applauding his wartime denunciation of the area offensive. Basically Liddell Hart felt that Hitler was no more than a classic exemplar of the European power politician intent on expanding his geopolitical domain.
