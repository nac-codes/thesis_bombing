It should be noted in passing that Liddell Hart was not the only military historian in Britain to express his outrage at the area offensive. Major General J. F. C. Fuller was in many ways Liddell Hart's equal in prestige as an analyst of military affairs. Both had written widely on the offensive potential of mobile armored warfare, and their ideas had made a considerable impact in 109 various quarters, especially in Germany itself.
