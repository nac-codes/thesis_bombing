Instead, he was subjected to a withering cross-examination as to how he had obtained advance notice that the coming invasion of Europe would take place in Normandy. He had considerable difficulty in convincing his interlocutors that a memorandum of his two months earlier had merely reflected his reasoned assessment given Allied troop deployments in southern England.42 Perhaps the stringent critique that both Liddell Hart and Fuller offered of one of the prim rime strategic commitments of the government makes this exclusion from its affairs unsurprising.
