during the war caused a sufficient number to regard him as unsound that his prospects were perma- nently stifled. The lesson seemed to be that it was acceptable to have been involved in and supportive of area bombing during the war as long as one was not unduly boastful about it. It was also acceptable to have been rather critical of area bombing as long as one was suitably discreet and private about it. The point in each case was to be able to resume one's career after the war without having been identified strongly with one side or the other. Neither Bell nor Harris, for perhaps similar reasons, found it possible to cover their tracks in this way. The Politicians Dr. Alfred Salter was a Labour member of Parliament from the depressed constituency of West Bermondsey in the East End of London. He was widely respected as a force for the renewal and at least modest beautification of his otherwise rather grim district. He made no secret of his loyalties: his entire life was spent as a socialist, a pacifist, and a Quaker. His opposition to his government's bombing policy against Germany was rather less subtle and complicated than George Bell's. Salter simply felt that the taking of human life for whatever reason was an illegitimate act. Yet it would be facile to dismiss his protest against area bombing as merely the rote expression of pacifist beliefs. In reality, Salter may have been against war as a tool of policy, but it was Britain's strategy of indiscriminate attacks against the German civilian population that aroused his special ire. Moreover, the MP for West Bermondsey was, like Bell, hardly unaware of the pressures for compromise and the commonsensical necessity of sometimes adjusting one's views to the prevailing political realities. Salter dwelled not in the ivory tower but in the rough-and-tumble of his blue-collar constituency (unlike many British MP's then and since, he actually lived in the district that he repre- sented in Parliament).
