tower but in the rough-and-tumble of his blue-collar constituency (unlike many British MP's then and since, he actually lived in the district that he repre- sented in Parliament).  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 116 The Subjects of the Realm There was still another circumstance that made the consistency of Salter's condemnation of Bomber Command's tactics rather compelling. West Bermondsey was particularly hard hit by the German Blitz of London. Of approximately 19,500 properties in the district, only 730 escaped some damage from German bombs. Alfred Salter's own residence was leveled by the Luftwaffe. For him to protest against the area bombing of Germany thus seemed to be conduct almost unique in its dispassion and devotion to principle. As with Bell, such conduct also carried a price. Salter was acutely aware of his relative isolation from the political mainstream almost from the beginning of the war. He calculated that only about six Labour MPs, led by the redoubtable George Lansbury, were actively opposed to the war at the outset. Perhaps another 20 to 30 MPs desired a truce with Germany following the collapse of Poland (22 of these signed a demand for a conference with Berlin to work out the terms of such a cease-fire). Salter figured that some 70 constituency Labour parties were in favor of a truce. All in all, not an impressive support network, especially when compared to the far greater body of those demanding a fight to the finish against German transgressions. What was particularly painful to Alfred Salter was his perception that his old allies in the West Bermondsey Labour Party essentially abandoned him once he made his opposition to the war clear. He reflected with some bitterness that his colleagues' earlier pacifist inclinations vanished once the government called for support in the military struggle against Germany. Symptomatic of the new mood, in Salter's view, was the decision of the Bermondsey Borough Council-once one of the most progressiv
