In passing, it might be noted that Richard Stokes too suffered the effects of having spoken out against the area offensive, at least before it became fashionable to do so. As we have already detailed, the postwar Labour government of Clement Atlee hardly disguised its disdain for Arthur Harris and other champions of Bomber Command, but this did not seem to translate into a willingness to welcome into the fold those who  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 120 The Subjects of the Realm had been "premature" in their moral objections to the area offensive.

His reward for these and similar remarks was to be excluded from ministerial office, to which he could normally have expected promotion.
