Her closest female friend, the novelist Winifred Holtby, died in her early forties. Her father suffered from life-long bouts of depression and finally killed himself in 1935.

Her witnessing of the suffering of both friend and enemy seems to have had a profound impact. She describes one occasion when, alone in a hospital ward, she was gazing half-hypnotized at the dishevelled beds, the stretchers on the floor, the scattered boots and piles of muddy khaki, the brown blankets turned back from
