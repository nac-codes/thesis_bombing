when, alone in a hospital ward, she was gazing half-hypnotized at the dishevelled beds, the stretchers on the floor, the scattered boots and piles of muddy khaki, the brown blankets turned back from smashed limbs bound to splints by filthy blood-stained bandages. Beneath each stinking wad of sodden wool and gauze an obscene horror waited for me-and all the equipment I had for attacking it in this ex-medical ward was one pair of forceps standing in a potted-meat glass half-full of methylated spirit.60 Given this memory, it may not have been difficult for her to envisage what the hospital wards in any German city were like after a visit from Bomber Command. Indeed, she stated later that her pacifism had its roots in her experience nursing wounded German POWs in France in 1917, since she saw them not in the abstract as the enemy but as fellow human beings.

In assessing her position, it needs emphasizing that as a pacifist she was similar to Alfred Salter in that she condemned the use of violence in whatever form. For both Salter and Brittain, condemnation of the area offensive was only part and parcel of a more general rejection of the tools of war to settle political disputes.

In other words, all war may have been evil, b
