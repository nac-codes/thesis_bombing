Any serious critique of the area offensive has to set out the moral argument in a good deal more systematic fashion than has heretofore been attempted. The following two chapters are an effort to do so. One very important caveat does have to be offered at the outset. There is a surprisingly sparse literature wherein specific historical problems of security or foreign policy are examined using an ethical framework. Such case studies as do exist, moreover, have often been rendered somewhat unsatisfactory by the tendency of the writer not to recognize the full complexity of the situations in which decision-makers found themselves.
