. Even more important, it fails to consider this reality in its own terms, that is to say, as an evolving collection  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 132 Standards and Principles of circumstances and decisions that had to be dealt with at a particular time and at a particular place by a particular group of individuals. In what follows, we will basically be working outward from the history of the area bombing offensive against Germany. This requires that we first establish a set of admittedly broad moral guidelines that can form at least a tentative basis for judgment. In arriving at such a judgment, however, it is crucial to acknowledge the full complexity of what faced the relevant individuals in Britain at the time and to describe these complications as straightfor- wardly as possible. In one of the more notable studies of the ethical dilemmas facing public officials, Donald Warwick expresses the challenge here rather nicely: "An ethical framework built on an idealized conception of what public officials will do will tilt toward sanctimony or collapse into irrelevance; one erected on inadequate moral principles will incline toward cynicism or topple into description."2 In considering the British area offensive against Germany, I want to assess what actual (or realistic) moral choices were open to British officials and what can be said about the quality of the decisions eventually taken. THE SHERMANESQUE FALLACY There is probably no writer on military strategy who has been more quoted (and misquoted) than Karl von Clausewitz, the famous author of On War and universally regarded as a basic source for insights into the relationship between war and politics. There is no doubt that Clausewitz, who wasa scholar but also a man of considerable practical military experience, ha much to tell us about the peculiar institution of war. Yet he also offered moral definition of the practice of war that has been the bane of thoughtful analysts of ethics in wartime ever since.
