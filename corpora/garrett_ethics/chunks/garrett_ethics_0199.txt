s in the American Civil War, which included the burning of Atlanta and the mass destruction visited on a wide swath of the South during his march to the sea, Sherman argued that "war is cruelty and you cannot refine it." In a later speech to the graduating cadets at West Point, he summarized his stance in the famous phrase, "War is Hell." What he meant here is of some importance to our subsequent analysis. Sherman was not defending war itself; on the contrary, he stressed that it was a most terrible institution. He suggested therefore that it was those who were responsible for the initiation of war that had to answer to the moral philosophers. Those who were charged with bringing the war to a successful conclusion could hardly be held accountable for the methods they subsequently used to meet such a goal. It was not the techniques of war that were at issue, then, but rather the very use of it as a tool of policy.4 It is interesting to see how widely shared Sherman's attitude was by various figures in the British Government and, more specifically, the RAF during World War II. Consider the following examples. Arthur Tedder, a generally admirable figure who questioned Bomber Command's strategy and favored precision bombing, suggested that "the history of war affords little hope that nations which are fighting for their lives and beliefs will be restricted in their conduct of the war by moral factors." Air Marshall Sir Robert Saundby, second-in-command to Arthur Harris, also employed the precepts of Clausewitz and Sherman in analyzing Bomber Command's attack on Dresden: It is not so much this or the other means of making war that is immoral or inhumane. What is immoral is war itself. Once full-scale war has broken out it can never be humanized or civilized, and if one side attempted to do it it would be most likely to be defeated. So long as we resort to war to settle differences between nations, so long will we have to endure the horrors, barbarities and excesses that
