So long as we resort to war to settle differences between nations, so long will we have to endure the horrors, barbarities and excesses that war brings with it. That, to me, is the lesson of Dresden.6  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 134 Standards and Principles The suggestion that the "realist" in wartime has to concern himself simply with the taking of lives cannot be taken in any serious sense as a self-evident proposition, however.
