civilized societies might contemplate. A bizarre episode at the Teheran Conference in November 1943 provides an example of Churchill's sensitivity on this point. Stalin suggested at one point that the most effective way to prevent a resurgence of German aggres- sion after the war would be to shoot out of hand at least 50,000, perhaps even 100,000, of the surviving German officer corps, thus decapitating at one blow future German military leadership. This idea may have been presented simply as an expression of Stalin's mordant sense of humor, but Churchill took it all quite seriously. He replied heatedly that he could never agree to such a proposal, that carrying it out would represent a permanent stain on the honor of the British people. Roosevelt attempted to lighten the somewhat strained atmosphere at this point by suggesting as a compromise that "only" 49,000 German officers should be shot. Churchill waved off this sally with impatience, and demanded that attention now be given to the next item on the agenda.9 It might be noted in passing that slaughtering virtually the whole of the German officer corps would have been a fairly effective way of undermining German military prowess, at least in the short run. Clearly, however, Churchill did not see it in these terms and in consequence rein- forced the notion that it was not just the ends of war but the means of it as well that required suitable attention. The assertion that historically there have been limits to the degree and type of violence in wartime undertaken by various of its participants does leave the question of what general standards of restraint may be identified and also from what source these derive. The first of these matters is considered below, but as to the origins of-or rationale for-restraint in wartime, three primary factors seem to contribute. There are the particular values and institutions of the warring state itself, which may or may not dictate moderation in certain measures of violence.
