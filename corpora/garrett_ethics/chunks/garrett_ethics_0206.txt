t was permissible for army units to shell a city despite the risk this involved to the non-combatant population (who, it was assumed, could leave the area of danger if they so desired). Even in this instance, such shelling had to be in pursuance of a legitimate military objective, that is, the capture of the besieged city. As far as the treatment of undefended towns was concerned, ground forces (e.g., artillery) were absolutely forbidden from attacks on such places. The general principles enunciated did give naval units rather more latitude than the army. Thus ships were allowed to shell specific military objectives in undefended cities, even if this might cause collateral damage among civilians. The rationale was that naval forces frequently were not in  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 138 Standards and Principles a position to actually capture the city whereas ground forces were, and thus attacks by the latter on an undefended town were quite unnecessary. Not surprisingly, supporters of the area offensive argued that by analogy air operations should be governed by the naval rules of the Hague Convention. 11 Even if we accept this association, the Hague Convention of 1907 hardly constitutes a legal defense of British bombing policy, and most especially in its final climactic phase. One of the possible ways in which it might be held to do so is to assert that German cities actually remained "defended" to the last days of the war. From the evidence that has already been produced, it is clear that this was true only in the most formal sense and that its truth depends on an almost infinitely flexible definition of "defended." The reality was that the Allies had virtually unchallenged command of German airspace by the summer of 1944; to the extent that population centers were defended, this defense increasingly became a pro forma exercise (there was not a single Luftwaffe sortie against the Allied planes that bombed Dresden in February 1945). Given the helplessness
