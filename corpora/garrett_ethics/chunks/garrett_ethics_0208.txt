es with Great Britain's war against Germany in terms of jus ad bellum. This was indeed a classic example of a war of self-defense, not only of Britain itself but of other weak and innocent third parties in all areas of Europe who succumbed to the Nazi yoke in the early years of the struggle. Moreover, Britain's declaration of war on Germany on September 3, 1939 was a perfect example of war's being resorted to only as a last resort. The whole history of British foreign policy in the mid- and late 1930s was a tapestry of repeated attempts by London to arrive at a peaceful settlement of outstanding disputes with Hitler. The Munich agreement stands out as the most famous (and perhaps notorious) effort in this direction. It was only when it became plain to one and all, and not just in Britain, that Hitler was embarked on an essentially unlimited campaign of conquest and subjugation that Neville Chamberlain (as the legitimate authority) took the extremely painful step of declaring a state of belligerency with Berlin. The moral case against the area bombing offensive of Germany, then, has to do entirely with the question of jus in bello. It is important to reiterate that just war theory does make a clear distinction between the purposes and the conduct of war. Even though the former can be entirely legitimate, this does not negate the demands (and the restrictions) of the latter, and indeed violations of norms of jus in bello can render a war illegitimate even if fought with right intent. It does have to be admitted that this is by far the most difficult and obscure part of the just war system. Jus in bello deals with such a potentially vast range of specific problems and issues that it is difficult to imagine there will ever be a universal consensus on what is just or unjust in the application of wartime violence. For our purposes, how- ever, this problem need not be unduly obtrusive. The moral critique of the area bombing offensive rests on a few basic principles of jus
