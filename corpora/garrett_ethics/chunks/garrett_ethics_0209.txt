in the application of wartime violence. For our purposes, how- ever, this problem need not be unduly obtrusive. The moral critique of the area bombing offensive rests on a few basic principles of jus in bello that are the recipient of more or less universal agreement and thus can be identified with relative ease. The most primordial of these is the notion of "proportionality." The essential proposition is that the military utility of a given action has to outweigh the evil side-effects of such an action, that is to say, it has to be proportional in balancing the steps taken to achieve victory against the calamities that war can produce. One relevant consideration, for example, may be the attaining of a more just and stable postwar environment for the international community. Measures that may gain victory but undermine or even destroy the prospects of the latter are thus rendered dubious, if not totally excluded. The concept of proportionality does present a problem as far as the definition of military utility is concerned. How useful does a particular action  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 140 141 Standards and Principles have to be in order to justify at least some evil side-effects? Clearly, there are few military men who will assert baldly that an operation contributed little to victory, but even so they remain indifferent to the suffering it may have caused. On the contrary, the consistent argument is that even though certain unfortunate consequences may have resulted from the event, it was militarily appropriate because it made at least some tangible contribution in vanquishing the enemy. Even given its ambiguities, however, the notion of proportionality continues to provide one of the surest bases on which to judge the moral legitimacy of various measures in wartime, and never more than when it involves the distinction between combatants and non-combatants. Among the traditional stipulations of the rule of proportionality, it is this one that is perhaps
