wartime, and never more than when it involves the distinction between combatants and non-combatants. Among the traditional stipulations of the rule of proportionality, it is this one that is perhaps the most fundamental. The general assertion is that those wearing uniforms or in some other way directly engaged in fighting are fair game for killing or wounding. Those not so engaged are supposed to be given sanctuary, that is, as "innocents," they are not legitimate targets for violent action. Where such takes place, the burden of proof is on the violator to demonstrate that the action was essential to the achievement of a just cause. It is true of course that in the modern era the definition of combatant and non-combatant has been a troublesome one. In an era of total war, of the complete mobilization of the resources of the nation in support of the war effort, are there any true "non-combatants"? Moreover one might ask why the fate of civilians should be regarded as particularly sacrosanct compared to the young men in uniform who are doing the actual fighting? Are their lives somehow less valuable than those sitting in comfort before their hearth? Shall we shrug off the deaths of thousands in battle while bewailing the deaths of a relative few at home? As it happens Hitler had his own answer to this question. When presented with evidence about the appallingly high rate of loss among young commissioned German officers on the Eastern Front, he replied with some puzzlement: "But that's what they are there for!" In his typically brutal fashion, Hitler was perhaps indirectly touching on a truth that seems to affect most governments at war- the sacrifice of combatants is viewed as less objectionable than grievous damage to the fabric of society itself, the protection of which, after all, is the ultimate purpose of war. In the era of total war, the definition of combatant might seem to be reasonably expanded to include not just those in uniform or on the battle fronts but
