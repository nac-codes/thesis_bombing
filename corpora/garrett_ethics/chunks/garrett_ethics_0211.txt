h, after all, is the ultimate purpose of war. In the era of total war, the definition of combatant might seem to be reasonably expanded to include not just those in uniform or on the battle fronts but also those directly engaged in providing specific support for the armies. Thus civilian workers in defense plants, civil service personnel at military headquarters, railway workers supervising the shipment of military supplies, individuals engaged in petroleum production for use of the armed forces might legitimately (if regrettably) be regarded as combatants in the expanded definition. Even today the distinction between combatants and non-combatants loses all meaning, however, if we extend the definition of "combatants" to include all civilians whose activities in any way might be of service to the war effort of the state. Farmers produce food that soldiers (and civilians) consume, teachers educate young people who may serve as officers, postmen deliver mail to families from those serving at the front-in each instance there is some tenuous connection between the activity and successful prosecution of the war. Yet the link is so amorphous that to insist on it is to render one of the fundamental principles of the war convention, of jus in bello, a nullity. The targeting strategy of Bomber Command over Germany during World War II, it will be clear enough by now, ignored any reasonable distinction between combatant and non-combatant, however broadly defined the for- mer. We need only recall Sir Charles Portal's minute to Bomber Command on February 14, 1942: "I suppose it is clear that the aiming points [for the bombers] are to be in the built-up areas, not, for instance, the dockyards or aircraft factories." The effects of this order could be seen in Berlin just after the end of the war. An observer noted that there were an estimated 50,000 orphans living in holes like animals around the city, "some of them one-eyed or one-legged veterans of seven or so, many so deranged
