of the war. An observer noted that there were an estimated 50,000 orphans living in holes like animals around the city, "some of them one-eyed or one-legged veterans of seven or so, many so deranged by the bombing and the Russian attack that they screamed at the sight of any uniform, even a Salvation Army one."13 We have described in general terms the effect that the Allied bombing offensive had on German civilian life. Descriptions such as this help to make concrete what runs the risk of becoming a numbing abstraction because of its sheer enormity. There is a cynical but perhaps apropos aphorism that for many people one human death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic. TWO PRELIMINARY DEFENSES The issue raised by the Berlin orphans is straightforward enough. By what calculation can we justify their suffering? Assuming that small children are not a legitimate target of wartime operations, is there any way in which their deaths and injuries may be defended as within the war convention? In analyzing the position taken by defenders of Bomber Command on this question, one is struck by a rather curious phenomenon. There seems to be an acceptance among many of these individuals that area bombing was a departure from the war convention as previously understood, but they then  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 142 143 Standards and Principles set out a series of mitigating factors that make this departure (regrettably) both understandable and even on balance legitimate. The argument seems to be that, in most cases, countries should observe the distinction between combatant and non-combatant, and hopefully the city bombing strategy of World War II will not have to be repeated. In this particular case, however, other claims took precedence over the dictates of the war convention as they applied to the protection of innocents. The general proposition underlaying all of these assertions is that the area offensive, however much it may have (apparently) violated certa
