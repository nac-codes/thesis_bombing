convention as they applied to the protection of innocents. The general proposition underlaying all of these assertions is that the area offensive, however much it may have (apparently) violated certain aspects of the war convention, was nevertheless in overall compliance with the rule of proportionality in just war doctrine That is to say, the suffering of German civilians was more than counterbal. anced by the contribution British bombing made to victory in a just cause A reasonable evaluation of this claim necessitates a detailed look at the actual military effects of the area offensive and thus is left to the following chapter At this point we consider two other claims offered in defense of that strategy that have appeared from time to time in the debate over the morality of bombing German cities. The Principle of Double Effect Innocents (non-combatants) have always died in wars, although more in some than in others. It seems inevitable that they will continue to do so Philosophers of war over the centuries have had to face this problem squarely and, if possible, develop standards by which the destruction of innocents may at least in some cases be accommodated within the war convention. Perhaps the most famous attempt in this direction is the so-called "principle of double effect." First developed by Catholic theologians in the Middle Ages, the principle of double effect is, as Walzer puts it, "a way of reconciling the absolute prohibition against attacking non-combatants with the legitimate conduct of military activity." Reduced to its essentials, the principle allows the killing of innocents provided that the following obtains: 1) The military action is in itself a legitimate act of war. 2) The "direct effect" is morally appropriate, that is, involves legitimate mili- tary targets, e.g., military supplies, enemy soldiers. 3) The intention of the actor is good in that he aims only at the acceptable ef- fect and the evil side-effect (killing of innocents) is not
