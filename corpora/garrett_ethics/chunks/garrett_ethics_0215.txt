rendered legitimate for that very reason (the reference to preserving the lives of Allied soldiers raises a somewhat differ- ent issue that needs to be considered separately). Clearly, this removes any conceivable restraints on violence, since it is well nigh impossible, and particularly during the conflict itself, not to make an argument that at least some progress toward victory will accrue from a given military action. The theologian John Ford effectively disputes this essentially unlimited exten- sion of double effect: "It is illegitimate to appeal to the principle of the double effect when the alleged justifying cause is speculative, future, and problem- atical, while the evil effect is enormous, certain, and immediate."16 More to the point, the principle of double effect hardly can be offered as a defense of the area offensive simply because the evil side-effect in this case (the random killing of non-combatants) was not an unintended or regrettable consequence of a legitimate military action but was instead one of the main points of the strategy. In terms of the definition of double effect offered  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 144 145 Standards and Principles above, destruction of German civilians was in fact a "means to an end," that is, victory over the Nazis. Lord Cherwell's original minute on the dehousing of German workers, which implied large-scale loss of civilian life and formed much of the basis for the subsequent area offensive, stands as a prime piece of evidence in this regard. The Sliding Scale A second argument offered in defense of the area offensive is what has been called the theory of the "sliding scale." Reduced to its essentials, this suggests that the more just the cause, the greater latitude one has in ignoring, or at least temporarily setting aside, the principles of the war convention. The eminent theoretician John Rawls puts the point somewhat indirectly: "Even in a just war, certain forms of violence are strictly inadmissible
