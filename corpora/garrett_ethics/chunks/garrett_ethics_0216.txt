ly setting aside, the principles of the war convention. The eminent theoretician John Rawls puts the point somewhat indirectly: "Even in a just war, certain forms of violence are strictly inadmissible; and when Â» country's right is questionable and uncertain, the constraints on the means ; can use are all the more severe. Acts permissible in a war of legitimate self-defense, when these are necessary, may be flatly excluded in a more doubtful situation."17 What this would seem to suggest is that area bombing by Germany against Great Britain (undertaken during the Blitz of 1940 1941) can be easily dismissed as morally repugnant whereas the subsequent British area offensive against Germany is far more defensible, since it was in pursuit of a compelling just cause. Noble Frankland makes precisely this argument. In discussing the morality of the area offensive, he suggests that a decisive consideration was "the causes for which the war [was] being fought and the nature of the enemy, for the means adopted must be in scale with the ends sought."18 There is hardly likely to be any war that provides more comfort and support to the adherents of the sliding scale hypothesis than World War It The Nazi regime was so repugnant in all its particulars, and represented such a threat to all basic and decent human values, that it would indeed be tempting to argue that any methods efficient in bringing down such a regime were morally supportable. Yet two critical objections remain. The unalloyed adoption of the sliding scale in this instance would have logically removed any compunctions about the most savage application of military violence to defeat the Nazis. Even the most fervent supporters of Allied air power in World War II would (and for the record did) stop short of such an unvar nished commitment to destruction. There was, for example, the repeated assurances by British spokesmen that their bombers were attacking "only" military targets and that they were attempting to avoid co
