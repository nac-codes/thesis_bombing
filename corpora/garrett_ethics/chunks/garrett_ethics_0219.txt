concept of supreme emergency we move to the corollary notion of "military necessity." This term is found very widely in all discussions of ethics and military conduct, as well as in various conventions setting out the laws of war. The problem has been to interpret the scope and meaning of military necessity and to determine how it may or may not sanction certain measures that would be unallowable in the absence of it. As a general matter, military necessity may be said to obtain when a certain action bears a legitimate connection to the search for victory and when its non-performance would actively undermine that effort. Even so, there are certain military activities that the war convention rules out regardless of their possible contribution to victory, e.g., the mass slaughter of prisoners. For present purposes, I want to attach the notion of military necessity very closely to supreme emergency and to consider both of these ideas in the context of the British decision in February 1942 to launch a campaign of indiscriminate bombing of German cities. We can summarize the implicit and, to some extent, explicit rationale of this decision as follows: Britain was indeed facing a supreme emergency in its war with Germany, and directing Bomber Command to attack German cities was a military necessity in the sense that Britain had no other significant way at the time of prosecuting the war against the Nazis. Not to prosecute the war was to accept the continuance, and perhaps the actual effectuation, of the supreme emergency, which was intolerable. Therefore. this particular violation of the war convention, that is, indiscriminate killing of German combatants and non-combatants alike, was morally defensible. In assessing this argument, we need to look closely at both elements of the equation-that is, did a supreme emergency confront Great Britain as of February 1942, and was the area offensive a military necessity in that Britain had no other options open to her, or at least
