inciples Command in nighttime operations, a large urban area seemed to suggest itself as the only feasible aiming point for the aircrew. The British Bombing Survey Unit summarized the argument after the war: "The navigational and bombing accuracy actually achieved by Bomber Command in night attacks makes it doubtful whether target systems other than towns could have been effectively bombed before the beginning of 1944."23 and later in Sicily and Italy, as well as to the destruction of the German U-Boat threat in the North Atlantic. Moreover, considerable resources could have been shifted away from the building of heavy bombers to the expansion of the army and navy (a possibility that many, although few within the RAF, strongly supported). Even in terms of strategic bombing itself, there could have been a continued effort to develop improvements in navigation and aiming until a more effective (and certainly more morally attractive) strategy of precision bombing was available for adoption. In the event, such alterna- tives were basically set aside, and the area offensive went ahead unabated. If this was the case, obviously the moral argument is strongly affected. Noble Frankland makes the not unreasonable assertion that to criticize the area offensive on moral grounds in the period 1942 to early 1944 is to offer an ethical query quite unrelated to the operational circumstances confronting the decision-makers. In the case of bombing, strategic criticism, even when operationally unfounded, often seems to be reinforced by moral indignation and moral indignation often seems to have more to do with the formation of views about strategic bombing than do the strategic pros and cons of it. This need not be objectionable but it becomes so when, to serve a moral argument, Bomber Command is given in retrospect a function which, operationally, it could not have performed.24 This is fine as far as it goes, but of course the issue was just a bit more complicated than that. Perhaps
