e (the so-called Transportation Plan identi- fied with Solly Zuckerman). This would make it extremely difficult for the Germans to move men and supplies to the invasion front. For present purposes what is important about this debate was London's uneasiness about the Transportation Plan. Concerns were expressed about the actual military effectiveness of a concentration on the German rail system. The British also presented a moral query, however, that focused on the large number of Belgian-but especially French-civilian casualties that were likely to result from implementation of the Transportation Plan, espe- cially given the fact that the marshalling yards were concentrated in urban areas. Prime Minister Churchill asked Lord Cherwell, of all people, to undertake some calculations about the likely losses, and on the basis of his estimates the War Cabinet asserted that some 40,000 civilians in the occupied territories might be killed along with another 120,000 wounded. On this basis London suggested that attacks on transport targets be authorized only when civilian casualties were not likely to exceed 100-150 persons.30 Churchill went so far as to appeal to President Roosevelt to intervene to limit what the former called the anticipated "French slaughters" and "the apparently ruthless use of the Air Forces, particularly of the Royal Air Force, on whom the brunt of this kind of work necessarily falls, and the reproaches that would be made upon the inaccuracy of night bombing."31 The President refused, saying he had full confidence in Eisenhower's judgment. Even Arthur Harris objected to the Transportation Plan, at least partly on supposed moral grounds, referring himself to the loss of civilian life to be expected from the campaign. It should be mentioned here that as far back as October 1942, the Air Ministry stated in a directive to Bomber Command that the official rules governing air attacks in the occupied  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 154 155 Standards and
