back as October 1942, the Air Ministry stated in a directive to Bomber Command that the official rules governing air attacks in the occupied  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 154 155 Standards and Principles territories forbade intentional bombing of civilian populations and required aircrew to take reasonable care to avoid undue loss of civilian life. All attacks had to be on strictly military objectives. This directive went on to state that given the enemy's adoption of a policy of "unrestricted air warfare," such rules did not apply to the enemy homeland itself.32 It has to be recognized that aside from their putative ethical qualms, Churchill and his advisers were concerned about a very negative political backlash, not only in occupied France itself but from De Gaulle's Free French government-in-exile as well, if a large number of Frenchmen were killed in Allied bombing raids. As it happened, pre-invasion bombing in the occupied countries had a less draconian effect on the civilian population than Churchill and others had feared. One reason was that the aircrew were given specific instructions that every target had to be identified visually in order to reduce the risk to civilians. Approximately 12,000 civilians lost their lives. This was a somber enough figure, but what stands out is the concern that London displayed in this instance about the suffering of innocent Allied civilians and it was one that could be seen on other occasions during the war. Even before the debate over air support for the Normandy invasion, for example, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, First Sea Lord, fretted about the danger to French civilians as a result of attacks on ports in the Bay of Biscay. He admitted that the question was how "we balance the loss of French lives against those of our own merchant seamen."33 Consider, as well, the attack by Mosquito fighter-bombers on the Shell House in Copenhagen, which was Gestapo headquarters in the city. The raid was designed to destroy all of t
