The raid was designed to destroy all of the Gestapo records on the Danish resistance and to kill as many Gestapo personnel as possible. A major worry in this operation, however, was the possibility of extensive Danish civilian casualties A debate unfolded on whether such casualties would be counterbalanced by the value of crippling Gestapo operations, and the decision was to go ahead. As it turned out, one of the Mosquitos crashed into a convent near the target, and a second wave of aircraft, thinking this was the target, bombed the wreckage of the convent, causing considerable loss of life among the children. As Air Chief Marshal Sir Basil Embry commented, "naturally this unfortunate incident caused great sorrow and distress in the [Bomber Command] Group," even though, he claimed, the Danes accepted it stoically as a legitimate "blow for freedom."34 Duties to the Enemy there any defensible difference between killing "friendly" civilians and enemy civilians? If the British government was so sensitive to civilian suffering in France and other places, should this concern not have been expressed with respect to German citizens as well? Churchill may have revealed his own conceptions on this score when he deplored the death of French civilians as being "among a friendly people who have committed no crimes against us, and not among the German foe, with all their record of cruelty and ruthlessness."35 Such an attitude, however (perhaps) understandable, can not gainsay the fact that even in the case of the enemy duties do exist for a warring government.
