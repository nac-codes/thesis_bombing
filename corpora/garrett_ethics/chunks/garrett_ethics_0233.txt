the case of one's own soldiers and civilians or those of Allied nations. Yet they hardly disappear even in the carnage of war. Indeed a standard philo- sophical proposition governing proper moral reasoning is the requirement of "universalization," which in essence means that before making a decision one must take into appropriate consideration the interests and rights of all effected parties. This does not mean that certain of these may not be given greater weight than others, but it does demand a reasonable attempt at balancing conflicting claims of groups or individuals.36 The idea that even the enemy retains certain rights in wartime inevitably rests on the notion that there is no essential difference in the sanctity of life. In the strictest sense, this applies even in the realm of the soldier. Thus few would countenance the systematic slaughter of enemy soldiers attempting to surrender on the basis that some might be concealing weapons and intending to do harm to one's own men. The principle applies even more, however, in balancing the welfare of one's own combatants with those of the enemy civilian population who are not combatants. By what moral calculus can we say that the death and injury of enemy civilians is essentially irrelevant as long as there is at least some prospect that such suffering will save a single life among one's soldiers? The mere fact that a state of war exists does not remove the legitimate claims of enemy civilians for a reasonable chance to go on living. In order to protect such rights, it may be necessary for the soldier to accept a somewhat higher degree of risk (no one is demanding that they simply sacrifice themselves for the sake of enemy non-combatants). There are some professional soldiers who have at times recognized this principle. In the early days of the Vietnam War, for example, it was common for the South Vietnamese army to call in artillery or an air strike on a village in response to a single sniper shot from the hamlet
