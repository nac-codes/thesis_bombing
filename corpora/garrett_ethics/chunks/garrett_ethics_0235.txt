red shortly) that the British concentration on area rather than precision bombing actually prolonged rather than shortened World War II. Since it is often difficult to demonstrate that a particular action is necessary in order to protect one's soldiers-the perfect duty of governments-all the more reason for proceeding cautiously in the decision to set aside the other standard rules of obligation, even when they involve the enemy himself.38 6 The Test of Experience "It is worse than a crime, it is a blunder." -French aristocrat Boulaye de la Meurthe (commenting on the execution by Napoleon of the Duc d'Enghien) In any discussion of applied ethics, one can speak of guidelines to moral judgment as deriving out of either "intuitions" or "consequences.". An intuitive value judgment regards a certain action as invariably wrong (or right) regardless of its effects, and reflects the pure dictates of conscience. Consequentialism holds that a proper ethical analysis must depend on an estimate of the good and bad results of given actions or policies. Obviously, both of these standards presents complications. Thus there may be serious contradictions between and among different intuitive values. At the same time focusing on the consequences of actions leaves open how we can properly evaluate relatively better or relatively worse outcomes.1 In offering a moral critique of the area offensive, it is tempting simply to adopt an intuitive argument that the killing of over 500,000 German civilians by bombing was inherently a reprehensible act, an affront to the conscience, and an evil hardly to be defended because of its supposed contribution to Allied victory. Such a stance indeed commands respect, but it seems to me that the overall moral case against the area offensive is considerably strengthened-and indeed has to be strengthened-by a close examination of the real effects of British bombing policy and what type of contribution to victory it actually made. Examining the consequence
