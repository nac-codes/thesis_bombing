strengthened-and indeed has to be strengthened-by a close examination of the real effects of British bombing policy and what type of contribution to victory it actually made. Examining the consequences of the area offensive is particularly important in this instance, because what we had was in fact a clash between two intuitive values: the sanctity of life and the sanctity of freedom (which required the defeat of the Nazi menace).  159 The Test of Experience Ethics and Airpower in World War II 158 a population to rally around its leaders in times of crisis (especially in wartime) and to commit one's resources and will to the nation at a time of its maximum peril. In retrospect, it is surprising that any in the British government should have seriously argued that the Germans would be less resolute under the impact of bombing that the British themselves had been during the period of the Blitz, even given the fact that the weight of destruction visited on Germany was far greater than that delivered against Britain. When this sort of contradiction exists, attention to the practical effect of different policies looms rather large. The central issue here thus becomes whether Britain's apparent violation of the war convention-overt attacks on the German civilian population-can be at least partially justified by their strategic effect in bringing about the Nazi defeat. EXPECTATIONS AND RESULTS Any overall assessment of the costs and benefits of British area bombing of Germany, invoking the principle of proportionality, is necessarily a complex one Nevertheless there are certain conclusions about Bomber Command's operations that may be offered with a fair degree of confidence, and-a crucial point- should have been clear to one and all no later than the summer of 1944. The Mirage of Morale The notion that German morale could be shattered by a strategy of devastating German cities proved to be an entirely false premise. "Morale" in this sense basically meant the willingness of
