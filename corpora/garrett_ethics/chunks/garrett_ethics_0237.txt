of Morale The notion that German morale could be shattered by a strategy of devastating German cities proved to be an entirely false premise. "Morale" in this sense basically meant the willingness of the German people to work for and support their government's war effort. For a variety of reasons, the carnage visited on Germany by British bombers never came close to having a real effect in these terms. The British Bombing Survey Unit itself conceded the point: "The effects of town area attacks on the morale of the German people were . . . . . very much over-estimated by all other ministries and departments through the course of the war. ... There is no evidence that they caused any serious break in the morale of the population as a whole."2 The United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) offered more or less the same conclusion: Under ruthless Nazi control they [the German people] showed surprising resis- tance to the terror and hardships of repeated air attack, to the destruction of their homes and belongings, and to the conditions under which they were reduced to live. Their morale, their belief in ultimate victory . . . and their confidence in their leaders declined, but they continued to work efficiently as long as the physical means of production remained. The power of a police state over its people cannot be underestimated.3 To say that the attempt to undermine German morale by area bombing didn't work is actually only one part, and perhaps the least important part, of a critique of this ostensible goal of British air attacks. Far more telling is the almost total lack of any systematic consideration on the part of British decision-makers as to how the "undermining of morale" was actually sup- posed to undercut the German war effort. In view of the fact that an assault on morale was one of the consistent items in the rationale for the area offensive against Germany, this is really rather an astonishing omission. Indeed, the idea that morale could well be th
