assault on morale was one of the consistent items in the rationale for the area offensive against Germany, this is really rather an astonishing omission. Indeed, the idea that morale could well be the Achilles heel of the German war effort can only be regarded as an article of faith rather than rigorous analysis on the part of those directing Bomber Command's activities. Typical of the rather casual assumptions underlying it was the belief that German industrial workers, the main target of the area offensive, were far more likely to crack than the stolid German middle class (a premise particularly convinc- ing to the aristocratic Sir Charles Portal). The USSBS pointed to one gap in the reasoning concerning German morale: in a police state such as Nazi Germany, where individuals were executed for offenses as mundane as listening to foreign radio broadcasts, how was a loss of morale to be translated into some sort of mass political activity that would force the hand of the government toward peace? As the war progressed there was no doubt a growing disillusionment among the German people about the prospects for victory, and the devastation of bombing may have contributed to this feeling. At the same time people had to get on with their lives, produce an income from their jobs, try to sustain their personal relations, and so forth. The point is that, for the Germans as well as for the British (and presumably everyone else as well), the expected reaction of human beings under this sort of stress is simply to attempt to survive and hope for an end to the pain. This type of fatalism is reinforced when the state has a capacity and a willingness to employ large-scale coercion to prevent open disaffection. Ironically, the Nazi authorities themselves seemed to have felt that Bomber Command's morale thesis might actually have some validity, and This analysis tends to stress the coercive capacity of the Nazi security apparatus to prevent disaffection, but one can also focus on
