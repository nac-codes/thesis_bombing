ped and indeed impossible to demonstrate. Lord Cherwell's famous minute about the dehousing of German workers and the effect this would have on the German war effort stands as a prime piece of evidence in this regard. Cherwell focused almost entirely on some rather elementary mathematical calculations about what weight of bombs would lead to what number of dehoused workers. How dehousing would disrupt the German military effort was left almost totally implicit. Actually, Cherwell's argument would have had a lot more coherency if he had simply said that the object of the area offensive was to kill a great number of German civilians who would then be unavail- able for arms production or service in the military. One is driven to the conclusion that the arguments about German morale were in effect adopted ex post facto by the British government in order to provide a rationale for something the government planned to do anyway, and for perhaps quite different and unrelated reasons. Putting it this way helps to deal with the consistent argument offered after the war by supporters of Bomber Command that even if morale wasn't significantly affected by the area offensive, the decision-makers had no way of knowing this at the time since the implementation of a massive strategic air offensive-and its likely effects-were quite without precedent in the conduct of war. The fact is that the decision-makers never had any reasonable standard for measurement of the loss of German morale nor for its impact on the German war effort. Since they had no actual notion of what they were trying to achieve, we can't exculpate them simply by saying they were "mistaken" in their assessments. In reality, they never had any assessments, at least as the term is commonly understood to mean a careful weighing of costs and gains, causes and effects. Bombs To Prevent Bombs A second inescapable conclusion about the area bombing offensive against Germany is that it proved to have only a modest impact on
