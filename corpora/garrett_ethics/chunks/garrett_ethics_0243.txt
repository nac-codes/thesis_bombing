victory really had in terms of damaging the German war effort. Within three weeks, gas and electricity had been restored to most homes and factories, and by September the port of Hamburg was able to handle 160,000 tons of cargo, only 40,000 less than in July. U-boat construction in the city was not significantly affected, nor was the output of aircraft.ยบ Subsequent analyses revealed that overall war production actually returned to near-nor- mal in the Hamburg area within a few weeks after the attack, and an earlier labor shortage was largely relieved since a large number of service workers shopkeepers, and office personnel now were perforce seeking other employ- ment. Professor John Kenneth Galbraith recalled his findings as a member of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey: "In reducing, as nothing else could, the consumption of non-essentials and the employment of men in their supply, there is a distinct possibility that the attacks on Hamburg increased Germany's output of war material and thus her military effectiveness."9 The second factor mitigating against the area offensive's having any pronounced effect on German military production was essentially technical. In order for Bomber Command to interrupt seriously the output of a particular item of significance, it was necessary for it to undertake repeated raids against a single target. This went against Arthur Harris's tendency to want to deal in turn with all the German cities on his "hit list," that is to say, the 60 major urban centers that he had originally designated for destruction by Bomber Command. In practice, Harris would order a major strike against one target and then move on to the next, which gave the Germans ample opportunity to restore manufacturing capacity in the areas already attacked.14 There was also the fact that simply destroying a large number of buildings in the target area did not necessarily result in an equivalent falloff in arms production. As the USSBS put it, "The destruction
