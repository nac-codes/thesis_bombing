f British intelligence states flatly that "no British statesman in modern times has had a more passionate faith in the value of secret intelligence than Winston Churchill." So intense was Churchill's interest in the subject that he often demanded to see raw intelligence reports before they had been analyzed by the professionals.18 It is self-evident that we typically have more knowledge about an important historical event after it has occurred than when it is actually taking place Even so it is remarkable how Harris and his immediate circle in Bomber Command throughout the war continually issued optimistic assessment about the effectiveness of the area offensive that seemingly remained unaf fected by the evidence that was at hand. During the Battle of Berlin, for example, Air Staff Intelligence at High Wycombe freely circulated qui extraordinary (and quite inaccurate) estimates of the havoc that was bei wreaked on the German capital. At the end of 1943, it was asserted that minimum of 320,000 Berliners had been dehoused, and that the actual figur was probably a good deal higher (perhaps on the order of 500,000 800,000). All this despite the fact that, as Harris himself admitted the consistent cloud cover over Berlin prevented his aircrews from direce observing any of the effects of their bombing. Goebbels took a curio satisfaction in Bomber Command's illusions. Aside from Ultra, Britain also had several other important sources of information on the situation in Germany. Among these were Japanese diplomatic communications from Berlin to Tokyo (which could also be read), reports from German prisoners of war, accounts from neutral-country business and diplomatic personnel in Germany, and SIS agents in place. Also of some value were decryptions of German police signals as well as assess- ments by the Political Warfare Executive (PWE) of German newspaper and radio reports and propaganda. Finally, there was considerable information available from photographic intelligence
