otation and unlikely to produce any measurable effect on the Nazi regime We have already detailed how overall German arms production actually reached its peak in the summer of 1944 despite (or because of) Bomber Command's commitment to the area offensive. Again, Allied planners had ample information testifying to this fact, including a decryption of a report by the Japanese Ambassador in Berlin describing an interview he had had with Albert Speer, the German armaments minister. Speer indicated that in the period since the Hamburg raid the amount of damage to arms factories per bomb dropped had gone down by 60 or 70 percent. Allied claims that they had contributed to a 30 percent drop in arms output were fundamentally in error. Speer suggested that the pattern of bombing first one city and then moving on to another was actually a great advantage to German production, since it allowed for a restoration of output in each city in turn. Munitions production in Hamburg, for example, was now 140 percent of what it had been before the raids of July 1943. Speer did indicate that Allied attacks on German oil installations were of quite a different character and that such "scientific raiding" might deal a fatal blow to Germany if pursued.22 Perhaps equally displeasing to him were other intelligence assessments that the effect of the unconditional surrender formula, together with the repressive capabilities of Gestapo and SS detachments, were important in keeping German popular restiveness within limits. The Chiefs of Staff Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), charged with coordinating information on conditions in Germany, summarized the situation as it seemed to be in early June 1944: "There is no evidence to suggest that the Allied bombing may shortly foment any effective opposition to the regime, or that the stamina and discipline of the German people have deteriorated to such an extent the a collapse may be considered likely within the next month or so."
