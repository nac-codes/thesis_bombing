on to the regime, or that the stamina and discipline of the German people have deteriorated to such an extent the a collapse may be considered likely within the next month or so." Almo three months later, the JIC issued an even stronger disclaimer to the effect that area bombing "was most unlikely to foment such opposition or produc such chaos as might lead to a collapse of the home front."20 In weighing what Allied leaders knew about Germany's war position, there is (ironically) no better example of their being in possession of quite certain information than was the case with German oil production. Needless to say, oil was the virtual mother's milk of the German (and Allied) war machine, and, at least in the latter stages of the war, the Allies possessed definite indicators as to the German fuel situation. Largely because of Ultra, and also due to extensive photographic reconnaissance (PR), the drastic decline in German petroleum reserves as a result of Allied bombing was amply documented. The flood of information from decrypts and other sources led the Allied Joint Intelligence Committee to conclude on July 14, 1944, that in view of German oil shortages it was hard to see how Germany could avoid complete collapse before the end of the year, provided intensive bombing of refineries and synthetic petroleum facilities continued. Hard data suggested that German fuel production in fact had fallen, in the preceding four months, to a level that provided only about 50 percent of the minimum needed for German combat operations. This was an especially striking finding since, given the need to provide tactical support for the D-Day It has to be accepted that there were, at times, divergent reports comino out of Germany concerning the effects of bombing on particular localesa population groups. The point is that there was never any solid body evidence available, from open or secret intelligence sources, to suggest the the area offensive could undermine German morale to the ex
