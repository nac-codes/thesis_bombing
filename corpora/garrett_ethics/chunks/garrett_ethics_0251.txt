The point is that there was never any solid body evidence available, from open or secret intelligence sources, to suggest the the area offensive could undermine German morale to the extent of produo ing a tangible effect on the German war effort. As far as the material effect of Bomber Command's efforts was concerned, however, particularly impact on German arms production, there was considerably more defini information at hand. of On the basis of the data available to it, the Air Ministry in November 19 foresaw a steady increase in German fighter production despite Harris's an campaign of the previous months against the Ruhr and other targets. predicted increase was of almost 300 aircraft, from a total of about 1,400 July 1943 to 1,700 by April 1944 (these proved to be something of underestimate).

Just as difficult to accept, however, was the perfor- mance of those in the top leadership outside the cocoon of High Wycombe, who were seemingly capable of more reasoned analysis of the data and indeed were persuaded by it that area bombing was basically ineffective. This greater realism did not lead them to demand that Harris abandon his fantasies and adopt a course of action that would have been both pragmat- ically and ethically more appropriate. invasion, Allied bombing of German oil targets had previously r
