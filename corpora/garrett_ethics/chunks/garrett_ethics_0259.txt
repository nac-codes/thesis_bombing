became famous (or notorious, depending on one's point of view) for his adherence to the concept of precision bombing. He regarded area bombing as only a temporary expedient until precision attacks on German targets could be achieved. It was Bufton, for example, who led the way in the creation of the Pathfinder Force, which he saw as a critical step in the British ability to undertake genuinely selective bombing. This is really quite an extraordinary argument and one that is heavy with moral implications. If airpower could have brought the war to an earlier conclusion, the savings in life and treasure-and not just German life- would have been enormous, particularly given the fact that the heaviest bloodletting of World War II occurred in the last ten months of the struggle. It is important to note, in this regard, that the opposition to Arthur Harris and his supporters didn't just come from those who were morally discomfited by the logic of the area offensive. Indeed it is striking how, almost from the beginning of that offensive, there were a number of expert and quite unsentimental voices outside High Wycombe who offered at times quiet and at other times more vocal opposition to the logic of devoting almost all of Bomber Command's resources to the destruction of German cities. The fact that this was so seems to make the moral defensibility of the area offensive all the more problematical. That is to say, if the overwhelming weight of professional opinion was in support of the rationale of city attacks, we might more easily dismiss the ethical cavils of the pacifists and the priests. Since the experts were far from unified on the pragmatic wisdom of the area offensive, the criticisms of the latter have to be viewed in a rather different light. As the war progressed, Bufton became increasingly frustrated by Harris's seeming ability to defy the growing consensus within the Air Ministry that Bomber Command was capable of a general campaign of precision bombing of Germ
