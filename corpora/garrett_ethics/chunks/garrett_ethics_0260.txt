fton became increasingly frustrated by Harris's seeming ability to defy the growing consensus within the Air Ministry that Bomber Command was capable of a general campaign of precision bombing of Germany that would produce far better results than indiscriminate attacks on German cities. For example, in responding to Harris's boast that his Lancasters could force Germany to surrender by the spring of 1944 without the necessity of a land campaign in Western Europe, Bufton wrote Portal along the following lines: The C-in-C [Harris] states that there can be little doubt that the enemy would be caused to capitulate by the destruction of between 40 and 50 per cent of the principal German towns, and that the Lancaster force alone should be sufficient, but only just sufficient, to produce in Germany by 1 April 1944 a state of devastation in which surrender is inevitable. I am of the opinion that it would be sounder for Bomber Command to subordinate as far as may be necessary their efforts to achieve a quick victory in favour of helping the Americans to deploy their strength so that the Combined Bomber forces (and Overlord) may together achieve a certain victory.34 To be sure, little of the doubt expressed by the professionals was offered in ethical terms although it was not for that reason less strongly felt. A number of these individuals conceded as well that in view of the technical and resource difficulties confronting Bomber Command in 1942, it might be inevitable that the aircrew should for the short term concentrate on the relatively simple task of devastating German industrial cities. The assumption, however, was that once  Ethics and Airpower in World War 174 175 The Test of Experience In somewhat more direct language, Bufton assessed Harris's strategy as being that of "a gambler doubling up on each losing throw" (this with specific reference to the Battle of Berlin). Following the successful D-Day invasion, Bufton threw his weight behind those attempting to convinc
