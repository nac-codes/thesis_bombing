and essential part of his job, namely, to press forward the interests, urgent requirements and doctrines of Bomber Command . .. while spending much of his time trying to run my command." Harris seemed to have somewhat more forgiving views on Bottomley, but he crisply reminded Portal that Bottomley was his "junior in the Service" and claimed that he had tried to work loyally with the deputy chief of the Air Staff after Bottomley had assumed executive control of Bomber Command after September 1944, "yet little I now do appears to meet with approval."37 That there was widespread disapproval of Harris's continuation of the area offensive among various officials in the Air Ministry was certainly true.

By the fall of 1943, he had become a tacit and sometimes open ally of Bufton in querying Bomber Command's strategy. He had become especially concerned about the need to reduce German fighter strength. At the begin- ning of 1944 he wrote Harris to the effect that it was imperative that he "attack, as far as practicable, those industrial centres associated with the German fighter air-frame and ball-bearing industry."56 On September 14 1944, he sent a further directive to Harris stating that the sole first priority of the bombing offensive should be oil, with transportation links and tank and vehicle production as second priority.

A DIFFERENT STRATEGY FOR BOMBER COMMAND It is necessary now to summarize what options were open to Bomber Command aside from the area offensive and to do so in at least some detail. We begin with a fairly elementary but rather important point: the majority of German military industry (as in all industrial countries) was locate
