area offensive and to do so in at least some detail. We begin with a fairly elementary but rather important point: the majority of German military industry (as in all industrial countries) was located on the outskirts of the cities. Bomber Command's essential strategy during the area offensive was to hit the center of cities. The continuing result was that the most vital part of the German war-making machine was left relatively untouched by city bombing. This was particularly evident, for example, in the two most notorious Bomber Command attacks of World War II, those on Hamburg and Dresden. In each case, the supposed military objectives of these raids, i.e., the submarine facilities in Hamburg and the rail marshalling yards in Dresden, emerged almost unscathed. The fact seems to be that as the war progressed, and certainly by the middle of 1943, support within the ranks of the Air Ministry for Harris's area offensive had generally eroded, and his adherents were steadily reduced to a relatively small group of acolytes at High Wycombe. Again, this was not necessarily because of moral qualms about the devastation of German cities Nevertheless the revolt against Harris's strategy is quite notable, including as it did a number of professional airmen with previous operational experi- ence with Bomber Command. The skepticism of these men was matched by a general disillusionment among the civilian staff of the Air Ministry. especially those offering expert scientific advice in the operational research division of the Ministry. Now it may be objected that for a good period of the war the only thing that Bomber Command could be reasonably confident of hitting was the Sir Arthur Harris's attitude toward these dissenters was a mix of contempt and airy dismissal. He commented bitterly in a letter to Portal in January  177 The Test of Experience Ethics and Airpower in World War II 176 such as Oboe to maximum effect. Moreover, the Mosquito could fly at around 350 MPH, which enab
