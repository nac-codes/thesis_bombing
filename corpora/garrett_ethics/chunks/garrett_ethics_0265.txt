y British accent. It originated in a request from the Royal Air Force to North American Aviation, who built the first prototype in 1940. Some 600 had been provided to the RAF by 1941, but at this point they lacked a sufficiently powerful engine. Five of the aircraft were subsequently fitted with Merlin 61 engines, and the production line in America was modified to accommodate Ameri- can-built Packard Merlins. By adding additional fuel tanks, the Mustang was converted into a plane that could outperform all the standard German fighters.38 Yet, by some strange circumstance, the RAF failed to benefit from this technological breakthrough while the Americans employed large num- bers of the redesigned Mustangs in their own operations. One conclusion is that Arthur Harris resisted the introduction of great numbers of the Mustangs to Bomber Command since this would have had the effect of negating his insistence on nighttime area bombing as the only feasible strategy for his aircrew. A. J. P. Taylor summarizes the point by saying that "no senior RAF leader sought the answer of long-range fighters, just as no senior British general of the First World War sought the answer of tanks to the problem of trench warfare."39 The implication was that in both instances the adoption of the new technology would have contradicted (or rendered irrelevant) long-cherished beliefs in a particular military doctrine. This point receives even greater support from the saga of the Mosquito fighter-bomber. The development of the Mosquito presented another range of possibilities for Arthur Harris that could well have changed the entire direction of the air offensive. The De Havilland Mosquito was able accu- rately to mark bombing targets from extremely high altitudes (around 28,000 feet). The height at which it flew made it possible to use navigational systems Why, then, was the Mosquito not chosen as the primary vehicle for Bomber Command's offensive against Germany? The reasons for this surprising
