hich it flew made it possible to use navigational systems Why, then, was the Mosquito not chosen as the primary vehicle for Bomber Command's offensive against Germany? The reasons for this surprising omission may have had more to do with Bomber Command's own professional interests than with a concern about hitting more precise military targets in Germany. As one of the principal historians of Bomber Command has put it, the promise of increased accuracy from a fleet of Mosquitos was viewed more as a threat than a promise: "It was the very inflexibility of [Harris's] Main Force and its alleged unsuitability for operations demanding great accuracy and co-operation with other elements which partly enabled its Commander to pursue so independent a strategy. A bombing weapon as delicate and subtle as 300-400 Mosquitoes would, in all probability, have been coveted by Tedder, if not by Spaatz [head of the US Strategic Air Force]."41 The point, then, is that the very crudity of Harris's forces was a major protection against their being taken over by other command authorities. Attacking German Chokepoints Leaving aside the missed opportunities in developing fighter escorts or in selecting the Mosquito as a primary instrument for Bomber Command, there is a legitimate debate about when Harris's aircrew did finally reach a point where they had a real choice between precision and area bombing. One of the principal British scientists working on problems of bombing accuracy states that as of late 1943 "had we realized the improvement in our bombing technique we might have abandoned area bombing earlier, or at least have put more effort into precision attacks at night. . . . But we had become so indoctrinated with the area policy that few of us realized that Portal's original oil bombing policy could now have been revived with a hope of success."42 This is a rather significant admission to make, but in any case by the summer of 1944 it was recognized by virtually one and all  uo 179
