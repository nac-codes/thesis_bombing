Basically the system had remained relatively intact until the spring of 1944, but after that it declined precipitously until it came virtually to a halt in early 1945. The Allied Strategic Air Targets Committee stressed how the attacks on transportation had a symbiotic relationship to German oil production. The output of oil products could not be distributed effectively, and shipments of coal, out of which much of the oil was produced, could not be delivered. In effect, there was a stranglehold at both ends of the petroleum production process. 46 that Bomber Command had now developed a genuine capacity for fairly precise bombing of German targets. Even Arthur Harris seemed to admit to this fact. He suggests (without apparent irony) that "it was not until the last year of the war that we had the technical equipment for such attacks [i.e., against key factories]." Another RAF veteran comments that when that stage was reached, it was actually possible, with vastly improved navigational and aiming devices, to place a heavier concentration of bombs on precision targets by non-visual than by visual methods. The Overall Report of the British Bombing Survey Unit offered a summary assessment of the elements leading to the collapse of the Nazi war machine: The question then becomes how Bomber Command could have been employed in the last ten months of the war and, not incidentally, in a way that would have hastened victory and avoided unnecessary civilian suffering The answer has been suggested already in our earlier discussion and needs only summary here.
