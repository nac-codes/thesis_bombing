that would have hastened victory and avoided unnecessary civilian suffering The answer has been suggested already in our earlier discussion and needs only summary here. A concerted British and American attack on German oil installations (especially the synthetic petroleum plants) would have almost certainly produced decisive and immediate results. A special oil panel of the USSBS concluded after the war, for example, that "even a small part of the bombs dropped on cities would have sufficed to completely knock out oil targets at an early date."43 As early as May 30, 1944, Albert Speer wrote to Hitler that "with the attacks on the hydrogenation plants, systematic bombing raids on economic targets have started at the most dangerous point. The only hope is that the enemy, too, had got an air staff. Only if it has as little comprehension of economic targets as ours would there be some hope that after a few attacks on this decisive economic target it would turn its attention elsewhere."44 The success that Bomber Command enjoyed in attacking oil installations prior to the D-Day invasion, even though this constituted only a minor part of their operations, was only one example of what ordinary aircrew could now achieve when led to the target by experienced Pathfinders In the immediate aftermath of the Normandy invasion there was a further Allied air effort against German oil facilities, undertaken almost entirely by the USAAF. Even though Spaatz's bombers devoted just 17 percent of their efforts to oil in July and August, the results were dramatic. Petroleum available to Germany fell from 715,000 tons in May to 472,000 tons in July. The Luftwaffe's supply of aviation fuel fell from 180,000 tons in April to only 10,000 tons by August. Speer was hardly less concerned about the effect of Allied bombing raids on the German transportation system. He commented in November 1944 that a "successful continuation of these attacks would be capable of resulting in a production catastro
