nd transportation systems, nor that the Americans did not occasionally engage in general area attacks themselves (notably at Dresden). It is to say that Harris's insistence on continuing his area offensive almost certainly de- layed the day of victory because of the lack of a unified Allied air campaign against the truly vulnerable linchpins in the German war effort.  181 The Test of Experience Ethics and Airpower in World War II would hardly have been an occasion for general lamentation among those who had dealt with him for the last two years. 180 There is evidence that Portal at least considered moving against Harris at the beginning of 1944. He is reported to have asked Bufton, "What do you think about the C-in-C then, Bufton? Do you think it might be good to have a change?" The exasperation of the Americans, the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and various departments of the Air Ministry were combining to make Harris's status at this point somewhat problematical. Yet aside from the essentially political factors involved in so dramatic a step as the sacking of Harris, it appears that a quite separate element existed in protecting the career of the head of Bomber Command. The fact is that Harris's superiors were uncertain at the beginning of the year as to whether any real alternative strategy in the air offensive against Germany would pay greater dividends than Harris's area bombing. The success of the American precision bombing campaign at this point was rather problem- atical, and the indecision about viable alternatives to the area offensive went a long way toward saving Harris. The Removal of Arthur Harris In considering the alternatives available to British decision-makers with respect to bombing strategy in the last year of the war, the question of removing Arthur Harris as head of Bomber Command inevitably reasserts itself. Enough has been said already to indicate that Harris would hardly have gone along with a new scheme of focusing on precise (or at least
