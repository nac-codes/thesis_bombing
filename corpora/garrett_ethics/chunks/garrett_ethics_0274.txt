.. . If anything characterized [this] era, it was the capacity of leaders to avoid the appearance of choice."1 The Force of Momentum One factor in the resumption of the area offensive seems particularly apropos to Sherry's argument. It is somewhat difficult to discuss because it implies that the most violent period of Bomber Command's operations against German cities was an essentially mindless exercise unconnected to any real military analysis, not to mention any reasonable moral sensitivity to the suffering of civilians. Nevertheless, it would appear to have been an import- ant impetus to the second phase of the city bombing campaign undertaken by the British. By early fall 1944, the effect of earlier decisions taken by the British government concerning the allocation of military resources began to be fully realized. The production of aircraft for Bomber Command had "acquired a remorseless momentum of its own". In 1940 there were only 41 four-engined heavy bombers delivered to the RAF, and in 1941 there were some 500. This increased the following year to about 2,000, and for 1943 and 1944 the figures were 4,600 and 5,500 respectively. At its peak, the Ministry of Aircraft Production was employing about 1,700,000 people.2 Bomber Command had more than 1,000 heavy bombers in its squadrons as of the summer of 1944 and frequently more aircrew at its disposal than there were planes to fly. By April 1945, there were some 1,600 available to the RAF and during the last four months of the war the average daily strength of heavy aircraft was over 1,400.3 As noted, there were so many aircrew coming out of final training that many were designated as "surplus to requirements" for actual operational duty, creating a situation in which there were a number of young men anxious to show their stuff but with decreasing opportunities to do so. In the face of this enormous surge in the number of aircraft as well as aircrew available to Bomber Command, it became a question of how to emp
