their stuff but with decreasing opportunities to do so. In the face of this enormous surge in the number of aircraft as well as aircrew available to Bomber Command, it became a question of how to employ the vast array of planes and personnel at the disposal of Arthur Harris. It seemed hardly thinkable to allow this armada to even partially stand down since so much political and military authority had previously been committed to the buildup of Bomber Command as a decisive weapon against Germany. Moreover, in line with the past belief in the merits of the area offensive, most aircrew had basically been trained in the techniques of the nighttime destruction of cities. Very few pilots wanted to become "beginners" again by being instructed in quite a different set of bombing tactics.4 The latter comments may seem contradictory to what we have written before about the capacity of Bomber Command for daylight precision bombing after the summer of 1944. It has been argued that Bomber Com- mand should have been forced to abandon the area offensive in favor of selective attacks on German oil and transportation targets. The contradiction is, however, more apparent than real. There was a significant segment of Bomber Command (e.g., 5 Group, famous for its accurate marking tech- niques under the leadership of Leonard Cheshire) who were available for a precision bombing campaign. A concerted effort to train (or retrain) at least a good number of other aircrew in precision bombing, using the new navigational and aiming devices now available, was also a possibility open to Harris and his colleagues. What this would have required, however, was a (most unlikely) conversion of Harris to the merits of precision bombing along with a corresponding willingness to overcome the resistance of many of his present pilots to the new emphasis in targeting. Realistically, such a change in strategy would have implied that a number of Harris's bombers would have simply refrained from city attacks
