ituations in which representatives of the two groups would present a united front against the competing claims for resources made by their respective counterparts in the army and navy. The classic example came at the Casablanca Conference in early 1943. Sir Arthur Harris and his opposite numbers in the USSAF may have disagreed on targeting policy for their bombers, but they were quite together on the necessity of giving the strategic bombing forces priority consideration. In 187 adopting this common stance, they were able to maximize their influence and heavily sway the final decisions taken at Casablanca. Still later, in the spring of 1944, both the British and American bomber commanders argued against redirecting their efforts toward tactical support of the coming D-Day invasion, even if they disagreed once again on the best strategy for attacking targets in Germany itself. This appearance of a (at least partial) united front was, however, never more than a marriage of convenience and was subject to all the strains and suspicions characteristic of such a relationship. To return to the Casablanca Conference, the leadership of Bomber Command had two quite different objectives: to gain an overall imprimatur for the strategic air offensive and, at the same time, to insure that Bomber Command would not somehow become subordinate to the growing power of the USSAF. The nightmare of Arthur Harris, and it is not too strong a phrase, was that his forces would either directly or indirectly be subsumed to the American bombing effort, not only in terms of doctrine but even in terms of overall operational control. Harris caught an early glimpse of this danger prior to becoming head of Bomber Command, when he spent a year in Washington as head of an RAF delegation examining various American airframe designs. It was apparent to him that if the United States joined Britain in the fight against Germany, the Americans would inevitably want (and expect) to become the senior partners
