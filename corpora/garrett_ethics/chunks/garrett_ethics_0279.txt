American airframe designs. It was apparent to him that if the United States joined Britain in the fight against Germany, the Americans would inevitably want (and expect) to become the senior partners in the anti-Nazi enterprise. By the summer of 1943, the number of bombers in the USSAF exceeded those in Bomber Command, and even more alarming was the evident American penchant for highly centralized control of air policy. At a confer- ence in Cairo in November 1943, for example, the Americans announced that they planned to put the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces under a single commander and ultimately under the control of the American Supreme Commander of the coming invasion of Europe. The British suspected that this would be only a forerunner to Bomber Command's itself coming under American control. The vice chief of the Air Staff, Sir Douglas Evill, sent a secret cable to London arguing that "everything possible" should be done to resist the American proposal for unification of command of the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces, and in particular for their being placed under direct operational control by the Supreme Commander for D-Day. "Such central- ization," he warned, "would logically suggest inclusion of the RAF strategic night-bomber force, and there are insuperable operational and political objections to this."5 There are copious examples attesting to Harris's extreme sensitivity concern- ing invidious comparisons between the achievements of Bomber Command and  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 188 HOL 189 Final Reflections those of the USSAF, sensitivities that, as noted above, found at least a fairly sympathetic ear at the Air Ministry and in Whitehall. One example of this came after Bomber Command had been diverted to transportation targets in France and the Low Countries prior to the Normandy invasion. His aircrew proved far more successful in their attacks on rail targets than Harris had anticipated, and the head of Bomber Command resented the fact that th
