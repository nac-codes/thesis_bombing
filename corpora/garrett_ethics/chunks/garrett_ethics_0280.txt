Countries prior to the Normandy invasion. His aircrew proved far more successful in their attacks on rail targets than Harris had anticipated, and the head of Bomber Command resented the fact that they did not seem to be receiving appropriate credit for their achievement. Harris wrote to Portal on July 1, 1944, along the following lines: "I think you should be aware of the full depth of feeling that is being aroused by the lack of adequate, or even reasonable credit to the Royal Air Force . .. for their efforts in the invasion. . . .

"There was accordingly a genuine danger that the part which it had played in the earlier part of the war would be forgotten."7 This obsession with image and reputation to be sure was hardly confined to the British side. General Carl Spaatz, for example, was (against all the evidence) convinced that Bomber Command's area offensive might just succeed and bear out Harris's wildly optimistic claims about winning the war singlehandedly.
