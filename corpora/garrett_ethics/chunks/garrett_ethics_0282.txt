explaining, for instance, why Arthur Harris was not replaced as head of Bomber Command in 1944. We have earlier summarized the factors that might have been cited to justify such a dismissal, including the failures in the Battle of Berlin and especially Harris's open defiance of Portal later that year. The fact is, however, that Arthur Harris was Bomber Command, at least in the minds of the general public, not to mention the Americans. He had been carefully built up earlier in the war as one of Britain's most daring and decisive military figures, and, more to the point, was "one of the very few senior British officers who seemed able to ignore, let alone defy the American predominance in the conduct of grand strategy."" To dismiss him would be in effect to dismiss Bomber Command itself, or at the least to call into question all of its achievements since 1942. Such achievements as there were, of course, depended on the presumption that area bombing was an effective strategy. Even though the Air Ministry, by the fall of 1944, had generally been converted to precision bombing of Germany, Bomber Command was identified by everybody with area bomb- ing, and Arthur Harris was the prime apostle of area bombing. To sack Harris, or absolutely to insist on Bomber Command's devoting itself solely to precision bombing, would be an implicit repudiation of the whole strategy pursued in the preceding years. The results for the image of Bomber Com- mand, which, it must be emphasized, stood out as the most important remaining symbol of British independence of action, would have been at the least highly deleterious. Under the circumstances, Harris's superiors, while often resentful of his insubordination and increasingly doubtful about the merits of area bombing, grudgingly decided to let events take their course, to pursue the path of least resistance. Sir Archibald Sinclair, Secretary of State for Air, even offered a sympa- thetic assessment of the emotional difficulties that Harris
