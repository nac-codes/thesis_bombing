When Portal showed Sinclair copies of his acerbic correspondence with Harris in late fall 1944, commenting that the head of Bomber Command was "evidently under considerable emotional stress," Sinclair became the amateur psychologist. "I see what troubles his soul: our failure to go nap on the policy of obliteration and that the laurels which he is receiving are for successes-e.g., the pathfinders [and] the oil plan-which are not of his own design."10 A mordant letter from Barry Sullivan to his brother-in-law Basil Liddell Hart perhaps best summarized the whole situation. Sullivan was serving in the RAF on Malta but was depressed by the seemingly uncon- trolled destruction being meted out by Bomber Command. He feared that the government had "become Frankenstein, dominated by its own creation-the monster of Bomber Command."11 The Spirit of the People The official rationale for the initiation of the area offensive against Germany in 1942 made much of its supposed effect on German civilian morale.
