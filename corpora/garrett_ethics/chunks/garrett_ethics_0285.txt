vities was calcu- lated to have a serious impact on the public's perception that Britain, as represented by Bomber Command, could lay claim to some very special qualities of bravery and military accomplishment. What is critical in this consideration of British morale, of course, was the notion constantly pushed by High Wycombe, the Ministry of Information, and others that Bomber Command's area offensive was doing serious dam- age to the German capacity to make war. What was at stake here was what might be called "the Singapore syndrome."

At the same time, the enormous buildup of American ground, naval, and air forces was apparent to all, and there was a reluctant recognition (and not just withi
