An Eye for an Eye Earlier in this essay we discussed whether British area bombing of Ger- many might not have been motivated, at least in part, by a straightforward desire for revenge-given German air attacks on Great Britain and, in particular, raids on British cities. One conclusion was that, to a surprising degree, the revenge motive seemed to be lacking among important seg- ments of British public opinion, especially among those (ironically) in the most heavily bombed British towns and cities. Polls taken by the Gallup organization never showed more than 50 percent in favor of outright reprisal raids on Germany.14 For his part, Sir Arthur Harris denied that revenge was ever a significant factor in the decision to initiate and to continue city bombing of Germany. This is hardly the whole story, however. There may have been some truth to Harris's assertion but it would be a mistake to take it at face value Harris himself admits saying (during a German attack on London), "Well, they are sowing the wind, and they will reap the whirlwind." Indeed, there 193 is convincing evidence that, over the entire period of the area offensive, the desire to do unto the enemy as they had done unto Britain was at least one impulse to bombing policy among some in the Government and in the general public as well. In a press conference on May 25, 1943, Churchill touched on the theme of retribution and of the moral lesson of the Germans being hoist with their own petard, receiving in full measure the sort of devastation that they had so coldly meted out to others. The air weapon, he said, was the weapon these people chose to subjugate the world. This was the weapon with which they struck at Pearl Harbour. This was the weapon with which they boasted-the Germans boasted-they would terrorize all the countries of the world. And it is an example of poetic justice that this should b
