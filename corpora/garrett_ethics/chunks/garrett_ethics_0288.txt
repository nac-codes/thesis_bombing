struck at Pearl Harbour. This was the weapon with which they boasted-the Germans boasted-they would terrorize all the countries of the world. And it is an example of poetic justice that this should be the weapon in which they should find themselves most out-matched and first out-matched in the ensuing struggle. 15 By the summer of 1944, one might have expected that such thirst for retribution as existed would have been considerably slaked. Bomber Com- mand, after all, as well as the USAAF, had been laying waste to Germany from one end to the other for two full years. The terrible disproportionality between the original offense and the subsequent punishment would seem- ingly have satisfied even the most hardened souls: for every ton of bombs dropped on Britain during the war, the Germans received 315 tons in return. Churchill himself conceded that the original "debt" incurred by German air attacks against Britain was "repaid tenfold, twentyfold, in the frightful routine bombardment of German cities. . . . Certainly the enemy got it all back in good measure, pressed down and running over. Alas for poor humanity!"16 As it happened, however, two new events occurred at this point that seem to have given fresh spur to the demand (at least by some) for retaliation against the incorrigible Germans. The first of these involved the initiation of German rocket attacks against British cities. Hitler placed much hope in the Vergeltungswaffen (the "weapons of retaliation") as a means of reversing his steadily declining military fortunes. As it turned out, the V-1s and V-2s had little effect in delaying his final defeat, but the character and nature of this new weapon of war seemed to confirm (or reconfirm) in the minds of many that the Germans were quite beyond th the pale of civilized conduct. The V-1 was a cruise missile powered by a jet engine and carried about a ton of high explosive. It could fly as fast as 450 MPH and had a range of some 200 miles. When its engine exhauste
