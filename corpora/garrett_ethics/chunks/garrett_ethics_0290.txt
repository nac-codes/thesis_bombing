th a "cold-blooded" assessment as to "how it would pay us to use poison gas. ... We could drench the cities of the Ruhr and many other cities in Germany in such a way that most of the population would be requiring constant medical treatment."19 The other event in 1944 that may well have refueled the rather primitive impulse toward retribution being visited on the German people was the Battle of the Bulge, which began on December 16 of that year. The German offensive in the Ardennes Forest was particularly galling to a British people who had anticipated, after five long years of war, that an end to the hostilities might be at hand. The initial successes of the Germans in the Ardennes suggested that the conflict might actually go on for an indeterminate period This in itself mitigated against any restraint in the air war against Germany and aroused once again all the anger concerning German responsibility for initiating the war in the first place. It is significant, in this regard, that the fateful attack on Dresden took place less than a month after the conclusion of the Ardennes offensive. To suggest that the area offensive continued up until virtually the last days of the war at least in part because Great Britain was intent on meting out just punishment to the Germans is a fairly controversial-and, to some perhaps offensive-argument. Moreover, it is one that obviously is not as 195 easy to substantiate as other aspects of British bombing policy, particularly since, after the war, most involved in that policy hastened to deny that they had ever been moved by so ignoble an impulse as a sheer desire for retribution. It also needs emphasizing that bombing as a tool for revenge (quite aside from its supposed military utility) was hardly a one-sided phenomenon in the war. The Germans for their part undertook overtly terrorist raids on Britain, the purpose of which was clearly not military but rather retributional. In addition to the indiscriminate German rocket attacks
