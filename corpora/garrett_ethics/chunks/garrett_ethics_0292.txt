Do Unto Others If They Can't Do Unto You There was a final element in the initiation, but especially the continuation, of the area offensive until the very end of the war. Despite all the apocalyptic predictions in Britain before 1939 about Germany's ability to deliver a  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 196 uou Final Reflections devastating air strike on the United Kingdom in the first days of a conflict, it gradually became apparent that the Germans actually had little capacity for massive strategic bombing. To be sure, the Blitz from the fall of 1940 to the spring of 1941 did some considerable damage in lives and materiel, but hardly on the order of what had been fearfully anticipated before the conflict. Once Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, moreover, the resources of the Luftwaffe were almost entirely redirected to the East, and air attacks on the British islands were no more than a minor annoyance for the remainder of the war, save for the V-1 and V-2 assaults in 1944. Given the fact that the Luftwaffe could not (or did not) retaliate in kind for British attacks on German cities, there was little incentive on the part of the British government to stay their hand with respect to German civilians. In a curious sense what we had here was an early confirmation of the basic notion of deterrence as it later came to influence the debate over the West's nuclear strategy toward the Soviet Union. Deterrence in its essentials was a doctrine not for the use of air power (in this case nuclear missiles and nuclear bomb-carrying aircraft) but for persuading one's enemy not to initiate this particular form of air warfare. The premise behind an effective deterrent strategy was that if one could inflict an equal or greater degree of damage on a potential instigator of nuclear warfare, that
