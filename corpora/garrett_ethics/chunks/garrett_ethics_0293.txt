particular form of air warfare. The premise behind an effective deterrent strategy was that if one could inflict an equal or greater degree of damage on a potential instigator of nuclear warfare, that country would be deterred from beginning a nuclear exchange, assuming it was capable of some fairly basic cost-benefit calculations. Also crucial to the notion of deterrence was the idea of credibility, that is, that one would actually carry out the threatened retaliation if attacked.22 The Germans seem to have attempted various forms of deterrence against British strategic bombing almost from the first days of the war. This derived not out of any unusual sensitivities to civilian suffering but rather from belief that Germany might well be more vulnerable to an unrestricted strategic air war than her enemies. Thus the Nazi leaders in 1939 made much of their pledge not to initiate air attacks on cities should their opponents desist from doing so as well. More specifically, they publicly agreed to President Roosevelt's call for a mutual forbearance in air attacks on cities, which the American leader issued in the first week of the war. As noted, Berlin had done relatively little to develop a genuine strategic bombing force, and she obviously hoped to constrain London's use of Bomber Command by sug- gesting the moral opprobrium that would be attached to the British govern ment by the international community if Great Britain should openly initiate attacks on civilian targets. As the war progressed, the Germans engaged in rather different attempts at deterrence. George Quester suggests, for example, that the Baedekker raids 197 were actually a last-gasp attempt by the Germans to maintain the earlier mutual restraint as far as the bombing of cities was concerned. In other words, the devastation inflicted on Canterbury, Exeter, and other cities might persuade the British to forgo a general area bombing offensive of Germany.23 Hitler and other Nazi spokesmen also constantly re
