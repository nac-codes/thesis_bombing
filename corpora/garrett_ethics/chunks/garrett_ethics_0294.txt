the devastation inflicted on Canterbury, Exeter, and other cities might persuade the British to forgo a general area bombing offensive of Germany.23 Hitler and other Nazi spokesmen also constantly referred to the development of new terror weapons that would cause the British to regret that they had ever started indiscriminate air warfare (or were continuing it). The V-1 and V-2 offensive against Britain might also be seen as an effort to deter further devastation of German cities, although the simple push for revenge seems to have been as prominent in this case as the idea of persuading Britain to curtail her own air offensive. If there were efforts by the Germans to employ the concept of deterrence, it is self-evident that they badly failed in their objective. Indeed, several of them actually seem to have steeled the British in their determination to continue the area offensive unabated. The decisive point about these German attempts to dissuade London from a generalized assault on their cities was the lack of the essential ingredient of credibility in their deterrence strategy once Britain came to realize that the capacity of Germany for serious aerial retaliation against the British islands was limited. This does not mean that the suffering inflicted by the Blitz was not deeply felt, nor that the effect of the German rocket campaign in 1944 was lightly discarded. It is simply to say that London recognized that there was little, if any, real balance between the amount of destruction that Germany could visit on Britain compared to that which Bomber Command was able to inflict on the Germans. Under the circumstances-and in accord with one of the basic principles of deter- rence-there was little incentive on the part of Churchill and his advisers to restrain the area offensive.
