roblematical, it will not do to say that Harris and others were essentially forced into them by unanticipated operational difficulties. This culminating period in the area offensive may indeed be traced to the "hopes and ambitions" dating back to the formation of the RAF in 1918. The postwar trials of the major German war criminals at Nuremberg provide another reference point concerning the British bombing of German cities. There was a studious effort on the part of the Allies to avoid placing the issue of area bombing on the agenda of the Tribunal. The chief American prosecutor at the trials, Telford Taylor, later recalled that "aerial bombard- ment had been used so extensively and ruthlessly on the Allied as well as the Axis side that neither at Nuremberg nor Tokyo was the issue made a part of the trials."28 It was obviously felt that such indelicate references might compromise the case being made against the crimes of the defendants. In the event, several of those in the dock declined to make so subtle a distinction between the killing of thousands of civilians in air raids and their own dubious activities. The events at Hamburg and Dresden-and  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 200 LOL Final Reflections Hiroshima-were used as important pieces of evidence in their defense, the burden of their argument being that their accusers had in fact committed crimes just as great as those that they were charged with. Moreover, the German defendants made the same use of doubtful precedents in interna- tional law that the British employed to justify their own actions. Thus Field Marshall Kesselring defended the German bombing of Warsaw in 1939 by saying that "in the German view, Warsaw was a fortress, and moreover it had strong air defenses. Thus, it fell under the stipulations of the Hague Convention for land warfare, which can analogously be applied to air warfare."29 It was precisely the 1907 Hague Convention (as we have seen) that was used by the British to justify thei
