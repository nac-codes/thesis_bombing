of the Hague Convention for land warfare, which can analogously be applied to air warfare."29 It was precisely the 1907 Hague Convention (as we have seen) that was used by the British to justify their aerial attacks on "defended" German cities during World War II. That so loathsome a collection of individuals as those under indictment at Nuremberg should have tried to use British conduct to justify their own might simply be dismissed as a rather desperate attempt to escape the hangman's noose. Yet there is something deeply troubling about the fact that they should have been able to make even a superficial connection between their activities and those of Bomber Command. Kant's famous Categorical Imperative asserted that the basis of all morality was that one should "act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become a universal law." The fact that the area offensive was so morally problematical made it vulnerable to those of quite dubious persuasions pleading "reciprocity." Moreover, it has continued to be so employed Various terrorist groups have from time to time defended their indiscriminate killing of civilians by saying that they were only following the precedent established by the British in World War II. Such an argument has had at least a certain credibility with a great many people who view the area offensive itself simply as an exercise in terror rather than military strategy.30 This is what might be called the "nemesis effect" of violating the war convention even in a worthy cause: such a departure often returns to haunt those originally responsible for it. Others pursuing a far less just end now find it convenient-and possible-to wrap themselves in the mantle of legitimacy when they employ these new techniques of violence, which often are directed at the very society that originally introduced them.31 The Drive Toward Total War To say that Bomber Command was basically an instrument of terror is a harsh indictment and, t
