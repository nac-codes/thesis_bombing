The destruction in Germany was by then [the time of the attack on Dresden] on a scale which might have appalled Attila or Genghis Khan."36 Perhaps the only difference between the two was that Magdeburg was laid waste by individuals who could directly observe the consequences of their actions, whereas the destruction of Dresden was an impersonal act carried out with studied technical efficiency by aircrew who could have little direct sense of the effect of their bombs on the people below. The re-emergence of the concept of total war, as partly represented by the area offensive against Germany (we should not ignore the Nazis' own 203 contribution here), clearly has had an enormous effect on the postwar world. Indeed, it has been this lingering residue of the area offensive that perhaps constitutes one of the most dolorous aspects of strategic bombing in World War II. To be sure, there has been no repetition of total war on the scale of World War II, and for that much we can be grateful. Yet many of the essential mindsets that led to (and made possible) strategic bombing have been much in evidence since 1945. One of these has been what might be called the "score card" approach to war, in which sheer numbers of bombers, tons of bombs dropped, number of killed and injured, and square miles of destruction achieved have been used as the basic indicator of military progress. This predilection for abstract quantification was very prevalent at High Wycombe, but we have seen it more recently as well, particularly in the Vietnam war. That struggle drew on the precedent of the area offensive in yet another way. A basic operating principle in Vietnam seemed to be that since the "people" were the basic source of strength for the enemy's armed forces, then the "people" themselves became a legitimate military target. The truth of this observation might be seen in a bizarre conversation the American journalist Neil Sheehan had with the commander of American forces in Vietnam, General
