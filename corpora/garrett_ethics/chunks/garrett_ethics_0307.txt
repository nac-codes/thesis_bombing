basically false- but the point is that a tendency in that direction is ever present, and it takes a concerted effort to deal with it. When a relatively novel, new technique of war becomes available, such an effort is made all the more difficult. This is particularly the case since it is a rare event for those in authority to feel that they are at something of a crossroads, that they are faced with a truly fundamental decision about adopting an entirely new line of military policy. On the contrary, the standard feeling is one of incrementalism, that is to say, that what is now being suggested is simply a logical, and seemingly marginal, continuation of what has already been done. This point certainly applies to the evolution of British bombing of Germany. It started out as an attempt to hit precise targets and with little or no unintended damage to civilians. Then there was an ambiguous period dating from May 1940 to February 1942, in which the definition of legitimate targets was expanded. Much emphasis continued to be on precision attacks on traditional military objectives, but there was an in- creasing tendency to include a broader category of potential targets as well, including German cities. Finally, the decision was made simply to concen- trate (at least for the time being) on large urban areas. In this two-and-one- half-year period, there never seems to have been one critical point in which the central issue of city bombing was directly faced. Such a strategy simply evolved out of a series of smaller, more detailed steps. If this is a fair characterization of British bombing strategy, we need to take note not only of the incremental way in which the area offensive was eventually adopted but also of something else that was integral to it, what might be called a fatal lack of imagination. The "donkeys" was a common pejorative directed at the British generals of World War I. The term suggested that those in high  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 206 207 Fina
