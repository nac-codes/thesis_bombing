atal lack of imagination. The "donkeys" was a common pejorative directed at the British generals of World War I. The term suggested that those in high  Ethics and Airpower in World War II 206 207 Final Reflections command were essentially impervious to reality, stubbornly determined to press on with patently false strategic premises, and quite insensitive to the human cost of their illusions in the bargain.41 A comparison is often made in this respect between Sir Arthur Harris and Sir Douglas Haig, the British commander on the Western Front. The latter, as head of all British ground forces, was noted for his unswerving commitment to frontal assaults against the German lines in France and Belgium in a vain attempt to achieve a decisive breakthrough that would lead to victory. The Passchendaele campaign in 1917, as one example of Haig's strategy, cost the British 400,000 casualties in return for the capture of five miles of muddy terrain. There is something to be said for the comparison between Harris and Haig, although there were differences between the two men as well. It is instructive to recall Haig's opinion that "from the point of view of morality and public opinion" he was opposed to any effort at the "devastation of enemy lands and destruction of industrial and populous centres on a vast scale."42 This judgment was presumably facilitated by the fact that Haig was jealous of the emerging glamour of the air service and assured one and all that airpower would always remain secondary and subordinate to the army and the navy.
