are many who will be made uneasy-or made angry-by this disquisition on the comparative "humanity" of German versus British military operations in World War II, and certainly the Wehrmacht was guilty of quite horrendous violations of the war convention on numerous occasions. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the Germans never came close to matching the British area bombing offensive of Germany in their own air attacks on Britain, although it can easily be argued that this was more because of operational limitations than concerns about limits in war. Even so, this may miss the point that Britain was fighting for a particular vision of the future of humanity. That vision was intimately related to the value system that had been so laboriously constructed in Britain itself over several hundred years, in particular respect for the dignity and integrity of the individual and the value of a single human life. The troubling question remains whether, in defeating the larger threat, Britain did not in some ways diminish the very cause for which she was fighting. It has been observed about World War I that, in the course of conquering German imperialism, there was "meted out heavy punishment to that broad humane liberalism which for two centuries had been one of the most vital elements in British politics."47 If such was the case, the same seems to apply in even greater degree to the British experience in World War II. Lord Acton's famous axiom that power tends to corrupt and absolute power to corrupt absolutely may be quoted to good effect here. In the last year of the war, the Allies generally, and Bomber Command specifically, had virtually absolute power of aerial destruction over Germany, and that this had a corrupting effect on British standards of humanity seems inescapable. In an observation on the American Civil War, Bruce Catton caught the essential dilemma facing free societies at war. He observed that in the search for victory democracies may be driven to "perform act
