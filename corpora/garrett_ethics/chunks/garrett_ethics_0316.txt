Slessor anticipated the later attitude of the Air Staff when he commented on the "difficult and depressing negotiations about the legality of bombing which took up so much of our time in 1938 and 1939. . . . It was all an unhappy, tedious and really rather meaningless business. In reality, speaking for myself (and I think for the rest of the Air Staff), I regarded it all as a matter not of legality but of expediency .. .. We never had the least doubt that sooner or later the gloves would come off." 10. Great Britain, 5 Parliamentary Debates (Commons), Volume 337 (June 21, 11.
