Professor Norris Hundley, former editor of the Pacific Historical Review,  taught me how to sharpen prose that I already thought was sharp. Two years at Stanford with my graduate cohort and three years at the USMA History Department provided engaging intellectual environments. I received help at numerous archival collections across the country: Dave Giardano and Wil Mahoney at the National Archives; the staffs at the Library of Congress, Washington D.C.; the Air Force Historical Research Center (AFHRC) at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama; the Seely G. Mudd Library at Princeton University; the Naval Historical Center in Washington D.C.; and the USMA Special Collections Department. Dennis Bilger of the Truman Presidential Library was the perfect “finding aide;” he somehow intuitively knew the documents that I needed to read. Grants from the Dean of USMA, the AFHRC, and the Truman Presidential Library helped to pay for a number of research trips. My parents, A1 and Betty Gentile, placed in me a love for history at a very early age by telling me stories about the Depression and World War II. My wife June and two children, Michael and Elizabeth, are the inspiration for all that I do. I could not have completed this thesis without their help. v Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
