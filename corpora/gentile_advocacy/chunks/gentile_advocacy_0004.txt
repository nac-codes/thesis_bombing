We are simply to seek the truth.” Franklin D’OIier, December 1944 Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson officially established the United States Strategic Bombing Survey in November 1944 to analyze the effects of strategic air power in the European theater. Later, President Harry S. Truman expanded the Survey’s scope to study all types of aerial war against Japan, including the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In an attempt to keep the Survey’s findings impartial, prominent civilians were appointed as directors of most of the Survey’s Divisions. The key directors of the Survey were Franklin D’OIier (Chairman), Henry Alexander (Vice- Chairman), George Ball, Paul Nitze, John Kenneth Galbraith, Admiral Ralph A. Ofstie, and General Orvil Arson Anderson. The final studies, completed and published in late 1945 through 1947, numbered over 330 reports and annexes; the massive amount of research and statistical data is staggering. *  *  * Two scholar
