the Survey also assessed the Navy’s use of air power against Japan, and the effects of the atomic bomb. The Pacific Survey had to wrestle with the fact that, unlike Germany, Japan was forced to surrender without a land invasion. But if it was not a ground invasion that ended the war, then what did force Japan to surrender?
