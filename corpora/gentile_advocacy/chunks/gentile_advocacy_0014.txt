eed, Douhet went on to state that it would be impossible to determine systematically enemy targets in aerial warfare because the choice would “depend on a number of circumstances, material, moral, and psychological, the importance of which, though real, is not easily estimated. It is just here, in grasping these imponderables, in choosing enemy targets, that future commanders of Independent Air Forces will show their ability.”2  Considering the overwhelming confidence that Douhet had in the ability of a fleet of bombers to destroy enemy cities and break the will of the civilian population, one would think that target selection would have played a more important role in the Italian’s theory of air 1  Guilio Douhet, The Command o f the Air,  Translated by Dino Ferrari, 1942, New Imprint by the Office of Air Force History (Washington, D.C.; USGPO, 1983), 57-59.

Douhet’s challenge to conventional military thought on warfare in the 1920s was that the nation that owned an air force predominantly of strategic bombers could avoid costly naval and ground engagements by attacking the “vital centers” of enemy cities thereby creating terror among the civilian population. The result, according to
