As early as 1923 a translation of The Command o f the Air  was being circulated at the Air Service Headquarters. In 1933 The Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) at Maxwell Field, Alabama maintained copies of Douhet’s work.6  Historians have debated how much direct influence Douhet had on the development of American air power strategy in the 1930s. Some analysts argue that air power proponents like William Mitchell had greater influence on American thinking on strategic bombing than Douhet. Others argue that Douhet’s prolific writings played an important role in shaping American views on air power.7  Most scholars, however, would agree that Douhet’s collective works gave a literary comprehensiveness to the ideas that gshaped the American conceptual approach to strategic bombing. By 1939 American airmen had developed a conception of air power that envisioned using strategic bombers to attack the “vital links” of the enemy’s war making capacity, 6  Conrad C. Crane, Bombs, Cities and Civilians: American Airpower Strategy in World War 11  (University Press of Kansas, 1993), 17-18; Ronald Schaffer, Wings o f Judgment: American Bombing in World War II (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), 24; Meilinger, “Guilio Douhet and the Origins of Airpower Theory,” 33. 7  Crane for example, in Bombs, Cities and Civilians,  argues that by the mid 1930s Douhet’s writings did influence the development of American airpower strategy but only insofar as advocating an independent air arm and the decisiveness o f strategic bombing (17-18). Shaffer, in Wings o f Judgment,  tends to place more emphasis on Douhet’s influence on Americans, especially the bombing of civilians(24). An extreme cases that refuses to acknowledge Douhet’s influence on American airmen is Robert T. Finney, History o f the Air Corps Tactical School, 1920-1940  (Washington, D.C.: U.S. GPO); In an older,
