n extreme cases that refuses to acknowledge Douhet’s influence on American airmen is Robert T.

American airmen were soldiers, not experts in industrial economies. They were trained to fly aircraft and to drop bombs on critical targets. However, the targets to attack under the American conception were economic in nature. To assess how the destruction of any given target would affect the
