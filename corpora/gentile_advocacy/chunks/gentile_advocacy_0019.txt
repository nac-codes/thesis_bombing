File: --- gentile_advocacy.pdf --- Page 23 --- Evaluating the effects of strategic bombing on certain industrial targets became especially difficult because evaluation required more than just assessing physical damage, it required an analysis of the entire enemy industrial system. And the overall effect of strategic bombing on enemy war-making capacity was never immediately apparent, sometimes taking an extended period of time to manifest itself. Hence the uncertainties of target selection and evaluation, which were embedded in the American conceptual approach to strategic bombing, created a need for civilian experts to change “imponderables” to ponderables. Organi 2ations like the Committee of Operations Analysts, the Committee of Historians, and the United States Strategic Bombing Survey were an outgrowth of this need. I The biggest problem for American air officers during the years following the end o f World War I, however, was not so much target selection (that problem would present itself more fully in the 1930s when they began to develop a strategic bombing concept) but achieving a co-equal status with the Army and Navy. The leading proponent in the 1920s for an independent air arm was Army General William Mitchell.1 1  Conventional thinking concerning air power during that decade saw it mainly as an adjunct, or supporting arm, for ground and naval operations. Since air power, according to this line o f thinking, could not win a war, it did not require independent status. Mitchell, conversely, argued that an independent air force could win by itself. He also posited that 1 1  For a recent analysis of William Mitchell on the development of American airpower see Mark L.
