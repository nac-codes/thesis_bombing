l Schools, by the late 1930s, had become the “incubator” of American strategic bombing doctrine. Partly due to its geographic detachment at Maxwell from Washington D.C., partly because it was the only service school that was producing a coherent doctrine for strategic bombardment, and because the smartest air corps officers were either instructors or had been students at the School (e.g., Hap Arnold, Carl Spaatz, Muir Fairchild, Laurence Kuter, Orville Anderson, Frederick Anderson, Ira Eaker, Hoyt Vandenberg, and Haywood Hansell) the School became the seedbed for developing concepts within the AAF on air power.

Once those key targets had been selected and bombed, the will of the enemy would most likely collapse.1 9  General Andrews’s rhetorical allusion to the defensive use o f airpower nevertheless was grounded in an offensive conception for an independent air force. To destroy the enemy’s “will to invade,” as the General suggested, the United States would have to launch a strategic bombing offensive that would prevent the enemy nation from using its war-making capacity first to attack American soil with strategic bombers.2 0 The Munich conference of 1938 and Hitler’s subsequent march into Czechoslovakia created a more conducive atmosphere for air officers forthrightly to advocate their conceptual approach to strategic bombing.2 1  Air Corps Tactical School officer Lieutenant Colonel Donald Wilson pointed out to other members of the School that the United States needed to develop a long range bombardment force that could threaten an enemy nation’s “home territory.” Although he did not explicitly mention Germany as the “home territo
