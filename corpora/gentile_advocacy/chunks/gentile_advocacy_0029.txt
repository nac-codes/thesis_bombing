their war making capacity.2 6 Based on a study of the American industrial system, ACTS instructor Major Haywood Hansell, who a few years later would assist in writing the plan for the American air war against Germany, determined that the “vital links” common to the United States and most other industrialized nations were, “in order of importance;” electric power, rail transportation, fuel, steel, and armament and munitions factories. Muir Fairchild concluded that if an enemy equipped with strategic bombers were to attack electrical power facilities in major American cities, for example, the will to resist of the 2 5 Muir Fairchild, “National Economic Structure,” 6. 2 6 ClodfeIter, “Molding Airpower Convictions,” 96. 21 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Hansell stated that these problems “were beyond the competence of the Tactical School. Strategic air intelligence on major world powers would demand an intelligence organization and analytical competence of considerable scope and complexity.” Muir Fairchild realized that his own analysis of the American industrial system was somewhat “amateurish” and that target selection and assessment of “vital links” in the enemy’s industrial structure called for analysis by “the economist— the statistician— the technical expert— rather than a strictly 29military study or war plan.” II If Guilio Douhet and ACTS instructor Lieutenant Colonel Donald Wilson were correct in stating that the essence of air strategy was target
