The basic conception on which this plan is based lies in the application of air power for the breakdown of the industrial and economic structure of Germany. This conception involves the selection of a system of objectives vital to continued German war effort, and to the means of livelihood of the German people, and tenaciously concentrating all bombing toward destruction of those objectives.” The specific target systems to attack within the German industrial and economic structure would be in order of priority: electrical power; transportation; oil and petroleum production; and the undermining of morale by air attack.3 3  Just as enemy morale in the ACTS lectures of the late 1930s was seen as a potential target to attack, so too was it a potential target in AWPD-1. Yet once acknowledged in the plan as a possible target, morale received very little attention. Indeed AWPD-1 bears striking similarity to Muir Fairchild’s ACTS lecture on the “National Economic Structure,” with the emphasis on attacking “vital links” in the war making capacity o f the enemy.3 6 The authors of AWPD-1 acknowledged that the strategic concept brought out in the plan and the estimates derived from that concept required “continuing study” and refinement.3 7  They pointed out to Army Chief of Staff, General George C.

But Hansell is strongly inconsistent in the way he treats the attacking of morale in his two books with the way AWPD/1 treated it in 1941. In AWPD/1 morale is fourth on the list
