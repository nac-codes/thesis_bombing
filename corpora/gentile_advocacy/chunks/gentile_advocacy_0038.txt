According to this early report, critical targets, once selected, should be attacked with “relentless determination” which would probably cause “grave injury” to German war-making capacity.4 3 The COA did not consider German morale a target.

Perera’s group stated that they could not give a “precise answer to this question.” But they went on to say that the destruction of a number of key targets “would gravely impair and might paralyze the Western Axis war effort...In view of the ability of adequate and properly utilized air power to impair the industrial sources of the enemy’s military strength, only the most vital considerations should be per
