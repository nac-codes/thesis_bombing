ilitary situation” for Germany.6 4 In his cover memorandum to President Roosevelt that went along with the historians’ report, General Arnold made a subtle but important change to their conclusion. General Arnold in fact tried to salvage from the report the notion that there was still the possibility to force German surrender without a land invasion, a possibility that the historians thoroughly argued against. General Arnold agreed with the committee’s conclusion that Germany could “not be bombed out of the war in the next three months but added that: ...surrender will come when, through lack of adequate air defense, Germany finds herself unable to maintain resistance to ground operations or prevent destruction by aerial bombardment of her industries, cities, and communications...I believe the report tends to confirm our essential theses of the use and effect of air power and our own findings as to the results of operations to date.”6 3 By stating that surrender would come about either  when Germany was unable to resist ground operations (a land invasion of Germany) or when it could no longer stop destruction of its “cities, industry, and communications” by strategic bombardment, General Arnold subtly, but profoundly, changed the conclusion of the Historians. They argued conversely that the land invasion was a necessary condition for Germany’s surrender. Strategic bombing, according to the Historians, had to be coupled with a land invasion of the European continent to force German capitulation. Strategic bombing was across the Atlantic, see Foreign Relations o f the United States  (FRUS), “The Conferences at Cairo and Tehran, 1943,” (Washington, D.C., US GPO, 1961), 273-290; Arnold, Global Mission,  453-456,490. 6 4  The Committee of Historians, Appendix I to “Germany’s War Potential,” “Is There A Valid Analogy Between 1918 and 1944?” 53. 6 5  Memorandum from General Arnold to the President, 27 January 1944 (italics mine). 36 Reproduced with permission of the copyri
