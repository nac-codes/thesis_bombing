It was not a radical departure and it did not surprise anyone. Airmen had been using civilian experts to make strategic target recommendations and evaluate AAF operations prior to and during the war. The Strategic Bombing Survey was a ological and natural continuation of this concept. Airmen like Hap Arnold and Carl Spaatz put forward the idea that having a civilian in charge would insure that the Survey’s report would “be received as an unbiased and completely impartial study based solely on fact and not on opinion.” Because of its great importance Spaatz argued, “careful consideration should be given to the selection of the head of this committee.” According to Spaatz, the AAF should try to find “a well-known American publisher, jurist, or university president” for the post.9  A civilian-led, impartial study became the leit-motif of the AAF because it would ostensibly add an air of objectivity to its conclusions that could be used to support the postwar crusade for an independent air force. In the main, the Survey would accomplish three goals for the AAF: First, it would serve as the AAF’s primary historical record that would help it establish postwar independence and lay the foundations for future air policy and theory; second, the Survey’s evaluation would determine the effects of strategic bombing on Germany’s war- 7  Beveridge, History o f the United States Strategic Bombing Survey,  frame 761. 8  Futrell, Ideas, Concepts, Doctrine,  142-144; Maclsaac, Strategic Bombing in World War II,  21-22. 9 Spaatz to Arnold, 5 April 1944, Beveridge, Frame 1365. 43 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
