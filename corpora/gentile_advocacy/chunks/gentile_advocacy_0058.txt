General Arnold proposed to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the survey ought to determine the facts and lessons learned from German experience so that they “may be applied without delay to the strategic bombardment of Japan...”1 0  Studying the effects of the strategic bombing campaign against Germany and applying those lessons to Japan was an important objective for AAF leaders. Because the air campaign against the Japanese home islands was still in its early stages in mid 1944, any relevant lessons learned from the European theater could prove helpful in the war against Japan.1 1  But the AAF had other evaluation agencies like the COA to conduct those types of studies, many of which demonstrated that there were differences between the industrial structures of Germany and Japan. There would be limits, therefore, to the usefulness of the experience gained from the American strategic bombing campaign against Germany for fighting Japan.1 2 But establishing the Survey, partly on the need for applying the lessons learned against Japan did, however, give the Survey a sense o f wartime urgency. General Spaatz agreed with General Arnold in June that the airmen should “stress the time factor and the operational requirements of the war against Japan, leaving until later the detailed 1 0  Memo for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “Post-Armistice Evaluation of the Strategic Bombardment of Europe,” undated, Beveridge, frames 1373-1374. 1 1  Arnold to Spaatz, 21 April 1944, Box 41, RG 243, NA; Haywood S.
