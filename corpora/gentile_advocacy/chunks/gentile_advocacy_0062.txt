My view is that we should resist any such pressure, whether brought to bear over here, or in Washington through the Combined Chiefs of Staff or otherwise. In my opinion, the investigation we propose should be set up as a completely independent American survey, staffed from American personnel from top to bottom.” By the end of May, Spaatz had come to an agreement with the British that would allow both the British and Americans to share data but conduct independent evaluations.

The AAF used its strategic bombers in Europe for the precise destruction of specific industrial targets.2 0  The RAF, conversely, had developed a different doctrine of strategic bombing.
