Although the RAF and AAF were working together to attack Germany by air, they were carrying out two fundamentally different doctrines of air power, according to Eaker.2 2 As the war progressed in Europe, the AAF conducted limited area attacks against the German war economy (and later, on a much larger scale, against Japan). The RAF, beginning in 1942, also used area bombing to attack the enemy’s war economy but according to historian Conrad Crane, “its main focus was on undermining the morale of the German populace, especially industrial workers.”2 3  When American airmen themselves conducted area raids they understood those raids to be a method  of using strategic bombers to attack the war-making capacity of the enemy, which was the objective  of the attacks. In the American conception, area or precision attacks would ideally also lower the morale of the enemy population, but morale was not the primary objective for precision or area bombing, according to American airmen.2 4  Strategic Bombing Survey analysts would carry this conception into their study of area attacks on German cities by demonstrating in their analytical approach and published reports a conception of urban area attacks as a method of destroying the enemy’s war-making capacity.
