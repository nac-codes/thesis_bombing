Koenig (assigned by General Kuter in July to do the preliminary organizational planning) took the questions from the various agencies, along with the recommendations from General Spaatz, and designed the core of what would become the organizational structure of the Strategic Bombing Survey. By September, Koenig envisioned the Survey consisting of five evaluation divisions: physical damage, strategic operations, economics, political and morale, and military analysis.3 2  Although this organizational structure would undergo a few more modifications as the Survey began its work in early 1945, the basic structure would remain as Koenig had planned it.3 3 ',0 Memo from AC/AS, Plans to the Air Inspector, “Survey of Results of Combined Bomber Offensive,” 10 May 1944, Box 225, Spaatz Papers, Library of Congress. 3 1  Memo from Barrett to the Air Surgeon, “Recommendations for the Study of the Psychological Effects of Strategic Bombing on Germany,” 1  October 1944, Box 41, file 381, RG 243, NA. 3 2  Theodore J.
