Before the war Nitze had been a member of the New York investment firm o f Dillon, Read and Company, responsible for some of the company’s investments in American electrical power industries. Prior to joining that company. Nitze had worked as an economist for another investment firm in Chicago. Anticipating the work he would later do for the Survey, Nitze in 1929 wrote a report for the firm analyzing the problems with the Germany economy. By 1944, Nitze had served in various governmental agencies that addressed economic problems created by the war. In October, 54he accepted the post as Director o f the Survey’s Equipment and Utilities Division. Perera and D’Olier wanted a talented economist to head the Division that would assess the overall effects of strategic bombing on the German economy. After considering a number of names during November and December, and with a recommendation from Paul Nitze, they decided on economist John Kenneth Galbraith.3 3 Prior to joining the Survey in February 1945, Galbraith had served as an economic advisor to the National Defense Advisory Commission and as a Director for the Price Division of the Office of Price Administration. Like his fellow Directors, Galbraith would bring to his work with the Survey in Europe a “sense of discovery and excitement” toward evaluating the effects of strategic bombing on the German war economy.3 6 Serving as the Survey’s Military Analysis Division Director, Major General Orvil Arson Anderson of the AAF saw in the Survey more than just discovery and excitement. 5 4
