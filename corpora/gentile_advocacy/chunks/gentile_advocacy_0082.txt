VI Paul Nitze commented in his memoirs that when he joined the Survey in October 1944 “it was still little more than an organization on paper.”6 3  Implicit in Nitze’s remembrance was that he and the other civilian directors built the Survey from scratch and carried out the purported “impartial” and “unbiased” evaluation of strategic bombing. But the record demonstrates that the Survey was anything but a “paper” organization in October nl944. Senior air officers had spent the preceding seven months establishing the Survey’s scope, framing its questions, and building an organizational framework that reflected the AAF’s conceptual approach to strategic bombing.

These meetings produced no radical change from the so-called “paper” organization that the AAF had already established. In fact, the meetings reinforced
