Orvil Arson Anderson, 1945 At a Survey Director’s meeting on 1  April 1945, Franklin D’Olier commented on his amazement that the “Air Corps should have given us this job with no qualifications, and to know that at no time has there been the slightest inclination to interfere with us. They want us to find out what the facts are from an absolutely impartial civilian point of view.”1  D’Olier was naively correct. The Survey did conduct an “impartial” civilian-led evaluation o f strategic bombing, but that evaluation was shaped by the AAF during the year prior to D’Olier’s conference with his civilian Directors. Between January and March 1945, the Survey had grown into an organization of approximately 300 civilian and 800 military analysts and support personnel. When Germany surrendered in May 1945, Survey field teams were inspecting bombed targets in France and Germany and gathering extensive data on the German wartime economy.
