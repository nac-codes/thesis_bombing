mbing concept, the most effective way to break the enemy’s will to resist was not to attack morale directly by killing people but instead to break the enemy’s capacity to resist by damaging the “basic industries” of its war economy. The Survey’s analysis flowed from the logic of that conception. The apparent contradictions and competing conclusions of the Survey’s published reports thus fade away when framed by the American concept. Strong disagreements between members of the European Survey did occur over certain conclusions concerning the most effective targets systems that the AAF bombed. But those disagreements never challenged the relevance of American air power, only its degree of effectiveness. I The first task that Survey analysts faced when they began their evaluation was to collect the evidence on the effects of strategic bombing.

At the inspection site, the teams assessed the level of physical destruction o f the target, collected production records and other related data, and interrogated, when possible, plant managers, workers, and other individuals with knowledge about the bombed target. After each inspection, the teams wrote up a standardized “form and content plant report” that consolidated the information they had gathered.7 The Division Directors took their field teams’  data, analyzed it, and wrote reports that attempted to answer the questions given to them by the AAF.
