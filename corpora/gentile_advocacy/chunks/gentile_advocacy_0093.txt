ciples to adopt in respect to the use of bombers.”1 1 But the most significant challenge faced by Survey Directors was to devise a method of evaluation that enabled them to understand the huge mass of data that the field teams collected, and then write their final reports. In simple terms their methodology was to take the data collected by the field teams on selected targets— for example the ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt, Germany that the AAF bombed heavily in 1943— and determine what impact strategic bombing had on those plants. They would then use the discrete findings from the Schweinfurt plants to evaluate the effects of strategic bombing on the entire German ball-bearing industry and then how that sector affected the whole war economy. It was important for all Survey analysts to understand how their own discrete field of study related to the general work of the Survey. According to an Economic Division analyst, it made little sense “to study industries one by one without considering their relations to each other and the total war economy.” Survey analysts needed to appreciate, therefore, “the interdependence of industry” so that they did not overlook “important data” in the course of their work.1 2 Because of the complexity of their economic-based evaluation, counterfactual speculation became an important part of their methodology. To determine the effects of strategic bombing on a given industry, or the overall economy for that matter, Survey analysts estimated what the production level of that industry would have been i f strategic 1 1  “Minutes of Meeting Held 1  April 1945,” Box 2, file 001, RG 243, NA. 1 2  Overall Effects Division, “Memorandum on the Investigation of the Effects of Strategic Bombing,” undated, Box 18, file 300.6, RG 243, NA. 73 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
