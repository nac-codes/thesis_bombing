Thus, the difference between the two~estimated production and actual production--would give them a good idea of the effectiveness of strategic bombing. The Chairman’s Office made this point clearly in late January 1945 as the early work of the field teams began to produce data for Division analysis: “To estimate the total economic effect, we have to compare Germany’s total output and available manpower with what they would have been in the absence of our bomber offensive.” As a guide to the field teams conducting data collection, the Chairman’s Office emphasized that “to determine what production would have been in the absence of bombing, we must start out by examining the German plans for production.” It cautioned, however, that “subtracting actual from planned output ...will by no means yield the loss due to bombing.” Yet realizing the German penchant for meticulous record keeping, the Chairman’s Office admitted that ‘The production plans of the Germans still remain the most practical starting point for determining what production would have been //bombardment had not interfered with their production programs.”1 4 Looking ahead to the Pacific phase of the Survey, it would be natural for the Survey to make a counterfactual argument over the AAF’s role in ending the war against Japan.1 3 Speculations on events that might have happened in the past, or predictions of future 1 3  “Standard Operating Procedures for Field Operations of Survey Teams— Area Studies Division,” undated, Box 16, file 300.6, RG 243, NA. 1 4  Office o f the Chairman, “Method and Sources of Data for Overall
