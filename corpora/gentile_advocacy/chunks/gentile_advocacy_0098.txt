And the depression among the population was extraordinary.” Speer stated to Ball that shortly after the raid he informed Hitler that if Germany “underwent 6-8 more such raids on big cities,” they would produce “a huge shock” on armament production and more importantly, on the morale of the German people. According to Ball, Speer predicted that if the Allies had “continued those attacks, knocking Hamburg completely out of the war, German morale... would have suffered a critical blow.”2 4  Ruminating years later on the interrogation, Ball considered Speer’s “insights” on the potential decisiveness of area attacks on morale to be “curious [and] fascinating.”2 5 The implications of Speer’s testimony about Hamburg were in fact quite profound. Military strategist Bernard Brodie argued in a postwar analysis of strategic bombing that “the terrible shock given to the entire German state by the series of extremely heavy attacks directed at Hamburg at the end of July and the beginning of August 1943 suggests what might have happened if attacks of comparable intensity could have been directed also against a substantial number of other German cities at about the same time and in rapid succession.”2 6  But George Ball did not grasp the potential decisiveness of area raids that Speer’s testimony suggested, and Brodie’s analysis stated forthrightly.
