It was also possible that Ball and other Survey analysts did not explore the potential of area attacks on morale (suggested by the Speer testimony) because of their moral uneasiness over killing large numbers of enemy civilians. The Survey knew that their findings would have some affect on the conduct of the AAF’s aerial war against Japanese cities.2 7  Perhaps Ball and some of the others felt that a strong emphasis on the potential decisiveness of area raids— with morale as the objective— might confirm and even increase the AAF’s area raids on Japanese cities.

Galbraith expressed a loathing in his memoirs for the fire raids against Japanese cities and referred to them as “an appalling business.”2 9  One can assume that he felt the same way about the RAF’s area raids against German cities.
