le as an objective probably because it wanted to confirm in the minds of Survey analysts who read the report the AAF’s approach to strategic bombing, which was subtly different from the political purpose for strategic bombing stated in the Casablanca directive.4 5  Survey analysts, however, fully accepted the notion that the purpose of American strategic bombing was to attack the war making capacity of the enemy and they conducted their evaluation with that conception in mind. Ill A troubling tendency in post-1945 writings on strategic bombing in World War II has been the conflation of the term area bombing (or, area attacks, area raids, fire bombing, fire raids) with the term morale bombing (or, terror bombing, terror attacks, morale attacks).
