s casualties from bombing. The focus was always for more narrow: Did the casualties and death disrupt and cut production? Thus, the killing or injuring of children or unemployed older folks, or worker’s unemployed spouses, were only important for their indirect effect on production.3 2 5 0  Overall Effects Division, “Memorandum on the Investigation of the Effects of Strategic Bombing,’’ undated, Box 18, file 300.6, RG 243, NA; Area Studies Division, “Short Statement of Objectives,” 25 February 1945, United States Strategic Bombing Survey, AFHRA, reel #A1154, 2098, EO 11652, frame 820-822. 5 1  Area Studies Division, “Suggested Procedures for Field Operations of Survey Teams,” 18 April 1945, Box 16, file 300.6, RG 243, NA; Office of the Chairman to All Division Directors, “Outline of Final Industry Report, 22 May 1945, Box 13, file 300.6, RG 243, NA. 5 2  The Division did make distinctions between the men, women, and children of the civilian work force.
