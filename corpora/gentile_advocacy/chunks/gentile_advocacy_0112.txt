In his 1986 memoirs, Hansell used Survey conclusions to argue that the AAF’s strategic bombing campaign against Germany had vindicated AWPD-1 ’s choice o f target systems.5 9  The European Survey’s Summary Report , which Hansell cited in his memoirs, argued that attacks against German transportation (inland waterways, and railroad tracks, cars, and marshaling yards) “was the decisive blow that completely disorganized the German economy.”6 0  The Summary Report  went on to state, counterfactually, that if “electric generating plants and substations had been made primary targets...the evidence indicates that their destruction would have had serious effects on Germany’s war production.”6 1 It is interesting to note that neither AWPD-1 nor Hansell’s memoirs addressed the physical damage to targets caused by strategic bombing. Instead, they both focused on the impact that strategic bombing would make, or made, on the critical target systems of the German war economy.
