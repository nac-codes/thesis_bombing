braith’s report placed on the effective use of American strategic bombers to attack German transportation and 85electric power. Equally troubling to Perera was the conclusion that strategic bombing attacks against German air frame and ball bearing production were ineffective in seriously damaging the German war economy. As an original member of the COA, Perera was heavily involved with the selection of strategic targets for the AAF’s air campaign against Germany. Although AWPD-1 had placed German transportation as a primary target for American bombers, Perera and his fellow COA analysts removed it in 8 3  Ibid., 26. 8 4  See my “Advocacy or Assessment?

Instead, the COA had recommended to the AAF that German airframe and ball-bearing production be the primary targets for strategic bombers.8 7  The AAF bombed airframe and ball-bearing factories until shortly after the Normandy invasion and then made German transportation and oil production their primary strategic targets. Galbraith’s analysis (based on other Division findings) implicitly emphasized that the AAF had the most success attacking targets that Perera and 88the COA did not recommend. In his memoirs, Perera repeatedly argues that the failures and successes of strategic bombing during World War II should be interpreted in light of the AAF’s objective  in the European theater: to prepare the way for a ground invasion of the continent, and not the destruction of German industry.
