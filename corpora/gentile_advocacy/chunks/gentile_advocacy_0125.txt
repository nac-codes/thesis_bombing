Judge Cabot’s interest in the Chairman’s final report rested on his desire, as George Ball recalled in a letter to Arthur Schlessinger Jr., “to advocate drafting the survey report as a public relations effort for the birdmen.” Cabot, as the Survey’s Secretariat, Ball charged, “rarely stirred out o f London, and read little of the material turned up by the Survey.” [He] was indubitably a barnacle on the rear end of objectivity.”9 1  Ball asserted that Cabot’s draft report proved to be “wholly inadequate. It was confused, diffuse and technically unacceptable. Its conclusions repeated the conclusions of individuals attached to the Survey who, because of their previous work with the Air Force, had a vested interest in the vindication of certain aspects of the air offensive.”9 2  The “individuals” with “vested” interests, according to Ball, were, among others, Guido Perera who was defending his work with the COA. Air power champion, General Orvil Arson Anderson, wanted the Survey Chairman’s report to endorse the future o f air power as an independent military force.9 3  In an interview conducted by the United States Strategic Air Force (USTAFF) historical section on 22 August 1945, just a few weeks before the controversy of the Chairman’s report, General Anderson emphasized the Survey’s role in shaping the future of the Air 9 0  Guido R.

Paul Baran was much less diplomatic in expressing his contempt for Cabot (and Perera). Baran declared in a letter to Galbraith that: Cabot was an “imbecile,” and Perera “a low-grade S.O.B.” See Baran to Galbraith, 12 October 1949, Box 70, Harvard University File, Galbraith Papers, JFK Library. 9
