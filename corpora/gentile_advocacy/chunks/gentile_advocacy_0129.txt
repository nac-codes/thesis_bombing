The Effects o f Strategic Bombing 99on the German War Economy,  were strikingly similar in their major conclusions about the effectiveness of strategic bombing in the European theater (although the tone of Galbraith’s report tends to be more critical). First, all three reports argue that the German economy was not efficiently run; it never achieved its full war potential, mostly because of poor strategic planning and inept economic management by Adolph Hitler and his staff. Second, attacks on urban areas were not effective in seriously reducing or breaking German war production. Finally, the AAF achieved its most decisive results by attacking German transportation, and should have devoted a greater effort to bombing German electric power.1 0 0 The real difference between Galbraith’s Economic Division report and the other two was that the other two, unlike Galbraith’s, had identical concluding sections commenting on “some signposts” for “the future.” In a frequently quoted passage, the Over-all Report and Summary Report  state in identical words: “The foregoing pages tell of the results achieved by Allied air power, in each of its several roles in the war in Europe. It remains to look at the results as a whole and to seek such signposts as may be of guidance to the future... Allied air power was decisive in the war in Western Europe. Hindsight inevitably suggests that it might have been employed differently or better in some respects. Nevertheless, it was decisive.”1 0 1 9 9  D’OIier determined that the Chairman’s Office, in addition to the Over-all Report,  should produce a shorter version called the Summary Report  that would be printable in newspapers and more easily read by “the man in the street” because of its brevity. Galbraith’s Economic Division report was published under the auspices of the Chairman’s Office because of its eclectic nature in evaluating the strategic bombing’s effects on the German war economy.
