s study in November 1943 to General Arnold. The study noted that area attacks on Japanese cities would cause production loss from “direct damage to industrial facilities and housing [and] the diversion of Japanese industry from its normal activities to the repair and replacement of this damage.” The study cautioned that the potential effectiveness o f incendiary raids required further analysis. It did conclude forthrightly that “incendiary attacks on urban areas will produce great economic loss...but because of the wide diffusion of this loss over many industries it is unlikely that output in any one important category” would substantially reduce the Japanese military’s front line strength. The COA’s sub-committee concluded that precision attacks, rather than incendiary raids, would be more effective in reducing Japan’s critical war industries than incendiary raids.8 But other COA studies emphasized the potential of incendiary raids on Japanese cities. The COA analyzed the effects of the RAF’s area raids against German cities to use in their planning for Japan. One such study, “The Economic Effect of Attacks in Force on German Urban Areas,” admitted that “a straight incendiary attack against congested residential areas in Japanese cities is the method  most frequently considered for the Far 7  Gates to Bush, 11 October 1943, History of the COA, file 118.04-2, AFHRA *  Committee of Operations Analysts, “Economic Effects of Successful Area Attacks on Six Japanese Cities: Summary of Findings and Conclusions,” 1  November 1943, file 118.04-02, AFHRA; “Japanese Small Factories in Relation to Air Bombardment,” undated, file 118.04-02, AFHRA. 107 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
