The COA noted that the “frame- built cities of Japan are highly combustible and can be more readily destroyed than the massive-built cities of Germany.” The Committee’s only question was “how much more readily they” could be destroyed. Their answer was to choose the most effective bombs and “modes” of delivering those bombs.1 0  Another analysis by the Committee provided further information on the potential of fire raids by emphasizing that the “sustaining sources o f Japanese military strength” could best be damaged by strategic bombing operations against air craft production, coke factories, petroleum, radios and radar, ball­ bearings, and “urban industrial areas.” The report argued that “urban industrial areas” as an objective were vulnerable to the area bombing “technique” and night attack.1 1 The COA often drew on the expertise of individuals outside the War Department. For example, upon request, Horatio Bond, the chief engineer of the National Fire Protection Association (International), enthusiastically offered technical assistance to Guido Perera and other members of the COA. Bond sent a letter to Perera in March 1944 explaining his analysis of the susceptibility of certain American industries to fire, with possible 9  Committee of Operations Analysts, “The Economic Effect of Attacks in Force On German Urban Areas, [January 1944], file 118.04-02, AFHRA (italics mine). 1 0  W.W.
