chitect of precision bombing doctrine, Hansell felt that he could effectively attack Japanese war-making capacity using precision bombing methods.2 0 1 8  Joint Target Group, “Japanese Urban Areas: General Analysis,” 26 February 1945, file 142.6606-13, AFHRA. 1 9  Ibid., Joint Target Group, “Monthly Target Intelligence Review,” February 1945, file 142.6603-1, AFHRA. 2 0  Haywood S.

File: --- gentile_advocacy.pdf --- Page 122 --- Due to numerous operational problems and difficult flying weather over Japan, Hansell was never able to achieve much success with precision methods. As a result, General Arnold replaced Hansell on 20 January 1945 with Major General Curtis E. LeMay. In the words of historian Conrad Crane, LeMay was probably “the most innovative air commander o f World War II.” Crane argues that it was LeMay’s operational boldness that led to his decision in March 1945 to switch from precision attacks on specific Japanese industry to fire bombing Japanese cities. This shift was not, according to Crane, a result of pressure placed on LeMay from Arnold in Washington D.C. Instead, LeMay made the change on his own due to a number of factors that made it difficult to fly high altitude precision bombing during the day against the fortress o f Japan, as Hansell had unsuccessfully tried to do.2 1  LeMay’s first major area attack using incendiary bombs occurred on the night of 9 March 1945 against Tokyo. The attack killed at least 70,000 civilians and burned major portions of Tokyo’s industrial and residential sectors. Using the results of LeMay’s fire raids and intelligence on Japanese industry, the JTG put together “target information sheets” that contained data on concentrated industrial areas located in the largest Japanese cities.
