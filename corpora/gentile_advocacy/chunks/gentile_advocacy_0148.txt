The questions reflected the emphasis that the JTG placed on the need for the AAF to destroy the end products of Japanese war industry. The Group’s first question to the Survey was whether “the productive capacity of a modem enemy is the factor which is most likely to be decisive in avoiding defeat.” General Samford of the JTG qualified the question further: “We do refer in this question to the exploitation, that is the productive capacity that is being exploited, and then we treat with sustained war action rather than to bring us back to a specific battle.”2 9  Here Samford was cryptically hinting at the JTG’s belief that the most effective way to prepare for a land invasion of Japan was to destroy its finished war products and not by attacking the basic industries of its war economy.
