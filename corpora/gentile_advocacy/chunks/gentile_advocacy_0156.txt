civilian population’s morale or the political will to resist. The European Survey’s Summary Report  argued that “Allied air power was decisive in the war in Western Europe. Hindsight inevitably suggests that it might have been employed differently or better in some respects. Nevertheless it was decisive.”4 5  But that published report never defined the word “decisive.” Implicit in the Survey’s use of the word “decisive,” of course, was the notion that something was decided. But who were the agents of that decision? The European Summary Report  did not argue that strategic 4 3  There were three other meetings held between the Survey and the JTG on 12, 13, and 15 June. Apparently no transcripts exist for these meetings. It was possible, therefore, for morale to have been the center of discussion at the meetings. But this was unlikely. In their memoirs, both Ball and Nitze discuss the series of June meetings and point out that there were disagreements between the Survey and the JTG over the best way to destroy Japanese war-making capacity, but they do not claim there was a discussion— or dispute— on morale. Late in the afternoon on the day of the last meeting, D’Olier, Ball, and Anderson had a phone conversation with Cabot in London. A good part of the conversation was over providing information to the Directors in Washington D.C. to assist them in their meetings. The information requested was on transportation, coke production, and electric power. If morale was the primary point o f disagreement between the Survey and the JTG during the 12, 13 and 15 June meetings, one would have expected the phone conversation on 15 June to address morale, but it did not. 4 4  JTG/USSBS Conference, 25. 4 5  USSBS, Chairman’s Office, Summary Report (European War),  15-16. 123 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
