an “alternate strategy for the air attack on Japan.’07 It is unclear why Nitze got the job over the other Survey Directors. Nitze’s demonstrated analytical acumen in the June meetings with the JTG must have helped. Certainly Alexander or Ball, or for that matter Galbraith, were all qualified, based on their European experience, to write an alternate plan for the strategic bombardment of Japan. Galbraith does not mention in his memoirs the Survey’s alternate bombardment plan. But he does provide a glimpse of the personality of Paul Nitze and a possible explanation as to why Nitze was given the job. Galbraith recalled that Nitze was a “self possessed man, [who] devoted the rest of his life to studying the theory and 58practice of aerial destruction, emerging in the end as a devout practitioner of the art.” Nitze recalled in his memoirs that he wrote the alternate plan over the fourth of July weekend while vacationing at a Long Island beach with family and friends. He claimed that since Japan was isolated due to the American naval blockade around the home islands, “the only means of transportation were the rail network and intercoastal shipping...” Nitze reasoned, therefore, that a “concentrated air attack on the essential lines of transportation and...the Kammon tunnels would isolate the Japanese home islands from one another and fragment the enemy’s base of operations.” Nitze said that he believed the “interdiction of the lines of transportation would be sufficiently effective so that additional bombing of urban industrial areas would not be necessary.”3 9 5 7  Nitze, From Hiroshima to Glasnost,  36. 5 8  Galbraith, A Life In Our Times,  233. 5 9  Nitze, From Hiroshima to Glasnost,  36-37. 129 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
