File: --- gentile_advocacy.pdf --- Page 139 --- The actual plan that Nitze wrote for the Survey in July 1945 called for top priority to be given to precision bombing attacks on Japanese transportation and “an increased emphasis on the [naval] blockade of the Japanese home islands.” Next in priority would be a “concentrated attack in a short period of time” on Japanese central ammunition reserves. But the AAF should attack ammunition reserves, according to the plan, only if it had confirmed intelligence that these reserves were centralized at a few locations and that “a significant portion o f them” could be destroyed. Following the attack on ammunition, the plan called for the AAF to bomb electric power and nitrogen production plants that they had not already destroyed by either “precision bombing attacks or by urban industrial concentration attacks.” Nitze also recommended in 1945 that the AAF bomb rice production in Japan with chemicals, thereby starving the people and eliminating any “hope of long term resistance.”6 0 Nitze gave a low priority to area attacks on industries in Japanese cities. The plan did not, however, omit this method of bombing, as Nitze implicitly suggested in his memoirs. Instead the plan recommended that the AAF bomb “urban industrial concentrations only insofar as operating considerations make it probable that there is a relatively small chance of hitting any of the precision targets listed above, selected as priority targets, or make it probable that the most efficient method of destroying such precision targets is by area rather than precision attack.”6 1 6 0  Draft o f Japanese Targets [July 1945], Box 27, file 319.1, RG 243 NA; “Review of Information Concerning Japanese Gasoline and Synthetic Nitrogen,” 2 July 1945, Box 27, file 319.1, RG 243, NA.
