atomic bombs force Japan to surrender unconditionally? If the atomic bombs had not been dropped, could the Survey’s alternate bombing plan (providing Spaatz had implemented it) have ended the war without a land invasion? After submitting their plan to General Spaatz, Franklin D’Olier and Paul Nitze returned to London in late July to complete their work on the European portion of the Survey. On 7 August, the day after Hiroshima, D’Olier telephoned Fred Searls in Washington D.C. and commented on their excitement “about this new bomb.” D’Olier then queried: “What effect, if any, do you think it is going to have on the Bombing Survey?” Searls gave no answer to D’Olier.7 7  But the Chairman and his Directors were aware, even before President Truman would issue a formal request on 15 August for the Survey to continue its work in the Pacific, that they would be evaluating the effects of 78strategic bombing on Japan. 7 6  Crane, Bombs, Cities, and Civilians , 139. 7 7  Record of Telephone Conference, 7 August 1945, Box 22, file 311.3, RG 243, NA. 7 8  D’Olier to Alexander, 14 July 1945, Box 41, file 383.8, RG 243, NA. 135 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Nitze recalled after Fred Searls had informed him about the atomic bomb in July 1945, that they both “concluded that even without the atomic bomb, Japan was likely to surrender in a matter of months. My own view was that Japan would capitulate by November 1945.”7 9  Nitze’s thinking in July 1945 undoubtedly shaped the counterfactual statement he would write in the Pacific Survey’s Summary Report  about seven months later concerning the end of the war with Japan. That report stated: “...certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all proba
