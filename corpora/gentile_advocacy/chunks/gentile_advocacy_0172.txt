he would write in the Pacific Survey’s Summary Report  about seven months later concerning the end of the war with Japan. That report stated: “...certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1  November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not o nentered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.” Counterfactual speculation, though, was nothing new for Paul Nitze or his fellow Survey analysts. 7 9  Nitze, From Hiroshima to Glasnost,  37. 8 0  USSBS, Chairman’s Office, Summary Report (Pacific War),  (USGPO: Washington, D.C., 1946), 26. 136 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Nitze, April 1946 After spending three months in Japan from October to December 1945 evaluating the effects of strategic bombing on Japan’s wartime economy and its political decision to surrender, Paul Nitze briefed members of the Senate Committee on Atomic Energy about the Survey’s findings from the Pacific. He told the Senators that by the closing months o f the Pacific war, “Japan was already defeated by air power, and that the major influence of the atomic bomb was that it made an invasion unnecessary.” But this was not the conclusion about Japan’s surrender that Nitze would publish six months later in the Pacific Survey’s Summary Report.  Anticipating the writing of what would become the Pacific Survey’s early surrender counterfactual, Nitze revised the conclusion he had presented to the Senators. Japan, argued Nitze, “would have surrendered prior to November 1  in any case; the atomic bomb merely accelerated the date at which Japan surrendered.”1  This striking remark made
