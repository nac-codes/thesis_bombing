economies of Japanese cities.9  Emphasizing the importance placed on the interrogations of Japanese leaders, Galbraith lectured Survey analysts in October to show more patience “with each interrogation to be sure that complete information is secured on any important points...”1 0 The data collection portion of the Pacific Survey went much faster than in Europe. Instead of taking almost eight months to collect information on the effects of strategic bombing, as was the case in Germany, the Pacific Survey did it in about three months. The intensive data collection began in early October and ended when most of the Survey departed Japan on the navy ship, USS Ancon, in mid-December, 1945.1 1  There were three primary reasons for the speed of data collection: 1) The experience gained from Europe made Survey analysts in the Pacific much more efficient in collecting and processing information; 2) since  the preponderance of data in the Pacific Survey was made up of interrogations and questionnaires, analysts did not have to spend as much time interpreting voluminous production and statistical records; 3) unlike Europe, Pacific Survey analysts could move about freely from the very start of their evaluation due to the American occupation of the Japanese home islands.
