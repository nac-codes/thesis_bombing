He listened to Survey Director Frank MacNamee, who had just arrived in Tokyo from Washington D.C., boast about how well the American press had received the Survey’s European reports. MacNamee told D’Olier and the other Survey Directors that the reception o f the Survey’s reports had “been so tremendous that 8000 additional copies of the summary [report] and 3500 additional copies o f the overall report have been published.”1 3  D’Olier and Nitze were certainly hoping that the published reports produced by the Pacific Survey would draw the same kind of favorable response.
