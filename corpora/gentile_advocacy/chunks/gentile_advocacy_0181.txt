al security.”2 2 In the immediate months following the end of World War II in the Pacific, American military leaders did their best to point out that victory over Japan was a team effort and that no single service had “won the war.” Lieutenant General James A. Doolittle, who had commanded the Eighth Air Force in Europe and during the closing weeks of the war in the Pacific, told members of his command that World War II in the Pacific was “won by teamwork between Land - Sea and Air...No single individual, arm, [or] service won the war.

Looking ahead, he envisioned the defense organization of the United States consisting of a “modem air-arm composed of long range bombers, long range fighters, and long range air transports backed  by an adequate Navy and Ground Force...”24 Naval officers, however, did not want to play “back seat” to the airmen and their concept for the American postwar military establishment.2 5 2 2  R.A.
