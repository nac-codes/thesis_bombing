Ill But how would the atomic bomb fit into such an independent air force?

While the report’s concluding remarks did suggest that atomic weapons would be a decisive factor in America’s postwar defense establishment, the report also argued that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were indecisive in forcing Japan to surrender.4 3  Nitze, according to his biographer Strobe Talbott, wanted to de-mystify the power of the bomb and force America to view it not as the “absolute weapon” but as a simply more powerful weapon of war.4 4 Paul Nitze recalled in his memoirs that he had believed in July 1945 that Japan would surrender, “even without the atomic bomb.”4 5  While in Japan, Nitze and his Survey 4 2  USSBS, Chairman’s Office, Summary Report (Pacific War),  26; and Anderson to Secretary of War and Commanding General, Army Air Forces, 11 July 1946, “Summary Report, United States Strategic Bombing Survey,” 1 1  July 1946. 4 3  USSBS, Chairman’s Office, Summar
