Yet as historian Barton Bernstein has demonstrated, the bulk of those interrogations provided only very tenuous support to the counterfactual conclusion that Japan “certainly” would have surrendered before 31 December 1945, “and in all probability prior to 1  November 1945,” without the atomic bombs or Russian war declaration. Bernstein points out that it was natural for Nitze to begin his analysis with a hypothesis concerning the effects of the atomic bombs on ending the war with Japan.4 6  Yet Nitze remained committed to that notion even when the evidence— the interrogations of Japanese officials—  did not reasonably support his conclusions. Consider for example the Survey’s interrogation of Prince Fumimaro Konoye, former Japanese Premier and influential advisor to the Emperor and to other key leaders, on 9 November 1945. The principal interrogators were Nitze, D’Olier, Galbraith, and Paul Baran.
