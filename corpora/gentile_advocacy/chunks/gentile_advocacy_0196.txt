Beveridge went on to note that the Survey’s recommendations concerning the postwar defense establishment brought about the fiercest debates among Survey analysts.5 3 In fact, Survey members seemed to have formed a consensus around Nitze’s early- surrender counterfactual over the role of the atomic bomb in ending the war against Japan. Navy officers like Ofstie could accept the early surrender counterfactual because it allowed them to claim that the decisive factor in producing victory in the Pacific was the Navy’s blockade around the Japanese home islands. The AAF, conversely, by citing the counterfactual, could claim that LeMay’s fire-bombing of Japanese cities ultimately brought about unconditional surrender, not the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or the Russian declaration of war. For the hundreds of other Survey analysts, both civilian and military, Nitze’s counterfactual fit neatly into their conceptual understanding of strategic bombing. They believed that the purpose of strategic bombing was to destroy the enemy’s war-making capacity.5 4  Since their analysis of the Pacific 5 3  Beveridge, History o f the United States Strategic Bombing Survey , frames 980-982. 5 4  For examples of this type of thinking among Pacific Survey analysts see.
