But a June 1946 analysis produced under the direction of General Leslie Groves, military commander of the Manhattan Engineer District which built the bomb, disagreed. General Groves’s report, “The Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” argued that “the atomic bomb did not alone win the war against Japan, but it most certainly ended it, saving the thousands of Allied lives that would have been lost in any combat invasion of Japan.”5 3  The Survey’s Secretariat, Walter Wilds, told Presidential Assistant Edwin Locke, (the White House action officer responsible to the President for reviewing the Survey’s Pacific reports) that the Survey believed the Groves report “should not be made public at this time.” Wilds informed Locke of attempts on the Survey’s part to “reduce conflicts” between the two reports by providing General Groves with Survey “data.” Wilds believed that the simultaneous release of the Survey’s Summary Report and the Groves report would “promote public confusion.”3 6  The potential “public confusion” that concerned Wilds was most likely tied to the contradiction between the two reports over the role of the atomic bomb in “ending” the war against Japan.
