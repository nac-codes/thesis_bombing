Report’ s  conclusion challenged President Truman remarks that Japan would not have surrendered soon if the United States had not used the bomb.6 4 Not only did The Summary Report’ s  surrender counterfactual contradict official explanations of the use of the atomic bomb, it implicitly contradicted some of the other conclusions brought out in the Summary Report  itself and other published reports from the Pacific Survey. The Summary Report , though acknowledging that the war against Japanese shipping was an important factor in destroying Japan’s war economy, argued that the decisive factor in persuading the Japanese leaders to surrender was the conventional strategic bombing of the home islands.6 5  But two reports— the Economic Division’s The Effects o f Strategic Bombing on Japan's War Economy  and the Transportation Division’s The War Against Japanese Transportation— subtly differed from the Summary Report's  argument. In the view of these two division studies, the anti-shipping campaign had virtually destroyed Japan’s economy prior to the main weight of the AAF’s bombing campaign, and therefore these two publications, unlike the Summary Report , stress the decisive role of anti-shipping in Japan’s ultimate defeat.6 6 6 4  Barton J.
