The Pacific Survey’s analysis of urban-area attacks had to wrestle with the fact that, unlike the European theater, seventy percent of the AAF’s campaign were area attacks against Japanese cities. The Effects of Air Attack on Japanese Urban Economy  credits the A A f’s area attacks for causing great damage to the urban work force and social structure. According to the report, absenteeism of workers, directly caused by air raids, turned an already critical situation into one of complete desperation. The air raids also caused widespread destruction and deprivation not only in the cities but throughout the Japanese 68homeland. But when it comes to assessing the effectiveness of
