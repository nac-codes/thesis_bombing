aviation played a critical role in forcing Japan to surrender unconditionally, and if a land invasion of Kyushu had been necessary, carrier aviation would have played a decisive role in that operation as well.6  He used evidence from the Strategic Bombing Survey to support his description of the war and the Navy’s role in winning it. The Survey, argued Admiral Ramsey, would “set forth in the record...that the Navy has measured up to the confidence reposed in it by the American people in spelling doom for the Japanese dreams of conquest long before the first atomic bomb descended on Hiroshima.”7 General Spaatz also appeared before the committee to provide his opinions on unification. In his testimony he used key passages from the Survey as justification for the Air Force’s postwar plans for air power. An often used passage from the European Survey’s Summary Report  states that “Allied air power was decisive in the war in western Europe.”8  General Spaatz quoted this passage to committee members when explaining the crucial role the AAF played in producing victory in the war in Europe. But unlike Admiral Ramsey who dwelled extensively on wartime accomplishments, General Spaatz quickly moved the discussion toward the future role of airpower: The plain fact is that coasts and seas no longer have their old significance for defense. Distance has been telescoped...In the air power age the Air Force is vitally concerned with the development of jet propulsion, supersonic speeds, guided missiles; not to speak of the potentials of harnessed atomic energy. The Air Force should be free from control by interests which may be influenced more by things of the past or present than by ideas for, and of, the future. 6  Statement of Vice Admiral Dewitt C.
