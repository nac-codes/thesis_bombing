Even after five or six years of further development and production of atomic weapons, according to Vandenberg, there was “only the bare possibility of winning the war [against the Soviets] by forcing capitulation,” if the United States relied heavily on atomic 2 6  Transcript of “Discussion Following Air Force Presentation to the Combat Aviation Subcommittee, Congressional Aviation Policy Board, Room 4e-870, the Pentagon, 21 January 1948,” (hereafter referred to as Air Policy Discussions), Box 12, RG 341, NA, 1-2. 184 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The airmen had therefore looked at the atomic bomb “from the standpoint of an additional weapon” to support a conventional bombing campaign against the Soviet Union.2 7 Simply put, conventional strategic bombing required many, many very heavy bombers that justified the Air Force’s seventy-group program. Heavy reliance on the atomic bomb would have logically called into question the great number of air planes that the airmen were asking Congress to buy. General Spaatz acknowledged that “200 plane loads” of 28conventional bombs would “accomplish the same result” as one atomic bomb attack. For the airmen and their seventy-group program,
