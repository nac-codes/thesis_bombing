Since the Air Force’s long range bombers would have to fly great distances to reach critical targets within the Soviet Union, Navy officers believed that the Air Force’s accuracy and probability in delivering the bombs would be quite low. The atomic bomb, claimed Admiral Ofstie in a speech to the Aviation Writers Association in 1948, was “of no use unless it [could] be delivered to the right spot. To my mind this, the delivery of the ‘A’  bomb, should be and probably is a major consideration today in the war plans of the Air Force and of Naval aviation.”3 6 The Navy did not disagree in principle with the American conceptual approach to strategic bombing— the use of strategic air power to attack the war making capacity of the enemy. But the Navy did want to be able to participate in strategic bombing operations in a potential war with the Soviet Union. Claiming a role to play in strategic bombing operations would give the Navy leverage in the inter-service “war” with the Air Force over defense dollars.
