But the postwar plans for a war against the Soviet Union, the Harmon Report, and the Strategic Bombing Survey Reports shared a common conception of using strategic air power to attack the enemy’s war-making capacity. In the American conception, therefore, directly attacking the enemy’s will to resist would be a target that was too ambiguous to plan for and evaluate. V The Joint Chiefs of Staff seemed to have formed a consensus over the approach to war fighting that was manifested in the series of war plans produced between 1945 and 1950.
