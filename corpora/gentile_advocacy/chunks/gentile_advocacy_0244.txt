eement between especially the Navy and the Air Force was not over the American conceptual approach to strategic bombing, which both considered “sound,” but the methods that the military would use to carry out strategic bombing operations in case of war with the Soviet Union. The Navy, for example, placed much importance on the need to acquire advanced overseas bases for the Air Force to launch its bombing operations against the Soviets. In order to acquire and support those bases, especially in the Mediterranean, the Navy would have to command the sea lines of communications. The Navy also believed that its carrier based aircraft could successfully launch strategic bombing operations against Russia’s “military machine.’02 The Air Force, conversely, argued that the B-36 strategic bomber, based in the United States, was the most effective weapon system for carrying out a strategic bombing campaign against the “industrial heart” of the Soviet Union. The need to control sea lanes, which were so important for the Navy, became less important for the Air Force.3 3 5 1  Bradley to Vinson, 18 July 1949, and, Denfield to Chairman, 18 July 1949, Box 42, Vandenberg Papers, Library o f Congress; “Agenda of B-36 Investigation,” 9 June 1949, Box 42, Vandenberg Papers, Library of Congress; Barlow, Revolt o f the Admirals,  218. 5 2  See for example, Memo from Ofstie to OP-05, “Naval Concept of Modem War,” 10 March 1949, Box 8, Ofstie Papers, Naval Historical Center, and, “Memorandum by the Chief of Naval Operations,” [undated], Box 9, Symington Papers, Truman Library; and Memo for Editors of Navy Publications in Washington Area, “Monthly Basic Article,” 23 March 1949, Box 11, Papers o f John L.
