He pointed to data collected by the Survey showing how the effects of radiation and flash bums greatly diminished beyond 6500 feet from ground zero.6 1  But quoting this statistic from the above report downplays the destructive power of the atomic bombs that another report from the Pacific Survey, Effects o f the Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,  makes abundantly clear.6 2 Appearing shortly after Commander Tatom, Stuart Symington echoed General Vandenberg’s earlier concern to Committee members about certain individuals using excerpts from the Survey to discredit strategic bombing.
