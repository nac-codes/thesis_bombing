But the article concluded that certain methods o f bombing during World War II were quite effective. Bombing German transportation during World War II, according to “The Strategic Bombing Myth,” proved to be a “decisive factor in the collapse of the Germany Army.”6 4 Symington correctly pointed out in his testimony to the Congressmen that “The Strategic Bombing Myth” rested in large part on highly selected portions o f the Strategic Bombing Survey. He presented to the Committee a letter written by former Survey Chairman Franklin D’Olier that argued that the “Strategic Bombing Myth” grossly misstated the major conclusions of the Survey.6 5  Explicitly, the Secretary sought to attack the credibility o f the article, but he had ulterior motives as well. The naval officers who appeared prior to Secretary Symington had relied largely on the Survey to attack Air Force methods of strategic air warfare. By attacking the use of the Survey in extreme form (“The Strategic Bombing Myth” and the Tatom testimony) Secretary Symington hoped to place doubt in the minds of committee members about the Navy’s use of the Survey in preceding and subsequent testimony. 6 4  [Author Unknown], “The Strategic Bombing Myth,” [Summer 1949], Box 6, Symingto
