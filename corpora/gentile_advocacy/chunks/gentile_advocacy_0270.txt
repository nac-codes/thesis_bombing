stead, Brodie saw the next major war being fought primarily, and decisively, with atomic bombs.1 Partly because Brodie believed that atomic weapons had changed the way wars in the future would be fought, he was judicious and cautious in using the Survey to support his theories. For Brodie, if there was any meaningful continuity between strategic bombing in World War II and future atomic war, it had to be analyzed rigorously for the development of atomic strategy. The Survey’s numerous reports on the successes and failures of bombing various targets in World War II did, however, emphasize to Brodie the crucial importance of 1  Brodie, The Absolute Weapon,  23-27, 71, 83. 216 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Brodie stressed that planning for a potential nuclear war had to be based on a thorough, contemporary analysis of all relevant factors for a particular enemy. In 1952, while serving as a special Air Force advisor, Brodie criticized the Air Targets Division for basing postwar target selection in the Soviet Union on a Survey conclusion that German electrical power facilities were vulnerable to bombing and, if attacked, would have had a crippling effect on the economy.3  While electrical facilities might have been the right targets in the war against Germany, he questioned whether they were necessarily the correct targets for a nuclear war with the Soviets.4 Perhaps the antithesis of Brodie when it came to defining and applying the lessons of World War II was P.M.S.
