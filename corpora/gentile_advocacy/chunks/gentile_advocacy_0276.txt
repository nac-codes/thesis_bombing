ccording to D’Olier, tactical bombing took off the arms and legs of the “cow,” but strategic bombing destroyed the whole “cow,” arms and legs and all.1 3 1 1  Barton J.

In 1946-47, that conclusion did not seem threatening to air power, to the sense of U.S. history, or to the military services. The Strategic Bombing Survey would continue to influence thinking about strategic bombing and military strategy beyond the immediate post-World War II years. For example, Gar Alperovitz, in his 1964 book Atomic Diplomacy,  challenged Stimson’s official explanation of the A-bomb. Using Paul Nitze’s Pacific Survey counterfactual as evidence, Alperovitz argued that President Truman used the bomb not to end the war, because he knew that Japan would soon surrender, but to intimidate the Soviet Union.1 4 In the early 1970s, journalists like David Halberstam and I.F.
