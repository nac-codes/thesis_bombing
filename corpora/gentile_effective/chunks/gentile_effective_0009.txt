Union, 2seemed flawed to me at an intuitive level. Moreover, the Survey’s counterfactualconclusion stating that Japan would have surrendered, even with-out the atomic bomb, “certainly prior to 31December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1November 1945,” 3also seemed incorrect. Such a sweeping conclusion—the atomic bomb was unnecessary inforcing Japan to surrender—struck me as missing the critical rolethe threat of a land invasion may have played in Japan’s uncondi-tional surrender. The other writing, arguing that the United Statesdropped the bomb on Japan primarily to end the war quickly andsave American lives, and, as a secondary purpose, to intimidate theSoviet Union, 4was a more reasonable explanation to me of Amer- ica’s combat use of the atomic bomb. I then began to look at many of the other published Survey re- ports from Europe and the Pacific to see if they lent support to thecounterfactual conclusion concerning Japan’s surrender. I discov-ered that the Survey reports were not a single set of unified analysesand arguments, systematically grounded in data, but, rather, a looseamalgam of studies, sometimes prepared more to shape the futureintroduction 3 Gentile, Gian P..

I also came to realize that the conclusions brought out in Survey reports were informed by a common concep-tion of strategic air power. That common conception became espe-cially clear to me after reading through the American plans for waragainst the Soviet Union written from 1945 to 1950.
