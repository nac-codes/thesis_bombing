ading through the American plans for waragainst the Soviet Union written from 1945 to 1950. The World War II United States Strategic Bombing Survey con- tains conclusions that have influenced scholars, strategists, andjournalists since its reports were first published in the two years fol-lowing the end of World War II. Analysts like Bernard Brodie and P.M. S. Blackett used the Survey’s conclusions and evidence to sup-port their ideas on nuclear strategy and postwar defense policy andorganization. The Survey’s findings also played a role in the post-war debate over President Truman’s decision to drop the atomicbombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Beginning with Karl Compton,Henry L. Stimson, Hanson Baldwin, and continuing up through atleast Herbert Feis and Gar Alperovitz and beyond, writers haveused portions of the Survey to support their position in the debateover the 1945 combat use of the bomb. Further, USSBS reports have supported various positions over President Richard Nixon’s bomb-ing of North Vietnam, and, much more recently, the application ofAmerican air power in the Gulf War and Kosovo. Because a presidential directive established the Survey and gave it an ofﬁcial status, and because the Survey was headed by civilians, os-tensibly making it impartial, the Survey reports have taken on theaura of a document that contains the truth about strategic bombing inWorld War II. In fact, the Survey is a secondary source that interprets the past: yet analysts and pundits who have used the Survey in theirpostwar writings have instead tended to treat it as a primary source.In criticizing such views, retired Air Force General Haywood Hansellonce cynically compared the Strategic Bombing Survey to the“Bible.” 5Yet as Clarence Darrow forced William Jennings Bryan to acknowledge in the famous 1925 Scopes trial, the Bible was only one of many truths that purported to explain the origins of man. And theSurvey contains the truth about the effects of strategic bombingintroduction
