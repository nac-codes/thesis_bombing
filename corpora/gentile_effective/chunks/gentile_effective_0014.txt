For example, Survey analysts be-lieved that the effects of strategic bombing on the morale of theGerman people were important only insofar as lowered morale mayhave reduced the productive capacity of the German industriallabor force. Moreover, many of the European Survey’s published re-ports argued that American air power was “decisive” against Ger-many because it destroyed transportation facilities, which were“vital elements” that linked together many important industries inGermany’s wartime economy. Generals Carl A. Spaatz and Orvil Anderson believed that the European Survey’s published reports confirmed the correctness ofthe American conceptual approach to strategic bombing. Thosepublished reports would help them fight the future battle of airforce independence. Within the American conception, though, disagreements did occur over the most effective methods for strategic bombers to use when at-tacking the enemy’s war-making capacity. Recommending a strategicbombing plan for the air campaign against Japan, Survey DirectorPaul Nitze concluded, based on his studies in Europe, that the bestmethod would be precise attacks against Japanese transportation andelectrical power facilities (precision bombing). Other AAF targetingagencies, however, believed that a more effective method would be tobomb large areas of Japanese cities using incendiary weapons (areabombing). The objectives of both these bombing methods could havebeen either to lower morale by killing Japanese civilians or to destroyJapanese
