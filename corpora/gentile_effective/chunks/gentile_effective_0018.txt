I confess I don’tknow what morale is. carl becker, 1943 In his 1921 book The Command of the Air, Italian air power theorist Guilio Douhet argued that once strategic bombers had achieved command of the air, they could quickly force an enemy into submission by dropping bombs on keytargets in its cities. 1But he only loosely defined those targets, and he never explained how to select them. Indeed, Douhet went on tostate that it would be impossible to determine enemy targets in aer-ial warfare systematically because the choice would “depend on anumber of circumstances, material, moral, and psychological, theimportance of which, though real, is not easily estimated.

Douhet challenged conventional military thought on warfare in the 1920s by claiming that the nation that owned an air force pre- dominantly of strategic bombers could avoid costly naval andground engagements by attacking the “vital centers” of enemycities, thereby creating terror among the civilian population.
