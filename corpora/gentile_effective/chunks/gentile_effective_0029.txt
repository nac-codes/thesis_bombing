—of this industrialmachine by the destruction of some vital link or links in the chainthat ties it together, constitut[ing] one of the primary, basic objec-tives of an air force—in fact, it is the opinion of the School that thisis the maximum contribution of which an air force is capable to-wards the attainment of the ultimate aim in war.” 25The dominant theme of the American theory of air power was not to attack civil-ians directly but to separate the enemy population from the sourcesof production by attacking their war-making capacity. 26 Based on a study of the American industrial system, ACTS in- structor Major Haywood Hansell, who a few years later would as-sist in writing the plan for the American air war against Germany,determined that the “vital links” common to the United States andmost other industrialized nations were, “in order of importance,”electric power, rail transportation, fuel, steel, and armament andmunitions factories. Muir Fairchild concluded that if an enemyequipped with strategic bombers were to attack electrical power fa-cilities in major American cities, for example, the will to resist ofthe Americans living in those cities would almost assuredly be bro-ken because their links to the sources of goods and productionwould have been severed. 27 But once this set of general objectives was established, determining target priority, their location in enemy countries, their protection, andassessment of the damage inﬂicted required a level of expertise thatairmen did not posses. Hansell stated that these problems “were be-yond the competence of the Tactical School. Strategic air intelligenceon major world powers would demand an intelligence organizationand analytical competence of considerable scope and complexity.” 28 Muir Fairchild realized that his own analysis of the American indus-trial system was somewhat “amateurish” and that target selection andassessment of “vital links” in the enemy’s industrial structure calledfor analysis by “the economi
