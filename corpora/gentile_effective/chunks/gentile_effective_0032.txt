AAF’s portion of “the overall production re-quirements required to defeat our potential enemies.” 32In order to determine production requirements the AAF needed to develop an airstrategic concept. The result after nine days of intense, demandingwork by the four men was Air War Plans Division/ 1. 33 AWPD/1, as it became known, posited that a massive strategic air offensive attacking German war-making capacity might make an in-vasion of the European continent unnecessary by forcing Germany tosurrender early. At a minimum, argued the planners, the air offensivewould weaken German war-making capacity to a point that wouldallow for a successful land invasion, if that became necessary. 34 The plan called for a massive strategic bombing offensive against “German military power” that would attack what it determined tobe an already weakened social and economic structure: [Destruction] of that structure will virtually break down the capacity of the German nation to wage war. The basic conception on whichthis plan is based lies in the application of air power for the break-down of the industrial and economic structure of Germany. This con-ception involves the selection of a system of objectives vital to contin-ued German war effort, and to the means of livelihood of the Ger-man people, and tenaciously concentrating all bombing towarddestruction of those objectives. The specific target systems to attack within the German indus- trial and economic structure would be, in order of priority: electri- cal power; transportation; oil and petroleum production; and theundermining of morale by air attack. 35Just as enemy morale in the ACTS lectures of the late 1930s was seen as a potential target to at- tack, so too was it a potential target in AWPD/ 1. Yet after the plan- ners acknowledged it in the plan as a possible target, morale re-the origins of the american conceptual approach 20 Gentile, Gian P..
