Indeed, AWPD/ 1bore striking similarity to Muir Fairchild’s ACTS lecture on the “National Economic Struc- ture,” with the emphasis on attacking “vital links” in the war-mak-ing capacity of the enemy. Once under way in 1945, the Strategic Bombing Survey would continue to emphasize, through its evalua-tion, the use of strategic bombers to attack war-making capacitywhile downplaying its effect on morale. The authors of AWPD/ 1acknowledged that the strategic concept brought out in the plan and the estimates derived from that conceptrequired “continuing study” and refinement. 36They pointed out to Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall that even thoughtarget selection might need adjustment based on further evaluation,the overall conceptual approach would not “result in any apprecia-ble change.” 37In August 1942, one year after the submission of AWPD/1 , air planners produced AWPD/ 42, “Requirements for Air Ascendancy.” AWPD/42 added to the older list of objectives the de- struction of German submarine construction and the depletion ofthe German air force, but maintained the same conceptual base asthe earlier plan. As Haywood Hansell later noted about AWPD/ 42, the primary strategic purpose was still to use strategic bombing todestroy “the capability and will of Germany to wage war.” Thiswould be accomplished, according to Hansell, by “destroying thewar-supporting industries and economic systems upon which thewar-sustaining and political economy depend
