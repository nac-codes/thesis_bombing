When writing his book MacIsaac apparently was not aware that in January 1944, just a few months before the bureaucratic wheels would start to turn es-tablishing the Survey, General Arnold received an analysis by CarlBecker and other distinguished historians that examined the sameproblems the Survey would later address. Yet the report by theCommittee of Historians was brushed into the dustbin of the pastbecause it contained just what MacIsaac later argued the Surveyneeded: “The presence of a questioning and persuasive historian[who would] have had the effect of bringing into better balance thecollection and interpretation of evidence . . . [who was] never verysure that he [could] discern the complicated relationships betweencause and effect. . . .” 74In short, the historian would have recog- nized the existence of imponderables in evidence and analysis, asdid Carl Becker and his fellow members on the committee.
