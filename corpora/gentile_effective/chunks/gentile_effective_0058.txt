For the Americans, a joint U.S./British survey would end up asa “mark of self-justification” for Britain’s own bombing methodsand target selection. 17 The notion of comparing the effects of RAF area bombing and American precision bombing permeated the early correspondencebetween air officers considering the objectives for the Survey.

The reason, according toGeneral Spaatz, was obvious: “The whole pu
