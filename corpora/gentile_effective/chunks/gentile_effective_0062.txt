The airmen certainly recognized the possibility that a Survey evaluation could be very critical of the AAF’s strategic bombing ef-forts against Germany. To the airmen, the prize that the Surveywould produce for them would be justification, in the form of Sur-vey evidence, for a postwar independent air force. The airmen,therefore, did not want the Survey to answer the question ofwhether or not there should be an independent air force. As a re-sult, they left alone the “more ambitious undertaking” of question-ing the relevance of air power to national strategy and focused in-stead on strategic bombing’s effectiveness. Moreover, the airmenthe united states strategic bombing survey 41 Gentile, Gian P.. How Effective Is Strategic Bombing? : Lessons Learned from World War II to Kosovo, New York University Press, 2000.

That is why in so manyof the letters, memorandums, and directives establishing the Survey,the airmen often noted that the Survey would bring out “the accom-plishments and potentialities of Air Power as an independent instru-ment of military strategy.” 28The Survey would do this by evaluat- ing the
