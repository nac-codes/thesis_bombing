After the experience thatGeneral Arnold and Edward Mead Earle had had with the Commit-tee of Historians in late 1943, it was no wonder that historians were not considered for positions on the Survey’s staff (except forthe Survey’s chronicler, Major James Beveridge).

Perera also madesuggestions to D’Olier for the division heads. Most of the men thatthe united states strategic bombing survey 47 Gentile, Gian P..
