Fairchild explained that he agreedwith the two men’s plan for the conduct of the Survey. He consid-ered their plan to be “excellent” because it demonstrated a lot ofcareful thought on their part toward solving the problems that wereconfronting the Survey. In fact, the general was so pleased withNitze and Alexander’s plan for the Survey that he had “very little inthe way of constructive suggestions to offer.” Fairchild found littleto criticize because Nitze and Alexander had built on the plan theAAF had established prior to November 1944 when the civilian heads joined the Survey. Like the organization “on paper,” Nitzeand Alexander’s Survey would consist of a number of divisions thatwould analyze the effects of strategic bombing on certain war-timeindustries and the overall economy and morale, and would deter-mine the value of area versus precision bombing. General Fairchildconfirmed that the critical objective of the Survey would be to eval-uate the effects of strategic bombing on “industrial structures inthe united states strategic bombing survey 51 Gentile, Gian P..
