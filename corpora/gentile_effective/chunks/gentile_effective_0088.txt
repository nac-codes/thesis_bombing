shortly after the raid he in-formed Hitler that if Germany “underwent 6–8more such raids on big cities,” they would produce “a huge shock” on armament pro-duction and, more important, on the morale of the German peo-ple. 23According to Ball, Speer said that if the Allies had “continued those attacks, knocking Hamburg completely out of the war, Ger-man morale . . . would have suffered a critical blow.” 24Ruminating years later on the interrogation, Ball considered Speer’s “insights”on the potential decisiveness of area attacks on morale to be “curi-ous [and] fascinating.” 25 The implications of Speer’s testimony about Hamburg were in fact quite profound. Military strategist Bernard Brodie argued in apostwar analysis of strategic bombing that “the terrible shock givento the entire German state by the series of extremely heavy attacksdirected at Hamburg at the end of July and the beginning of August1943 suggests what might have happened if attacks of comparable intensity could have been directed also against a substantial numberof other German cities at about the same time and in rapid succes-sion.” 26But George Ball did not grasp the potential decisiveness of area raids that Speer’s testimony suggested and Brodie’s analysisstated forthrightly. Instead, Speer’s testimony on the Hamburg raidsseemed “curious” to Ball. The testimony seemed curious becauseBall and his fellow Survey analysts directed their analysis towardthe effects of area raids on German war production, not morale. It was also possible that Ball and other Survey analysts did not explore the potential effect of area attacks on morale (suggested bythe Speer testimony) because of their moral uneasiness over killinglarge numbers of enemy civilians. The Survey knew that their find-ings would have some effect on the conduct of the AAF’s aerial waragainst Japanese cities. 27Perhaps Ball and some of the others felt that a strong emphasis on the potential decisiveness of area raids—with morale as the objective—mi
