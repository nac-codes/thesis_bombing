the analysts could then “compare variances betweenplanned and actual production of plants in raided areas with likevariances of undamaged plants in non-raided areas,” thus providinga reasonable indication of the overall “production loss caused bythe area raid.” 49 Note that analysts took account of worker absenteeism from fac- tories and casualties, suggesting that they were interested in the ef-fects of area raids on the morale of workers. But the Area Divisionused worker absenteeism and casualties as analytical categories todetermine how area raids affected the ability of workers to con-tribute to war production. Damage caused to workers’ homes fromarea attacks would usually force those workers to be absent fromthe factories to repair their homes or move to new ones, thus lower-ing the output of factories. The term “casualties” to the Area Divi-sion meant the number of civilian workers killed or wounded byarea attacks. Like worker absenteeism, casualties caused by arearaids would affect the war-making capacity of the city by prevent-ing people from going to work in the factories. 50 The Survey, because of its focus on Germany’s war-making ca- pacity, never addressed the large issues of mass killing and mass ca-sualties from bombing. The focus was always far more narrow: Didthe casualties and death disrupt and cut production? Thus, thekilling or injuring of children or those too old to work, or workers’unemployed spouses, was important only for its indirect effect on production. 51strategic bombing against germany 66 Gentile, Gian P..
