two high-priority targets for the AAF to bomb.57 In his 1986 memoirs, Hansell used Survey conclusions to argue that the AAF’s strategic bombing campaign against Germany had vindi-cated AWPD/ 1’s choice of target systems. 58The European Survey’s Summary Report, which Hansell cited in his memoirs, argued thatstrategic bombing against germany 67 Gentile, Gian P..

Like AWPD/1 and Hansell’s memoirs, the Survey, by the spring of 1945, placed little importance on studying the waystrategic bombing damaged buildings and structures. John KennethGalbraith noted that examining physical damage to industrial plants“became little more than an exercise in viewing rubble.” 61 Paul Nitze agreed with Galbraith about the decreased impor- tance of studying the amount of physical damage caused by strate-gic bombing. He recommended to D’Olier that the Survey reducethe size of the Physical Damage Division and direct its ener
