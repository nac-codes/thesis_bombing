f the Survey [were]being accented more than the physical damage phase.” 62 Part of the problem that Bereta and his division faced was the growing influence Nitze wielded among Survey members, especiallyFranklin D’Olier. When the Survey conducted its field operations inFrance and Germany from January to July 1945, Vice-Chairman Alexander and Chairman D’Olier worked out of the Survey’s Lon-don headquarters and made frequent trips back to the UnitedStates. In their absence, Nitze acted as Survey chairman. Not sur-prisingly, D’Olier had come to rely “very heavily on him” becauseof his ability and expertise. Bereta noted that “many of the policiesof the Survey are definitely set by Mr. Nitze due to the confidencethat higher authority has in him.” 63 By June 1945, Nitze, Ball, and Galbraith were beginning to for- mulate initial conclusions about the effects of strategic bombing.They believed that the AAF had been most effective when it directedits bombers against basic industries such as electric power, trans-portation, and oil production. 64Based on the evidence that their di- visions had collected and analyzed, especially Albert Speer’s testi-mony, Nitze recalled that unlike factories producing finished prod-ucts such as ball bearings or airframes, the basic industries “onceseverely damaged, could not be quickly restored to full productionnor could stocks be readily replaced.” It was the basic industrieslinking together the entire German war economy that proved to bethe most valuable target systems for American strategic bombers toattack, argued Nitze. 65 With the war in Germany over, the United States concentrated its effort on the Pacific. Wanting to explore the lessons learned fromthe European theater for possible use against Japan, the AAF askedSurvey directors to summarize their findings. Survey analysts hadhoned in on two basic industries or target systems that, accordingto them, either would have been decisive or were decisive in the waragainst Germany.strategic
