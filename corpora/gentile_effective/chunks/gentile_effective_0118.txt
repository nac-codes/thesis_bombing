Ewell, be involved in the study. 6the survey presents its findings 81 Gentile, Gian P..

The study noted that area attacks on Japanese cities would cause production loss from “direct damage to industrial facilitiesand housing [and] the diversion of Japanese industry from its nor-mal activities to the repair and replacement of this damage.” Thestudy cautioned that the potential effectiveness of incendiary raidsrequired further analysis. It did conclude forthrightly that “incendi-ary attacks on urban areas will produce great economic loss . . . butbecause of the wide diffusion of this loss over many industries it isunlikely that output in any one important category” would substan-tially reduce the Japanese military’s frontline strength. The COA’ssubcommittee concluded that precision attacks, rather than incendi-ary raids, would be more effective in reducing Japan’s critical warindustries than incendiary raids. 7 But other COA studies emphasized the potential of incendiary raids on Japanese cities.
