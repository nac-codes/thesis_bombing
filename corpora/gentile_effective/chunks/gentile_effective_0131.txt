Paul Nitze, during the 9June conference with the JTG, displayed his penchant for counterfactual speculation when evaluating the ef-fects of strategic bombing. Trying to understand the relationship be-tween discrete industries in the overall German war economy, theJTG asked if the “rates of recovery of particular industries [were]importantly affected by attack[s] on other target categories.” Thequestion allowed Nitze to demonstrate, counterfactually, the Sur-vey’s belief that a strategic bombing attack on the German electricthe survey presents its findings 90 Gentile, Gian P..
