ing the economic effects of strategic bombing on Germany duringthe war. General Anderson brought up again the effectiveness of theRAF’s area raids against German cities. George Ball, referring toSpeer’s testimony, pointed out that “the Hamburg raid in 1943 scared them to death.” Colonel Brownell, who had been quiet up tothen, perceptively noted that Ball’s statement placed “some doubton what [Ball] said earlier about the effectiveness of area raids.”Ball retorted: “What Speer said was that he was terribly worried atthe time. He thought if those raids were continued that the war waslost, but he later realized he had been wrong, as other people inthe survey presents its findings 92 Gentile, Gian P..

But General Norstadprobed at the profound implications of Speer’s testimony: the po-tential effects of area bombing on German morale. Norstad sug-gested to Anderson and Ball that “there was probably a certainamount of hysteria connected with [the area raids].” 38“Hysteria” for Norstad clearly meant the ability of the RAF’s area raids oncities like Hamburg to cause terror among the civilian population.But because Ball framed his analysis of area attacks in terms of Ger-man war-making capacity and not morale, he easily moved the dis-cussion back to the economic effects of area bombing and Ham-burg’s “surprisingly fast recuperation.” 39 Although morale as an objective had been a key topic of discussion for the Committee of Histori
