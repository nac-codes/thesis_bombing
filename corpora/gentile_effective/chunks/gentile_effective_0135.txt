cussion back to the economic effects of area bombing and Ham-burg’s “surprisingly fast recuperation.” 39 Although morale as an objective had been a key topic of discussion for the Committee of Historians back in 1943, it was simply not an important topic for discussion during the daylong conference betweenthe JTG and Survey directors in June 1945. Some historians have ei- ther misread the entire transcript for the 9June conference or failed to read it at all. The conference has been portrayed, incorrectly, as adebate between the JTG’s purported emphasis on using the XXIBomber Command’s ﬁre raids to attack Japanese morale and the Sur-vey’s purported attempt to have the AAF halt the ﬁre raids, stop at-tacking morale, and bomb “basic industries” like electric power andtransportation. 40But if the central issue of the debate between the JTG and Survey members was over the effects of strategic bombing onmorale, then one would have expected it to take up much more timeat the conference. The conferees spent the entire day on 9June dis- cussing the effects of strategic bombing, resulting in a seventy-ﬁve-page typed transcript of the meeting. Out of those seventy-ﬁve pagesonly about one page reﬂected discussions over morale. 41George Ball insisted that he did not “think that the question of morale in and ofitself [was] important. It doesn’t mean anything unless it is translatedinto political action or a decrease in production.” 42The Survey’s Morale Division director, Rensis Likert, was left back in Germany anddid not attend the conference.the survey presents its findings 93 Gentile, Gian P..
