The Survey’s plan would reduce the XXI Bomber Command’sfire raids that had already killed hundreds of thousands of Japanesecivilians, probably easing Spaatz’s moral concerns. 72The Survey’sthe survey presents its findings 101 Gentile, Gian P..

Anything that might avoidthe land invasion of the Japanese home islands and prove the deci-siveness of air power must have appealed to the general. V But the American Joint Chiefs of Staff and President Harry S. Tru-man had decided at a high-level meeting on 18June 1945 to go ahead with the plans for a massive ground invasion of Kyushu(Operation Olympic), requiring about 767,000 American troops. Olympic was set to begin on 1November 1945. The JCS had con- sidered the possibility that strategic bombardment, coupled with anaval blockade, against Japan might end the war. Yet as GeneralMarshall explained to the president at the 18June meeting, the ground invasion of Kyushu was essential, “both to tightening ourstranglehold of blockade and bombardment on Japan, and to forc-ing capitulation by invasion of the Tokyo Plain.” 73 General Spaatz did not arrive in the Paciﬁc until late July 1945 with the Survey’s alternate strategic bombing plan. The momentum of theXXI Bomber Command’s ﬁre raids kept Spaatz from implementinghis late-July directive to shift targe
