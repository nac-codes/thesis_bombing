ny, do you think it is goingto have on the Bombing Survey?” Searls gave no answer toD’Olier. 75But the chairman and his directors were aware, even be- fore President Truman issued a formal request on 15August for the Survey to continue its work in the Pacific, that they would be evalu-ating the effects of strategic bombing on Japan. 76 Paul Nitze implicitly claimed in his 1987 memoirs that he knew beforehand the answers to so many of the perplexing questions sur-rounding the end of the war in the Pacific. Nitze recalled that afterFred Searls had informed him about the atomic bomb in July 1945, they both “concluded that even without the atomic bomb, Japanwas likely to surrender in a matter of months. My own view wasthat Japan would capitulate by November 1945.” 77Nitze’s thinking in July 1945 undoubtedly shaped the counterfactual statement he would write in the Pacific Survey’s Summary Report about seven months later concerning the end of the war with Japan. That reportstated: “certainly prior to 31December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not en-tered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contem-plated.” 78Counterfactual speculation, though, was nothing new for Paul Nitze or his fellow Survey analysts.the survey presents its findings 103 Gentile, Gian P..
