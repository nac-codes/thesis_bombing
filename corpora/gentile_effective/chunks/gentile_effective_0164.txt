In a lengthy memorandum An- derson considered the Summary Report to be “an instrument which perceives the truth but has not pointedly developed the fundamental issues as a working thesis.” Regarding the report’s conclusion onthe need for reorganization and unification, Anderson believed thatthe Survey had taken an appropriate stand on that issue.

III But how would the atomic bomb fit into such an independent airforce? Anderson was pleased by the Summary Report’s counterfac- tual conclusion concerning the end of the war with Japan, whichstated that “certainly prior to 31December 1945, and in all proba- bility prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia hadnot entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned orcontemplated.” But he was troubled that the Summary Report did not immediately follow up the counterfactual conclusion with astatement on the potential of atomic power. 41 Anderson was obliquely pointing to a fundamental conflict in Nitze’s Summary Report. While the report’s concluding remarks did suggest that atomic weapons would be a decisive factor in Amer-ica’s postwar defense establishment, the report also argued that theatomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were indecisive inforcing Japan to surrender. 42Nitze, according to his biographer Strobe Talbott, wanted to demystify
