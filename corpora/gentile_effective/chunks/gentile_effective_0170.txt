orthe Russian declaration of war. For the hundreds of other Surveyanalysts, both civilian and military, Nitze’s counterfactual fit neatlyinto their conceptual understanding of strategic bombing. They be-lieved that the purpose of strategic bombing was to destroy theenemy’s war-making capacity. 58Since their analysis of the Pacific war showed them that the conventional bombing of the Japanesehome islands coupled with the naval blockade had decisively dam-aged Japan’s war-making capacity, the atomic bomb, for them,played only a minor role in ending the war. But a June 1946 analysis produced under the direction of Gen- eral Leslie Groves, military commander of the Manhattan EngineerDistrict which built the bomb, disagreed. General Groves’s report,“The Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” argued that“the atomic bomb did not alone win the war against Japan, but itmost certainly ended it, saving the thousands of Allied lives thatwould have been lost in any combat invasion of Japan.” 59The Sur- vey’s secretariat, Walter Wilds, told presidential assistant EdwinLocke (who had recently arrived back from Japan as a special envoyto the president) that the Survey believed the Groves report “shouldnot be made public at this time.” Wilds informed Locke of attemptson the Survey’s part to “reduce conflicts” between the two reportsby providing General Groves with Survey “data.” Wilds believedthat the simultaneous release of the Survey’s Summary Report and the Groves report would “promote public confusion.” 60The poten- tial “public confusion” that concerned Wilds was most likely tied tothe contradiction between the two reports over the role of theatomic bomb in “ending” the war against Japan.
