by the politicaland military leadership. The report concluded that morale (eitherpolitical or public) was not decisive; rather, it was only “one impor-tant factor among several” in the defeat of Japan. 76 Three conflicting conclusions emerge from the pages of various reports of the Pacific Survey: ( 1) approximately 70 percent of AAF attacks against the Japanese home islands were against urban areas;(2) area attacks against Japan’s morale and urban economy were not decisive factors in Japan’s decision to surrender; and ( 3) con- ventional strategic bombing was the decisive factor in forcing theJapanese to surrender “unconditionally.” The Survey’s first twofindings, taken together, suggest that a major portion of the AAF’sair campaign against the Japanese home islands was not decisive,and was perhaps unnecessary. The third finding—the Summary Re- port’s conclusion—therefore, requires an explanation of how the re- maining 30percent of the AAF’s campaign, which consisted of pre- cision attacks against specific military and economic targets, de-feated Japan and forced a surrender. Granted the Summary Reportargued that the main weight of the AAF’s campaign against Japan-ese cities lowered the morale and will to resist of the Japanese lead-ership, thereby forcing them to accept surrender, but the Pacific Sur-vey report on morale suggested that both factors were not criticalfor Japan’s capitulation. This is the dilemma that emerges from the pages of the Paciﬁc Sur- vey reports: How to claim the decisiveness of conventional air powerwhen there was evidence pointing to the conclusion that a large partof the AAF’s campaign, while important, was not the crucial factor inJapan’s defeat? The devastating effects of the antishipping campaignand of conventional strategic bombing certainly forced the Japaneseleadership to realize that defeat was inevitable. But there is a differ-ence between the realization of defeat and the political acceptance ofsurrender. Here is where the atom
