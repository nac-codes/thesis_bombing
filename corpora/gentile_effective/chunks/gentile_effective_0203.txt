lowed to take part in strategic bombing operations.33 Spaatz’s concern was justified. The navy’s assistant secretary for air, John Nicholas Brown, was reported to have testified to theEberstadt committee on defense unification: “In any future war, theNavy, through its carrier task forces, will carry the war to theenemy. . . . In the early stages of any future war, long range bombersof the U.S. Air Force will not be able to reach the industrial heart ofthe enemy.” 34 Carrier-based aircraft, argued navy officers, would be most effec- tive in dropping atomic bombs on targets inside of the SovietUnion. Since the air force’s long-range bombers would have to flygreat distances to reach critical targets within the Soviet Union,navy officers believed that their accuracy and the probability oftheir delivering the bombs would be quite low. The atomic bomb,claimed Admiral Ofstie in a speech to the Aviation Writers Associa-tion in 1948, was “of no use unless it [could] be delivered to theright spot. To my mind this, the delivery of the ‘A’ bomb, should beand probably is a major consideration today in the war plans of theAir Force and of Naval aviation.” 35 The navy did not disagree in principle with what I have called the American conceptual approach to strategic bombing—the use ofstrategic air power to attack the war-making capacity of the enemy.But the navy did want to be able to participate in strategic bombingoperations in a potential war with the Soviet Union. Claiming a roleto play in strategic bombing operations would give the navy lever-age in the interservice “war” with the air force over defense dollars. IV The post–World War II plans for war against the Soviet Union, pro-duced by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for “a prompt strategic airoffensive” that would “destroy the Soviet war-making capacity.” Inthe war plans written between 1945 and 1950, the atomic bomba-bombs, budgets, and the dilemma of defense 142 Gentile, Gian P..
