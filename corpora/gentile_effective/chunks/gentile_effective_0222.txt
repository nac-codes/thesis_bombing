tary of the navy), Ofstie noted that the UnitedStates would “hesitate to use bacteriological warfare involving themass destruction of persons until after the enemy had shown goodevidence they had intended to use it.” But Ofstie did believe theUnited States should attack Soviet “grain crops” as soon as “wehad the advantage and knew that the Soviets could not retaliate ef-fectively against us.

According to Of-stie’s “personal view,” the United States should go to war at that time when Russia is approaching industrial self sufficiency in that part of Europe which is outside Russia. . . .The obvious advantage would be that this would make it possible forus to win the war. The alternative would be a stalemate and subse-quent decreased relative potential between the U.S. and the Soviet.Such a course of action (preventive war) would be possible in thiscountry if the public were educated up to fully understanding thetrue position. . . .
