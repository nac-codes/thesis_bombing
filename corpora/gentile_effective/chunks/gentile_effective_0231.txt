containing the correspondence he re-ceived after his relief from the Air War College, and the only letterthere from an influential military establishment member, eithercivilian or military, was from Bernard Brodie. Perhaps Brodie understood better than anyone else the dilemma that atomic weapons posed for American security and the logic ofGeneral Anderson’s public statements on preventive war. In a lec-ture to the Air War College two years after Anderson’s relief, Brodiereferred to “preventive war” as an “alternative strategy to be con-sidered,” and he blamed his “social science colleagues for the factthat they have turned their faces away from any consideration ofthis problem.” 90 VIII Bernard Brodie and other postwar analysts used the reports of theUSSBS to help them think through the problems that nuclearweapons and air power posed for American national security. In his1946 book The Absolute Weapon , Brodie argued that atomic bombs had revolutionized warfare. Brodie contended that any fu-ture war with the Soviets would not be similar to the great land bat-tles of World War II. Instead, Brodie saw the next major war beingfought primarily, and decisively, with atomic bombs. 91Partly be- cause Brodie believed that atomic weapons had changed the waywars in the future would be fought, he was judicious and cautiousin using the Survey to support his theories. For Brodie, if there wasany meaningful continuity between strategic bombing in World WarII and future atomic war, it had to be analyzed rigorously for the de-velopment of atomic strategy.a-bombs, budgets, and the dilemma of defense 161 Gentile, Gian P..
