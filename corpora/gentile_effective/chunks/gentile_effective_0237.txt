restatement of the presidential directivesthat established the Survey. It is unclear why D’Olier did not try toresolve the apparent contradiction between Stimson’s and the Sur-vey’s explanation for Japan’s surrender. Back in December 1944 Franklin D’Olier gave a welcome speech to many of the Survey’s newly arrived analysts. He used a metaphorto explain to them his concept of strategic bombing. According toD’Olier, tactical bombing took off the arms and legs of the “cow,”but strategic bombing destroyed the whole “cow,” arms and legsand all. 103D’Olier’s Bombing Survey did its part to demonstrate that American strategic air power had slain the “cow” of Germanand Japanese war-making capacity during World War II. But in thePacific, the United States did it, according to the Survey, without theatomic bomb. In 1946– 47, that conclusion did not seem threatening to air power, to the sense of U.S. history, or to the military services. The Strategic Bombing Survey would continue to influence think- ing about strategic bombing and military strategy beyond the imme-diate post–World War II years. For example, Gar Alperovitz, in his1964 book Atomic Diplomacy , challenged Stimson’s official expla- nation of the A-bomb.
