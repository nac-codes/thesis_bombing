the United States initiated its aerial assault on Iraq and Kuwait, Colonel John A. Warden III, airforce deputy director for war-fighting concepts in the Pentagon, be-lieved that another World War II-type survey was needed if theUnited States carried out its planned air campaign. Colonel Wardensubsequently sent a memorandum to the air force vice-chief of staff,General John M. Loh, pointing out that a “bombing survey wouldbe extremely valuable” and should be performed by an “independ-ent commission.” Colonel Warden later pursued the idea of whatbecame known as the Gulf War Air Power Survey (GWAPS) withformer USSBS director Paul Nitze. In fact Colonel Warden prepareda special briefing for Nitze and made a strong “pitch for an inde-pendent bombing survey.” 12Undoubtedly, Colonel Warden and other airmen saw great success in their efforts against Iraq; an “in-dependent study” would assuredly confirm the decisiveness ofAmerican air power in the Gulf War just as airmen intended theUSSBS to do after World War II. In a certain way, however, the GWAPS was unlike the USSBS. American airmen played a strong role in establishing the USSBS’sorganizational structure and in shaping the questions that it an-swered, and airmen influenced the conclusions reached by theUSSBS about strategic bombing in World War II. The USSBS thus fitneatly within the AAF’s conceptual approach to air power, andserved its postwar interests in establishing an independent air arm.The GWAPS was different. Powerful air force interests did try to in-fluence the conclusions reached by the GWAPS. However, those in-terests did not substantially affect the GWAPS ability to conduct anindependent study of the use of air power in the Gulf War. Analyzing this shift from the USSBS to the GWAPS is important because it sheds light on the subtle interplay of advocacy and as-a comparison of surveys 170 Gentile, Gian P..
