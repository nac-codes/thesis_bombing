[GWAPS] members had as their standard the ob-servation of Mr. Franklin D’Olier, chairman of the United StatesStrategic Bombing Survey . . . [which was to] ‘burn into everybody’ssouls the fact that the survey’s responsibility was to ascertain factsand to seek truth, eliminating completely any preconceived theoriesor dogmas.’” 30 As Survey director, however, there were few similarities between Franklin D’Olier and Eliot Cohen. D’Olier was a corporate man-ager and Cohen a scholar. Aside from his limited military experi-ence as a staff officer in World War I, D’Olier had little understand-ing of the strategic and operational levels of war. Cohen, conversely,after graduating from Harvard with a Ph.D. in political science,spent four years at the Naval War College teaching strategy andalso served on the Policy Planning Staff for the secretary of de-fense. 31While D’Olier was “the amiable figurehead”32of the USSBS and made no intellectual contributions to the Survey’s work, Cohenwas closely involved with the daily running of the GWAPS, and,more important, was the intellectual leader during the research andwriting of GWAPS volumes. Like D’Olier, who relied on HenryAlexander for managerial and intellectual leadership, Cohen cameto rely greatly on historian Thomas Keaney, especially for the writ-ing of the important GWAPS Summary Repor
