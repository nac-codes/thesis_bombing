There were GWAPS members who disregardedhis directive and leaked draft reports to interested airmen and civiliananalysts, who later sought to suppress the publication of GWAPS vol-umes. 37Generally speaking, however, most GWAPS analysts under- stood the need for impartiality, intellectual honesty, and independencefrom air force interests during the conduct of their study. IV It is useful to compare the professional backgrounds of the USSBSanalysts with those of the GWAPS. Paul Nitze perceptively pointedout to GWAPS leaders at a review board meeting that the USSBS,“in its attempt to be independent, selected people who had no ex-pertise in the areas they were to study.” 38Nitze may have been get- ting at the lack of professional military experience of most of theUSSBS personnel, including himself. Of course one must acknowledge the historical context in which the USSBS conducted its evaluation. The reason why the USSBS hadvirtually no analysts with professional military backgrounds (savefor the professional military officers like Orvil Anderson and RalphOfstie) was that a defense establishment simply did not exist duringthe years leading up to World War II. Very few Americans served inthe armed services during the 1930s, so very few USSBS members would have had professional military service in their records. Moreimportant, the link between the military and academic institutionsfor research and development was only in its infancy during WorldWar II. When the GWAPS conducted its study in the early 1990s, a close institutional relationship between the military and civilian expertshad developed within the American defense establishment
