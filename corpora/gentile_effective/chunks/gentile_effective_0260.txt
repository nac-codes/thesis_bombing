group of distinguished scholars, statesmen, and senior military lead-ers to act as a corporate body to review the GWAPS work, provid-ing it with the “credibility and prestige necessary to support thefinal product.” The review committee was not, however, intended“to serve as ornaments” for GWAPS credibility. Instead the com-mittee played a “key role in both the study process and the final”GWAPS volumes by recommending analytical methods and by“identifying gaps in the overall project.” 49 The committee met formally in March 1992 and in January 1993 to review the work of the GWAPS. Bernard Lewis, a professor ofpolitical science at Princeton University, cautioned Eliot Cohen andhis task force leaders to maintain balance in their analysis by keep-ing “in mind that losers tend to study what went wrong while win-ners study what went right.” Another one of the review committee’scivilian scholars, Richard Kohn of the University of North Carolinaat Chapel Hill, advised the group that they needed to be very care-ful in the use of counterfactual speculation. Aware of the contro-versy over the USSBS’s counterfactual about Japan’s surrender atthe end of World War II, Kohn noted that it would be very difficultfor the GWAPS “to answer what if questions.” He doubted theycould assess events that did not happen. 50 There were retired senior military officers on the GWAPS review committee like General Michael J. Dugan of the air force, AdmiralHuntington Hardisty of the navy, and General Maxwell Thurmanof the army. These retired officers certainly had strong vested inter-ests in their respective services. One might have expected interser-vice wrangling over GWAPS conclusions similar to the fierceparochial debates between Admiral Ralph Ofstie and General OrvilAnderson of the Pacific USSBS. Yet in comparison to the USSBS, theGWAPS review committee seems remarkable in its desire to avoida comparison of surveys 182 Gentile, Gian P.. How Effective Is Strategic Bombing? : Lessons Learned fro
