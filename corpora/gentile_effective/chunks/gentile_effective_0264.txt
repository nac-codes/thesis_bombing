Cochran (task force leader for Strat- egy and Plans) recommended that since the air force rejected the les- sons they should have learned from Vietnam and Korea, the Effectsvolume should “refer back to World War II.” Colonel Emery M. Ki-raly followed Cochran by suggesting that in order to “validate” the“findings” of the volume, the authors should make a comparison ofthe GWAPS and the USSBS. Making such a comparison would, ac-cording to Thomas Keaney, provide a “baseline” for the GWAPS.Establishing a “baseline” was critical for the authors of the Effects and Effectiveness study because of their inability to gain access to Iraq to collect evidence. 55 The “baseline” discerned from the USSBS allowed the volume’s authors to deemphasize the problems that they had with access toIraq by showing how their volume would go beyond the more nar-row approach taken by John Kenneth Galbraith’s USSBS EconomicDivision report. The Effects volume noted that if one used only physical damage as a measure of strategic bombing’s effectiveness,then bombing attacks on a given target could be considered success-ful simply if they did physical damage to the target. However, phys-ical destruction of structures did not always produce the effects de-sired on an enemy political, economic, or military system. Accord-ing to the authors of the Effects volume, Galbraith’s report, The Effects of Strategic Bombing on the German War Economy , was unable to make nuanced distinctions between effects and effective-ness. In light of the “neglect of such effects in parts of the WorldWar II survey,” the authors believed that they should try to move beyond these shortcomings in their evaluation of the effects of theair campaign against Iraq. 56 Thus the GWAPS Effects volume drew attention
