urvey,” the authors believed that they should try to move beyond these shortcomings in their evaluation of the effects of theair campaign against Iraq. 56 Thus the GWAPS Effects volume drew attention away from its existing problem of lack of evidence by creating a pejorative distinc-tion between itself and Galbraith’s USSBS report. But in so doingthe GWAPS volume overly emphasized Galbraith’s reliance on sta-tistics and “indices” and downplayed the economists’ sophisticatedunderstanding of the German war economy as a “system” and thea comparison of surveys 185 Gentile, Gian P..

The GWAPS Effects volume argued that Galbraith’s USSBS re- port, The Effects of Strategic Bombing on the German War Econ- omy, narrowly focused its analysis on economic statistics rather than trying to determine the second- and third-order effects—or ef-fectiveness—of strategic bombing on the German war economy. 57 This was a narrow rendering of Galbraith’s USSBS argument.
