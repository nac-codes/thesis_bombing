third-order effects of bombing on enemy economic “sys-tems.” 58The discussions between Galbraith and his Economic Ef- fects Division further demonstrated that they were not solelyfixated on economic statistics and “indices” in their evaluation ofthe overall effectiveness of strategic bombing. 59 To be fair to Watts and Keaney, they both believed that Galbraith focused his USSBS analysis exclusively on the effects of strategicbombing on the German war economy to the detriment of “the ac-tual goals of the air commanders at specific points in time.” 60Un- derstanding operational objectives of air leaders was understand-ably important to Watts and Keaney because that was going to be acrucial factor in their study of air power in the Gulf War. But to beequally fair to Galbraith, the USSBS intentionally focused its analy-sis on the effects of strategic bombing on the German and Japanesewar economies and not on the tactical and operational problems ofthe AAF. Watts and Keaney also rolled together some of Galbraith’s very critical post-USSBS writings on air power with his USSBS report. 61 Galbraith claimed in his memoirs that the data he and other Surveymembers had collected proved the “disastrous failures” of strategicbombing in World War II. 62Neither his report nor any of the other published USSBS studies ever used such language or made sucha comparison of surveys 186 Gentile, Gian P..
