For theGWAPS in the early 1990s there were clearly similar air force inter-ests at work trying to affect the outcome of the GWAPS reports.The GWAPS, however, based on the available documentary evi-dence, was able to keep those interests at bay, allowing for an inde-pendent study of air power in the Gulf War.a comparison of surveys 190 Gentile, Gian P..

The apparent aim of the campaign wasto force the Yugoslavian president, Slobodan Milosevic, to stop theethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosovo and to pull his militaryforces out of Kosovo. Air power was expected to help achieve thoseobjectives. The American-dominated NATO air campaign over Yugoslavia demonstrates that problems still exist with the use of strategicbombing in war and conflict. First, the type of targets bombed inYugoslavia and the attitudes of certain senior airmen toward the air campaign show that the traditional American concept of strategicbombing continues to shape Air Force thinking. Second, as in previ-ous conflicts involving the application of air power—World War II,Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf War—efforts to prove the effective-ness of strategic bombing remain clouded with ambiguity. Third,because it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of strategic bomb-ing, a need remains for experts—civilian experts—to conduct evalu-ations
