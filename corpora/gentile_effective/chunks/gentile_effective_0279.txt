Sherry, in The Rise of American Air Power , sees the influence of Douhet on American airmen as a part of a greater mix of social, political, economic, and especially tech- nological factors (52– 76). An extreme case of a refusal to acknowledge Douhet’s influence on American airmen is Robert T. Finney, History of the Air Corps Tactical School, 1920–1940 (Washington, D.C.: USGPO, 1955). In an older but still useful work, Thomas H. Greer, The Development of Air Doctrine in the Army Air Arm, 1917–1941 (Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala.: Air University Press, 1955), argues that the influence of Douhet on American thought was “indirectly and directly substantial” ( 49).
