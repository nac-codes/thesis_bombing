18.The Air Corps Tactical Schools, by the late 1930s, had become the “incubator” of American strategic bombing doctrine. Partly owing to thegeographic detachment of Maxwell from Washington, D.C., partly becauseit was the only service school that was producing a coherent doctrine forstrategic bombardment, and because the smartest air corps officers eitherwere instructors or had been students at the school (e.g., Hap Arnold, CarlSpaatz, Muir Fairchild, Laurence Kuter, Orvil Anderson, Frederick Ander-son, Ira Eaker, Hoyt Vandenberg, and Haywood Hansell), the school be-came the seedbed for developing concepts of air power within the AAF.
