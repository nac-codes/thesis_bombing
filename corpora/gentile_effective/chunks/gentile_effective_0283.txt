d. Greer, Development of Air Doctrine, 109. 23.Quoted in Hansell, Air Plan That Defeated Hitler, 45. 24.Air Corps Tactical School, Course: Air Force “National Economic Structure” (instructor, Muir Fairchild), pp. 1–3, 1939– 1940, file 168.7001- 31, AFHRA. Historian Ronald Schaffer in his important 1985 book Wings of Judgment implies that the emphasis of Fairchild’s thirty- nine-page lecture was on attacking civilian morale for psychological effects(30–33). But Fairchild acknowledged at the beginning of the lecture that this was not the recommended method of the school. Schaffer, therefore,quotes Fairchild out of context in order to provide support for his argu-ment that both morale and physical capacity were equally important tar-gets for air officers as they refined their theory of air power in the late1930s. Air officers at the Tactical School, however, did not treat both asequally important. Fairchild’s lecture, at least, demonstrates that in 1939 the primary objective for strategic bombers was the enemy’s war-makingcapacity. 25.Fairchild, “National Economic Structure,” 6. 26.Clodfelter, “Molding Airpower Convictions,” 96. 27.Hansell, Strategic Air War against Germany and Japan , 12–13; Fairchild, “National Economic Structure,” 29–30. 28.Hansell, Strategic Air War against Germany and Japan , 12, 19; Fairchild, “National Economic Structure,” 31. 29.Fairchild, “National Economic Structure,” 6–7. 30.Proposed memo, General Henry H.
