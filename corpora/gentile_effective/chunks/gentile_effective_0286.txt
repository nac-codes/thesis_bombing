The term urban area attacks has often been employed to describe the use of strategic bombers in World War II to attack German and Japan-ese cities with the intention of striking civilians targets, thereby directly at-tacking their morale. Urban area attacks, in this conception, become syn-onymous with the direct attack on morale as an objective. But for Ameri- can airmen and civilian analysts during World War II, urban area attacks,like the precise bombing of specific industrial targets (precision bombing),was a method (albeit a very destructive one) of strategic bombing with the objective usually being the German and Japanese war-making capacity. An urban area attack, as a method, could have had morale as an objective, butthe two were logically distinct, and not automatically synonymous. 46.Edward Mead Earle to Winfield Riefler, 23December 1942, His- tory of the COA, file 118.01, AFHRA. 47.Biddle, “British and American Approaches to Strategic Bombing,” 118– 20; Schaffer, Wings of Judgment, 36–38; Charles Webster and Noble Frankland, The Strategic Air Offensive against Germany, 1939–1945, vol. 2: Endeavor (London: Her Majesty’s Stationary Office, 1961), 12. 48.Memo, Committee of Operations Analysts to Arnold, “Report of Committee of Operations Analysts with Respect to Economic Targetswithin
