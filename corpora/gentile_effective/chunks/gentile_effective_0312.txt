t the RAF did take upa good part of the strategic bombing campaign against Germany and thatthe Survey spent a good part of its effort evaluating the results of RAFbombing. How could the two reports have used anything but the adjective“Allied” in light of the basic facts and still claimed at least a modicum of“impartiality”? And AAF leaders probably had no problems with the ad-jective “Allied” preceding the phrase on air power’s “decisiveness.” In Sep-tember 1945, when the European Reports were being published, air leaders like Anderson could happily accept the European Survey’s conclusions con-cerning “Allied” air power and look ahead to the Pacific phase of the Sur-vey where the Survey would only be evaluating “American” air power.notes to chapter 3 218 Gentile, Gian P..
