n on the effects of strategic bombing on morale, he is wrong to arguethat the JTG, even by July 1945, emphasized the importance of using area raids to attack Japanese morale. The JTG was primarily concerned withdestroying Japanese finished war material that could be used to defendagainst a ground invasion. 41.There were three other meetings held between the Survey and the JTG on 12, 13, and 15 June. Apparently no transcripts exist for these meetings. It is possible, therefore, for morale to have been the center of dis-cussion at the meetings. But this is unlikely. In their memoirs, both Ball andNitze discuss the series of June meetings and point out that there were dis-agreements between the Survey and the JTG over the best way to destroyJapanese war-making capacity, but they do not claim there was a discus-sion—or dispute—on morale. Late in the afternoon on the day of the lastmeeting, D’Olier, Ball, and O. A. Anderson had a phone conversation withCabot in London. A good part of the conversation was over providing in-formation to the directors in Washington, D.C., to assist them in theirmeetings. The information requested was on transportation, coke produc-tion, and electric power. If morale was the primary point of disagreementbetween the Survey and the JTG during the 12, 13, and 15 June meetings, one would have expected the phone conversation on 15June to address morale, but it did not. 42.JTG/USSBS Conference, p. 25. 43.USSBS, Summary Report (European War), 15–16. 44.JTG/USSBS Conference, p. 14. 45.Ibid., p. 15. 46.JTG, “Japanese Urban Areas General Analysis,” [ 5July 1945], file 142.66022- 79, AFHRA; XXI Bomber Command, “Monthly Activity Re- port,” 1July 1945, box 16, Curtis E.
