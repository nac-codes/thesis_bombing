In another March draft of the Summary Report, Nitze appears to have bracketed this statement and replaced it with a statement calling for a “third establish- ment” within a “unified department of common defense.” This term,“third establishment,” would eventually appear in the 1July published Summary Report; see “Recommendations,” [undated], USSBS Records,microfilm no. 1655, roll 1 , frames 1526, 1528, NA. 32.M.A.D.

Anderson’s name does not appear on this draft, but he almost certainly wrote it. The draft closely resembles ahandwritten draft of a Survey report found in the O. A. Anderson Papers.Also, throughout his career, Anderson used recognizable terms such as“echelon” and “dominating” that appear in this Survey draft. The styleand tone strongly appear to be Anderson’s as well.
