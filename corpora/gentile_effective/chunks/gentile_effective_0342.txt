Also see a critique of Radford’s testimony (probably prepared for Symington by Leach) that notes a contradiction between the admiral’scriticism of the air force’s approach to strategic bombing on moral groundsand earlier arguments made by navy officers in favor of strategic bombingoperations against Russian urban areas; “[Barton Leach], “Outline ofStatement,” [October 1949], box 7 , Symington Papers. 73.Memo, Ofstie to Chairman, General Board, “General Board Serial 315,” 8April 1948, box 3 , Ofstie Papers. 74.Ibid.; also see Address of Dr. R.
