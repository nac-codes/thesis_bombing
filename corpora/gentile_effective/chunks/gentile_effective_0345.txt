All the main themes are there: the nationis at war; the power of the new weapons is such that the ﬁrst blow will be de-cisive; therefore, this ﬁrst (atomic) blow must be struck by the United States.”Also see a 1949 essay by General Orvil A. Anderson, “Air Warfare and Morality,” Air University Quarterly Review (winter 1949): 5–14. Anderson argues that atomic warfare against the Soviet Union would be moral becauseAmerican bombers would not be attacking civilians directly, but rather theSoviet industrial “power” base (7). Bernard Brodie’s Strategy in the Missile Age(227–32), has an excellent and still relevant passage on preventive war theory.
