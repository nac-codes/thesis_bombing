r , Hansell saw the strategic bombing forces dispersed and directed against targets which were not strategic  in nature . In July 1943 Hansell returned  to the United States where he took an important  position  on the staff of General Henry Arnold. Arnold entrusted  Hansell with creating  a strategic air force which would be controlled  from Washington  and be devoted to purely strategic  targets . Hansell served as the first chief of staff of the Twentieth  Air Force and insisted on daylight,  precision  operations  against Japan. In October 1944 Hansell arrived in the Marianas  as the commander  of the XXI Bomber Command . After initiating  daylight operations v  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 10 --- against Japan he was denied decisive  results by difficulties in supply, weather, and the command structure. It is commonly  believed  that Americans  were universally committed  to daylight bombing, but Hansell was soon under pressure from Lauris Norstad, the new chief of staff of the Twentieth  Air Force, to use incendiary  weapons to burn Japan's cities. Hansell resisted  Norstad's  proposals  and thus was dismissed  from his command  by Arnold. Hansell stands as the single most important  exponent  of daylight, precision  bombing in World War II. In Europe the existing  technology  and conditions  favored American  daylight attacks, but over Japan the possibility  of firebombing Japanese cities coupled with the American hatred of the Japanese prompted the American  leaders to abandon daylight, precision  bombing in spite of Hansell's  efforts.
