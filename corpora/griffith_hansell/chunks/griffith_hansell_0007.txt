nsell to the Quebec Conference  to plead the case of American  strategic bombing before President Roosevelt in the wake of the Schweinfurt/Regensburg  Mission. Hansell also accompanied Roosevelt's  party to Cairo where he coordinated  the planning for the strategic  bombing of Japan. Arnold had placed much effort and expense in the new B-29 and entrusted  Hansell with preparing  the operational  plans for the new weapon . The result of Hansell's  efforts was the creation  of the world's first "global" bombardment  force -- the Twentieth  Air Force. This unique organization  had its headquarters  in Washington, but had operational  units in India, China, and the Marianas. The sole mission of the Twentieth  Air Force was the strategic bombardment  of Japan. Arnold was to command the force, but Hansell was its chief of staff. With Arnold's far-flung interests  and poor health, Hansell had a virtual free hand to mold this bomber force for the mission envisioned  at the Air Corps Tactical School: daylight,  precision  bombardment. The Americans  had left the terror bombing in Europe to the RAF Bomber Command, playing only small roles in such attacks as the fire bombing of Hamburg in July 1943. But 4  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 16 --- Americans  had long been aware that Japanese  cities were prime targets for such fire attacks and had conducted  tests and prepared  weapons which would make such raids possible. The Americans  held a singular  animosity  toward the Japanese and these ill feelings would later translate  into justification for the destruction  of Japanese  cities, first by fire bombing and then by nuclear attack. Hansell was certainly  aware of the new incendiary  weapons, but maintained  his steadfast belief in the precision  bombardment  of military  and industrial targets . As chief of staff of the Twentieth  Air Force he had insisted  that General Wolfe's XX Bomber Command  operating  out of China conduct daylight,  precision  attacks. Under
