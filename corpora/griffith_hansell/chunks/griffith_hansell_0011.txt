the United States against Germany during World War II. This campaign, which 8  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 20 --- lasted from August 1942 to April 1945 called for "undermining the enemy military  capability  to fight as well as the enemy national 'will' by destroying  the physical elements which support the military forces and the societal will to wage war." 2 General Hansell acknowledged  the fact that the campaign failed to accomplish  the operational  strategy as planned, but concluded that, if air power had not been diverted to the Mediterranean  and had been concentrated  on essential  economic targets , the strategic  air campaign  could have been successfully  completed  before the Normandy  invasion in June 1944. Had this been the case, Germany would have collapsed  much earlier because  Hitler would have been unable to sustain the war materially. 3 2 Hansell and Hansell, "Air Power in National  Strategy ." 3 Ibid.Colonel Hansell, building upon his father's thesis, continued  the speech by maintaining  that a constant  force of 200 modern bombers (B-1 and B-2) , using conventional,  unguided bombs weapons could reasonably replicate the entire destructive  effect of strategic bombing (area bombing included) of Germany in World War II in just 21 operational days . Moreover , a force of 230 such bombers , using conventional  weapons could fatally weaken the Soviet Union's ability to make war. This was predicated  on the assumption that SDI would have been successfully  deployed  and that the bomber force suffered  no more than a 2 percent attrition  rate 9  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 21 --- per day for twenty-one  days. SDI would theoretically  protect the United States from missile attack while the Air Force would deploy the B-1B, with its low radar profile which would protect it from being detected  and shot down, and the B-2, which has almost no radar profile . In addition  to the stealth aircraft , the Air Force would attack Soviet
