The 1907 Hague Conference  included  a prohibition  on the bombardment  of " towns and villages , dwellings,  or buildings  that are not defended." 6 7 The fear of aerial bombardment  opened an entirely  new debate concerning  morality  and warfare . 6 Michael 2.

Industrial facilities  were mass producing everything  from sewing needles to machine gun bullets; advances  in transportation  had made the world a much smaller place ; political  advances had given rise to massive "peoples'  armies" . Novelties  such as heavier-than-air flight certainly  fit into the pattern of unlimited  progress.
