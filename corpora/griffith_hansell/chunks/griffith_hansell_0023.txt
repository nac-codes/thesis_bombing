At first he advocated  attacks at the sources of an enemy's strength, but grew more and more to favor attacks on an enemy's morale, believing that the psychological  "yield" of the RAF's attacks on towns along the Rhine during the First World War was twenty times more powerful  than the material  damage suffered. 24 24 Kennett, Strategic  Bombing , 57; Hansell, Strategic  Air War, 2; Ronald Schaffer, Wings of Judgment  : American  Bombing in World War II, (New York: Oxford University  Press, 1985), 20.Count Giovanni  Caproni was an early proponent  of the use of air power in the First World War.
