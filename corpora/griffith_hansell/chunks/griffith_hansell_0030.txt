trategic  air war doctrine. The Army Air Corps advocated attacking  specific  economic targets in daylight  with massive numbers of bombers flying in formation. Historian  Ronald Schaffer points out that selective  bombing was better for publicity  in America; it fit the kind of equipment  available and it represented  the best way for Air Corps officers  to get the most out of a shrinking  budget . This was, for the reasons stated above , a clear departure from Douhet's concept of massive, violent attacks directly  against civilians .41 41 Ibid, 28-30; David Macisaac , Strategic  Bombing  in World War II: The Story of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey , (New York: Garland, 1976), 7 ; Barry Watts, The Foundations  of U.S. Air Doctrine , (Maxwell  AFB; Air University Press, 1984), 17-18. 42 Clausewitz,  164.The new technology  of the B-17 existed  only in peace-time practice;  it had yet to experience  the realities  of war. The unexpected  is to be expected on the battlefield,  which embodies the idea of "frictions " as explained  by Clausewitz . "Friction  [he wrote] is the only conception  which in a general way corresponds  to that which distinguishes  real war from war on paper . "42 it had been assumed by those who popularized strategic  air war and the serious theorists  that the "bomber would always get through ." Douhet had examined  some of the potential problems of strategic air war such as improved safety, better materials  in aircraft  construction,  increased carrying  capacity  and radius of action, and more speed with 31  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 43 --- less fuel consumption . Yet, no one addressed the real frictions  of strategic  air warfare. 43 43 Douhet, 62 . 44 MacIsaac, "Voices from the Central Blue," 635.Even after the experiences  of the Great War the theorists viewed strategic bombing far too simplistically . The strategic  bombing  campaign  itself was seen merely as a problem of targeting, but in order to select the
