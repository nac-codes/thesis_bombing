the Army Air Forces were pragmatists , but Hansell clearly exhibited  the temperament  and will to chart a particular  course of action and then throw himself into the task of carrying  it out. The course he charted  was daylight,  precision  bombardment  and he would risk his life and ultimately  sacrifice  his military career for the sake of pursuing  this course in the face of the disapproval  of his peers and superiors .47 47 Ibid, 7-10; MacIsaac, "Voices from the Central Blue, " 626.Hansell's  career serves as a microcosmic  view of the course of strategic  bombing  policy  before and during World War II.

His efforts were instrumental  in preparing  the watershed  document , AWPD-1 which served as the United States military's  basic air war plan all through the war. In fact, his planning abilities  were so important  that he was the only airman involved  in formulating the AWPD-1, AWPD-42, and the plan for the Combined Bomber Offensive . As a wing commander  in the Eighth Air Force from August 1942 to July 1943, he set the standards  for bombing  and air combat in that theater of operations . After further planning  duties in England, he returned  to Washington  where he planned the strategic  air war against Japan and created and commanded the first independent  strategic air force in history. From October 1944 to January 1945 he overcame the many frictions  of aerial combat to launch the first heavy bomber raids on Japan from the Marianas .
