school work. Perhaps the most important  lesson he learned  was horsemanship. He served as a wrangler on a surveying expedition  and developed  a love for horses which would serve him well in later Army life. The time spent in New Mexico did give the young teenager a taste of the active, adventurous life but his father's  objectives  were not achieved. 9 9 Ibid.Young Haywood arrived at Sewanee Military  Academy near Chattanooga,  Tennessee,  as a freshman  in 1916. This private military high school was his father's answer to his poor academic standing. By 1918, however, now Lieutenant  Colonel Hansell was in France with the American  Expeditionary Force. The separation  of father and son by distance  did not break the strong emotional  bond between the two. In a letter dated May 29, 1918, Colonel  Hansell  revealed  that his son's progress  was very much on his mind when he wrote, "Well, when Mother's 44  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 56 --- letter about your school reports reached  me, I decided  to wait for the next report , hoping it would show improvement  -- and thank goodness and you, I was not disappointed.  " Here the father acknowledged  his son's slow climb to success but went on to add, "If you do your best, remember Dad is always willing to forget the short comings ." Young Haywood was expected to succeed and was also expected to take on the additional  burdens brought on by the war: "France and the end of the war are both so far away, that you will have to assume responsibilities  earlier than you would otherwise . This is hard on you, but I don't see how it could be avoided.  " He offered  another  glimmer  of pride in his son by stating that if he were killed he had "a fine boy to carry on the work. " He concluded  by reminding  his son, "... don't let Mother worry about you. You know how wrapped up she is in you and your career.  "10 10 Colonel  Haywood  S. Hansell, Sr. , to Haywood  S.
