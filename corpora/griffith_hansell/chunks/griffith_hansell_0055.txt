over to a near stall before hurling back toward earth. At the apex of the maneuver  nothing  was visible, not even each other's aircraft. Hansell, thinking  quickly, rolled and came down. The three were startled  during the descent to see that they were still in formation but Hansell and Williamson  had emerged on opposite sides of Chennault. This was either evidence of superb teamwork, or as Hansell concluded,  blind luck.38 37 Shalett, 95. 38 Byrd, 41-42.Once the team tied ten-foot  ropes to their aircraft,  but they often flew much closer than that anyway. On one occasion Hansell's  P-12 blew into the tail of Chennault's,  tearing up Chennault's  stabilizers  and elevators. Chennault  proved he was indeed a superb aviator by landing safely using only the throttle  to bring his airplane  in to the field.

In those days he was known as "Pursuit Possum" because  he favored  the virtues of the fighter or pursuit airplane over the bomber . The basic question  in the debate was simple, "Could pursuit, operating in the defense of a target, destroy  bombers at a rate high enough to make a bombing offensive  impracticable?" 40 Chennault  argued that bombers could be detected, intercepted,  and destroyed. Even though Hansell  was a loyal pursuit  pilot, his position  in this Air Corps debate would be turned around completely  when he was accepted  as a student at the Air Corps Tactical  School in 1934.41 Hansell's  uncertainty  about the future of the Army Air Service was shared by the institution  itself. Mitchell  had been advocating  an independent  air force for years , but in the wake of the successful  battleship  tests the Chief of the Air Service , Major General Mason M. Patrick rather wanted the air arm to be elevated
