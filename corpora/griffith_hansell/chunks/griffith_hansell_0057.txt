In an effort to placate critics the Board recommended  changing the name from Air Service to Air Corps, giving the Air Corps representation  in the General Staff , and that assistant secretaries  in charge of aviation  be added to the War, Navy , and Commerce  Departments .43 62  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 74 --- The Air Corps Act of 1926 was the direct result of the report of the Morrow Board . On July 2, 1926, the Army Air Service  became the Army Air Corps , but the new name was purely cosmetic  because there was no change in status; the Air corps would still be a combat branch of the Army with less prestige than the Infantry. The position  of Assistant  Secretary  of War for aviation was created, steps were taken to regularize flying officers'  pay, rating, and promotion,  and a five-year program was instituted  which would eventually  give the Air Corps 1,800 serviceable  aircraft  and the crews to fly them.44 44 Ibid, 29. 45 Ibid, 29-30.Critics who felt that the Air Corps Act of 1926 did not go far enough were vindicated  when funds to expand the Air Corps were not available  and the other reforms failed to meet expectations . From 1926 to 1931 twelve bills for the creation of a separate  department  of aeronautics  and seventeen  bills for a single department of defense were introduced in Congress , but not one had succeeded. Compromise  was in the air, however . In 1931 General Douglas MacArthur , the Army Chief of Staff, and Admiral William Pratt, Chief of Naval Operations,  agreed that Army aviation's  role in national defense would be limited to coast defense. This agreement further clarified  the mission  of the Air Corps and eventually contributed  to the creation  of the GHQ Air Force. 45 In 1933 Major General Hugh Drum headed a board which 63  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 75 --- explored  an expanded  role for the Air Corps . The Drum Board's recommendation  was for the creation of a GHQ Air Force of 1,800 aircraft . This was
