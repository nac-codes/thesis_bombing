If this had been the case the students would have limited themselves  to studies in coastal defense and consequently would have been unprepared  for the realities of military aviation in World War II. Rather they introduced  their students to the underlying  philosophy of war and in so doing hoped explore new methods of waging it. In 1929 ACTS adopted the motto  : Proficimus  More Irretenti (We Make Progress Unhindered  by Custom)  . This motto was highly symbolic  because by 1930 ACTS had shifted emphasis from the familiar  pursuit aviation to bombardment  aviation, which existed mainly in theory and depended on technology  which had yet to be developed. 50 in the early days ACTS regarded pursuit aviation as 66  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 78 --- central to air operations . This belief was summed up in the 1925-26 text entitled Employment  of Combined Air Force  : " Pursuit in its relation to the air service . . . may be compared  to the infantry  in its relation  to the other branches of the Army. Without pursuit, the successful  employment  of the other air branches is impossible." 51 War Department doctrine had been based on the Clausewitzian  principle  as expressed  in the Field Service Regulations  of 1923 : "The ultimate objective in all military operations is the destruction  of the enemy's armed forces by battle . Decisive defeat in battle breaks the enemy's  will to war and forces him to sue for peace . "52 In 1926 ACTS amended this by stating that air power could strike deep into enemy territory  at the vital points of the enemy's infrastructure
