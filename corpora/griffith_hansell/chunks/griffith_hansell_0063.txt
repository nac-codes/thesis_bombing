American air power doctrine,  but his hellish  vision of initial attacks against the enemy civilian  population  was all but rejected  out of hand. Even Mitchell  thought a few gas bombs could paralyze the population  of a city, but ACTS refused to accept this particular  concept for a number of reasons . In later years Hansell explained  one reason for this rejection:  "The idea of killing thousands  of men, women , and children  was basically repugnant  to American  mores . And from a more pragmatic  point of view, people did not make good targets for the high 69  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 81 --- explosive bomb.57 58 Ronald Schaffer explains another reason for the rejection  of attacks  directed  toward civilians  : "Selective  bombing also fit very well the kind of equipment and bombing techniques  the Air Corps was developing,  and it seemed the most efficient  way of using the nation's scarce military  resources . 1,58 New technologies  had made it easier for the Americans  to avoid the politically  unacceptable  idea of bombing civilians , therefore,  Douhet was influential  at ACTS in terms of formulating  basic concepts , not in terms of designing  a specific  strategic  bombing doctrine . As so often happens in military aviation, the existing technology determined  the parameters  of the doctrine  which would direct it. 57 Hansell , Strategic  Air War, 13, 14. 58 Schaffer,  Wings , 29.In technological  terms the bomber of the 1930s was indeed the queen of the skies . With the B-10 and later with the B-17 Flying Fortress , both of which could achieve speeds of two hundred miles per hour or better, there were no pursuit aircraft  in existence  that could overtake  the bombers from the rear . For pursuit aircraft  to be successful  against bombers they would have to meet them head on. With out a sufficient early warning  system this was all but impossible;  radar was as yet unknown . Even if by chance the pursuit aircraft  overtook the bombers ,
