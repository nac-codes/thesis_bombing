Force section. The section chiefs during Hansell's  three years were first Harold George, then Donald Wilson, and finally Muir "Santy" Fairchild. Many future Air Force leaders such as John Cannon, Ira Eaker, Newton Longfellow,  Elwood Quesada, Nathan Twining, Kenneth Wolf, Orvil Anderson, Earle Partridge,  and a host of lesser- known officers were students of Hansell . Hansell found himself in company with the most important advocates of strategic  air war in the United States Army and, for that Bombs, Cities, and Civilians 19; 76  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 88 --- matter, in the world.72 72 Finney , 21, 23, 24, 58-61, 64-77. 73 Byrd, 62 ; Mrs. Haywood S.

The Chinese government made it profitable  for Americans to join their struggle against the Japanese . Luke Williamson  and Billy McDonald, frustrated  at not receiving  regular commissions,  had already joined Chennault. One day Chennault  called Mrs. Hansell and asked to see Pos. When Chennault  arrived, she prepared  tea for the two but remained  close at hand so she could hear the conversation.  Chennault offered  a position  in his expedition to Hansell , who promptly  turned him down citing his career and most of all the fact that he did not wish to leave his family. Chennault,  impatient  with his subordinate's  attitude,  informed Hansell that he too had a wife and children  and that he was leaving them and that Hansell could do the same . At that point Mrs. Hansell burst into the room and ordered Chennault to leave at once without saying another word and promptly showed him to the door. This removed all doubt about Hansell's  new career choice and alienated  Chennault  for the rest of his life.73 With Harold George and Claire Chennault  together  at
