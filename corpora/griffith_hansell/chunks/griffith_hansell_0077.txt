to attack strategic  ground targets it should not be included in a striking force. Hansell's 87 Haywood S.

Yet as a junior officer  Hansell  did make some unique contributions.  In some lectures he explored the use of chemical weapons to neutralize  the air bases and bridges of invading forces, although  he assumed  that these actions  would only occur during an actual invasion  of the United States and that the use of poison gas would come only out of desperation. 91 In another project  Hansell  put his engineering  skills to use by preparing curves of probability  from which the probability  of the number of bomb hits on a target based on a given number of bombs dropped and average accuracy. 92 Hansell's greatest contribution  revealed a talent which would serve him well later: gathering and understanding  foreign military intelligence.  In his lectures,  he would routinely  compare the theory being taught at ACTS with actual air combat in China 86  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 98 --- and Spain . For example he stated
