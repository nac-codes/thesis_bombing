in Berlin, Hansell Papers (Microfilm  Edition) , AFHRC , Maxwell AFB.The War Department  G-2 offered  Hansell and White no help whatsoever . Not surprisingly,  G-2 vigorously  opposed the collection  and analysis of this type of information,  arguing that "it did not relate to proper military intelligence. " In addition  to this problem, the assistant  military  attaches  for air ran into trouble collecting  information. For example, during the invasion  of Poland the only sources of information came from the press, conversations  with colleagues , and a knowledge  of German air doctrine  and tactics , none of which could reveal what was actually  happening  at the front . Yet Hansell dutifully  analyzed the reports, most of which were little better than reading the New York Times . Never one to back down from a challenge, Hansell committed  himself to finding new ways of gathering  information  on his own.16 In July 1940 Hansell was appointed Chief of the 96  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 108 --- Operations  Planning  Branch , Foreign Intelligence  Section.

Lowe who was a specialist  in diplomatic  history. He also lured Dr. Malcom Moss who was an expert in oil production and had traveled  widely and had seen many potential  targets first hand.17 17 Hansell, Air Plan, 50; Hansell, Strategic  Air War, 23. 18 Personal Interview  by Bruce C.
