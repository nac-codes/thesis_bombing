Major Moss's assessment  of the German electrical  system had been invaluable  to Hansell and he made full use of it. As historian  James Gaston wrote, "At 1:30 [p.m. ] on Thursday, 7 August, the gentle, red-haired  Southerner  knew more than Rudolph  Vogel . 1,60 Of course, Hansell realized  there would be problems  with targeting  electrical  systems such as generating plants and switching  stations . The generating  plants were bound to be heavily defended; the stations were small and difficult  to hit from high altitude,  dams were vulnerable,  but difficult  to get to.59 60 61 Even though , as we shall see, this target system was later rejected, it had much merit . As historian  Alan Levine noted: "The only weak spot, perhaps , was a strained  electrical  power system. Otherwise,  there were few weak points in the German war economy, and they were not 59 Ibid. 60 Gaston, 32; Rudolph Vogel was the director of the Reisholz  electrical  power station near Dusseldorf. 61 Hansell, Strategic  Air War, 35; Hansell , Air Plan , 81. 116  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 128 --- obvious .

He determined  that inland waterways carried 25% of the total freight carried  in Germany. He estimated  that the destruction of 9 locks, 3 ship elevators,  and inland harbor facilities  at Mannheim and Duisburg would paralyze the existing inland waterway establishment . In terms of rail transportation , Hansell estimated  that the destruction  of 15 marshalling  yards and 15 other "
