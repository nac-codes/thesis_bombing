at Mannheim and Duisburg would paralyze the existing inland waterway establishment . In terms of rail transportation , Hansell estimated  that the destruction  of 15 marshalling  yards and 15 other "sensitive  points within the rail net" would cause the "disintegration  and failure of the transportation system in Germany ." This was significant  since Hansell estimated  that 72% of German traffic was by rail . Thus with seventeen  targets in the German inland waterway system and thirty targets in the German rail system, their destruction could be insured  with 1,410 group missions .63 Hansell was very sanguine about the prospects of destroying  the German petroleum industry . He pinpointed twenty-seven  synthetic  oil plants which, according  to Hansell , accounted for "nearly 50% of Germany's crude petroleum. " Since the Luftwaffe,  German Army, and Kriegsmarine  were so dependent on POL (petroleum, oil, and lubricants) the 117  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 129 --- destruction  of these plants would all but halt their supply of gasoline. Most importantly,  he estimated  that 80% of the aviation  gasoline came from these plants . The plants were located  in central and western  Germany, and thus would be more easily targeted. Therefore,  with only 810 group missions,  the petroleum  industry  of Germany  would be practically  useless .64 The most controversial  of Hansell's  target systems was the proposed  attack on the civil population  of Berlin. Only in the event that the whole structure  of the German state "seemed on the verge of collapse" would the attack be ordered. 65 In fact it was not given much attention  in AWPD- 1: 64 AWPD-1 , Tab 2 ; Hansell, Air Plan , 82. 65 Hansell , Air Plan , 93. 66 AWPD-1, Tab 2. 67 Hansell, Air Plan , 93.Immediately  after some very apparent results of air attacks on the material objectives  listed above or immediately after some major set-back  of the German ground forces, it may become highly profitable  to delive
