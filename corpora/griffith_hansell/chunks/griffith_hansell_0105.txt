ter some very apparent results of air attacks on the material objectives  listed above or immediately after some major set-back  of the German ground forces, it may become highly profitable  to deliver  a large scale, all- out attack on the civil population  of Berlin. In this event , any or all the bombardment  forces may be diverted for this mission. No special bombardment force is set up for this purpose .66 Here Hansell maintains that the attack may become highly profitable.  Later he wrote  : "We stressed  the point that until that time [Germany  on the verge of collapse] there was reason to doubt the efficacy of simply bombing civilians." 67 Yet, 118  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 130 --- since Germany  had surrendered  in 1918 in part because  of civil unrest following set-backs on the battlefield,  there was reason to believe that such an attack was justified,  but only under certain  conditions . Hansell  went so far as to point out that no bombardment  force was set up for the purpose . But, as Conrad Crane points out : "This one-time  exception  to general policy was sanctioned  only as a way to end the war quickly, but late in the war this concept of an aerial Todestoss (deathblow)  would prove a potent lure for American leaders , helping to sanction  the use of the atomic bomb."68 Hansell had allowed the one tiny crack in his strategic bombing doctrine that would ultimately  change the entire concept of strategic  bombing in the eyes of many highly-placed  American Air Force generals . 68 Crane , Bombs , 26 .Before any of these target systems could be attacked  in strength, AWPD-1 listed an "Intermediate"  target  : the Luftwaffe. The plan, however , was not for air-to-air  combat , because at ACTS these men had dismissed  the very idea of great battles between aircraft  and, as Hansell had put it at ACTS , no "death ray" had yet been invented . The only way for a strategic air force to destroy fighter opposition  was to destroy the German air
