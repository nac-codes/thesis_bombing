An additional  twelve groups of B-29s would be based in the Middle East. The plan even made provisions  for the giant B-36 which could bomb Europe from bases in the United States. As it turned out, B-29s would not be ready for the air war in Europe and B-36s would be the intercontinental  bombers of the post-war  period, but Hansell and his colleagues  had prepared  a detailed  plan which they believed  would win the war.71 71 Hansell, Strategic  Air War, map opposite  pages 36 and 37. 72 Gaston, 34.Thus the watershed  document  of America's  air strategy  in World War II was completed  by the deadline of 1:30 p.m. on Sunday, August 12, 1941. Hansell's  contribution  was crucial, not only for preparing  the document, but also in giving it lasting value as a war plan. As James Gaston observed, "Hansell's  analysis was clean, thorough, and intelligent  -Â­ exactly  what was needed." 72 After World War II AWPD-1 came under criticism  for a number of flaws . Craven and Cate's classic study of the Army Air Forces in World War II found the plan to be deficient  in that it did not allocate sufficient  forces for strategic defense in the Pacific, while providing for too much hemispheric  defense  in the Americas. Of course, there was the 121  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 133 --- argument  that Germany  was not defeated  by air power alone and that the invasion  support was weak in fighters . While it is difficult  to argue with these conclusions,  they overlook  the most fundamental  flaw in AWPD-1. 73 73 Craven and Cate, 1, 149. 74 Alan S.
