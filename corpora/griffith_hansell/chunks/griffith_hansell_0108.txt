Germany  was not under the economic stress Hansell and others believed. As economic  historian  Alan Milward  observed: Seen from outside its frontiers  National Socialist  Germany  was a country  which had already geared its economy to the more absolute  limit of war potential . It was widely assumed that the German state in 1939 had long been fully prepared for a major war and that Germany's economic resources were wholly engaged in the purpose of war. All Allied strategic planners started from this assumption, but nothing could have been farther from the truth. 74 The error, of course, was not Hansell's  alone .

This information  shocked many when it was discovered  after the war. Hansell's  estimation  of numbers of targets , numbers  of group missions,  and identification  of subÂ­ targets within such target systems as the petroleum  industry was inadequate .

Hansell himself expressed  regrets that fighters were not included, "...neither  AWPD-1 or AWPD-42 called for escort fighters,  and patently  this was the greatest  deficiency  in both plans...We did not think it possible to build an airplane that had [a] couple thousand miles of range , that would
