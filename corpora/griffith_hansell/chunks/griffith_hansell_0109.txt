alled for escort fighters,  and patently  this was the greatest  deficiency  in both plans...We did not think it possible to build an airplane that had [a] couple thousand miles of range , that would also have the maneuverability  to enter into combat with an airplane  that has simply come up from the ground into the target area." 76 The inability  of the bomber to defend itself would lead to a 21% loss at Schweinfurt  and the Luftwaffe  would be destroyed  in the end by escort fighters,  not by destroying  German aircraft factories .77 Yet, the AWPD had used the best information available  at the time and, as Hansell later related, "We were told that [escort fighters  would be impossible]  by most of the aeronautical  people with whom we had dealt . . . and the air strategy  people accepted  the concept that we are going to have to fight our way through to defend ourselves  simply because it was either that or give up."78 Other criticisms  of AWPD-1 have emerged . Historian  Barry Watts, in considering  the method in which the numbers were 123  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 135 --- estimated,  added his criticism  of the overall strategic  scope of the document  : "I would , therefore, argue that their thinking  was mechanistic  in character  â€” more akin to that of artillery  officers  laying out a plan of fire against inanimate targets than to classical, Clausewitzian  strategists." 79 Hansell later admitted  that they had concentrated  on winning the war with the fewest American casualties  and had paid little attention  to "what happened  afterward. "80 But it is certain that in preparing  the air campaign against Germany they had adhered to principles  of strategic  air war they had earlier espoused. After all, Clausewitz's  objective  was to compel an enemy to yield by using the appropriate  level and type of violence against him. The AWPD had planned a revolutionary  method of achieving that objective, but the ideas had clearly come from the ACTS in
