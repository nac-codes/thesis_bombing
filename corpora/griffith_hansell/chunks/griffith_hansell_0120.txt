the end of their disagreement . The JSC accepted the "Germany-First " principle, but then suggested  sending  a strategic  bombing  force to guard the route between Hawaii and Australia. Not only was this an inappropriate  way to deploy bombers , it would have taken away from the proposed  mission of the yet-to-be  formed Eighth Air Force .
