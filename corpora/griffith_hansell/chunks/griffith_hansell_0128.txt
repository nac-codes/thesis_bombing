ntial  change between  AWPD-1 and AWPD-42 at a strategic  level. Yet military necessity  dictated  some important  changes in the structure  of the plan. It was feared that Russia would collapse at any time and since air power was the only area in which the Allies had a numerical  superiority,  it would be up to the air forces to hold Germany at bay while the surface forces grew. This meant that strategic  air power would have to be used to bomb U-boat facilities  and provide air support for surface forces in the Mediterranean  and the Pacific. The Eighth Air Force would have to alter its target list and make provisions  to work more closely  with RAF Bomber Command. 17 17 Copp, Forged in Fire , 298; Hansell, Air Plan , 102-103; Craven and Cate, II, 277.The intended  purpose of AWPD-42, like its predecessor, was to project aircraft production  needs. Hansell and his team more than doubled the required  production  over AWPD-1's projected  total of 68,416 aircraft of all types to 146,902 aircraft  of all types to be built in 1943. The actual total was eventually  lowered to 127,000 airplanes,  80,500 of which would be combat types . These figures included  aircraft for the USAAF, the Navy, and our allies. The types of aircraft included  tactical,  training,  liaison, transport,  gliders, and bombing aircraft. Seventy-six  heavy bomb groups were projected  with a total 1943 production  of 3,648 B-17s and B- 146  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 158 --- 24s. The 10,000-mile  B-36 was dropped from the plan because Hansell and his planners  realized  that Great Britain  would be secure and could provide 130 air bases. 18 18 Hansell, Air Plan , 109; United States Strategic  Bombing Survey Secretariat, "Memorandum  on Bombardment  Planning Documents  (AWPD-1, AWPD-42, COA Report, POINTBLANK, " 30 March 1945, Spaatz Papers , Box 66, Library of Congress. 19 Hansell, Air Plan , 109-111;  USSBS, "Memo on Bombardment Planning  Documents ."AWPD-42 also called for 230,243
