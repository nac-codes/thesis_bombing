OA Report, POINTBLANK, " 30 March 1945, Spaatz Papers , Box 66, Library of Congress. 19 Hansell, Air Plan , 109-111;  USSBS, "Memo on Bombardment Planning  Documents ."AWPD-42 also called for 230,243 officers and 1,554,104 enlisted men for the USAAF, 1,140,363 tons of bombs, 4,888,941,000  gallons of gasoline,  and 17,421,507  ship tons in order to transport  all its necessities  to the battle fronts in 1943. Hansell and his team then projected  the number of USAAF aircraft  which would be needed in each theater of operations. The United Kingdom got the lion's share with 7,268 aircraft; North Africa was allotted 824; the Middle East was given 448; the Far East received  676; and the China-Burma-India  Theater was projected  to have 950.19 Like AWPD-1, AWPD-42 went beyond production  requirements to produce a plan for the use of strategic  bombers . A fairly detailed analysis of a bombing campaign against Japan was drawn up which projected  that 51,480 bomber sorties against 123 Japanese target systems would bring the Empire to its knees. The B-29 would not be ready until late 1944, but neither would bases that were within range of Japan. The revisions  in AWPD-1's  list of target systems  would have a more immediate  impact since the strategic  air war against Germany 147  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 159 --- was still the first priority. 20 20 Hansell, Air Plan , 108. 21 Copp, Forged in Fire , 298; Hansell , Air Plan , 107; Fabyanic , 120.As in the first plan, AWPD-42 placed German aircraft factories , Luftwaffe  airfields,  and industries  which supported aircraft production at the top of the list. This "intermediate " target was important  because even AWPD-42 did not include fighter escort . It was still believed  that the bomber was self-defending,  but perhaps  more importantly  it was not thought possible  to design an escort fighter which would have the range to cover B-17s and B-24s over Germany . The Eighth Air Force had only completed  six miss
