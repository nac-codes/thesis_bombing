1942 was bleak for the Hansell family. Ethyl Kuter, wife of General Kuter, offered Dotta the Kuters' more comfortable  quarters at Fort Myer for the holidays, where Dotta and the children  enjoyed a Christmas  dinner of cheese sandwiches. This was a difficult  time for Mrs. Hansell, but she worked hard to keep her despair from the children. In early 1943 Dotta developed  pneumonia  and all three of the children  got sick at the same time. Possum's sister, Susan Vance, called from Tampa each day for ten days but Mrs. Hansell pretended  all was well . Finally  Mrs. Arnold took it upon herself to contact Mrs. Vance and inform her of her sister-in-law's  plight. Susan arrived the next day and took charge. First she checked Dotta into Walter Reed Army Hospital. Then she sublet the house, found new tires for the car (a miracle in war time) , and made arrangements  for the care of Tony and Lucia. Susan then took Dennett, who was still sick, back to Tampa on the train. When she regained  her health, Mrs. Hansell drove the other two children  to Florida and eventually  settled in a quiet community  called Indian Rocks, where Possum would later join them.32 32 Mrs. Haywood S.
