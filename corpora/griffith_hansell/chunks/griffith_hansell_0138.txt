the 322nd Bombardment  Group and the 42nd Service Group. Hansell's  main task was to get his wing ready for combat as soon as possible. By the second day of command  he was in conference  with his group commanders  and had inspected  most of their facilities.  His greatest  problem was eliminating  the crews' fear of the B-26. Although  he had never flown one himself, on December  7 he began his education in flying the Marauder.
