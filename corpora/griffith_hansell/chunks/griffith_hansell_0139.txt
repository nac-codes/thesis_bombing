The VIII Bomber Command was divided into wings, with each wing consisting of numbered groups , each consisting of four numbered  squadrons. In January  1943 General  Baker could count on two heavy bomber wings, the 1st (which was equipped  with B- 17s) and the 2nd (which was equipped  with B-24s) .
