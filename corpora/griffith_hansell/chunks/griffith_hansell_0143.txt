Flying straight and level in the face of heavy opposition  was a nine-minute ordeal . After the Spitfires  departed, the Luftwaffe  pressed the attack from the front -- head-on attacks with a closing speed often in excess of five hundred miles per hour . In addition to this the anti-aircraft  fire or flak (short for Flieger Abwehr Kannonen ) was particularly  deadly because the Germans introduced  the highly-effective  "predicted  barrage ."
