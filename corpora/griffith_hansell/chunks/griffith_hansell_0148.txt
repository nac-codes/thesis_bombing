e found the gunners to be "woefully  ill-trained"  and sought to remedy the situation  by establishing  a gunnery school . The British Air Ministry provided  a site where war-weary  B-17s could tow targets , and LeMay provided  the gunnery instructor . Hansell recalled  the situation:  "The gunnery instructor  was slightly  tougher than Curt [LeMay]  , and I spent much of my time keeping him from being court-martialed  for his treatment  of his students . " When they attempted  to test gunnery against head-on attacks, the gunners shot the A-20 target plane down. Because of weather restrictions , most 1st Bomb Wing gunners got their gunnery practice  in combat .65 169  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 181 --- The toughest  problem  the air crews encountered  was indeed the head-on attacks. The solution was to make field modifications  of B-17s by placing flexible, hand-held 50 caliber machine guns in the nose of the aircraft. The chin turret of the B-17G did not arrive in England  until September 1943. Another solution  was the YB-40, a "destroyer  escort" version of the B-17. By placing an additional  turret to the aft of the aircraft  and providing  more machine gun ammunition it was believed  that this new aircraft  could "shepherd"  the bombers to and from the targets . They proved to be less than satisfactory. 66 The other problems  which confronted  1st Wing gunnery officers included air-to-air  bombing, long-range cannon fire, and long-range  rocket fire. There would be no satisfactory  defense against these German tactics until the escort fighters appeared. 67 66 Once the B-17s had released their payloads, their weight diminished  and thus their speed increased  causing them to leave the heavier YB-40s behind. 67 Hansell, Air Plan , 125; Craven and Cate, II, 265-266, 270.Hansell was quite effective in establishing  combat doctrines for formation flying, bombing, and defensive gunnery. These practices  would serve the Eighth Air Force for the most part
