A 20 mm shell struck Major Taylor in the head, 171  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 183 --- killing him instantly. A shell fragment hit the co-pilot, Second Lieutenant  Joseph Boyle, wounding  him in the leg, while flying glass from the explosion  lacerated  his face . 70 70 Martin Bowman , Castles in the Air, (Wellingborough, England: Patrick  Stephens,  1984), 37-38; Freeman, 23 ; "History of the 305th Bomb Group; " Wilbur Morrison, The Incredible 305th: The "Can Do" Bombers of World War II, (New York: A Jove Book, 1962), 24-26; "War Diary: 364th Bomb Squadron, " AFHRC , Maxwell AFB. 71 Morrison, The Incredible  305th , 26-29; "War Diary: 364th Bomb Squadron; " Copp, Forged in Fire, 332-333.At that point the "Dry Martini II" dove out of formation and fell 2,000 feet . Boyle thought that the engines were gone, but after he pulled Major Taylor's body from the controls  he managed to level the aircraft  off. Just as Boyle learned  that two of his crewmen  were also wounded , another  FW- 190 made a head-on  attack into the nose of the B-17 , blasting the oxygen masks from the faces of the navigator and bombardier . Both men recovered  their masks and continued firing for their lives . The interphone  was mostly knocked out, allowing  communication  only between the co-pilot, tail gunner , and navigator. Even though the aircraft  was out of formation  and had its hydraulic  system shot away, Boyle, much to his credit, managed to bring the stricken  "Dry Martini II" back to Chelveston.  Hansell, probably  positioned  in the radio compartment  during the action, left the business of managing the aircraft  back to base to the crew. Having come very close to death, Hansell would always know what it meant to send young men in B-17s over German-occupied  Europe .71 172  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 184 --- Seventy-two  B-1
