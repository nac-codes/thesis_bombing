On January 23 the 1st Wing launched  a disappointing  mission  to the Lorient /Brest U-boat facilities. Seventy-three  1st Wing aircraft were dispatched, of which only fifty-four  bombed the target. Fourteen  of the seventy-three  B-17s aborted  the mission  and no damage was reported  to the submarine  pens. Five B-17s were lost -- nearly seven percent of the force. The major mission of January 1943 was the raid on Wilhelmshaven.  Churchill wanted an American  day-light  attack on Germany and it was up to Hansell and his 1st Wing to deliver. Sixty-four  of Hansell's  B-17s set out for the target and only six aborted. German defenses so were confused that a British observer termed them "pathetic ." Even though German fighters  were out in force, only one B-17 was lost and the gunners downed as many as seven enemy attackers . The U-boat yards were not seriously  affected  by the attack, but the Eighth Air Force had made its long-anticipated  appearance  over Germany. 78 175  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 187 --- February's  weather  did not permit full operations . After two false starts because of unfavorable  weather, Hansell's bombers set out for Emden, Germany, on February  4. This raid over Germany  proved to be more costly than the first. Thirty- nine B-17s bombed Emden, stirring  up a "hornet's  nest" of Me- 110s, Ju-88s, in addition  to the usual Me-109s and FW-190s. This was the first time the Germans had sent twin-engined fighters into the battle against American bombers and the first time air-to-air  bombing  was used. Five B-17s were lost. Other problems surfaced as well. The electrically  heated suits fa
