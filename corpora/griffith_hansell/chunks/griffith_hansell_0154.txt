The electrically  heated suits failed, causing forty-three  cases of frostbite,  nine of them severe. The unheated  machine guns even froze up in the battle. 79 79 Mission  Report for 4 February  1943; "Summary  of Events, 1 February - 28 February 1943 ;" Craven and Cate, II, 324; Freeman, 25. 80 Copp, Forged in Fire, 364.On February 4, 1943, Lieutenant  General Frank Andrews assumed  command  of ETOUSA.
