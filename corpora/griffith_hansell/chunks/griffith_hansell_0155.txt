Missions could only be launched if there were enough fresh, trained crews , but by March an estimated seventy-three  crews were "war weary . 1,83 Hansell described his dilemma: During the early period when the bomber units of the eighth were finding themselves  and tempering  their quality  in the heat of combat , success or failure hung upon the human factor which had to sustain the greatest strain of all, the morale of the combat crews . . . The morning after each mission saw the breakfast table growing smaller. By March the crews of the initial groups were less that half st
