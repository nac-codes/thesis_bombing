not have to rely upon highly theoretical  calculations  as the AWPD planners had. They determined  that their objectives  would be achieved  through a four-phase  plan. In phase one (April - July 1943) the missions would be limited to the range of fighter support, which meant that the submarine  yards would be the targets . In phase two (July - October 1943) 1,192 heavy bombers would commit seventy-five  percent of their effort to fighter assembly  and aircraft  factories  within a radius of 500 miles , while committing  twenty-five  percent of their efforts on submarine  facilities . The third phase (October  1943 - January 1944) would deploy 1,746 heavy bombers , enough to perform  all assigned  tasks . The fourth phase (beginning  in early 1944) would commit 2,702 bombers on the combined offensive. The plan was quite realistic and contributed  to a generally 185  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 197 --- successful  bombing campaign .99 99 "Plan for Combined  Bomber Offensive  From the United Kingdom;"  Craven and Cate, II, 369-371; Fabyanic, 202. 100 Hansell, "Notes of a Bomber Commander,"  16; Copp, Forged in Fire, 385; Craven and Cate, II, 365-366, 372-373; Parton, 263.Hansell wrote the final draft of the CBO himself. General  Andrews  gave the plan his "unqualified"  endorsement  as did the Chief of the Air Staff and the Royal Air Force Bomber Command. General Baker took the plan Washington  and presented it to the Joint Chiefs of Staff on April 29, 1943. The Navy objected,  but on May 4, 1943, the JCS approved  the CBO Plan. On May 14 the JCS presented  the plan to the Combined  Chiefs at the TRIDENT Conference in Washington. It was the understanding  of the CCS that the plan would culminate  with a cross-channel  invasion on May 1, 1944. Thus Hansell had written  the plan that effectively  ended his dream of defeating Germany  with strategic  air power alone. Electric  power would not be a priority  target; the invasion  was now the object of the air
