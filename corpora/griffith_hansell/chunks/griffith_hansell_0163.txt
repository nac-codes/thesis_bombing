written  the plan that effectively  ended his dream of defeating Germany  with strategic  air power alone. Electric  power would not be a priority  target; the invasion  was now the object of the air offensive;  and the report recognized  the bomber's vulnerability  to fighters. Hansell was, above all, a good soldier. When given an order he did his best to carry it out. In essence, he had written  a plan that met the necessities  of war but that did not reflect his true vision of the proper use of an independent  strategic  bomber force. 100 Hansell  returned  to Brampton  Grange to face another  enemy -- the weather. Only four missions  were flown in the month of 186  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 198 --- April because of unfavorable  weather  conditions . On April 5 eighty-five  bombers attacked the Renault motor vehicle and armament  works at Ballancourt , Paris . Extensive  damage was inflicted, which cost the Wehrmacht 3,000 trucks and effectively  shut the factory down for some time. Four B-17s were lost in the action. The next day industrial  and aviation facilities  at Antwerp were bombed with a loss of four Flying Fortresses . On April 16 the port areas of Lorient and Brest were struck with a loss of four bombers . On April 17 the 1st Bomb Wing struck the Focke-Wulf  Flugzeugbau  at Bremen . According  to the returning  crews , "Enemy fighters  attacked  in great force and with great determination  after the bombers  had passed the I. P., continuing  their attacks until 1355 when the bombers were 30 or 40 miles out to sea on the way home." 101 Six Fortresses  from the 91st Group and ten from the 306th were shot down, a loss of fifteen percent of the attacking aircraft . Bomb damage was extensive,  however , with half the factory being destroyed. 102 101 Mission Report for 17 April 1943. 102 "Summary of Events , " 1st Bomb Wing; Mission Reports for 4, 5, 16, 17 April 1943 ; Craven and Cate, II, 316-319.Hansell truly enjoyed the public relations  si
