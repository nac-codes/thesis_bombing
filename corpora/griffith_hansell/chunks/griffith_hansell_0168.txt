averaged 6.4 percent per mission of those aircraft  actually  attacking  the target .114 114 " 1st Bombardment  Wing Battle Casualties,  " File 525.391, AFHRC Maxwell AFB; Craven and Cate, II, 317. 115 Craven and Cate, II, 316.What had all these brave young men accomplished?  Sixty- three percent of Eighth Air Force bombs had fallen on submarine  targets  which the Air Force had not planned  to bomb. The bombing  itself was accurate,  but the U-boat pens were much too thick for existing  bombs -- Kuter and Hansell had both considered larger ordinance the key to bombing U-boat facilities . On May 4, 1943, Admiral Karl Doenitz observed, "You know that the towns of St. Nazaire  and Lorient have been rubbed out as main submarine  bases . No dog or cat is left in these towns .

By contrast, little more than fifteen  percent  of Eighth Air Force bombs had 192  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 204 --- fallen on German aircraft targets . Of seven attacks on the German aircraft industry, four were successful , the most notable example being the April 17, 1943, mission to the Focke-Wulf  Flugzeugbau  at Bremen . Attacks on Germany itself had been relatively  successful , but very costly. The missions had not been escorted, but the Eighth had not been discouraged. 116 116 Ibid, 258, 317.Hansell 's achievement  lies in the fact that he led the Eighth Air Force in its formative  days . He commanded  all four of the B-17 groups and there were only two B-24 groups in the 2nd Bombardment  Wing. He established  the standard  operating procedures , defensive  formations,  and bombing standards  which carried the Mighty Eighth through her history. He had, after all, commanded  the forces that executed the first American daylight bombing raid on Germany, written
