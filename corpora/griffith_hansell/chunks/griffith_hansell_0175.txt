He concluded his letter to Baker by stating: "Although  my stay has protracted,  I believe it has paid dividends to the 8th Air Force . Certainly the opportunity  to talk to the President about the bomber offensive  was a gift from heaven."13 12 Hansell to Baker , July 24, 1943. 13 Ibid.On August 31 he accompanied  Arnold on an inspection  tour of England.
