took up the challenge and, as he later remembered, with much difficulty succeed in amending the statement of basic strategy. The new description  of the grand strategy  against Japan read : "The possibility  that invasion of the principal Japanese  islands may not be necessary  and the defeat of Japan may be accomplished  by sea and air blockade  and intensive  air bombardment  from progressively  advanced  bases . The plan must, however , be capable of expansion  to meet the contingency  of invasion.

This three-billion dollar project promised a bombing aircraft which was pressurized,  could fly to 30,000 feet, and carry a four-ton bomb load to a target 1,750 miles distant . The project had begun in November  1939 and after four years the aircraft  was nearly operational . It was so complicated  that it had more than the usual number of design flaws that had to be ironed out, but it was important  to get it into the war as soon as 17 Ibid, 19.

There were many doubts about Operation  MATTERHORN,  which called for the operation  of B-29s out of China. The basing of B-29s in China would cause tremendous  logistical  problems  and place the heavy bomber bases in danger of being captured  by Japanese  ground forces. In September  1943 (before Hansell joined the team) the Combined  Staff Planners  had concluded  that MATTERHORN  was unfeasible  from a logistical  point of view alone. 18 18 Craven and Cate, V, 7-9; Hansell, Japan , 21. 19 Hansell, Japan , 21; Army Air Force Historical  Office, History of the Twentieth  Air Force: Genesis , (Headquarters Army Air Forces, October 1945), 139, LeMay Papers, Box B-39, Library of Congress.General Arnold had requested that the Committee of Operations  Analysts draw up target lists for MATTERHORN anyway.
