d his colleagues  had formulated  at the Air Corps Tactical  School in the 1930s. Here was an opportunity  to use a much-improved  bombing  aircraft  in a theater  where he had the opportunity  of avoiding the administrative  red tape that existed in Europe and against an island nation that he felt offered the kind of targets suited for daylight precision bombing. His only concern with politics was in using his contacts to insure that his plan for the strategic  air war against Japan was adopted. While Arnold was using his influence and authority to get the B-29 operational,  he trusted Haywood Hansell to see that the appropriate  war plan and command organization  was created and adopted to make his 213  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 225 --- B-29 operations  a reality. This was indeed Hansell's  greatest opportunity  to influence  the course of American air power , because, while Arnold wanted his B-29s in action as soon as possible, he left the bulk of the decisions  concerning  the actual operations  up to Hansell . Hansell knew that the only appropriate  targets for the B-29 were to be found in Japan and that if they were going to be successful  the bombers would have to be concentrated against strategic  targets in the Japanese  home islands . Yet as early as July 1943 General Kenney had requested  B-29s for the South West Pacific , and by January  MacArthur  and the Navy were in rare agreement  that B-29s should be based at Darwin, Australia,  to attack Japanese  shipping  and oil targets in the Dutch East Indies . In fact, the Joint War Plan document  JWP2 recommended  placing the first four B-29 groups in the South West Pacific. Hansell alone opposed any deployment  except against Japan proper . He suggested  that the JWPC report had made insufficient  use of the COA report concerning  Japanese targets and had neglected  to consider  that bases in India and Ceylon could strike the same targets as aircraft based in Australia. At Hansell's  request,
