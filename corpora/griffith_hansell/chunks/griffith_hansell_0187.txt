use of the COA report concerning  Japanese targets and had neglected  to consider  that bases in India and Ceylon could strike the same targets as aircraft based in Australia. At Hansell's  request, the Joint Planning Staff sent the report back to the Joint War Plan Committee for revision, but when the paper was returned  on February  15 it still maintained  that Australia  was a better choice than China . In the final analysis, it was President  Roosevelt's decision  to proceed  with MATTERHORN , but Hansell fought for a 214  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 226 --- project in which he believed  deeply and emerged  from the first round on the winning side.37 37 Craven and Cate, V, 12, 29; Sherry, Rise , 166. 38 Ibid, 31.Also on February 15, Hansell presented to the Joint Chiefs the AAF's concept of the Pacific war.

Hansell was even willing, as an Army officer, to side with Nimitz over MacArthur  concerning  Pacific strategy. On March 12 the JCS decided to bypass Truk Island and launch an amphibious  attack on the Marianas,  with D-Day on Saipan set for June 15, 1944. Since the B-29s could reach Sumatra  via Ceylon, even a scaled- down request for the aircraft in the South West Pacific was rejected. After a struggle, Hansell had achieved concentration  of force against the only target systems that mattered  to strategic  bombers -- those located  on the Japanese islands themselves .38 By March 1944 the plan for MATTERHORN  was finalized  by the Joint Chiefs.

Since there would only be one wing operating out of China, the MATTERHORN  plan could not be fully implemented,  but Hansell made the most of what he had. As Craven and Cate observe, "The Joint Planners adhe
