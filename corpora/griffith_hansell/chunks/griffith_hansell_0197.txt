the policy of the Twentieth  Air Force during the war.56 56 Ibid.While Hansell  was working  out the administrative  problems in Washington , Brigadier  General Kenneth  Wolfe was wrestling with the operational  challenges  in India and China . He had arrived at New Delhi on January 13, 1944, to set up the advanced echelon of the XX Bomber Command staff . Since he reported  directly  to Arnold in Washington  and was technically not a part of the China-Burma-India  Theater  of Operations,  his difficulties  were compounded . The plan for MATTERHORN  called for the B-29s to be based in India and to conduct their combat missions against Japan from bases in China . The bases were being built even as Wolfe arrived  in India.

The next step was to transport  the necessary  supplies over the Himalaya  Mountains  — the "Hump" . Crossing  the mountains  was quite treacherous  because  of the weather  and the fact that the B-29 was still prone to engine failure . Of the one hundred and fifty B-29s that began the journey on April 24, five were lost and four were seriously  damaged .
