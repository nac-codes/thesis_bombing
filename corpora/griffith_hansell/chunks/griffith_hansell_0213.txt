7,000 feet runway were actually  paved. The other runway could not be used at all. Only forty hardstands  were ready, thus causing the B-29s to double park â€” a tempting target for Japanese  bombers . All other facilities  were woefully  behind schedule  and Isley Field was not substantially  completed  until April of 1945. It was obvious to Hansell that Saipan was not ready to receive the 12,000 men and 180 aircraft  of the 73rd Wing. There were similar delays on the islands of Tinian and Guam.21 Hansell's  supply problems  were overwhelming.  Craven and Cate describe the situation: "The XXI Bomber Command was unique in that it carried out its operations  without an air service command, without control of an air depot, without aviation  engineer  battalions  or ordinance  companies,  and with 245  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 257 --- the barest minimum of work and service troops.1,22 The first troops and supplies  for the depot on Guam did not arrive until November  9, 1944. The depot itself was combat loaded so it could be unloaded quickly and assembled. When the ship carrying  the depot arrived at Guam the harbor master allowed only twenty-four  hours to unload the ship. It was unloaded  in such a hurry that supplies  were scattered  all over the jungle and never recovered. Aircraft  supplies then had to be flown in from Sacramento,  over four thousand  miles away. The XXI Bomber Command  did not possess a working  aircraft  depot until February  1945.22 23 22 Craven and Cate, V, 53 6. 23 Ibid, 536, 543; Hansell, Japan , 34.Even though Hansell was pleased  with the cooperation  he received  from the Navy, supplies  were still slow in arriving. His supply officer, Colonel Sol Rosenblatt,  came up with a very creative  and surprising  solution  to the problem. One day early in the operation Rosenblatt  appeared at Hansell's headquarters  and requested  that the general accompany  him to the dock. When they arrived  Hansell  discovered  that he was in com
