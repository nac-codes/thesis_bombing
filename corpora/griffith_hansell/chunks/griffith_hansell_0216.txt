The Air Force was in the process of improving  its radar , but the improved  AN/APG-3  and AN/APG-15  radars were not ready for operations  and would not be until the last quarter of 1945. To make matters  worse, Hansell did not have a single target folder. Unlike his days in England  when he could rely upon the RAF for targeting  assistance,  he found Japan to be virgin territory  that had to be mapped out by F-13 photoÂ­ reconnaissance  aircraft .28 28 Hansell , Japan , 48; Hansell, Strategic  Air War, 170; Crane , Bombs , 67, 68, 74, 128; Norstad to Hansell , October 7, 1944, LeMay Papers , Box B-ll, Library of Congress;  Morrison, Point of No Return , 159.Weather had always been a problem for the Eighth Air Force in England, but at least they had weather stations to the west to help them make a forecast . In the Pacific, Hansell had to rely upon nightly flights of B-29s over Japan for his weather  predictions . Even though intelligence  sources had decoded Japanese  weather reports they had not been made available  to the XXI Bomber Command . Hansell gave his weather officer, Colonel James Seaver, qualified  praise by saying, "...often he was right." Japan was almost constantly  cloud covered and cloud formations  arose from 1,500 to 30,000 feet over the ocean, thus standing  between the assembly  points and the targets . The winds often reached 200 knots over the targets caused the bombers to drift 45 degrees , but the bomb 249  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 261 --- sights could correct for only 35 degrees . To further complicate  matters, winds at lower altitudes  often changed in direction  and velocity forcing the bombardier  to make an number of corrections .29 29 Hansell, Japan , 44; Schaffer,  Wings , 124.When a bomber of the Eighth Air Force was shot down over Europe the crew had reasona
