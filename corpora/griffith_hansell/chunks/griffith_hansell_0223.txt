The COA had given the Air Force the reasons for an incendiary campaign  against Japan and the JCS had set the date for the invasion of Kyushu (November  1, 1945), thus giving the Air Force the incentive to act quickly to bring about victory before the invasion. 40 40 Schaffer, Wings , 111; Sherry, Rise , 228; Hansell, Japan , 51. 41 Schaffer, Wings , 107-198, 115; Sherry, Rise , 228.The idea of launching incendiary  attacks on Japanese cities was not new or secret.

"Little Tokyos " had been erected  at Elgin Field, Florida, which tested incendiary  bombs against simulated  Japanese  cities. Colonel Perera of the COA and Twentieth  Air Force staff had again raised the issue of incendiary bombing in May 1944, recommending  that an incendiary  campaign  begin in the spring of 1945 when weather conditions  could maximize  the effect. 41 Michael Sherry contends that, "by September  the air staff apparently had committed itself to a major incendiary 257  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 269 --- campaign" and that, "The shift in emphasis may have been hastened  by the replacement  on August 20 of Hansell ...with Norstad, an eager advocate  of incendiaries.  ...1,42 General  Arnold tended to measure  success in terms of tons of bombs dropped over a target â€” not in how many bombs actually  destroyed  a target that was part of the strategic plan. Hansell was apparently  concerned  about his chief's attitude, because on July 26, 1944, he hand-delivered  a memorandum  to General Arnold: "Mere tonnage of explosives  is a fallacious  criterion.
