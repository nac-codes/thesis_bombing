9-40 session later spoke of only having ninety days at ACTS, LeMay flatly admitting that he learned " not much" at ACTS . Arnold naturally did not attended ACTS, but the officers who advocated  and ultimately  carried out the incendiary  raids on Japan were graduates  of the "short course. " LeMay, Norstad, and O'Donnell  all attended  ACTS during the 1939-40 session  and thus had missed the experience  (and indoctrination)  of the full nine-month  course .
