informed him that he could proceed with the mission. 55 55 Craven and Cate, V, 550. 56 Mission Folders nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, Record Group 18, National  Archives .On October  27, 1944, the 869th Squadron  of the 497th Bomb Group struck Dublon Island in the Carolines . The bombing  was discouraging,  but opposition  was light, with the anti-aircraft fire labeled "inaccurate ." Only one Japanese fighter plane made a feeble attempt to defend the island. The 73rd Wing conducted  similar strikes on October 30, November  2, November 5, and November  11. In each case the bombing  was poor and the enemy defense was just evident enough for the crews to say they had been under enemy fire . Yet the missions  served the purpose of giving the crews some experience  under "combat" conditions .56 As Hansell looked toward the XXI Bomber Commands first attack on Japan, he intended to lead the mission himself . Soon after he accompanied  one of the training missions to Truk, however , he was ordered to fly no more missions . He complained  in a letter to Norstad  that he had been careful not to receive  any information  which would prevent  him from flying combat missions and that he was surprised  at the order . At first he had intended  to ignore the order and lead the raid anyway . Before he could do so, a Navy lieutenant  accompanied by a petty officer gave Hansell a written copy of the order 264  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 276 --- and demanded  acknowledgement  of its receipt . In the meantime Hansell had received "certain  information " which he had been careful not to accept up to that point . It is certain that he knew too much about the breaking of the Japanese codes and probably  had slight familiarity  with the atomic bomb.57 57 Hansell to Norstad, November  1, 1944, Record Group 18, File 201, National  Archives  ; Norstad  to Hansell , November  13, 1944, Record Group 18, File 201, National  Archives  ; Hansell , Japan , 36-37  ; Sherry, Rise , 224. 58 Crav
