The next day the Japanese  struck. Although  the Japanese  bombers did no damage on this raid, the Marine air defense units had failed to protect Hansell's  base . As a result of the bombing  General O'Donnell  decided to attack the Japanese  airfields  on Iwo Jima, thus combining  training  with an effort to prevent future attacks . The bombing  results from the B-29 "practice"  attacks were poor and the Japanese  would be back. 58 On November 1, 1944, an F-13 from the 3rd Photo Reconnaissance  Squadron  piloted  by Captain Ralph D. Steakley became the first American airplane over Japan since the Doolittle  Raid. The photo/recon  version of the B-29 was appropriately  named the "Tokyo Rose" and experienced  a phenomenon  over Japan -- clear weather . Steakley's  crew was 265  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 277 --- able to take 7,000 photographs  of the Tokyo area from 32,000 feet . From these Hansell was able to compile target folders on the important  aircraft assembly  and engine facilities  in the Tokyo area. Hansell was excited about this development and sent copies to Arnold and Admiral Halsey. Instead of being impressed,  Halsey complained  that Hansell was simply stirring  up the Japanese  and requested  that the reconnaissance be halted. 59 59 Hansell , Japan , 36; Craven and Cate, V, 555; Hansell , Yenne Interview. 60 Craven and Cate, V, 554, 556 ; Kennett, Strategic Bombing , 169; Mission  Folder no. 7, XXI Bomber Command , Record Group 18, National  Archives .Hansell had submitted  his plan
