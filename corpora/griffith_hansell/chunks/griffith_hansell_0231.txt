Intelligence  estimates stated that the Japanese had six hundred and eight first-line  fighters . Preliminary  analysis of photos indicated  at least one hundred  and fifty heavy antiÂ­ aircraft guns and intense accurate fire was predicted. Japanese radar capabilities  were still unclear, but after a debate over countermeasures  between Hansell and Harmon , O'Donnell  decided  to drop "window"  over Nagoya as a diversion . The target, in accordance  with JCS directives  concerning targeting,  was the Nakajima-Musashino  aircraft  complex  outside Tokyo . The plant was responsible  for twenty-seven  percent of Japanese  aircraft  engines .60 As the date to execute SAN ANTONIO I approached , Hansell 266  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 278 --- was confronted  with three crises which presented  difficulties far above the already perplexing  operational  frictions .

This would confuse Japanese defenses and give fighter support for the Superfortresses . Because of obligations  in the Philippines , operation  HOTFOOT , as the Navy portion of the mission was called, was canceled. The Navy recommended  that the entire mission be postponed  until they could participate . With Arnold anxious for action, Hansell decided to continue  with the mission without the Navy.
