ertainly  not cooperative,  with either extensive  cloud cover completely  covering targets or the winds at high altitude making the bombardiers'  job very difficult. But Hansell's outburst was caused by his belief that his wing commander  and group commanders  were not with him. Hansell felt that high altitude, precision  bombing would work if O'Donnell  and the others gave it time and effort. On December  13 eighty-two  B-29s attacked  the Mitsubishi Aircraft  Engine Plant at Nagoya. Opposition  was heavy for one squadron and total wing losses amounted to four SuperÂ­ fortresses  lost and thirty one damaged. Bombing  results  were, however, termed "good", with sixteen percent of the bombs landing within a thousand feet of the aiming point. It was later learned that two hundred and sixty-four  workers were killed and capacity fell by twenty-five  percent. 85 But the encouraging  news came only after a near disaster. A tropical storm hit Saipan before the B-29s could return. Hansell "sweated out" much of the mission in the tower listening  to calls from crews nearly out of fuel and nearing the field. McKelway  recorded  the scene: "This night, this unforgettable 85 Mission  Folder no. 12, XXI Bomber Command, Record Group 18, National  Archives;  Craven and Cate, V, 563. 280  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 292 --- night. Possum and Rosy stood in the rain for twenty-five minutes in a silence that ached and groaned with agony, screamed with apprehension,  and made no sound. 1,86 The weather broke just in time to avert disaster, as Hansell watched the air traffic control sergeant  bring each plane in "without a hint of panic." Hansell later recalled, "I realized  that I really was quite helpless . The real commander of the XXI Bomber Command was a non-commissioned  officer who was functioning  so superbly as tower operator ."86 87 86 St. Clair McKelway, "A Reporter  with the B-29s " (The New Yorker , June 9, 1945), 34. 87 Hansell, Japan , 41. 88 Mission  Folder
