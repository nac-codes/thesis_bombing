the bombs doing little damage to the target. The attack did inadvertently  set fire to a hospital , thus giving the Japanese  the excuse to accuse the American  "devils " of intentionally  targeting  hospitals , schools , and private homes.92 By the end of December Hansell was in his new headquarters  on Guam. On January 1, 1945, Hansell received New Year's greetings  from General Arnold, which read in part : "You have brought to a great many Japanese  the realization  of what this war holds for them.
