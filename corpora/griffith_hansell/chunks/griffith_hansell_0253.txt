t Arnold fired Hansell . Norstad realized  that Hansell would not easily go along with firebombing  Japan's cities and that his press releases were only confirming  his committment  to daylight, precision attacks and thus not preparing  the public for the eventuality of urban area attacks . In Norstad's  eyes , Hansell had to go. Years later Norstad  was asked if he was only the "hatchet  man" in the dismissal  of Hansell . He revealed that he was much more : "...I was more than a hatchet man... I had to decide to take the action before we lost the goddamned war.

The two weeks remaining  in Hansell's command were most unpleasant  for him and those around him, but the daylight, precision  missions continued. On January 9, 1945, another attack on the Nakajima-Musashino aircraft complex near Tokyo was disappointing,  with only twenty-four  bombs landing in the plant site at a cost of six B-29s . On January 14 seventy-three  B-29s were launched against the Mitsubi
