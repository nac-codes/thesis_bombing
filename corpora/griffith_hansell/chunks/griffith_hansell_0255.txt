vindication  of his belief in selective  bombing. Yet, the attack was far more successful than Air Force intelligence  had determined.  The United States Strategic  Bombing Survey reported  after the war: "The first attack on Akashi, on 19 January 1945 ... was in large force . . . Every important building in the engine and air-frame branches was hit and production  was cut 90 percent." Even though the machine tools suffered little damage, the plant itself was out of business.

It has been my lot to prepare for and pioneer both the air offensive  against Germany and that against Japan. I should like a job now which will afford me the time and opportunity  to rehabilitate  myself . " Hansel
