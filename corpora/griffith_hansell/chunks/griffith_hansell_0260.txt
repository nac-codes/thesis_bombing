"pull his outfit out of the hole." LeMay also informed  Norstad that he was going to get the 73rd started  on some "proper training,  " although  he continued  the Lead Crew School begun by Hansell. 28 28 LeMay to Norstad, January 31, 1945, LeMay Papers, Box B-11 , Library  of Congress;  LeMay to Norstad, February  1, 1945, LeMay Papers, Box B-11, Library  of Congress;  Hansell, Japan , 60; Morgan, Griffith  Interview. 29 Craven and Cate, V, 568, 571-572.Between  late January  and early March LeMay sent his crews on training  missions to bomb Japanese-held  islands (much as Hansell had) and then sent them to bomb daylight, precision targets in the Japanese  aircraft  industry. The results from these attacks  were much the same Hansell  had experienced.  The weather continued to be a problem that even the most determined  daylight attack could not solve consistently. Norstad gave LeMay the "fullest latitude" in turning from "purely strategic  targets" (i.e. daylight,  precision  attacks) and suggested  incendiary  attacks on Kobe and on February  12 suggested  a major incendiary  attack on Nagoya, "to secure more planning  data." Arnold was again getting impatient  with the commander  of the XXI Bomber Command. 29 Historian  Conrad Crane suggests  that LeMay undertook  the incendiary  attacks "without real direction  from Washington, " 300  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 312 --- but Hansell's  fate was not lost on LeMay â€” Norstad had made it clear that LeMay had to act quickly. 30 On March 3, 1945, LeMay pondered the possibilities  in a letter to Norstad: "Another out is night bombing . I don't believe it is an efficient  method of operation  but this is another case of a few bombs on the target being better than no bombs at all...I am working on several very radical methods of employment  of the force. As soon as I have run a few tests , I'll submit the plans for your comment . "31 32 30 Crane , Bombs , 7. 31 LeMay to Norstad, March 3, 1945, LeMay Papers ,
