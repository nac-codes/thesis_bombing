April 3, 1945, to LeMay: "Certainly your last month's operations  have been the most impressive that I have seen in the field of bombardment . " Finally Norstad  had seen the Air Force  make the most effective  use of its available technology. If high-altitude,  precision bombardment  was a slow, agonizing  process, the low-altitude, area bombing offered quick results in a strategy  Norstad  had advocated  from the beginning  of his tenure with the Twentieth Air Force . The news was no longer discouraging ; Norstad characterized  the results of the incendiary attacks as " tremendous .1,34 While Hansell struggled with daylight, precision bombardment , his contemporaries  had been carried away with what historian Michael Sherry called "technological 302  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 314 --- fanaticism.  " The bad weather  had rendered  Hansell's  method of bombing slow and seemingly  unproductive,  but, using the same technology, it was possible to visit a great deal of destruction  upon the enemy through area attacks. Hansell simply considered  area attacks a waste of bombs because he maintained  that the destruction  of a specific number of targets could bring an enemy to his knees . But, given the expectations  associated  with strategic bombing from the theories of Douhet to the firebombing  of Hamburg , mass destruction  seemed the logical conclusion  to the use of such a weapon . The B-29 and the various types of incendiary  bombs available gave the Air Force the means to destroy whole cities, and if the weather prohibited  an effective  selective bombing campaign then another method would have to be employed. Those who directed  the air war against Japan sought to attack Japan with any weapon at their disposal .35 35 Sherry, Rise , 251-252, 254.Another factor in "technological  fanaticism"  is the powerful  emotions  that war invokes . Americans  were reluctant to use area bombing  against the Germans, but the Japanese  were quite a different  matter
