"sound military  decision, " it is highly unlikely  that he was totally genuine in his remarks .42 43 Hansell's objection to area bombing was that it was wasteful . The killing of civilians  was distasteful  to him, but his main concern  was to destroy selected economic objectives . He had initially accepted  the idea of urban area attacks, but only as a means to drive an enemy on the verge of surrender  over the brink.

In his post-war writings Hansell constructed  a scenario  which he felt could have successfully ended the war with Japan before an invasion, without using area attacks or atomic weapons.
