constructed  a scenario  which he felt could have successfully ended the war with Japan before an invasion, without using area attacks or atomic weapons. With more training  and better use of radar, Hansell believed that Japan's electric power system, rail transportation system, and aircraft  airframe  and engine factories  could have been put out of commission. In addition to this, aerial mining by B-29s could have sealed Japan's fate. He estimated that this could have been accomplished  with 18,500 sorties, 7,900 sorties less than the XXI Bomber Command  actually  flew from November  1944 to August 1945.45 46 45 Hansell, Japan , 91, 93. 46 Ibid, 49, 90. 47 Sherry, Rise, 309.Naturally  Hansell was biased in his opinion, but Michael Sherry concludes that Hansell "constructed  a powerful case." 47 But more importantly,  the United States Strategic Bombing  Survey tends to confirm  the effectiveness  of daylight, 308  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 320 --- precision  bombing . The major miscalculation  Hansell and his fellow  planners  made in AWPD/1 was the assumption  that Germany had mobilized  to the limit. This was clearly not the case, and the strategic  bombing  campaign  in Europe did not cause the disruption  to German industry  as expected  until toward the end of the war. Japan was mobilized  to the limit and Hansell's bombing  attacks had much more impact than was believed  at the time.48 * The USSBS "Summary Report" states: "During this period [November  1944 to March 9, 1945], attacks  were directed almost exclusively  against aircraft, primarily aircraft engine, targets. The principal  aircraft engine plants were hit sufficiently  heavily and persistently  to convince the Japanese  that these plants would inevitably  be destroyed. The Japanese were thereby forced into a wholesale and hasty dispersal  program. 1,49 Along with the bombing, the Japanese had severe shortages of special steels requiring cobalt, nickel, and chrome brought about by t
