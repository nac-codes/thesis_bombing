. Finally, he pioneered the deployment  of the B-29 against Japan , overcoming  great odds just to begin operations  and conducting  a successful  campaign in the face of opposition  not only from the Japanese,  but also from Washington  and his own subordinate  commanders . In short, Hansell played a central and mostly unsung role in the ascendancy  of American  air power before and during World War 310  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 322 --- II. Yet, Hansell's  importance  certainly  transcends  the fact that he served in important assignments  during the war. Hansell  was an innovator  who helped create and give wing to an important  and uniquely  American  air war doctrine . At ACTS Hansell had taught the principles  of daylight, precision bombing ; the air war plans he wrote insured  that this doctrine was at the very center of the American strategic air war against  Germany; as a general in command  of B-17s and later B- 29s Hansell  worked tirelessly  to see his air war doctrine  come to fruition. By early 1945 Hansell  had become almost the lone champion  of daylight,  precision  bombing and his dismissal  as commander  of the XXI Bomber Command  marked a drastic change in American  air war doctrine . Instead of practicing  selective strategic  bombing, the Army Air Forces resorted  first to urban area bombing using incendiary  weapons and then to the destructive  power of nuclear weapons . After Hansell's  retirement  in 1946 and the creation  of the United States Air Force in 1947, American air doctrine depended  more and more upon a Douhetian  strategy  using nuclear weapons . In 1948 the new Strategic  Air Command selected aiming points with the primary objective of annihilating population  centers .
