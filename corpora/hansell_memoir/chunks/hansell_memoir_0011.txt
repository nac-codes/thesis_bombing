255      MAJ. GEN. HAYWOOD S. HANSELL, JR.      Chapter I    Integrating Strategy,  Air Doctrines, and War Plans    World War II witnessed the first full application of strategic air power in war. At this writing, in fact, World War II has provided the only such full-scale application. Because that great effort was unique, it should be worth analytical examination, not only in terms of actions and effects, but more particularly in terms of objectives, strategic plans, and results of operations designed to achieve these ends. A brief review of the development of U.S. strategic air doctrines and their nature at the outbreak of American participation in World War II should serve as a useful prelude to discussion of the strategic air war itself.*  Air Pioneers  Airplanes were used, of course, in World War I, although on a very limited scale.

The commission came into being largely as a result of popular dissatisfaction with the ability of the air defenses to deal with German Zeppelin and Gotha bombing attacks against London.

Air supremacy may in the long run become as important a factor in the defense of
