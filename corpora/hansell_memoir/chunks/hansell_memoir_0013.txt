factories, thus ending the war with Italy’s main opponent. In October 1917, Caproni, in collaboration with his friend Lt. Col. Giulio Douhet of the Italian Army, prepared a “Memorandum on the ‘Air War’ for the U.S. Air Service,” in which he suggested that mass attacks made at night by long-range Allied bombers against industrial targets deep within Germany and Austria could definitely overwhelm the enemy by substantially reducing his war production at the same time that Allied production was increasing.  More must be said about Douhet. Actually, he had begun to write about military aviation as early as 1909. During World War I, he was imprisoned for a year (1916-1917) for criticizing Italy’s wartime military policy. But Douhet, like Brig. Gen. William “Billy” Mitchell of the U.S. Army Air Service, whose career was parallel, became more influential in the post- World War I period. Douhet’s wartime court- martial was expunged in 1920, and he was promoted to general officer rank in 1921. He completed his first serious treatise on military aviation — II Dominio delV Aria, or The Command of the Air — in October 1921. In this essay, he proved to be a strong proponent of strategic air warfare. In essence, he advocated creation of an independent air force made up of a fleet of bombers, to be accompa- nied by “battle planes” — bombers equipped with many guns to fight off hostile pursuit planes en route to strategic targets. This bomber force would win command of the air by attacking enemy aircraft factories and flying facilities and would destroy the enemy’s will to resist by bombing his population centers.  Soon after the end of World War I, airpower concepts were deeply influenced by two other military strategists. One was the great British military historian Capt. B. H. Liddell Hart. In his book Paris, Liddell Hart pointed out that Germany had surrendered when her armies were still powerful and her borders were still intact. The military power to wage war was still there
