ragmatic application of air power in attainment of specific objectives.  The early visionaries and proponents had made great claims for air power. Their strategic concepts all depended upon one basic tactical concept accepted by the Tactical School as a fundamental doctrine: bombers could reach their targets and destroy them. The strategic airpower doctrine fashioned at the school rested on five fundamental aphorisms:  1. Modern great powers rely on major industrial and economic    7      MEMBERS OF THE TACTICAL SCHOOL FACULTY    HAROLD L.

Disruption or paralysis of these systems undermines both the enemy’s capability and will to fight.  2. Such major systems contain critical points whose destruction will break down these systems, and bombs can be delivered with adequate accuracy to do this.  3. Massed air strike forces can penetrate air defenses without unacceptable losses and destroy selected targets.  4. Proper selection of vital targets in the industrial/economic/ social structure of a modern industrialized nation, and their subse- quent destruction by air attack, can lead to fatal weakening of an industrialized enemy nation and to victory through air power.  5. If enemy resistance still persists after successful paralysis of selected target systems, it may be necessary as a last resort to apply direct force upon the sources of enemy national will by attacking cities. In this event, it is preferable to render the cities untenable rath
