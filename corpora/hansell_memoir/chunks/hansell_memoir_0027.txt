force as possible in order to concentrate mass on the principal effort.   Security   Unless the base of power is defended and    secure, it will be very difficult to sustain the strategic offensive and to continue to prosecute the war.    The Tactical School devised a form, the Air Estimate of the    15     STRATEGIC AIR WAR    Situation for Strategic Air Warfare, to assist in determining the optimum application of offensive strategic air power. The form’s rationale was fairly simple, the most significant considerations being: lefine clearly the purpose, the goal — what you want to accomplish; consider the obstacles and opportunities in the broad situation; list the actions (tasks) which, if successfully accomplished, would attain the purpose, in order of desired priority, consider the force needed to carry out each task; consider the capability of your own forces and determine which of the tasks come within your capability; consider the risks and possible losses of each task; select the tasks that will achieve your purpose most effectively without unacceptable risk and loss, and which come within your capability; prepare a plan to fulfill the selected tasks. We used this form in preparing all the strategic war plans. “Purpose” was the keynote: select targets that contribute most to the purpose. The rationale also underscored the principle of “Capacity of the Force.” That is, do not attempt tasks beyond your capability. Keep your operations within the capability of the forces available. It is far better to destroy a few vital targets completely than to attack many targets inconclusively.  Though airmen at the Tactical School were slowly evolving a concrete body of doctrine for the employment of strategic air forces, the Army Air Corps had neither the organization nor the forces required to implement it. The closest the Air Corps came to achieve either in the 1930s was the establishment of General Headquarters Air Force (GHQ Air Force) and the appearance of the B-17
