ustrial systems that made war production possible, such as:  (1) Electric power systems (generating stations, transform- er and switching stations, dams and penstocks).  (2) Natural fuel, refining, and transfer systems; synthetic fuel production systems; transportation systems (rail, highway, canal, sea).  (3) Special factories and arsenals (aircraft and aircraft engine, tank, weapons, and ammunition factories; major interior depots; rubber production facilities).  (4) Basic war-supporting materials (steel plants, aluminum and magnesium plants).  b. Local interior air defense of friendly forces and installa- tions vital to munitions manufacture.  3. Direct air attack on the economic and social systems and structure of the enemy state, including destruction or neutralization of major supporting systems (electric power, communication, basic economic industrial production, water supply, industrial and econom- ic transportation, food-handling, food-production, food preservation and distribution, and management control).  a. Many of the national industrial systems and economic systems supported the enemy capability to sustain the armed forces and the ability to continue to fight. These were also vital to the continued operation of the state itself as a modem industrialized society â€” systems bolstering the political will to resist of the enemy nation.  b.

Electric power was the heart, without whose continued function all directed activity is paralyzed. Transportation was the system of arteries carrying energy to the vital organs. Fuel systems were the metabolic functions that translate sources of energy to muscular action. Communications were the nervous system. All served the brain, the source of political decision. All were vital to the civil as well as to the military capabilities
