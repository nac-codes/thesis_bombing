officers of the Information Division had no more useful occupation for their energies than this, he was prepared to disband the Information Division and transfer its personnel to G-2 where their talents could be directed to some useful purpose. Even General Arnold was miffed — and when he was miffed people soon found out about it. Doubtless he was embarrassed to be called down about an incident of which he had no knowledge. In sending the correspondence down to the Informa-    20     STRATEGY, DOCTRINE, AND PLANS    tion Division, he penned the comment, “I am inclined to agree with General Bryden. ’ The incident passed, but it served to slam shut the door connecting the Air Corps Information Division and G-2.  Not long thereafter the relationship — or lack of it— surfaced again. General Arnold had an informal conversation with Lt. Col. Truman Smith, recently returned from Berlin as the Assistant Military Attache. Smith furnished General Arnold many details of the Luftwaffe and German aircraft production of which Arnold was ignorant. The general demanded to know why such information had not been passed to him previously. Obviously it was of vital importance to the Air Corps. He was informed that these and numerous other facts were reported to G— 2. General Arnold went to General Miles, G-2, and posed the same question. He was advised that intelligence of this nature was restricted to members of the War Department General Staff (WDGS), and Arnold as Chief of the Air Corps was not a member of the General Staff and hence was not on the distribution list.  Arnold went directly to Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall and requested authority to set up an air intelligence system with Assistant Military Attaches for Air at U.S. embassies abroad. General Marshall approved the request. Next, Col. Ira Eaker, Arnold’s Executive Officer, sent for Maj. Thomas D. White and me. He described General Marshall’s authorization, and said General Arnold directed us to get on with it. T
