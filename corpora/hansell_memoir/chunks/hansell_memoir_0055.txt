es could make final preparations for amphibious invasion, if by that time it were still necessary to storm the coast of France. (See charts on page 117.) Even if effective German resistance were broken by the air offensive, an occupying force would be needed. It would keep order, support an interim government, and ensure adherence to peace terms. The opposition to such an occupying force might be considerable, but the enemy capacity for massive, organized resistance should be broken by that time.    37     STRATEGIC AIR WAR    RELATIONSHIP OF STRATEGIC AIR OFFENSE  IN  PLANNING GRAND STRATEGY-WAR IN EUROPE (VICTORY PROGRAM - AWPD-1)    ■27 MONTHS-    ARMY MOBILIZATION    MOBILIZATION TRAINING & PRODUCTION    BUILDING OF MERCHANT MARINE FORCES AND TRANSPORTATION OVERSEAS     AIR  OFFENSIVE    9 MONTHS    PREPARATION OF BASES M DAY       9 MONTHS    6 MONTHS    *◄-    >4    DEPLOYMENT TO ENGLAND    AIR  OFFENSIVE  GERMANY     3 MOS    D DAY    COMBINED  OPERATIONS    The plan was completed and submitted to the War Plans Division, WDGS, before General Arnold returned from Argentia, Newfound- land, where he had gone with President Roosevelt and General Marshall to meet with Prime Minister Churchill and his staff.

As a document it was not impressive-looking — pages typed and mimeographed; pen-and-ink corrections; charts black and white, hastily prepared and crudely pasted together. Finally, the entire War Plans document (including AWPD-1) was bundled off to the Government Printing Office.  The Air War Plans Division Plan No. 1 (AWPD-1) stipulated these total force requirements:    38     TOTAL AIR FORCE GROUPS REQUIRED    Heavy bombers (B— 17, B— 24)  Very heavy bombers (B— 29, B— 32)  Very long-range bombers (B-36)*  Fighters  Others (Primarily for support of ground forces)  TOTAL    47  24  44  54  82  251    TOTAL MILITARY AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION REQUIRED (
