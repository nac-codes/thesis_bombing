Aero engine assembly plants  The primary ones were:  (German) Submarine yards  Transportation targets (rail and canal in Germany)  Electric power system  Synthetic oil plants  Aluminum plants  Synthetic rubber plants  When inaugurated, the strategic offensive against Japan would resemble that for Germany. It would seek to undermine and destroy the capability and will of the Japanese people to wage war by destroying the industries and systems upon which the war industries and the civilian economy relied.  In comparison with operations and priorities called for in AWPD-1, worldwide operations revealed by 1942 some weakening of resolve to keep the maximum possible air strength directed toward the primary strategic air offensive, the destruction of the vital elements of Germany. Northwest Africa was drawing off air forces to support land operations. Land operations in the Middle East were likewise diverting air elements. And surface operations to regain base areas in the Far East, as distinct from operations for a strictly defensive purpose, were also absorbing air power. By necessity, all these absorbed air forces could have been employed in the primary strategic effort, the air offensive against Germany. Yet the latter had not even started in any meaningful sense, and the delay would be further extended if these diversions continued to grow.  As for the air offensive against Japan, it was too early to give anything more than general guidance in terms of objectives and targets. Nevertheless, AWPD-42 recognized that the strategic air offensive against Japan would follow the defeat of Germany, and proposed the following targets:    59     STRATEGIC AIR WAR    Aircraft engine plants  Submarine yards  Naval and commercial bases  Alumina and aluminum plants  Iron and steel  Oil  Chemical plants Rubber factories  There were two striking omissions from this list: the Japanese electric power system and the transportation system (including shipping, harbor and repair facilitie
