diversion from the intermediate objective and the primary targets for six months at full strength. Final decision on invasion of northern France was postponed. In the meantime, tactical air forces would be built up to support such an invasion. Eaker’s cup was surely running over.    73     STRATEGIC AIR WAR    From Policy to Operational Plans  At General Arnold’s suggestion, and with Air Chief Marshal Portal’s endorsement, a joint U.S. Army Air Forces-RAF team was set up in Eaker’s headquarters in 1943 to prepare a plan for carrying out the Casablanca Directive. The team consisted of members of Eaker’s staff, the two B-17 wing commanders of the Eighth Air Force (Brig. Gen. Frederick L. Anderson and myself), representatives of the Air Ministry and RAF Bomber Command, and a representative from the British Ministry of Economic Warfare. I was chairman of the planning team.  Col. Charles P. Cabell, who had been one of Arnold’s special advisors, arrived at General Eaker’s headquarters on March 23, 1943, carrying the list of potential target systems prepared by the Committee of Operations Analysts. General Eaker then turned to the planning team to prepare the strategic plan of operations and select the target systems which would come within the capability of Eighth Air Force while contributing most to the accomplishment of the objective, after considering the scheduled growth of the force and the potential combat losses. The operational plan would also set up a proposed time schedule.  To direct this planning team, I had been called in from my 1st Bombardment Wing Headquarters. General Frederick Anderson was brought in from the 4th Bombardment Wing and, at General Eaker’s request, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal furnished the very able Air Commodore Sidney O. Bufton, RAF, Director of Bomber Operations at the Air Ministry. Sidney Bufton was a most valuable addition to the planning team. He had been, and continued to be, an important contributor to the bomber offensive
