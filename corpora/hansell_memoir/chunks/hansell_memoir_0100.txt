would have been more palatable to the airmen. As it was, three basic interpretations of the Casablanca Directive were now in evidence.  For instance, RAF Bomber Command considered the “undermin- ing of the morale of the German people” as the significant clause leading to the “point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.” This did not necessarily entail killing large numbers of people. It did entail depriving them of homes, heat, light, water, urban transportation, and perhaps food. Homeless, hungry workers and civilian employees, they reasoned, do not produce munitions and, like soldiers who are wounded, are a greater impedi- ment to the state at war than dead ones. Also, factories deprived of workers and utilities as a byproduct of urban bombing are useless as sources of combat munitions. Finally, there was the added hope that    78     PLANNING THE WAR FOR EUROPE    civilians might become so discouraged as to lose their willingness to support the war.  In contrast, the U.S. Strategic Air Forces looked upon “the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial, and economic system” as the path to the “fatal weakening,” and believed it could best be done by destroying selected targets in Germany. “Fatal weakening” meant the impending collapse of the entire German state, not simply a breach in the coastal defenses of France. A structure that has been “fatally weakened” is doomed to collapse.  The differences between British and American airmen were not so deep as might appear on the surface. The responsible air commanders generally agreed on the suitability of the strategic objective to be attained. The debate was over method and was related more to operational equipment and capability and survivability than to the need for “fatal weakening” per se. It will be recalled that at first the RAF was committed to the doctrine of daylight, precision attacks, but the bombers available to carry out the mission could not withs
