The Eighth Air Force by day and the RAF Bomber Command by night were thus launched upon their parallel and coordinate efforts, to cause the fatal weakening of the willingness and capability of the German people to pursue the war. The Combined Bomber Offensive (code name Pointblank) was under way.  The two strands of strategic thought — decisive weakening of interior Germany by air power, and air preparation for decisive air- ground operations on the Continent — clashed with each other due to the restriction in timing. Originally, the plans had specified six months of air offensive before direct preparation for invasion. However, the campaign in North Africa and the Mediterranean (opposed by the Joint Chiefs on military grounds) delayed by about four months the crucial assault on the German air forces from bases in England. This telescoped by a like time interval the period between the completion of the offensive against the
