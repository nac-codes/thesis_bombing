As shown on the chart, after the bombing of German targets rose from about 40,000 tons in August to a peak of nearly 200,000 tons in February, the index of combat munitions production dropped steeply from about 315 to about 140 on its way to zero 2 months later.  Strategic Bombing Survey Conclusions  The Strategic Bombing Survey gave as one of its major conclu- sions:    The attack on transportation was the decisive blow that completely disorganized the German economy. It reduced war production in all categories and made it difficult to move what was produced to the front. The attack also limited the tactical mobility    126      127          COMBAT MUNITIONS PRODUCTION IN GERMANY (USSBS)      ■ 200,000    . 150,000    .100,000    50,000    25,000    128     EXECUTION AND EVALUATION    of the German Army.*  By the beginning of 1945, before the invasion of the homeland itself, Germany was reaching a state of helplessness. Her armament production was falling irretrievably, orderliness in effort was disappearing, and total disruption and disintegration were well along. Her armies were still in the field. But with the impending collapse of the supporting economy, the indications are convincing that they would have had to cease fighting — any effective fighting — within a few months. Germany was mortally wounded.  Even if the final military victories that carried the Allied armies across the Rhine and the Oder had not taken place, armament production would have come to a virtual standstill by May. The indications were convincing that the German armies, completely bereft of ammunition and motive power, would have had to cease fighting — any effective fighting — within a few months.  In the actual case — as in most others in the history of wars — the collapse occurred before the time when the lack of means had rendered further resistance physically impossible.  The creation of this condition was the intent of all the strategic air plans and should have been ac
