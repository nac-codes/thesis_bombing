Six coking plants (3 in the Japanese southern island of Kyushu, 2 near Mukden in Manchuria, and 1 in Korea) produced 73 percent of    143     STRATEGIC AIR WAR    Japanese coke. The Committee of Operations Analysts said the destruction of these 6 coking plants would deprive Japan of 66 percent of her total steel output. Coke ovens were susceptible to shock and their replacement would take years. The Air War Plans Division proposed that B-29s be based in India and operated from advanced bases in China, within range of some or all of these coking plants. The vicinity of Chengtu, China, was the preferred forward base. The location, relative importance, and approximate distance of these plants from Chengtu were:    Percent of   Miles from   Plant Location Production   Chengtu   Anshan (near Mukden, Manchuria)   34.5   1,350   Penchihu (near Mukden, Manchuria)   11.2   1,300   Kenjiho, Korea   3.6   1,400   Yawata (Kyushu, Japan) (1)   16.2   1,500   Yawata (Kyushu, Japan) (2)   3.9   1,500   Omuta (Kyushu, Japan)   3.3   1,475    Chengtu, China, was situated about 1,150 miles from Calcutta, India.
