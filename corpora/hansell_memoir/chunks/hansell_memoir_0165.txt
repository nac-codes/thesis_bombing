This would leave a Japanese force behind the invading force, cut off by the jungle, the terrain, and the sea. When one of General MacArthur’s staff officers asked sarcastically what the troops were supposed to do    148     PLANNING THE WAR AGAINST JAPAN    without wheeled vehicles, Kenney said he would move these too. He proceeded to cut trucks and other vehicles in two with acetylene torches, stuff the parts into air transports, fly them over the mountains, and have them assembled and welded back together. It worked! He also promoted low-level skip bombing on ships, armed medium bombers with multiple batteries of .50-caliber guns for strafing, and sponsored the mounting of a 75-millimeter cannon on a light bomber.  No air strategist or tactician showed greater imagination and inventiveness than George Kenney. And it speaks volumes for mutual trust and confidence that General MacArthur embraced the daring proposals of his chief airman and pursued his audacious program of “island hopping.”  The meeting place was a shack that had been fitted up as a private war room for General MacArthur.
