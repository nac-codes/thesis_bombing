en endorsed the initial operations entailed in Matterhorn, but planned to use the B-29s later in support of Southeast Asia Command objectives. In his capacity as Chiang Kai-shek’s Chief of Staff for Air, General Chennault appealed to President Roosevelt directly requesting that all B-29s operating out of China be placed under his control. He made a similar request to General Arnold, asking that the B-29s operating from Chinese bases be put under the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force.  The Joint Staff planners proposed that ultimately four groups of B-29s be based in the Philippines. Those islands, when recaptured, would be under the command of General MacArthur. His chief airman, General Kenney, was already making vigorous demands for B-29s to be used in the Southwest Pacific campaign. Kenney wanted B-29s stationed in Darwin, Australia, for strikes on targets in the Netherlands East Indies. In addition, plans were actively being prepared for positioning B-29s in the Central Pacific and in Alaska. The Marianas, due to be captured chiefly as the Central Pacific base for the B-29s, would under existing circumstances be under the command of Admiral Nimitz. Alaska was still another command area.    154     COMMAND, CONTROL, AND SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS TWENTIETH AIR FORCE January 1945     155    Responsible for Air Defense of B-29 bases  Responsible for Depot Support of B-29s— Marianas  Responsible for Depot Support of B-29s— XXth Bomber Command     STRATEGIC AIR WAR    Every one of these base areas was under a separate theater commander, and these field commanders were powerful people. Each wanted to apply the B-29s to his own strategic theater purposes, and each resented any incursion into his area of control. Yet there was one area in which unity of air command and continuity of effort was imperative. That was the target area itself, Japan, which was under the control of none of them.  In March 1944 I presented to the Joint Chiefs of Staff the Army Air Forces concept of Pacific
