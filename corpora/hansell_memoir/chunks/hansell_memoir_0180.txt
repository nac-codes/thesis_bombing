I briefed General Arnold on our communications requirements and watched with amusement as he applied his famous technique for attacking the impossible. He called in Brig. Gen. Harold M.

General McClelland didn’t bat an eye. He said “Yes, sir,” saluted and departed. It left Arnold a little flat and completely deflated me.  General McClelland had the last chuckle. He produced.
