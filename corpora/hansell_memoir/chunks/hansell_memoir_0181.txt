red myself of a somewhat intemperate diatribe. I mentioned that the U.S.    162     PLANNING THE WAR AGAINST JAPAN    Navy always got the best of everything, with plenty to spare, while good fighting people in the Army— and the Army Air Forces in particular— made do on a song and a shoestring. The Twentieth Air Force was on its way to becoming the most powerful fighting force in the world, and it deserved the best and we were going to provide it.  I felt that I had expressed myself well and that the point was clearly understood and I dismissed the subject from my mind for a while. But intemperance often breeds surprising results. It did so in this case. It was some time before I found out what a fire I had started. Colonel Rosenblatt took me seriously. He used not only my meager name and authority to chum the brew, but he used General Arnold’s name and authority as well. I do not suppose we will ever find out the true level of supplies that were ordered for the Twentieth. I think it likely supplies were still being shipped to the Marianas long after the war was over and the troops had come home. Through his efforts I also acquired for a brief time my own personal “fleet” of cargo vessels. But that is another story.  During the period I served as Chief of Staff of the Twentieth Air Force, I had one particular experience which I well remember. The B-29s were coming off the production line, and there was increasing interest and speculation in the aviation press. We tried to keep a tight rein on security. The B-29s were destined for the major air assault on Japan. They would be operating at high altitude, unescorted. If the Japanese learned this and also discovered the salient elements of B-29 performance and defensive firepower, they would try by every means at their disposal to provide defenses against them. Security could be directly equated in terms of mission success or failure and in terms of the lives of American crewmen. We were deeply worried about news leaks.
