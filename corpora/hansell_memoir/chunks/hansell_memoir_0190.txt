been left free to expand, the price might have been too high. And if it had been, the air offensive would have failed and with it any hope of surface invasion.    169     STRATEGIC AIR WAR    In Europe the bombers of the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces were directed against the sources of German fighter development and strength — aircraft and engine factories, air bases, and sources of aviation fuel. These comprised the targets of the “intermediate objective:” the enemy air force. As soon as possible, the penetration capability of the bomber formations was supplemented by escort fighters. This experience in Europe obviously weighed heavily in establishing target systems in Japan. The aircraft and engine factories and to a lesser degree the oil resources were designated the intermedi- ate objective in the war against Japan. They were to receive first priority in point of time. Dangerous as unescorted daylight missions might be, they had to be undertaken against Japanese aircraft and engine plants lest the Japanese air force grow strong enough to make our missions too costly to sustain.  The other lesson of European air combat could not be applied initially to the Twentieth Air Force. The range of the B-29 prevented escort fighters from accompanying the formations from the Marianas, though steps were taken to secure a very-long-range escort fighter. Until Iwo Jima could be captured and a fighter base set up there, the bombers would be completely on their own. This was really the most controversial point of all. Seasoned experts on every hand assured us the B-29s would simply be shot out of the air. But it was a risk that had to be taken if the strategic purposes were to be achieved. And the B-29s had some factors working for them — greatly improved defen- sive firepower and high-altitude performance.  Early in September 1944, I issued orders for converting the 73d Bombardment Wing to daylight tactics, and I established tactical doctrine for daylight operations includ
