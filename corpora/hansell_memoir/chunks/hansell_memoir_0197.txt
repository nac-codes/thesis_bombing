what was happening, the supplies were dumped in the jungle. They were never recovered. We had to provide aircraft supplies for the B-29s (themselves new and unfamiliar) by air from Sacramento, California— 8,000 miles away! The in-commission rate of the B-29s was astonishingly high— considering the circumstances.  As indicated earlier, the strategic concept was for the defeat or neutralization of the Japanese air forces as an “over riding intermediate objective.” Thereafter, the major strategic air offensive was to be    175      BRIG. GEN. HAYWOOD S. HANSELL, Commanding Gener- al, XXI Bomber Command, briefs pilots before a mission over Tokyo.    176     EARLY OPERATIONS    launched against the war-supporting and economic systems of Japan. These systems were the “primary objectives.” The plan of operations against them contemplated the destruction of certain major industrial facilities by selective target bombing.  The overriding intermediate objective and its associated target system, assigned to XXI Bomber Command by agreement of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave first place to Japanese factories building airplanes and aircraft engines. This assignment was not lightly conceived, for it had been learned in Europe that air superiority is essential to strategic air operations as well as to surface operations and invasions. The Joint Chiefs had been persuaded to back the air offensive, but they were looking over the shoulders of the airmen at the invasion shore.  The primary targets, to be destroyed after the Japanese aircraft industry, were of two kinds: selected targets, to be destroyed by precision bombing; and urban targets, to be destroyed by incendiary attack. Precision bombing of selected targets was the preferred method. But it was believed that small, “home-shop” type production facilities were distributed in the great cities of Japan. Those cities were known to be highly flammable. Incendiary attack of urban areas was listed high among approved target lists be
