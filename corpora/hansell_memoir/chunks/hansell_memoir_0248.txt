A History of Basic Thinking in the United States Air Force, 1907-1964:  Actually the B-29 attacks against the Japanese aircraft factories proved to be more effective than was realized. The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey would discover that the damages caused by the B-29’s were enough to convince the Japanese of a need to disperse their aircraft plants. The destruction inflicted, plus the confusion resulting from frantic dispersal efforts, reduced the pre-attack capacity of the aircraft engine plants by 75 percent, of airframe plants by 60 percent, and of electronic and communications equipment plants by 70 percent.  Japanese combat aircraft production peaked in 1944, before the B-29 attacks commenced in late November. Output for the year was 21,058, an increase of 662 percent from the 3,180 built in 1941. There were 9 producing companies, dominated by:      Nakajima   Percent  37.1     Mitsubishi   23.0     Kawasaki   14.9   followed by:   Aichi   Percent  6.9     Tachikawa   6.0     Total   87.9     Others   12.1     Grand Total   100.0    The primary and vital airframe and engine facilities were concentrated in the central manufacturing districts of these areas: Tokyo- Kawasaki- Yokohama; Nagoya; and Osaka- Kobe.

This reflects the air attacks on the Japanese aircraft industry by the XXI Bomber Command.  Later Operations  When General LeMay assumed command of the XXI Bomber Command, he “stood down” the groups briefly. He retained my training program and improved the Lead Crew School. He focused on the maintenance effort, keeping on my A-4, Col. Clarence S. Irvine, who had worked wonders with this terribly difficult problem. After loss of the depot at Guam, Colonel Irvine needed to improvise a maintenance system based on the depot at Sacramento, 8,000 miles away
