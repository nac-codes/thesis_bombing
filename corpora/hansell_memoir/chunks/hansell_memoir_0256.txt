burned out.  The bulk of XXI Bomber Command’s operations was devoted to urban industrial area incendiary attacks. In the entire period of its operations, the Twentieth Air Force applied its capacity as follows:    233     STRATEGIC AIR WAR    Precision bombing attacks:   Sorties   Tons of Bombs   Aircraft and engine targets   2,838   14,152   Petroleum targets   1,437   10,600   Assorted industrial targets   1,459   8.093   Total   5,734   32,845   Urban industrial area attacks   21,671   138,215   Aerial mining   1,750     GRAND TOTAL   29,155   171,060    Thus, just 19 percent of the total effort in terms of both sorties and bomb tonnage was directed against selective targets; 80 percent went to urban incendiary attacks; and less than 1 percent to mining.  The somewhat precipitate decision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to move the 58th Wing from China- Burma-India Theater to the Mari- anas had at least one ill effect. It postponed the deployment of the 315th Wing (equipped with the new AN/APQ-7 radar bombing system) from April to June 1945. So upon the 315th’s arrival in the Marianas, it carried out fewer than two months of operations before the end of the war. The deployment delay, however, was put to good use by intensifying training, particularly to perfect radar bombing accuracy. Consequently, the 315th’s performance with the APQ-7 was spectacular. It clearly showed that selected targets could be hit at night or when obscured from visual bombing.  The first group of the 315th touched down at Northwest Field, Guam, late in June. Only one runway was available, although the other was nearing completion. Many of the base facilities were not yet installed, for construction of the field had been seriously delayed. The decision of the Navy Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Area, to move his advanced headquarters to Guam had caused critical changes in construction priorities there. Roads and naval facilities enjoyed a higher priority than B-29 bases. As a matter of fa
