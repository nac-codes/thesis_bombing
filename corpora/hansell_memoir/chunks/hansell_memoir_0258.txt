So the position of Generals Giles and LeMay had considerable backing. This fine decision by General LeMay afforded the opportunity to test again the feasibility of all- weather attack on selected targets by radar bombing, and at the same time to contribute substantially to the conduct of the war.  Between June 26 and the end of the war on August 14, the 315th Wing flew fifteen night missions against oil refineries or synthetic plants in Japan. These missions are listed below:    Date   Mission  Number   Target   June 26/27   1   Utsube Oil Refinery at Yokkaichi   June 29/30   2   Nippon Oil Company at Kudamatsu   July 2/3   3   Maruzen Oil Company at Shimotsu   July 6/7   4   Maruzen Oil Company at   July 9/10   5   Shimotsu (Repeat) Utsube Oil Refinery at   July 12/13   6   Yokkaichi (Repeat) Mitsubishi Oil Company at    238     OTHER OPERATIONS    Kawasaki    July 15/16   7   Nippon Oil Company at Kudamatsu (Repeat)   July 19/20   8   Nippon Oil Company at Kansai   July 22/23   9   Imperial Fuel Industry Company at Ube   July 25/26   10   Mitsubishi Oil Company at Kawasaki   July 28/29   11   Toa Fuel Company at Smimotsu   August 1/2   12   Mitsubishi Oil Company at Kawasaki (Repeat)   August 5/6   13   Imperial Fuel Industry Company at Ube (Repeat)   August 9/10   14   Nippon Oil Company at Kansai (Repeat)   August 14/15   15   Nippon Oil Company at    Tsuchizaki (near Akita)  The missions were conducted by streams of single aircraft at night, bombing from 15,000 feet. The initial bombloads averaged 14,631 pounds per airplane but, with experience, this grew to 20,684 pounds. Only 4 planes were lost and 66 damaged in the entire campaign.
