of the whole aircraft industry’s facilities were out of production due to dispersal alone.  For other categories of war production, the overall drop in production capacity through physical destruction of plant, machinery, and equipment was:  Army ordnance 26 percent  Naval ordnance 28 percent  Merchant and naval ships 10-15 percent Motor vehicles negligible    246     OTHER OPERATIONS    The decline in production capacity due to unsuccessful attempts at dispersal (induced by the threat of bombing) was:  Army ordnance 12 percent  Naval ordnance 12 percent  Merchant and naval ships small Motor vehicles sufficient to bring  a complete collapse of production  The loss of production capacity by bombing was brought about by a combination of heavy urban area attacks and a relatively small amount of bombing (24,000 tons or 17 percent of total bomb tonnage) directed at selected targets. Strategic bombing alone did not reduce Japanese production. Loss of raw materials from shipping losses and blockade had an impact as well, especially in the case of steel. The report pointed out that:  The loss through ships sunk of 17 percent of all Army supplies shipped overseas (including food, clothing, fuel, and construction materials as well as ordnance) in 1943; 30 percent in 1944; and 50 percent in 1945 shows that increased production alone would not have been sufficient to provide adequate supplies for the Japanese Army overseas.  The report summed up its findings on the effect of strategic bombing of Japanese war industry production in these terms:  There was a 53 percent decline in war production between September 1944 (just prior to the launching of the air offensive) and July 1945 — the last full month of production before the end of the war. The magnitude of the decline in output of each of the major categories of war production from peak levels to the July 1945 level is shown below:  Category Percentage drop from  peak production    Aircraft  Army Ordnance    247    57  54
