a great nation can be stilled by strategic air operations, as well as by occupation by troops.) General MacArthur believed Russia would demand and get Manchuria, but thought she should pay for it by joining in the fight against Japan. He was quoted as saying that he understood the Navy still favored a plan whereby Japan would be surrounded with air and naval bases, and eventually blockaded and bombed into submission. MacArthur con- tended that this would never succeed.  On April 20, 1945, General MacArthur analyzed the strategic problem under three possibilities:  Course 1. Encircle Japan by further expansion to the westward, deploying maximum air forces preparatory to attacks on Kyushu and Honshu in succession or directly against Honshu.  Course 2.

Attack Kyushu and install air forces to cover a decisive assault on Honshu.  He dismissed Course 1 as time-consuming and diversionary away from the decisive area â€” the plain of Tokyo. Turning down Course 2 as time- consuming and ineffective, he said:  It assumes success of air power alone to conquer a people in spite of its demonstrated failure in Europe, where Germany was subjected to more intensive bombardment than can be brought to bear against Japan, and where all the available resources in ground troops of the    250     SOVIET UNION    BERING SEA     OTHER OPERATIONS    United States, the United Kingdom and Russia had to be commit- ted in order to force a decision.

He wanted to know the time needed and the losses that would ensue from an effort to defeat Japan by isolation, blockade, and bombardment by sea and air forces. He asked General Marshall for his views. Marshall said
