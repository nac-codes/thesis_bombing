The President had already agreed to the policy of invasion and the machinery had been set in motion, not only for the invasion of Kyushu but for the subsequent invasions of Honshu.  At the Potsdam Conference, President Truman learned of the successful test of the “atomic device.” He queried his advisors and top commanders about using it.
