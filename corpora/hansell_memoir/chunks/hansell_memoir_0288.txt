surrender for lack of sustenance.  (2) Conduct of an effective sea blockade of the Japanese home islands, including sinking or capture of Japanese ships.  (3) Conduct of an effective strategic air war to bring about the collapse of Japanese resistance and to undermine the civil and social    268     SUMMING UP    structure through selective air attack, using both visual and APQ-7 radar techniques against:  (a) The Japanese Air Force, through destruction of the Japanese aircraft engine and airframe industry.  (b) The Japanese electric power system, primarily through destruction of thermal power plants and switching and transformer stations in the power transmission system serving the principal industrial areas.  (c) The Japanese transportation systems, including Japanese sea transportation (accomplished through aerial mining of home waters, and air attack of shipbuilding and repair facilities and ports), and the principal railroads, which were meager in capacity and very vital and vulnerable.  (d) Japanese steel industry, through destruction of coke ovens.  (e) Petroleum storage and refineries.  (f) The Japanese food resources by destruction of fertilizer chemicals.  (4) Preparation for:  (a) Incendiary attack of Japanese urban areas, if this became necessary to bring about capitulation of the crippled nation.  (b) Atomic attack of Japanese urban areas, if necessary.  (c) Occupation, if Japan surrendered.  (d) Invasion if all else failed.  Secondary effort: operations in the Southwest Pacific to recapture the Philippines, isolate large bodies of Japanese troops, and impose heavy casualties.  This proposed air strategy for Japan bears an interesting resem- blance to that of AWPD-1 for Europe. Both proposals stemmed from the basic concepts developed at the Air Corps Tactical School.  Any serious consideration of this speculation, and any derivation of lessons must take into account these circumstances in which the war was fought:  (1) Security of the American homeland
