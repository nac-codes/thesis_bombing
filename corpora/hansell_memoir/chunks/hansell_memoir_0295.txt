on the capacity of the system, and with the outbreak of war the demands rose rapidly. Power was rationed first with regard to civilian non-war use. But as the demands for munitions rose, the entire reserve capacity was absorbed, and still it was necessary to ration vital industries. By 1944 many vital industries were rationed at thirty percent below their needs.  It became impossible to allow “stand down” for maintenance and this also began to be felt. Power availability fell considerably below normal “plate” capacity.  Little effort had been made to increase the power capacity at the outset of the war, since the war was expected to be of short duration. But in 1941 an attempt was made to build ten large new plants. None of them was completed prior to the end of the war. However, existing plants were expanded on the following scale:    •Haywood S. Hansell, Jr., The Air Plan that Defeated Hitler (Atlanta, Ga., 1972), pp 286-297. In some instances, author has revised the figures in this appendix.    275     STRATEGIC AIR WAR    1942 900,000 additional KW  1943 850,000 additional KW  1944 875,000 additional KW  Since the total theoretical installed capacity came to 22,000,000 KW in 1944, of which the actual peak extraction was about 16,000,000 KW, this increase in existing plant capacity was small and was hardly felt. Of the theoretical installed capacity of 22,000,000 KW,  13,300,000 KW was incorporated in the national integrated system. The remainder was either in large factory plants, in the national railway system, or in a large number of small installations which were not included in the generally available power pool.  Of the 13,000,000 KW theoretical capacity of the integrated system,  79% was in coal burning plants.  21% was in the hydroelectric power plants.  About twenty percent of the entire generating capacity was established in the industrial area around Leipzig, Another twenty percent was established in the Ruhr. The hydroelectric plants, comprising anot
