ut twenty percent of the entire generating capacity was established in the industrial area around Leipzig, Another twenty percent was established in the Ruhr. The hydroelectric plants, comprising another twenty percent, were in southwest Germany.  The distribution of the more important electrical power stations came from some ninety-five power generating stations:  Over 200,000 KW 5  100.000 to 200,000 KW 40  50.000 to 100,000 KW 50  95  The total number of large stations was 45. Their capacity was a total of 8,000,000 KW, or nearly two-thirds of the capacity of the installed integrated systems.  This complex, vital, and over-stressed system was operated under the constant control and supervision of the National Load Dispatcher in Berlin, who in turn operated through twelve District Load Dispatchers, each having a major switching system.  Actually the maximum peak capacity that ever flowed through the system rated at 13,000,000 KW was 9,700,000 KW. Thus the 45 plants with a theoretical capacity of 8,000,000 KW constituted the    276     APPENDIX    great majority of power which was in such urgent demand by industry.  The integrated “grid” which was the cause of such concern to the Committee of Operations Analysts and the air planners turned out to be far less flexible than they had believed. The report of the USSBS says “A statement by the National Load Dispatcher discloses that the capacity of the transmission system was such as to permit an exchange between adjacent districts, of approximately 10 percent of the larger district’s capacity.” Thus the system was much less flexible than we had thought.  The report has the following to say about transmission systems:  The ability to use electric power transmitted over a transmis- sion line depends upon rather severe limits of receiving-end voltage.  Any voltage variation beyond the band of 90 percent and 110 percent of normal leads to damage of connected utilization equip- ment. At some value between 80 and 85 percent
