of receiving-end voltage.  Any voltage variation beyond the band of 90 percent and 110 percent of normal leads to damage of connected utilization equip- ment. At some value between 80 and 85 percent of normal voltage, the whole transmission system becomes unstable and will suddenly collapse with coincident wide-spread damage to utilization equip- ment.  When generating facilities are lost, the transmission system capacity drops at the same time because of the loss of synchronous equipment in the generating stations (turbo-generators), which was the terminal equipment of the transmission system. Destruction of generating facilities, therefore, has a two-fold effect: the direct loss of generating capacity of the area, and the simultaneous reduction of transmission line capacity into the area.  An integrated system contains a complex array of voltage regulators and relays and circuit breakers and switches intended to prevent and arrest damage which may be caused by sudden increases of load and sudden drops in capacity and voltage. These control complexes and safety devices are limited in the degree to which they can accommodate sudden major changes in load and voltage.  The complexes are usually integral with or immediately adjacent to the powerhouses, as are the large transformers.  The Bombing Survey concluded that all evidence indicates that the destruction of power generating and switching installations would  277     STRATEGIC AIR WAR    have had a catastrophic effect on Germany’s war production. The survey might have added that it would have had a catastrophic effect on Germany’s civilian economy and social structure as well.  Was the destruction and disruption of the German Electric Power System within the capacity of the available strategic air forces? More specifically:  (a) Could the disruption of the German electric power system have been accomplished in addition to the other operations actually carried out before the invasion, with the forces actually made
