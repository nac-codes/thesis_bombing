erating plant to air attack in wartime is a continued nightmare.  The recuperability of a generating station to a major failure even in normal times is slow. No two plants are alike, and often the individual pieces of equipment are specially designed to meet a given set of conditions. The possibility of maintaining adequate spares to cover contingencies in such ‘custom-made’ plants does not exist.  As indicated earlier, examination of these plants which had received damage incidental to attack on adjacent targets led the USSBS to conclude that .2 tons of bombs per acre would put a plant out of commission for several months, and .4 tons of bombs per acre would put a plant out of commission for a period lasting from 6 to 1 8 months.  Since a powerhouse proper averaged about four acres in extent, this would require two hits with 1 100-pound bombs to put the station out of commission for several months, and 3 hits with 1100-pound bombs to knock it out for 6 to 18 months.  The entire area of the generating complex, covering 25 acres, or an area of 1000 feet by 1000 feet, should receive 10 tons of bombs or 20 hits with 1100-pound bombs to knock it out for 6 to 18 months.  3. What size force is required to knock out a generating station, as determined by actual bombing accuracy and prevailing tactics?  In computing requirements to knock out a generating plant, the current bombing tactics employed by the Eighth Air Force, that is to say, formation pattern bombing by combat boxes of 18 aircraft at 20,000 feet and the actual bombing accuracy and distribution recorded for the Eighth Air Force in 1943 and 44 will be used:  Average radial error of the center of the bombing pattern from the aiming point: 875 feet.  Circular probable error of the center of the bombing pattern about the aiming point: 820 feet.  Average dimensions of bomb pattern: 2400 feet by 2400 feet.    280     APPENDIX    One combat box of 18 bombers carrying 1 100— pound bombs could deliver 108 bombs.  Conside
