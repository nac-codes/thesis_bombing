e aiming point: 820 feet.  Average dimensions of bomb pattern: 2400 feet by 2400 feet.    280     APPENDIX    One combat box of 18 bombers carrying 1 100â€” pound bombs could deliver 108 bombs.  Considering first the powerhouse only (400 feet by 500 feet), a combat box would provide a 75 percent probability of making at least 1 hit with 108 bombs.  If one combat wing (3 combat boxes or 54 bombers) is used against one powerhouse target, the probability of at least one hit is 98.5 percent, and the probability of at least 2 hits is 84.5 percent.  If two combat wings (6 combat boxes or a total of 108 bombers) are used against 1 target, then:  The probability of at least 1 hit is 99.99%.  The probability of at least 2 hits is 96.5%.  The probability of at least 3 hits is 89%.  The probability of at least 4 hits is 77%.  The probability of at least 5 hits is 54%.  The probability of at least 6 hits is 18%.  This is a conservative method of estimating probable hits.  The probability of making at least three hits with two combat wings is thus about ninety percent.  The normal expectancy (fifty percent probability) of hits within the powerhouse itself from one combat wing is eight.  Thus, if 2 combat wings (6 combat boxes or 108 bombers) attacked each power generating station, they would have virtual assurance of at least 1 hit in the powerhouse, a 96.5 percent probability of knocking it out with 2 hits for several months and 89 percent probability of 3 hits, knocking it out for 6 to 18 months.  As for the total target area: (1000 feet by 1000 feet)  The normal expectancy (fifty percent probability) of bombs within the target if two combat wings are used is fifteen percent. This would provide a normal expectancy of ninety-seven hits within the target area. Actual experience showed that fifteen percent of all bombs dropped by all methods (visual bombing and instrument bombing) by the Eighth Air Force against the oil targets fell within the target area.  4.
