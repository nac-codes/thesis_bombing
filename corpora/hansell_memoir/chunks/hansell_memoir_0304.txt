of visual bombing opportunity to have accommodated the precision attacks against electric power targets prior to the invasion?  Some guidance can be obtained by consideration of the number of days in the spring of 1943 on which the Eighth Air Force was launched against targets in which visual bombing conditions were predicted.  In the three months, March through May 1943, there were 25 such missions, 19 of them between 1 March and 15 May. In 1944 about 150,000 tons of bombs were dropped in this time period.  It might be expected that in the corresponding two and a half months of 1944 a similar number of daylight missions had been possible.  Oil targets would have absorbed 4 of those days and 6,000 tons of    283     STRATEGIC AIR WAR    bombs, leaving 15 visual bombing days and 144,000 tons for targets other than oil. However, the winter of 1944 was especially severe, there was an unusual amount of overcast, weather forecasts were unreliable, and weather distribution was seldom in the pattern desired. To take care of the vicissitudes of weather, allowance has been made for diversion of one half of the sorties away from the primary targets to secondary targets. This would require re-attack of half of the targets.  To repeat, it is most unlikely that the weather would have have been so accommodating as to arrange for clear skies at the places desired. But this allowance for inaccurate weather forecasting and for unfavorable weather distribution provides a cushion that is ultra conservative. The bombing effort could have accounted for the destruction of two-thirds of Germanyâ€™s electric power capacity in two and a half months even in the face of unusually bad weather.  The rate of repeat attacks for German electric power targets is quite a different matter from that for synthetic oil plants. The latter can be repaired by men with cutting torches, reinforcing plates, and welding tools. But the boilers that nave been wrecked or the large steam turbines, or the electric g
