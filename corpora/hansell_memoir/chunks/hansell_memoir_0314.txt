nese cities against B-29 strikes.  Single-wing, one-seat, single-engine, fighter-interceptor built by Kawasa- ki. Nicknamed “Tony” by the Allies, it served in virtually every theater of the Pacific, and at one time formed a major part of Japan’s home fighter force. Armament, 2 fuselage 7.7-mm guns and 2 wing- mounted 12.7-mm guns (later models strengthened this armament). Maximum takeoff weight was 7,650 pounds; top speed, 348 miles per hour at 16,404 feet; service ceiling, 32,808 feet; combat range, 1,118 miles. Tony was one of the best interceptors against the B-29s. Pilots often made “kills” by ramming the target rather than using their guns.  Known to the Allies as “Frank,” this one-seat, single-engine, Nakajima aircraft served as a day/night fighter, dive bomber, and ground support fighter. Armament, a pair of 20-mm wing cannon and twin 12.7-mm guns in the upper engine cowling. It could carry two 550-pound bombs under its wings. Maximum takeoff weight was 8,267 pounds; highest speed, 388 miles per hour at 19,685 feet; service ceiling, 34,450 feet; and combat range, 1,025 miles.  Twin-engine, two-seat, attack fighter, developed by Kawasaki. Known as “Randy” by the Allies. It resembled the Ki-45-Kai-C (‘Nick’), but had better performance. In its nose were two 20-mm cannon. The wings had 57-mm cannons (with 150 shells and a firing rate of 80 rounds per minute). A 12.7-mm machinegun in the rear cockpit fired obliquely upward to the rear. Two 550-pound bombs could be carried under the wings. Maximum takeoff weight was 16,094 pounds; top speed, 360 miles per hour at 19,685 feet; service ceiling, 32,808 feet; and combat range was 1,243 miles.  Japanese for “divine wind.” A tactic used by certain Japanese pilots during World War II, in which they flew their airplanes as missiles against Allied targets.
