The Canadian War Museum 1 announced that, in response to pressure from veterans' groups, it was going to alter a plaque describing actions of Bomber Command during the Second World War. The plaque, drafted by Museum officials, had read: The value and morality of the strategic bomber offensive against Ger- many remains bitterly contested. Bomber Command's aim was to crush civilian morale and force Germany to surrender by destroying its cities and industrial installations. Although Bomber Command and American attacks left 600,000 Germans dead and more than five million homeless, the raids resulted in only small reductions in German war production until late in the war. In altering the plaque, the Museum did what it swore it would never do: rewrite history in the face of public pressure. And, in doing so, it unleashed a fury of controversy. Some observers condemned the decision as craven, revisionist, and even Orwellian. Others responded with equal force, accusing the Museum's critics of arrogance, insensitivity to the veterans, and a lack of patriotism. Hate mail filled inboxes, and the bloggers were active for weeks. The redrafted text, three times as long as the original, satisfied the veterans and their supporters, but did so at the expense of obscuring the history that the original was meant to explain. ix  X 1 FIRE AND FUR
