and dresses caught fire, and the flames climbed up them. They screamed loudly at first, then grew quiet, gurgled, and died. Some followed Heidenkampsweg north or south, past the burning buildings and falling debris. Those who were not crushed by falling buildings made for canals running parallel to the east-west streets. They jumped in and were cooked to death. The water was boiling. The fires in buildings on either side of the street merged into one and began moving in search of oxygen. The entire neighbourhood was in flames. The bomb- ing that night was unusually concentrated. The pathfinders marked the neigh- bourhood with uncommon precision, and there was little "creepback" (which occurred when bombers dropped their bombs before they reached the aiming point). The weather was atypically hot by Hamburg's standards (the city's weather is roughly similar to that of England), and had been so for days. It was 30 degrees Celsius in the early evening and humidity was extremely low. Hamburg had expe- rienced one of largest raids of the war two nights earlier, and the city's Gauleiter (regional head) had ordered the firefighters to concentrate all of their efforts on putting out the fires. The headquarters of the fire brigade was located at the Berliner Tor, but it had dispatched the fire trucks to other parts of the city. As a result, they were on the wrong side of Hamburg when the bombing began and had to fight their way back through bomb craters, abandoned cars, and rubble. When they finally arrived in Hammerbrook, it was too late. They could only combat fires on the neighbourhood's periphery, and most of their efforts were directed toward helping the victims. The fire itself raged unchecked. 9 Somewhere in the middle of Hammerbrook, the flames converged with unimaginable force. As they did so, a chain reaction began: the intense heat led the fires to rise quickly, leaving a gas bubble below. Cold air then rushed in, mixing with the gases and setting the "bubble" ali
