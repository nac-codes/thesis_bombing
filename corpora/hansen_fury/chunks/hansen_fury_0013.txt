e force. As they did so, a chain reaction began: the intense heat led the fires to rise quickly, leaving a gas bubble below. Cold air then rushed in, mixing with the gases and setting the "bubble" alight. As the fires burned, more oxygen was sucked in and the process repeated itself. The inferno became larger and hotter, peaking at more than 1000 degrees Celsius and climbing four miles into the sky. The fire sucked all of the oxygen out of the cellars. Those in them gasped, put their faces to the ground, choked, and died. Then their bodies were incinerated. On the streets, people were met with a scene of utter chaos.

They lay where they fell and died. Rather than fresh air,
