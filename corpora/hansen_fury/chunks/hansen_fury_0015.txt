remains of the neighbour's wife and children. Ernst-G체nther and his mother sought to escape the heat in the underground railway tunnels beneath the Berliner Tor. From there they were taken by lorry to the Moorweide, a large park in the middle of the city. They joined thousands of others and waited to be transported out of Hamburg. Elfriede, her mother, and Kuttl pushed their way through the wind and crowds, making their way to the same subway station, where they stopped to rest. They saw screaming women lying on makeshift beds. There was a brownshirt (SA) whose stomach was hugely protruded from smoke poisoning. No doctor came to him, and the efforts of others to help were fruitless. He died and was dragged away. The three sat near the underground railway tracks for hours. Having no desire to climb up to the streets, they tried to find a way out by following the subway lines. They eventually made their way to the main station, the Hauptbahnhof, where they were reunited with Elfriede's father. He told them what he had seen: "The houses in the S체derstrasse had been flattened, even the cellars were gone. There was nothing left of our house; not even one stone stood atop another. The entire street was a burning mass grave. The flames were shooting out of the cel- lars! The high explosives knocked the roofs off, and the incendiaries finished | 11 the job." He closed his eyes and continued: "On the corner of S체derstrasse and Ausschl채ger Weg a lorry drove into a deep bomb crater. No one survived. God, there were so many bodies. I saw people running down the street; they suddenly caught fire; they fell to the ground and died there. The air was so hot, it could suffocate you. I jumped into the crater [among the bodies] and stayed there for at least an hour. [The British] dropped phosphorous, liquid phosphorous. People [covered in it] jumped into the canals, but when they came up they were still burning. It was an awful fate, you can't imagine . .. so many charcoaled bodies.
