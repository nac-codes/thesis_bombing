ombers ham- mered the London docks and the surrounding East End neighbourhoods, among the poorest in the city. As an inferno consumed the docks, the destruction spread through the Isle of Dogs, West Ham, Bermondsey, Stepney, Whitechapel, Poplar, Bow, and Shoreditch. In one Bow church, people knelt on the ground, wept and prayed. They were spared; some four hundred others were not. The next night, the Germans were back. More than 170 bombers pasted the East End again, killing another 400. On September 9, still more-200- bombers arrived by day, killing 370.

At Liverpool Street on Sep- tember 8, workers and soldiers stood off for hours until the latter capitulated. 17  18 1 FIRE AND FURY The Blitz: Bombing civilians and destroying houses The doors were flung open, and the people scrambled past each other, down the steps, and into the tunnels. Overnight, London's tube lines became the capital's largest air-raid shelter, housing as many as 177,000 people. They were not always safe there, however. On September 19, as German bombers continued to hammer the capital, bombs landed near the tube station at Balham. The roadway caved in, the mains burst, and the water gushed into the station below. Ballast, sand, and water mixed together and cascaded down the escalators and steps. Slime began filling the station. "All you could hear," remem- bered one air defence worker, "was the sound of screaming and rushing water." The next morning, sixty-four Londoners lay dead, with a pile of sludge on top of
