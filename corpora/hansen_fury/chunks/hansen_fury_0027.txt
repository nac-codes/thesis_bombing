He concluded that only two out of every three of the bombers dropped their loads within seventy-five miles of their target. If it was impossible to bomb precisely, then there were only two choices: bomb imprecisely or don't bomb at all. There was no other way of hitting back, 1 23 and an end to bombing was unthinkable. British forces had been driven from the Continent, and re-establishing a British military presence was out of the question. The Russians had become an ally in July 1941, but at this point in the war they were wholly engaged in a defensive conflict. Their survival was more in doubt than that of the British. And the Americans were still not in the war. All that was left was area bombing. Few people at this point or any other in the war were pre- pared to countenance the deliberate killing of German civilians as an end in itself; it had to produce some measurable good for the war. The concept of "morale," which would be worn down through city bombing, seemed to offer hope toward that end. Portal, who had by late 1941 finally converted to area bombing, put the case for targeting morale to Churchill in a September 1941 memorandum.21 "It must be realised," he wrote, that attack on morale is not a matter of pure killing, although the fear of death is unquestionably an important factor. It is rather the general dis- location of industrial and social life arising from damage to industrial plant, dwelling houses, shops, utility and transportation services, from resultant absenteeism and, in fact, from interference with all that goes to make up the general activity of a community . . . In highly industrial countries such as Germany and England it is in the thickly populated towns that the morale effect of bombing will be chiefly felt, though the population involved may be a comparatively small pro- portion of the whole. [By contrast,] in so far as the war effort is con- cerned, the contribution of the country population is only a fraction of that of the town wo
