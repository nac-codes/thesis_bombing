may be a comparatively small pro- portion of the whole. [By contrast,] in so far as the war effort is con- cerned, the contribution of the country population is only a fraction of that of the town workers. The conclusion is that the morale of the coun- try as a whole will crack provided a high enough proportion of town dwellers is affected by the general dislocation produced by bombing. Bombing the Germans into submission required will, but above all it required money. "The strength required to obtain decisive results against German morale," Portal concluded, "may be estimated at 4,000 heavy bombers and that the time taken would be about 6 months."22 Britain's daily availability of bombs was approximately five hundred at this point. Churchill wrote back two days later with a letter that-in the light of his ear- lier support for Bomber Command-was surprisingly blunt and dismissive. "It  FIRE AND FURY 24 I The Blitz: Bombing civilians and destroying houses is very disputable whether bombing by itself will be a decisive factor in the pres. ent war. On the contrary, all that we have learnt since the war began shows that its effects, both physical and moral, are greatly exaggerated. . . . The most we can say is that it will be a heavy and I trust seriously increasing annoyance."23 Among Portal's merits were a capacity to remain calm in the face of provo- cation and an ability to deal well with difficult men. He waited five days to reply. When he did, he reminded Churchill of the history of bombing. "Since the fall of France," he wrote, it has been a fundamental principle of our strategy that victory over Ger- many could not be hoped for until German morale and German material strength had been subjected to a bombing offensive of the greatest inten- sity. This principle was clearly stated [by you] more than a year ago .. . and has been reaffirmed by you in several occasions. In their recent review of General Strategy, which you approved, the Chiefs of Staff [i.e., senior
