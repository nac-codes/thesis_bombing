rty; then, by the need to avoid bombing east of the Rhine; and finally, by the need to target industry rather than civilians. In early 1942, before Harris took power, all of this changed. According to the directive, precision bombing was to be abandoned, and from that day forward bombing was to be "focussed on the morale of the enemy civil- ian population and in particular of the industrial workers." To stave off any ambiguity, the Chief of Air Staff, Sir Charles Portal, clarified the directive in a follow-up communication the next day: "Ref the new bombing directive: I sup- pose it is clear that the aiming points are to be built up areas, not, for instance, the dockyards or factories. .. . This must be made quite clear if it is not already understood."8 The directive specified "Primary Industrial Areas"-Essen, Duis- burg, DÃ¼sseldorf, Cologne-and "Alternative Industrial Targets." The directive was meant to be temporary-to apply for no more than six months. For Harris, the timing could not have been better. The directive gave him exactly what he wanted and he made no bones about it. Although not one to court publicity, he agreed to give an interview a few weeks after taking office. As the newsreel rolled, Harris barely looked at the camera, exuding an air of bored contempt. He outlined his bombing philosophy in cool, clipped tones: "There are a lot of people who say that bombing cannot win a war. My reply is that it has never yet been tried. We shall see." He nonetheless had to move carefully. Bomber Command was a demoralized animal, and the vultures-in the form of an army and, above all, a navy hungry for more air support-were circling above it.

Cripps was a devout Christian and pacifist. A vegetarian and teetotaller, he hailed from the far left of the Labour Party. In 1936, the party had to repudiate
