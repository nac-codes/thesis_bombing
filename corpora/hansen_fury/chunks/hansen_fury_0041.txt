ain under Wright in Dayton, Ohio, as a pilot. When he showed the letter to his commanding officer, the man drolly replied, "Young man, I know of no better way for a person to commit suicide."4 After two months' instruction under the Wright brothers, completed in June 1911, Arnold was a fully trained pilot. He was one of exactly two in the U.S. Aviation Service, but soon there would be twenty-six more. Of this early cohort, ten died in airplane crashes, twelve quit after a few months, and four died of natural causes. Hap was one of the survivors. After a glittering year in which he achieved a number of aviation "firsts" for high altitude, distance, and speed, a near crash on November 5, 1912, almost ended it all. He swore never to get in an airplane again and was transferred to a desk job in Washington. 35 In 1914, Arnold returned to Manila, where he and his new bride were forced to share headquarters with one other officer and many cockroaches. The latter were so large that Arnold's wife tried to kill them with a broom and failed.5 Two years later, Billy Mitchell, the father of modern American air power, asked Arnold to reconsider a career in aviation. Arnold had still not set foot in an air- plane since his near crash. He had to decide whether to try again or to bring his aviation career to an end, and with it the anomaly of an Air Force man afraid to fly. On October 18, 1916, he flew as a passenger; a month later he soloed, and in mid-December he was in the air for more than forty minutes, flying upside down and putting the aircraft through stalls, spins, rolls, and loops. "Hap" was back. After a frustrating attempt to build an air force during the First World War, Arnold was demoted to major and transferred to Rockwell Field in San Diego, where he served as commander. Despite the demotion and more provincial focus of his work, Arnold was ecstatic. He was away from the desk and commanding troops. The transfer was more fateful than he could have recognized. Arnold
