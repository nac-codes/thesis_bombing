civilian. For their part, Eaker, Spaatz, and Arnold survived the trial, but they drew at least one powerful lesson from it. "There must be something to this public relations business,"10 they were reported to have said to each other. "I guess we'd better learn it." Montgomery, Alabama, is most famous for its role in the civil rights movement. It played an equally important role in the history of air power. In 1910, at a muddy site occupied by a few wooden hangars, the Wright brothers opened their flying school. In 1922, the air force designated the site Maxwell Field. In 1928, the Air Corps Tactical School was transferred to it from Langley, Virginia. Over the subsequent decade, some of the most distinguished men in the history of American air power-Eaker, Spaatz, LeMay, and Arnold-would pass through its doors. They-and the less well-known permanent faculty at the school-developed American ideas about air power. One of the faculty lecturers was Lieutenant Colonel Harold L. George, a veteran bomber pilot who had served in the First World War and the "anonymous warrior"" who provided much of the intellectual basis for what would become America's Second World War strategic bombing campaign. During his three- year stint at the school (1933-1936), he worked with Laurence Kuter (who taught bombardment and was known for his sharp mind and brilliant sense of humour), Muir Fairchild (an instructor), Kenneth Walker (an intense, method- ological student of strategic bombing), Donald Wilson (an instructor), and Haywood S.

Mitchell and especially Douhet had said little about targets (except that, for Douhet, everything was a target) beyond the aircraft industry and the opaque goal of destroying "morale."14 George and his colleagues thought abo
