Douhet had said little about targets (except that, for Douhet, everything was a target) beyond the aircraft industry and the opaque goal of destroying "morale."14 George and his colleagues thought about nothing but targets: they wanted to identify the critical pillars of a modern 39 industrial economy and how bombing could knock them-and, with them, the enemy's war-out. Determining this required money, and the Air Corps Tactical School had little of it. They could not hire economists and they were forbidden from studying the economies of Japan or Germany. To get around these constraints, George and his colleagues studied the American industrial system as a (imperfect, as the two economies were different) proxy for the German one. Through this work, they came up with an idea of an "industrial web": modern economies were delicate and inter- connected machines that were entirely dependent the same set of key supports.15 All industries needed steel, ball bearings, and electricity. All industries needed railroads to transport these materials and to deliver their finished products. What was needed, then, was not Douhet's Old Testament war of extermination, but rather a precise and relentless bombing campaign against the producers of steel, ball bearings, elec- tricity, and similar targets.16 If bombing could destroy these "choke points," the wartime economy would collapse, and with it the will to fight on. Out of these theories emerged daylight precision bombing, America's plan for bringing the war to Germany. The question was how to accomplish it, and it is here that George's ideas showed their American origins: he had an overwhelm- ingly optimistic faith in the ability of ingenuity and technology to overcome difficulties. In an almost perfect confirmation of cultural stereotypes, early set- backs in the war quickly convinced the British that precision daylight bombing couldn't be done; the Americans, in the face of similar losses, insisted that it could.
