We are up against the mightiest Army the world has ever known."16 When Arnold left London, he had the impression that the British were setting their sights far too low and that the gloom that had overtaken the country might lose them the war. He reserved his most scathing views for Sir Richard Peirse. In contrast to the leaders of Fighter Command, who were actually fighting, Peirse was "pathetic."

Neither country would seek territorial aggrandizement, and both would foster the free- doms of all people, vanquished and victors. The United States had served notice on Hitler that his enemies had its sympathy. It had also, though this captured less attention at the time, served notice on the British Empire.
