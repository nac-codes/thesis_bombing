leman, sought a compromise and in so doing produced a phrase that would become legend. "Yes," he said, "we'll bomb them by day. You bomb them by night. We'll hit them right around the clock."21 The strategy, which had resulted not from agreement but rather the opposite. would become policy. On February 4, 1942, Eaker left to take up his assignment in England. He and six staff officers undertook a long trip to England. After a complicated journey, he finally arrived in London on February 21, a day before Harris took over Bomber Command. After three days in London, Eaker and his staff moved on to Bomber Command headquarters in High Wycombe. Harris was there to greet him. Although he and his wife, Jill, had themselves just moved in, he insisted that Eaker stay with him until his headquarters were ready. They lived at Springfield a two-storey, wide brick house. After the war, rumours circulated to the effect that the house was bombproof, but it wasn't.22 The only bombproof part of the house is a panic room in a bathroom, with a bullet-proof window. The window wasn't installed until the 1980s, when the RAF had the Irish rather than the Ger- mans to fear. In fact, both the house and the town itself-a typical provincial English town filled with rolling hills and streets of terraced, working-class houses-were chosen for their ordinariness. German reconnaissance flights Building the mighty Eighth - 47 over High Wycombe would see only a clutch of private houses. Harris did not, however, want for comfort. The house has large rooms, a dining hall reminiscent of an Oxford Head-of-House's lodging, and a grand lawn. It is stately but unpretentious and housed both the Harrises and the Eakers comfortably. The two men could not have been more different: Harris liked a drink; Eaker barely touched the stuff. Harris was hearty, gruff, and deliberately offensive; Eaker was shy and eager to please. Harris was cold and aloof with his staff; Eaker was informal and completely unpretentious.
