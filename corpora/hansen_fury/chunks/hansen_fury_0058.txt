touched the stuff. Harris was hearty, gruff, and deliberately offensive; Eaker was shy and eager to please. Harris was cold and aloof with his staff; Eaker was informal and completely unpretentious. For all that, the two men got along during their stay, and developed a friendship that would outlast the war. Harris had a monster of a personality, but never let his disagreements get in the way of friendship with those for whom he had genuine affection. After Harris's warm welcome, Eaker received a less enthusiastic one from Major General James E. Chaney (Commanding General, U.S. Army Forces in the British Isles), who had overseen the skeleton staff the Americans had in Eng- land. Chaney and Eaker, like most airmen, had known each other for some time, but Chaney was hostile to the American plan for a separate air force under Eaker and Spaatz. He had anglicized during his time in the UK, and viewed the war with the same set of low expectations as his British hosts. Under Chaney's vision, Baker and his men would become simply adjuncts to the existing London-based staff of thirty-five officers, only four of whom were airmen.23 Eaker outflanked him. He pointed out that he was there to understudy the RAF and that he could not do that from London. Fortuitously, he received an invitation from Harris to share space at RAF Bomber Command. Eaker seized upon it immediately and he, his six accompanying staff members, and eventually fifteen additional officers, all moved in. Until the U.S. Air Force had its own infrastructure in the United Kingdom, Eaker had to play his hand carefully. The British were still pressuring the Amer- icans to join in the area bombing campaign and, when expressed by Harris, that pressure was not subtle. Throughout early 1942, the commander-in-chief pressed Eaker to bomb cities. "It took," Harris told Eaker, "only a year or less to build a tank or a plane but it took 20 years to build skilled workmen, and skilled workmen in short supply would affect war
