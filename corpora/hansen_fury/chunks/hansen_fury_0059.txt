Eaker to bomb cities. "It took," Harris told Eaker, "only a year or less to build a tank or a plane but it took 20 years to build skilled workmen, and skilled workmen in short supply would affect war production as much as loss of their factory."24 Eaker was always careful not to sound skeptical, which some observers have taken as evidence of his and broader American support for Harris. The truth was more complicated: Eaker needed Harris's support and he could not risk that support by telling him that the Americans viewed city bombing as  48 | FIRE AND FURY 6 1 Burn, Germany, burn immoral, if not murderous, and pointless. Instead, he steadfastly told Harris and Portal that his orders from Arnold were to bomb by day, that American planes and crews were not trained for night bombing, and that precision daylight bombing could be made to work.25 It was an agreement to disagree. Portal and Harris did not agree with him, but they helped him. Harris turned over five long-established bases in East Anglia, and the Air Ministry agreed to build another sixty. Eaker could not have been more pleased. The first job was securing permanent headquarters. General Chaney, clearly accustomed to English privations, suggested tents, but Eaker was able to kill that idea. He also got his way on the location: in High Wycombe, within five miles of RAF Bomber Command. Harris and Eaker drew a five-mile radius around Bomber Command headquarters, and Eaker scouted the area. The only suitable building was the Wycombe Abbey School for girls, a manor house set on a verdant campus, its walkways shaded by linden trees. Harris agreed it would be perfect, but thought that securing it was beyond even his powers of persua- sion: "I'm afraid you'll have trouble getting that school. Too many of our Min- isters' wives are graduates." Eaker persevered, and applied for the school through the Air Ministry. An Air Ministry official, also a Lord, came to see Eaker a few days later and told him it was impossible.
