wives are graduates." Eaker persevered, and applied for the school through the Air Ministry. An Air Ministry official, also a Lord, came to see Eaker a few days later and told him it was impossible. "Our girls from the colonies, Australia, and Canada are in that school, and we have to keep them there. We can't send them home due to the submarine menace." Eaker replied in his Texan drawl, "If you're more interested in educating your daughters than in winning this war, I'm glad you've told us." The official was taken aback and left. The next day, he called: "The school is yours."26 Eaker moved in three weeks later. Although formally part of a joint strategy, over the next three years the Americans and British would effectively fight parallel but separate air wars against Germany. While the Americans were preparing for their war, Britain's, under Arthur Harris, would begin in earnest. he bombing force that Harris took over in 1942 was small: 407 bombers. Of 1 these, only 136 (29 Lancasters, 62 Halifaxes, and 45 Stirlings, all four- engined aircraft with maximum speeds of some 260 miles per hour) were heavy bombers.1 A force of that size could be literally wiped out over the course of a few high-loss raids. Harris viewed the situation with his usual clarity. He sought to increase the number of bombers, to expand his crews, and to make sure that both had a better chance of surviving. All three problems had, as Harris saw it, a single solution: successful raids that inflicted a great deal of damage to Germany at little cost to Bomber Command. A new development in radar, an area in which the British were always ahead of the Americans, Gee (named after the first letter in grid), helped. Gee was devel- oped in 1940-1941 and worked like this: three transmitter stations in England (one "master" and two "slave") sent signals that were picked up by equipment carried in the bombers. When the navigator's three signals were plotted, the result was a sort of a grid, and the positio
