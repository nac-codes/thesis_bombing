of bombs does it take to break a town? And, how should the bombs be delivered-in one sharp attack or over a number of nights; if the latter, in what rations should the total load be distributed and over how many nights?30 Zuckerman carried out the survey with the help of Desmond Bernal, a Cambridge scientist. They chose Birmingham and Hull as typical manufacturing and port towns. Cherwell sent Zuckerman and Bernal requests for data and had an almost complete tally of the bombs dropped during air raids fed to David Butt in the Statistical Department.31 Butt analyzed the  56 | FIRE AND FURY results and then presented them to Cherwell. They, but not the Zuckerman-Bernal report itself, formed the basis for a minute he drafted for Churchill. It was ready on March 30. The following seems a simple method of estimating what we could do by bombing Germany. Careful analysis of the raids on Birmingham, Hull and elsewhere have shown that on average one tonne of bombs dropped on a built-up area demolished 20-40 dwellings and turns 100-200 people out of house and home. We know from our experience that we can count on nearly 14 opera- tional surveys per bomber produced. The average lift of the bombers we are going to produce over the next 15 months will be 3 tons. It follows that each of these bombers will in its lifetime drop about 40 tons of bombs. If these are dropped on built up areas they will make 4,000-8,000 people homeless. In 1938 over 22 million Germans lived in 58 towns of over 100,000 inhabitants, which, with modern equipment, should be easy to find and hit. Our forecast output of heavy bombers (including Wellingtons) between now and the middle of 1943 is about 10,000. Even if half the total load of 10,000 bombers were dropped on the built-up areas of these 58 German towns the great majority of their inhabitants (about one-third of the German population) would be turned out of house and home. Investigation seems to show that having one's house demolished is most damag
