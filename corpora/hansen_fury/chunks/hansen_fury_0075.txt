it is an error to contrast a humane Tizard, who wanted to spare German cities the horrors of bombing, with a sadistic Cherwell. Some of Cherwell's more blood- thirsty comments make the contrast a tempting one, but it is false. As Tizard's point (b) implies, he was willing to carpet-bomb the Germans. He simply doubted that it was technically possible to do so and that, even if it were, it would deliver what Cherwell promised. Bomber Command could expect at most seven thousand bombers by mid-1943, not the ten thousand Cherwell promised; bombs would hit, at most, 25 percent of their targets; and the next generation of radar navigation and bomb aids necessary to perform better would not be available before spring of 1943 at the earliest. Above all, such a large transfer of resources might lose the war elsewhere, notably in the Battle of the Atlantic. Given all of this, bombing on the scale envisaged by Cherwell "would certainly be most damaging, but would not be decisive unless in the intervening period Germany was either defeated in the field by Russia, or at least prevented from any further advance."36 Tizard was not alone in his skepticism. When Cherwell's memorandum made its way to Zuckerman, he was taken aback, as it contradicted his and Bernal's report.37 In neither town was there any evidence of panic resulting from a series of raids or a single raid. The situation in Hull has been somewhat obscured  60 1 FIRE AND FURY 7 | Killing the Boche from this point of view by the occurrence of trekking [people leaving town at night], which was made possible by the availability of road trans- port which was much publicized as a sign of breaking morale, but which in fact can be fairly regarded as a considered response to the situation. In both towns, actual raids were, of course, associated with a degree of alarm and anxiety which cannot in the circumstances be regarded as abnormal. and in which in no instance was sufficient to provoke mass anti-social behaviour.
