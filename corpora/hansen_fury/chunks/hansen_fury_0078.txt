by now." He then added a few sentences that generously interpreted the truth: "[Ira] and I see eye to eve in all such matters-and indeed in all matters. He's a great man. I do not thereby infer that I am also! But I find myself in invariable agreement with him-except perhaps that I think he will find it necessary to go easy on the daylight bomb- ing stuff until he has found his way ... Extraordinary how many people can think of ways of employing air power except the right one! I know you have your problems too. Frightening the codfish over wide open spaces will never win a war. Bombing Germany and Japan will win this one-or else."3 Harris's next try came over the northern Baltic city of Rostock. Over four nights, Bomber Command attacked the medieval core of the densely packed city. Despite heavy defences, the raids were another destructive success: forty thousand were made homeless and two hundred killed.4 The raids on both LÃ¼beck and Rostock followed the same pattern. High explosive bombs landed in the middle of densely packed streets-on houses. churches, museums, and government buildings-and exploded. They created large piles of flammable material as well as air passages through which flames could travel. Incendiary bombs served as matches, creating large fires that would do most of the damage. The Air Ministry had concluded in late 1941 that only the old town centres were suitable targets for large-scale incendiary attacks, and even then the spreading fire would not necessarily develop into a widespread conflagration. To ensure it did required a relentless attack that would overwhelm the fire brigade and interrupt the water supply used to fight the fires; ideally, high-speed winds would carry the flames over fire breaks.5 The high explosives also had to do the job right. If they hit buildings but failed to smash out the doors and windows, there would not be enough oxygen to feed the fire. If they 63 levelled the building entirely, what would have been an inferno
