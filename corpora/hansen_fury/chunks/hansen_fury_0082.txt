burg, Germany's second-largest city and Europe's largest port. What was more, the Elbe provided a user-friendly map leading right into the heart of the Hanseatic capital. On May 27, the day originally chosen by Harris for the Hamburg raid, thick clouds covered England and northern Germany. A raid in such conditions risked collisions on a massive scale over the target area and during landing.13 Such a disaster might have finished Bomber Command. He postponed the operation for twenty-four hours, but Hamburg and eastern England were once again cov- ered in cloud. The operation was postponed until May 29, and then for the same reasons until May 30. The pressure was beginning to mount on Harris. The longer he waited, the stronger his critics would become. On the morning of May 30, 1942, Harris walked into the operations room at Bomber Command headquarters in rural Buckinghamshire, near the village of Walters Ash. He sat at his desk and tensely waited for the meteorological reports. At 9:10 A.M., the meteorological officer gave him unexpected news: while north- ern Germany would be covered in cloud, there was a chance that it would break up in the south. Saundby added, "The home base will, on the whole, be clear of cloud."14 Harris remained stone-faced. He slowly pulled a cigarette pack from his pocket, flicked the bottom with his thumb, and retrieved a protruding Lucky Strike.15 He set the cigarette precisely within a cigarette holder he retrieved from his right breast pocket and placed the holder firmly between his teeth.16 Still silent, Harris put a finger on the charts in front of him and moved it slowly from England toward the European continent. It passed Brussels and Loewen in Belgium, and reached the German border. He continued to move it past Aachen and the liberal, francophile city of DÃ¼sseldorf. Then he stopped. He turned to his senior air staff officer, his face still expressionless, and said, "The Thou- sand Plan. Tonight."17 His finger rested on Cologne.  8
