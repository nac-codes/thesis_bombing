A fighter pilot awarded the prestigious Pour le Mérite by the Kaiser in June 1918, he was an uncritical subscriber to the "stab-in-the-back" theory.10 He met Hitler in 1922, and was immediately con- vinced that Hitler had the keys to Germany's greatness. By 1939, Göring was in charge of a rambling empire that controlled the police, the air ministry, and industrial policy across an increasingly centralized Germany.
