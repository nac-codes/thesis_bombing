Thou- sands of Jews had been arrested during Kristallnacht, and afterwards many others fled. Across the city, hundreds of apartments previously occupied by Jews were vacant. As Speer's redevelopment plans would require a great deal of excess hous- ing, he was very keen to get hold of the vacated apartments, and to ensure that he had access to those forcibly vacated by Jews in the future.25 At this time, the notorious anti-Semite Goebbels and his subordinate Adolf Eichmann began cleansing Berlin of Jews. On October 13, 1939, hundreds of Jews received expulsion orders. The next day, SS units burst into their flats and ordered them to pack a few belongings immediately. The SS transported them to a collecting camp run by Jews in a synagogue on Levetzowstrasse. On Octo- ber 17, the Jews were slowly marched in pouring rain through the leafy streets of Grunewald to the suburb's railway station. A day later, the first trains left for Lodz; others left for Riga, Minsk, and other points east. Across Germany, sui- cides became more and more common, to the point where the SS Sturmbann- f√ºhrer Alois Brunner (who had organized the expulsion of Jews from Vienna) wrote to Jewish leaders and demanded that they "prevent this flight into sui- cide."26 In early 1940, some nine months into the operation, a Gestapo official gleefully announced to the Jewish community office on Oranienburgerstrasse that the Jews of Berlin were no more.

Several entries refer to the eviction, resettlement, and, later, evacuation of Jewish tenants. On November 27, 1940, Speer wrote to an assistant to ask him: "How is the clearance of those thousand Jewish flats going?" By some quirk of fate, Speer's fortunes changed forever in exactly the
