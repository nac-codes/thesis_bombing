ants. On November 27, 1940, Speer wrote to an assistant to ask him: "How is the clearance of those thousand Jewish flats going?" By some quirk of fate, Speer's fortunes changed forever in exactly the same month that Harris's and Eaker's did: February 1942. If Harris's predecessor  ISA 1 FIRE AND FURY 78 Goring and Speer | suffered from a lack of self-assurance and an unwillingness to speak truth to power, Speer's had the opposite problem. Fritz Todt was born in 1891 to a wealthy upper-middle-class family similar to Speer's. He joined the Nazis in 1922 and remained a committed national socialist throughout his life.27 Almost immedi- ately after the Nazi seizure of power, he was tasked with overseeing the con- struction of the autobahns.

He saw first-hand how winter had stopped the German soldiers in their tracks and revealed how hopelessly overextended they were. Back in Berlin, he arranged a meeting with Hitler on November 29. He told him that opening a second front was a strategic blunder. The war could not be won and it was time to seek a political solution.

Two weeks later, as if in deliberate rebuke of Todt, he declared war on the United States. By January 1942, the tide was beginning to turn. It looked as if
