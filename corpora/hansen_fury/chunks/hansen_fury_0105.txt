ations; air bombardment alone was not suf- ficient."12 The 1942 bombings of Bremen, Emden, Duisburg, Düsseldorf, Lübeck, Osnabrück, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Rostock, and other cities had not brought Germany to its knees, and both Portal and Churchill were starting to view Har- ris's promises with skepticism. There was also agreement on the overwhelming necessity of beating the U-boats at sea,13 with the predictable exception of Har- ris. In June 1942, he said of Coastal Command: "it achieves nothing essential. .. It abates little. ... It aids by preventing a few shipping losses. A very few."14 Eaker arrived in Casablanca on January 15 and took his rooms. He tried to reach Arnold right away, without success. Arnold wasn't able to escape meetings until that evening, when he joined Eaker and Harriman for dinner. He told Baker that "the President is under pressure from the Prime Minister to aban- don day bombing and put all our bomber force in England into night operations along with (and preferably under the control of) the RAF." Eaker exploded. "General, that is absurd. The cross-Channel operation will then fail. Our planes are not equipped for night bombing; our crews are not trained for it. We'll lose more planes landing on that fog-shrouded island in darkness than we lose now over German targets. If our leaders are that stupid, count me out. I don't want any part of such nonsense!" Arnold, himself given to flying off the handle, was amused to see the usu- ally controlled Eaker do so. He chuckled and replied, "I know all that as well as you do ... [in] fact, I hoped you would respond that way. The only chance we have to go get that disastrous decision reversed is to convince Churchill of its effort. I have heard him speak favorably of you. I'm going to try to get an appointment for you to see him. Stand by and be ready."15  FIRE AND FURY 84 1 Churchill, Roosevelt, and the future of bombing | 85 Eaker returned to his villa with his assistant, James Parton, took a pencil,
