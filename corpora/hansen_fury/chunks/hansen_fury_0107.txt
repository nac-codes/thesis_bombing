.54 percent; British 4.7 percent-but Eaker resisted the temptation to correct the prime minister. He presented Churchill with a short memorandum, less than a page long, making his case. "I hope," he said to the prime minister, "you will read it." Churchill had Eaker sit on the sofa beside him. Reading half-aloud, he absorbed Eaker's arguments. Toward the end, Churchill began to speak louder, rolling the words and adding emphasis to his rounded English tones:18 Day bombing is the bold, the aggressive, the offensive thing to do. It is the method and the practice which will put the greatest pressure on Germany, work the greatest havoc to his war-time industry and the greatest reduction in his air force. The operations of the next 90 days will demonstrate in convincing manner the truth of these conclusions. We have built up slowly and painfully and learned our job in a new theater against a tough enemy. Then we were torn down and shipped away to Africa. Now we have just built back up again and are ready for the job we all cherish-daylight bombing of Germany. Be patient, give us our chance and your reward will be ample-a successful day bombing offensive to combine and conspire with the admirable night bombing of the RAF to wreck German industry, transportation and morale-soften the Hun for land invasion and the kill.19 The memo still in his hand, Churchill chatted with Eaker as if the two were old friends. After Eaker argued his case further, Churchill handed the memo back to him. He said, "Young man, you have not convinced me that you are right, but you have persuaded ded me that you should have further opportunity to prove your contention. How fortuitous it would be if we could, as you say, bomb the devils around the clock. When I see your President at lunch today, I shall tell him that I withdraw my suggestion that U.S. bombers join the RAF in night bombing and that I now recommend that our joint effort, day and night bomb- ing, be continued for a time."20 Arnold was
