In the spring of 1943, the 89  FIRE AND FURY 90 | The Rubr 1 Ruhr became the focus of Harris's war. "At long last," he said, "we are ready and equipped.

They made up the pathfinder force and were car- rying Oboe tracking equipment, which allowed them to pinpoint with great accuracy the marking point, and red flares.
