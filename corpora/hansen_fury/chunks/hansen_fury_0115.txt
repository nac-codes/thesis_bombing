Twenty-four children came out into the street. Paul led them through the burn- ing streets and to the subway near the main station. His arms and hands were covered in burns. At 4 A.M., the door of the shelter housing Horst and his mother was opened. "I," he said sixty-five years later, "could not believe my eyes. . . . There were smoking piles of rubble everywhere.

When the flames subsided, 479 people were dead and another 30,000 were homeless. Horst and Paul stayed in the city, and a week later-on March 12-they watched the rest of it go under in a second devastating RAF raid. Essen was the opening salvo in the Battle of the Ruhr.
