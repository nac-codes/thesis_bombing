special squadron and suggested Guy Gibson to command it. Gibson, a dashing young man with a lovely smile, was already known as a crack pilot who had flown a hundred missions over three bombing tours-one tour more than was usual. Harris rarely admitted he was wrong, but on those rare occasions when he did, he did not hesitate to change his behaviour. From then on, the dambuster raid had his full support, and by May, 617 Squadron was ready to attack the Ruhr dams. On the night of May 16, nineteen aircraft-specially designed Lancasters-took off for the Ruhr. Nine were to attack the Möhne, five the Sorpe, and five were in reserve. En route, the Sorpe force was savaged. Guns raked one of the planes, while another grazed the water while taking evasive action; both had to return.4 Between Harderwijk and Apeldoom, ground fire Busting dams | 95 sliced into the lead planes; they crashed to the ground, taking all fourteen crew members to their death. Three were Canadians.5 Gibson's Möhne force fared better, but one plane was lost on the way. Flak tore a Lancaster from the sky; another three Canadians died in the crash.6 When Gibson's plane reached the Möhne, there were eight airborne and ready to attack. Under intense flak fire in the full glare of the searchlights, Gibson's aircraft swept in low across the water. He dropped his bomb and pulled up hard. The bomb skipped across the water, hit the side of the dam, and exploded under- water. A perfect hit. When Gibson looked back, however, the dam was still stand- ing. A second plane, piloted by John ("Hoppy") Hopgood, came in next. Hopgood's plane had already been raked by ground fire on the way over, wound- ing his rear gunner. He was bleeding from the head and Hopgood could have easily returned to base with honour. Instead, he had chosen to press on. As he came in over the water, he did not enjoy Gibson's element of surprise. Flak strafed his airplane, setting his starboard wing on fire. His bomb-aimer, John Fraser of Nanaimo
