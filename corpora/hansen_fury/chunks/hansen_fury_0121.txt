higher than on the average raid, and small compared to the vast degree of destruction meted out against the dams. Gibson became a national hero, though he did not enjoy his status for long. He was above all a bomber and could not forgo the thrill of the air. After writing his bestselling book, Enemy Coast Ahead, and going on a lecture tour of the U.S. (paid for by the British government in the vain hope of keeping its hero on the ground), Gibson con- tinued to badger Bomber Command for a return to operations. He volunteered for still more bombing runs and, in 1944, his plane went down on its way to a raid over Rheydt, a suburb of Monchengladbach. The man who had dodged dozens of Luftwaffe fighters and tons of flak had run out of luck. And fuel. His plane crashed near Steenburgen in the Netherlands. He was twenty-six years old.

Once there, some of them would become hope- lessly lost, failing to find Germany much less any particular city in it. Those planes that did reach their target would circle pathetically above it, trying to identify without radar the precision target they had been assigned. They were easy prey for the Luftwaffe, and Bomber Command suffered terrible casualties. As the Butt report had made clear, the bombs that did fall barely hit anything.

Over the space of four months, Harris had taken out major German cities and brought Bomber Command to industrial Germany's beating heart. And, finally, as a definitive answer to the sniping of the Butt report, the dam- buster raid had hit a target with a precision me
