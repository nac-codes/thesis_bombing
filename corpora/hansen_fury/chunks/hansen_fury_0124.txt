"missed its second chance."" Harris did not have the benefit of Speer's views, and he in any case thought the advantage of the dambuster raids lay in their effect on Bomber Command morale and popularity. Cities remained the key to Germany's war effort. In the months after the dambuster raids, Harris returned to them. On May 28, 826 bombers lit Dortmund's medieval centre on fire, knocking out the Hoesch steel- works with it. The following night, almost five hundred bombers attacked Wup- pertal. Fires tore through the city centre's narrow streets, destroying half of the city and leaving thirty-four hundred dead and a hundred thousand homeless. Busting dams | 99 The bombers had developed a new technique. The first wave of planes dropped the high explosives that tore off the roofs of the houses and public buildings. The second wave followed with incendiaries, which lit the houses' contents and interior walls on fire. Fires spread from one building to another, and soon the neighbourhood was a conflagration. With any luck, the high explosives would also break underground waterlines, making it impossible to fight the fires. The ratio varied, but Portal viewed the ideal as one-third high explosives to two- thirds incendiaries.12 This technique was again employed to devastating effect on the Rhine city of Düsseldorf on June 11-12. The high explosives-incendiaries sequence started 8000 fires, destroyed 25 miles of the city centre, and left 1400 people dead and another 140,000 homeless. On June 21-22, the fires did their work on Krefeld, destroying half of the city, killing five hundred people, and making another sev- enty thousand homeless. The next night, 550 aircraft destroyed 60 percent of Mülheim an der Ruhr.13 The night after that, Bomber Command destroyed the other half of Wuppertal and left four thousand dead. By July, Bomber Com- mand had carried out twenty-two major raids. The raids had killed fifteen thou- sand civilians, and seven thousand aircrew. The Battle of t
