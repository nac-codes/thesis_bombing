Wuppertal and left four thousand dead. By July, Bomber Com- mand had carried out twenty-two major raids. The raids had killed fifteen thou- sand civilians, and seven thousand aircrew. The Battle of the Ruhr ended with the destruction of the medieval city of Remscheid; a July 30-31 raid flattened the city centre. After twenty minutes, "the town," as one Group captain put it, "had ceased to exist."14 The RAF lost fifteen aircraft. One-a Halifax-landed near Hermann Josef-Baum's Flak Batterie.15 Hermann was an eighteen-year-old flak operator from Oberkassel, a DÃ¼ssel- dorf suburb. He had been called up to serve in air defence as a schoolboy, on February 15, 1943.16 A German fighter raked the Halifax with bullets, and it made an emergency landing. When Hermann's crew reached it, only one aircrew was alive. Badly wounded, he was transported by Hermann's Batterie to a POW camp hospital. Hermann removed and kept the plate bearing the Halifax's serial number: E.E.P. 108770. Speer viewed coal (of which one-third of Germany's supply was in the Ruhr), but also steel and chemicals, as key spokes in the German war economy. He feared that sustained attack on them-meaning an initial raid that destroyed the factories and subsequent raids that frustrated efforts to repair them-would cripple Germany's capacity to wage war. In the early years of the war, such pre- cision would have been impossible; by 1943, as the dambuster raids had so clearly  100 | FIRE AND FURY Busting dams proven, it was possible. "The principle followed [in the dambuster raids ] was to paralyze a cross section, as it were-just as a motor can be made useless by the removal of the ignition."17 As Speer surveyed the damage, he concluded that the results for Germany could well be disastrous. "I had early recognized," Speer wrote, "[that] the war could largely have been decided in 1943 if instead of vast but pointless area bombing, the planes had concentrated on centres of arma ments production."18 For his part, Harr
