arranged. From these tests, the committee concluded that if the time it took for a beam to return from an airplane was multiplied by the speed of the signal and divided by two, it was possible to find and then follow the airplane.7 Wattson-Watt's early work also showed how radar might be rendered use- less. When he conducted early tests on RAF planes, he noticed that anything close to the planes-a bird, for instance-would interfere with their radar equip- ment. If the British could drop objects from their planes continuously, they might disrupt German radar and protect their aircraft. Out of this simple idea emerged Window: metal strips, dropped in the thousands, would render German radar useless. Window was on course for early adoption in 1942, but then Cherwell-who "rarely found it possible to believe in an idea unless he was at least a midwife at its delivery"8-intervened. He pointed out the obvious-if the strategy worked against German radar, it would also work against the British. And then he posed a question that still shook a bombing-weary country: what if the Germans launched a new and more devastating blitz against Britain?" The idea horrified those responsible for defending London: Fighter Command, Anti-Aircraft Com- mand, and Minister of Home Security Herbert Morrison. Tizard threw his weight behind Bomber Command, which was firmly in favour of Window, but it was not enough. Its introduction was delayed. Harris was disgusted, and he did not hesitate to let the Air Ministry know. Directly addressing Cherwell's "tit-for-tat" argument, "it is generally wise," he wrote in late May 1942, "when you think of a weapon first to use it. Otherwise you lose all chance of profit before the enemy, as he will think of it and get it into service. This weapon is adjudged to be of benefit to the bomber. The bomber crews have more to face than anyone else in our war. They should be given all reasonable preference. But because we are defensively minded-and that never yet wo
