There were not. He said words to the effect of, "It is now time to synchronize your watches. Good luck."5 Then he turned and left the room.

Once in the air, Moseley's Stir- ling was overtaken by the Lancasters in the pathfinder force. 109 At around 10 P.M., Jack Pragnell's Halifax took off and slowly began to gain altitude. His first job was to get the heavy plane as high in the air as possible. Down below, in Wellingborough, his fianc√©e, Brenda, could often hear the planes and wondered which one he was in.

The Luftwaffe had been warned. About eighty
