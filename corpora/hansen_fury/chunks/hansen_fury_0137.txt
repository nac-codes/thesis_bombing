Hitler. with an eye to Britain's rapidly expanding bombing force, ordered Göring to devote sixty billion Reichsmarks to the building up of Germany's bombing force. Kammhuber and the rest of Luftwaffe High Command knew that such overnight expansion was impossible. German industry could not produce the materials fast enough. They told Göring so, presenting Kammhuber's alternate plan for twenty billion Reichsmarks at one-third of the production levels Göring looked at them and said, "The Führer's program has to be carried out as planned. You will somehow meet the quotas." It was an invitation to lie. Kammhuber had had enough of Göring and he requested active duty. He was sent to France, quickly shot down and captured. After France fell, he was released and sent back to Germany for Luftwaffe service. Erhard Milch, always a backer, put him in charge of coordinating Germany's air defence. The result of Kammhuber's efforts was the XII Fliegerkorp-a dedicated night-fighter force-and the Kammhuber Line, which linked the three spokes of air defence-flak, fighters, and searchlights-in a single integrated defence system. The first spoke was made up of the fighter forces, which were organized into "boxes" (Himmelbetten, or sky beds, in German) stretching along the German coast.7 Each had a radius of about twenty-two miles and was linked with a Würzburg mirror, which covered the twenty-two-mile range and could follow a bomber in every direction. From the ground, vast searchlights illuminated the darkened sky. When a bomber entered a box, the night control officer would use the radio to direct the fighters to exactly the point where the bomber crossed over the searchlight. From that moment, the bomber had three minutes to identify and engage his target. The whole thing would be over in ten minutes. The bomber would be spinning t
