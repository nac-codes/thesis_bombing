the bomber crossed over the searchlight. From that moment, the bomber had three minutes to identify and engage his target. The whole thing would be over in ten minutes. The bomber would be spinning toward the ground or he would be through the box Fighters did not pursue bombers that made it through The next obstacle was a chain of searchlights further east, about eighteen miles deep, stretching from the Skagerrak Straight (between Norway and Den- mark) and ending in northeastern France. The searchlights were themselves divided into quadrants made up of three sections of nine sixty-inch searchlights. In the centre was a main searchlight. The centre light and those around it rotated 360 degrees in unison. Behind the wall of light, the squadrons of fighters (Helle Nachtjagd) were waiting.

He took out a stopwatch, which would allow him to throw down the bundles every sixty seconds exactly. Around him, seven hundred other flight engineers were doing the same. They would continue to do so for the next two hours, as the planes flew to Hamburg and back, stopping only on the outward flight once they were sixty minutes away from the city. At half past midnight, the pathfinders had the German coast-and thus the Kammhuber Line-in their sights. They approached it, waiting for the flak and the fighters. Their breath quickened, and their hands gripped the controls more tightly. From the back, the rear gunner's eyes strained against the darkness, try- ing to pick up enemy fighters.

Whereas dozens upon dozens of Luftwaffe fighters might normally attack the bomber stream, only a handful-drawn
