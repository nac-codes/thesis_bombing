target indicators guided the other pathfinders into the city, and the white told them whether to drop their red indicators.12 Within a few minutes, thirty-nine yellow and red target indicators were cascading down over Hamburg, forming a rough rectangle over the city centre.13 These markers served as maps for the incoming bombers. Minutes later, some seven hundred bombers swept in over the northeast of the city,14 over Elmsb√ºttel and into the city centre, toward Altona (southwest of the centre) and Wandsbek (northeast of the centre). One of those above the city was an unusual passenger, an American: Brigadier General Fred Anderson, the commanding general of 113 the U.S. Eighth Bomber Command. He was there to watch, and was flown by Canadian Richard Garvey of 83 Squadron.15 They were aiming for the middle of the city, near the Rathaus and Alster, at a point exactly above a church-St. Nicholas, the city's highest peak. The goal on July 25, 1943, was to drop the bombs within 3 square miles of the twelfth- century church, destroying a pear-shaped area covering 3 miles by 1.5.16 It was the centre of administrative, cultural, and residential Hamburg. The first high explosives landed southwest of the city centre just before I A.M. They were designed, in the words of one Bomber command veteran, to "open up" the houses. The bombs hit the roofs of the residential areas below within a few seconds. The high explosives sliced into the houses. Shingles, dust, brick, sometimes cabinets, beds, tables, children's toys, and whatever else was in the flat followed the bomb down with a deafening crash. Seconds after drawing the house into itself, the process was reversed: the bomb detonated. Within the blink of an eye, shingles became dust; wood, brick, stone, and-if the house was occupied-body parts exploded outward in vast arcs in all directions. The house either collapsed or stood gutted. The shattered roofs, blown-out windows, and debris were manna for the incendiary bombs. Fires sp
