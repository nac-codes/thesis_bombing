in Wandsbek, an affluent suburb northeast of the city centre. He was not a Hamburger by birth, and was one of few Germans who could view Hamburgers as southerners. Gerhard was born in Flensburg, Germany's northernmost city, close to Denmark, but moved to Hamburg in 1933. The tran- sition from Flensburg to Hamburg coincided with Gerhard's own transition from childhood to boyhood. Although his youth would be lived out against the backdrop of the Nazi period, Gerhard was not by inclination political and he took little notice of events around him.
