first line of high explosives was dropped. The bombs hit the roofs of the residential areas below within a few sec. onds, tearing them open. After a few minutes, the sound of the bombs became more intense, and it was possible to identify them by the piercing howl and the change in air pressure. A. Gerhard and his family sat in the cellar, it was clear that the bombs were com ing closer. The house shook with each one. As he huddled with the others, Ger hard thought of the difference between a soldier and a civilian: the soldier meet his death head-on, in the open; a civilian hides from it in his own coffin. Then a pattern in the bombing emerged. One whistle and then an explosion; another this one closer; a third, and then a fourth. Each whistle was louder, and each explosion was closer. A line of bombs had been dropped as the plane passed over the neighbourhood. Then, suddenly, there was silence. People in the cellar began to scream. Intuitively, collectively, they knew that the next bomb was theirs Women hugged their children; wives grasped their husbands' hands. The high explosive hit the house with a deafening explosion. It cut through brick and mortar; the walls caved in and the ceiling came down. Everything was dark. Gerhard felt something on his legs. He tried to move them, but they were pinned. He opened his eyes and made out the blurry outlines of a beam above his head. He had crouched under a door frame. It had held as it fell with the house and landed at an angle that created a gap beneath it. Without that, the beam would have almost certainly crushed Gerhard's head. He heard no one. The only sound was of wood creaking and dust settling. He called out to his parents "Mama? Papa?" There was no reply. He called again, but still nothing. Gerhard turned his head and could make out the outlines of the garden. The door frame created a gap in the rubble. Carefully, he pulled his legs out from under the debris, squeezed through the gap, and stepped onto the grass.
