Front from these sources. On the other hand, the expansion of German fighter strength is continuing and has increased 13 percent this year. It was hoped that this expansion would by now have been stopped. The Eighth Air Force, who were achieving a great task with their existing resources, believe they can achieve even greater successes if their strength is increased." It was imperative, Portal argued, to ensure a victory in the battle for air supremacy by autumn 1943. Without it, the Germans, "by conservation of their strength and by the development of new methods of defense, might be in an unassailable position by the spring." The key to winning this battle was to put an end to the constant drain on the Eighth's forces: "To achieve our object diversions from the Eighth Air Force should be stopped, loans of aircraft from the Eighth Air Force to other theatres must be returned and the bomber command of the Eighth Air Force must be built up and reinforced to the maximum possible." Portal drew heavily on a recent report from the British Intelligence Appreciation: Germany is now faced with imminent disaster if only the presence of POINTBLANK can be maintained and increased before the increase in the GAF [German Air Force] has gone too far ... The daylight "Battle of Ger- many" is evidently regarded by the Germans as of critical importance and we have already made them throw into it most, if not all, of their avail- able reserves.38 If we do not now strain every nerve to bring enough force to bear to win this battle during the next two or three months but are content to see the Eighth Bomber Command hampered by a lack of rein- forcements just as success is within its grasp, we may well miss the oppor- tunity to win a decisive victory against the German Air Force which will have incalculable effects on all future operations and the length of the war. And the opportunity, once lost, may not recur. Imperial War Museum London  FIRE AND FURY 132 | Speer's nightmare | Quoting
