to attack Schweinfurt again.53 Harris of course had no intention of hitting Schweinfurt, but the Americans-mindful of their losses-also paused to regroup. The losses they sustained on the first Schweinfurt raid ruled out a quick follow-up. Instead, the Americans looked to easier targets, and to easier bombing in the run-up to the second Schweinfurt raid. The targets were limited to cities in the western reaches of Germany: Emden (October 2), Bremen (October 8), and Münster (October 10). In the first two raids, the Americans experimented with a new radar technique, H2X. Through a signal under the air- plane, H2X produced a rough outline of the earth's surface, distinguishing water. forests, and cities. It allowed the Eighth to bomb through the dense cloud covering Germany in winter. The problem was that the radar could not make out factories. The Americans continued to aim at precision targets, but they were effectively bombing blind. Then, on the morning of Sunday, October 10, members of the 95th Bomb Group were told that "unlike all previous military and industrial targets attacked ... , today you will hit the centre of [Münster], the homes of the working pop- ulation of those marshalling yards. You will disrupt their lives so completely that their morale will be seriously affected."54 A young Group Navigator, Cap- tain Ellis Scripture, was "shocked to learn that we were to bomb civilians as our primary target for the first time in the war." Scripture approached the Group commander, Colonel John Gerhart, and said he couldn't fly the mission. Ger- hart replied: "Look, Captain, this is war ... spelled W-A-R. We're in an all-out fight. The Germans have been killing innocent people all over Europe for years. We're here to beat the hell out of them . .. and we're going to do it. .. . You have no option! If you don't fly, I'll have to court-martial you. .. . Any questions?" There weren't. The bombers pasted the centre of Münster, leaving seven hun- dred people dead. n A
