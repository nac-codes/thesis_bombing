been coned. Lofthouse dived, hoping to shake the cone. It didn't work. He jettisoned his flares and tried again to shake the searchlight. Again, no luck. Then a "great bright 'whoosh' of tracer" streamed past the cockpit. He was under fire: "I don't suppose anyone saw the attacking plane; the gun- ners must have been blinded by the searchlights. This coloured tracer just raced by us and the damage was on the port side. The wings and engines were badly hit." While the engineer frantically tried to put out the engine fire, the navigator, Denis Cayford, bravely asked if he could try crawling out onto the wing to put 139 out the fire there. As this would have been a certain death, Lofthouse said no. He ordered his crew to dump the bomb load and shouted, "Abandon!" The flames were very fierce by now, stretching back from each engine, and there was a large hole in the wing between the two nacelles, with flames coming out of it, being beaten back by the airflow. The crew started [jumping through the bomb chute]. The flight engineer put my parachute ready beside me. The wireless op came forward and gave me a thumbs-up to indicate that the boys at the back had gone. Cayford came back at that stage, went back to his "office" [the navigator's bay], and then went for- ward and out. He told me later that he had come back for a gold signet ring from his girlfriend, which he always took off when flying because it got so cold. That horrified me because I was fighting the controls hard by then, but I managed to get out.5 Lofthouse broke his arm as he jumped, and his parachute came down in a tree. He was hanging outside the window of a wooden barrack building, easily visible to anyone inside. The building was used by concentration camp labour- ers sent to work in the fields and watched over by camp guards. Lofthouse was a POW within seconds. But he was alive, as was-he would learn later-the rest of his crew. Many others were not so lucky. Flight Lieutenant Kevin Hornibrook's plane,
