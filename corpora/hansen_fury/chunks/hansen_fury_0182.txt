weather, Harris was again ready to attack the German capi- tal. On November 3, 1943, Harris wrote a letter to the prime minister in which he took stock of the bombing war.14 Bombing had "virtually destroyed" nine- teen cities, including Cologne, Hamburg, Hanover, the Ruhr cities of Düssel- dorf, Remscheid, Bochum, Deutz, Krefeld, and Mülheim. The Hanseatic city of Rostock, Charlemagne's Aachen, and the medieval city of Kassel had also gone under. On October 22, at 8:45 P.M., more than 550 bombers had attacked Kassel. It was a hot, still, and clear night much like the one on which Hamburg was destroyed. The aiming point was the Martinsplatz, right in the centre of the city, and the bombers scored a near-perfect hit. Almost two thousand tons of bombs rained down on the city. The bombing was so intense that, on average, two incendiary bombs landed on every square yard. The fires rose further and a firestorm raged. Temperatures reached 1500 degrees Celsius, the winds 100 miles per hour. People struggled against the winds and were pulled into the flames. The oxygen was sucked from the cellars and their inhabitants suffocated and burned. By morning, ten thousand people, 5 percent of Kassel's population, were dead.15 The Fieseler fighter factory remained untouched. 145 Along with Berlin, Harris believed that there were some sixty cities (including Leipzig, Dresden, Erfurt, Weimar, Frankfurt, and Munich) left to destroy. When that was done, Bomber Command would only have to "mop up the few small coal and steel towns" in the Saar and, "when the occasion serves . . . tidy up all around" by taking out Solingen, Witten, and Leverkusen. But it would not come to that. Harris concluded: "I feel certain that Germany must collapse before this programme which is more than half completed already, has proceeded much further." The key was getting the Americans to co-operate. We have not got far to go. If they will only get going according to plan and avoid such disastrous diversions as
