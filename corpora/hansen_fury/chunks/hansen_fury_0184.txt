s on German cities without bringing the country remotely close to collapse.17 As Alec Coryton, Assistant Chief of Air Staff [Operations] (and former AOC of 5 Group) noted in November, even if Berlin had been destroyed, it is doubtful that it would have meant the Imperial War Museum London  146 1 FIRE AND FURY end of the war.18 The city simply never enjoyed the same singularly important industrial and financial role played by the British capital. The elusive search for a levelled Berlin was motivated by symbolism rather than sound strategy. April 1, 1944, came and went without the promised German capitulation. The failure of the Berlin campaign did not discourage Harris. Rather, he looked to a whole new set of cities. While the Berlin campaign was still under way, 596 aircraft destroyed the ancient city of Augsburg on February 25-26 under the fire of only token flak defence.19 On March 1-2, Stuttgart was hit, destroying the Neues Schloss and killing 125 people.20 On March 18-19 and again on March 22- 23, Frankfurt was hit, flattening the old centre and ending "the existence of the Frankfurt which had been built up since the Middle Ages."21 Throughout this period, the British death toll climbed: in January 1944, Har- ris lost 6.1 percent of aircraft sent to Berlin, and 7.2 percent of those that went to Stettin; in a February raid on Leipzig and a March raid on Berlin, the casu- alty rate was greater than 9 percent.22 Six days after the end of the Berlin cam paign, on March 30-31, Harris dispatched 795 aircraft on an attack on Nuremberg. Although the city-like all German cities-had some industries none of these, with the exception of a small aircraft repair plant on the outskirts was specified under the Casablanca and POINTBLANK directives.23 Like Berlin Nuremberg was appealing more for its symbolism than its industrial impor- tance: Harris wanted to flatten the city of the Nazi party rally. The raid was a disaster: ninety-six planes, or 11.8 percent of those that took
