aling more for its symbolism than its industrial impor- tance: Harris wanted to flatten the city of the Nazi party rally. The raid was a disaster: ninety-six planes, or 11.8 percent of those that took off, did not return The casualty rate was a staggering 20.6 percent. Nuremberg itself got off rela- tively easy: 265 buildings of little or no industrial importance were destroyed, 75 people (including 15 foreign workers) were killed, and 11,000 were made home- less. Ironically, many pilots mistook Schweinfurt for Nuremberg and successfully dropped ten blockbusters (4000-pound bombs with light casings), three hun- dred other explosives, and thousands of incendiaries on a city that Harris claimed they could not attack.24 After two years, the failure of the bomber dream and its costs were obvious to everyone but Harris himself.25 For the moment, however, he had to deal with what he called a "diversion":26 Operation OVERLORD-the invasion of the European continent. 18 1 What the British knew he Times was the most venerable institution on Fleet Street. Founded in 1 1788, it was Britain's newspaper of record for almost two centuries. Throughout the war, it recorded Bomber Command's successes (but almost never its failures). From the beginning, but particularly as Harris ramped up the bomber war, it was the most important voice of Bomber Command. And it was generally loud and proud. Following a March 9, 1942, raid on Essen, the paper reported: During the heavy air attack on Essen and objectives elsewhere in the Ruhr on the night of March 9, a small number of aircraft bombed the August Thyssen Steelworks, which lie between the town of Hamborn and the Rhine. Photographs taken during the bombing fully confirm the pilots' reports that there were large fires in the area of the works, and that high- explosive bombs were accurately aimed at the fires. There can be little doubt that substantial damage was done.1 Imperial war Museum London The reports rarely described the destruction
