prov- ing easy. Some of the bombed-out people have not been sympathetically received, and in the German Press there have been complaints of this lack of considerateness.4 With some imagination, Sinclair's vengeful rhetoric and Fritsche's stories of evacuations could have conveyed the idea that not everyone could be success- fully evacuated.

Likewise, some reflection might have led a reader to conclude that, if large numbers of civilians were being driven out of their homes, some of them, perhaps many of them, must be dying in the process.
