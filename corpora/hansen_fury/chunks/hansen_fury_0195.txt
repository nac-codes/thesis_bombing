exactly the opposite: The aim of our Bomber Force which went to Cassel on October 22/23 was to wreck the city. ... In the course of the proceedings, the Henschel Works and a number of other factories probably got damaged, and this makes the loss to the enemy all the greater. But the fundamental purpose was to knock another great German city out of the war and add it to the growing list of those which are now liabilities and not assets to the enemy from the point of view of morale and production. By obscuring this pur- pose, we simply rob the whole operation of its point.15 The second consequence was that it gave the crews the impression that "the authorities are ashamed of area bombing." This could not stand. Men could not to go on "risking their lives to effect a purpose which their own Government appears to consider at least as too disreputable to be mentioned in public."The third was that it gave "unlimited scope for pushing their view" to "those ele- ments in this country who hope to accumulate political capital by minimising our contribution to the defeat of Germany as contrasted with that of the USSR."
