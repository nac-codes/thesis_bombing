obably was. But Harris was not devious. As he wrote a week later, the Ministry's answers to his questions were, "in spite of [my] most careful examination ... ambiguous." With regard to the Soviets and the Western ground forces, Harris did not want to imply that their successes or their significance should be ignored. Rather, he HARTTATT TITTACATAT TPAA TPITAGITIT asked simply that adequate emphasis as distinct from occasional and casual references should be made to the fact that these successes have been made possible largely by the Bomber Offensive, and also to the truth, of which the enemy is well aware, that the reduction to ruins of Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne and many other cities is of incomparably greater significance to the German people than the recovery by the Soviets of the ruins of Kharkov, Kiev and Gomel.
