ich made his pomposity even more annoying, and his inability to be shaken from an idea once he adopted it as his own made Arthur Harris look like a model of flexibility. His view of a fighter's role was thoroughly defensive: his four years of experience successfully defending the United Kingdom had con- vinced him that there was no point in trying to get the Luftwaffe to fight if it did not want to." The head of the Ninth Air Force, General Lewis Brereton. wanted to keep it independent of both Spaatz and Leigh-Mallory. As Brereton saw it, the Ninth would spend the time in the months leading up to D-Day on training exercises, with a few raids being launched on V-1 production sites. Added to all of this was general confusion about how the Allied command structure would operate once Eisenhower assumed control of the integrated British- American forces.

Brereton received an official letter: "The Commanding General, USSTAF, will exercise control of all administrative and training matters per- taining to the Ninth Air force and will
