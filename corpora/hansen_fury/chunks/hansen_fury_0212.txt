from targets deep inside Germany. The Americans attacked shipyards in Rostock, railway and power stations in Berlin, aircraft indus- try in Brunswick, Daimler-Benz in Stuttgart, Messerschmitt factories in Regensburg and Augsburg, and more.24 The Luftwaffe fought back viciously, and the American fighters responded with aggressive attacks. The "Big Week" cost the Americans 266 bombers, 2600 aircrew (killed or captured), and 28 fighters.25 Fully one-half of these losses occurred on the last two days of the battle, when the Germans exploited mistakes that left bombers unescorted or without sufficient escorts.26 The British joined in on the Big Week, but with different targets. From February 20 to 25, the RAF bombed the centres and/or residential sections of Leipzig, Berlin, Aachen, Stuttgart, Munich, Keil, Augsburg, Saarbrücken, Mannheim, and Schweinfurt. Augsburg-an ancient city-was entirely obliterated.27 Speer was in bed at the Red Cross's Hohenlychen Hospital when he got the news of the American attacks. He had fallen ill in January and, at his worst, was delusional and unable to get out of bed. Himmler had assigned Dr. Karl Geb- hardt, his personal physician, to look after Speer. Gebhardt had been a doctor at the Ravensbrück and Sachsenhausen concentration camps, where he deliber- ately infected women with gas gangrene to test the effectiveness of new drugs.28 Gebhardt misdiagnosed Speer with muscular rheumatism, for which he pre- scribed sulphonamide and bee poison. "I think," Speer said after one of Geb- hardt's rounds, "he's trying to kill me."29 He might have been: in February 1944, Speer's secretary, while hiding behind a door, heard Himmler say to Gebhardt, in apparent reference to Speer, "Well, then, he'll just be dead." When Gebhardt protested, Himmler replied, "Enough! The less said the better."30 On February 23, a few weeks before Speer was able to transfer out of the hospital and away from Gebhardt's clutches, Milch came to see him. The Amer- icans, he
