would be destroyed. Imperial War Museum London Spaatz's urgency was driven by the British as much as the Germans. Solly Zuckerman, who had been fully behind Spaatz's attacks on the Luftwaffe, had been studying attacks on communications in the Mediterranean theatre. He became convinced that the best way to weaken Germany in the run-up to D-Day was through destroying the country's transportation system, and above all its large railway centres and rolling stock.1 Sounding rather like Harris on cities, Zuckerman argued that a country's railways were its nervous system: if you dam- aged one part of it, you could cripple the whole.2 Specifically, destroying these transportation nodes would paralyze the Germans as they tried to ship men and mat√©riel to Normandy. Zuckerman calculated that about 40 percent-45,000 tons out of a total pre-invasion program of 108,000-of all Allied bombs 171  172 | FIRE AND FURY Germany's Achilles heel | should hit communication targets. The work would be roughly divided between the RAF and the Eighth and Ninth air forces. Zuckerman presented his con- clusions, which were not radically different from those of a 1943 report by the Ministry of War Transport, in early 1944.3 The plan went before a newly formed Allied Air Forces Bombing Committee on January 10, passed through several other committees, and finally reached Eisen- hower and Tedder on February 1. The plan proposed attacks on rail targets. They liked it. The report convinced Tedder of the merits of attacking transportation. Eisenhower was similarly won over, but one of the plan's merits had nothing to do with bombing at all: the integration of all available air forces nicely complemented Eisenhower's assumption of overall command. As the plan circulated, the battle lines quickly became clear. Eisenhower, Tedder, Leigh-Mallory, and Zuckerman supported the plan; the prime minister, the bulk of the War Cabinet, the War Office, the Air Ministry, Bomber Command, and the USSTAF opposed it.4 A
