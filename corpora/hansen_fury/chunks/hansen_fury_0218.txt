chair-a crucial advantage. He secured general agreement that the Luftwaffe, including ball bearings production, remained the highest priority, and that the air forces would only target oil or com- munications after they targeted the German Air Force. Tedder then put the case for the transportation plan, and Eisenhower swung in behind it. "Everything," he said, "I have read convinces me that, apart from the attack on the German Air Force, the Transportation Plan was the only one which offered a reasonable chance of the air forces making a real contribution to the land battle during the first vital weeks of OVERLORD."8 He continued: "In fact, there is no real alternative." The argument was not going Spaatz's way, and he did himself no favours. When he presented the oil plan, he highlighted the transportation plan's prob- lems without emphasizing strongly enough how the oil plan would aid OVER- LORD. Worse still, he spoke in a wooden and unpersuasive manner. Among the English, wit and rhetorical persuasion mattered. Immensely. After Spaatz's speech, Anderson came in with the honest admission that the oil plan would not guarantee a decisive influence during the initial stages of OVERLORD. What it would do, however, was have a devastating effect on the enemy within six months. The transportation plan, by contrast, might affect neither OVERLORD nor the overall war effort. At this point, a British oil expert from the Ministry of Economic Warfare offered his "help"; attacks on oil would drive down German supplies by 25 percent in three months, and would significantly affect German production (they would "feel the pinch") within four to five months. Portal leapt on this. The official's comments "showed conclusively that the oil plan would not help OVERLORD in the first few critical weeks."9 Eisenhower agreed, and it was all over. Transportation, not oil, would be the primary target in the run-up to the invasion of the Continent. Imperial war iviuseum London Arthur Harris ha
