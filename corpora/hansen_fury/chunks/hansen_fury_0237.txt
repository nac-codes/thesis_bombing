Without endorsing the proposal or even formally asking McCloy to act on it, he suggested that the assistant secretary "explore it."17 The report was definitive proof of Auschwitz (the concentration camp) and Birkenau (or Auschwitz II, the gas chambers and crematorium), and what was happening there. Much information on the Nazi murder of Jews had leaked out and been reported, and by 1942 the Allies knew the name and location of four of the death camps: Chelmno, Treblinka, Sobibor, and Belzec.18 Auschwitz- Birkenau, the principal site of mass murder, nonetheless remained shrouded in secrecy. Specific information about the camp-through ULTRA intercepts, for instance-had come to the Allies sometime before, and by mid-1943 a number of officials had enough details to determine the site and purpose of the instal- lation. It is, however, a matter of debate whether they had analyzed the disparate pieces of information in a systematic enough way to know with certainty at that point. By June 1944, they had. By the time the Allies had the knowledge, they also had the capability: bombing Birkenau required in practice heavy bombing missions from northern Italy. By April 1944 at the latest, the Fifteenth Air Force was capable of destroying Auschwitz in four precision raids, spread over several weeks and involving some seventy-five bombers each.19 It would have diverted 7 percent of the Fifteenth's bombers from the oil offensive. Only a raid on the camp itself would have worked: bombed rail lines were easily repaired, and the more ambitious project of taking out the rail nexus leading to Auschwitz- Birkenau would have required a massive diversion of air power.20 In June, the Eighth Air Force began flying missions in support of the Soviet summer offensive from bases near Kiev ("Operation Frantic"). An attack on Auschwitz from Soviet bases would have required Stalin's approval, however, and they were much more vulnerable to Luftwaffe attack.21 It is pos
