aintained consistently in all public statements regarding our bombing policy that it is directed against military objec- tives and that any damage to civilians is incidental to our attack on the German war machine. This is a moral and legal point of great impor- tance, both now and in the maintenance of our position after the war, and it would be greatly weakened should we now for the first time declare that we intended deliberate attacks on the civilian population as such.53 On July 5, the Chiefs of Staff approved the report, but-partly unable to shake the lingering belief that still more bombing might bring results-left the door open for future destruction of small cities. "The time might well come," the Chiefs agreed, "when an all-out attack by every means at our disposal on German civilian morale might be decisive."54 In the end, the Chiefs recommended to Churchill that the methods of such an attack should be examined and all pos- sible preparations made. Despite Portal's objections, the train had left the station. In the United States, a similar argument was being played out. In June 1944, an intelligence officer in Washington, Colonel Lowell P. Weicker, drew up sev- eral plans for destroying German morale by blasting small German towns. Throughout June and July, an official under General Charles P. Cabell, the USSTAF director of plans, worked to scuttle the idea. The official's name was Colonel Richard D. Hughes. He had worked in the Air War Plans Division and came to London to serve on the Enemy Objectives Unit, which selected the tar- get systems most vital to the Nazi war effort.55 Hughes was no sentimentalist; he believed the Germans should suffer for what they had done. It was just that there were plenty of ways to make them suffer without killing them, and killing them would do nothing to serve the interests of the Allies during the war or after it. Hughes attacked Weicker's plans as yet another stab at the "will of the wisp of 'morale." Nazi repression
