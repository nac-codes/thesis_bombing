885 people were killed, and 87 per- cent of the city was gone. Stuttgart joined an ever-growing list of dead cities. The following week, on August 3, the working committee presented its final draft to the British Chiefs of Staff. By then, Portal had successfully deflected the conversation away from destroying German towns.60 That left Berlin: Harris's plan for pasting the city's residential neighbourhoods was still on the table, and the Chiefs of Staff had left open the possibility of a massive area raid in their August 1 memorandum. The Directorate of Bombing Operations did some calculations on the bombing needed for a raid-code-named THUNDER- CLAP61-that would devastate Berlin. It suggested that two thousand Eighth Air Force bombers drop five thousand tons on two and a half square miles of central Berlin. The attack would be by day, when the area had a population of 375,000 people. If the Eighth achieved a bomb density of 2000 tons per square mile, they would kill 110,000 and maim or otherwise seriously injure another 110,000.62 In order to bomb "for purely moral effect," wrote the Director of Bombing Operations, Bufton, on August 1, "that attack must be delivered in such density that it imposes as nearly as possible a 100% risk of death to the individual in the area to which it is applied."63 If the Eighth didn't do the job on the first day, the Fifteenth could pelt the area with incendiaries on the next. Such death and destruction, the Air Staff subsequently argued, would be a "spectacular and final object lesson to the German people on the consequences of universal aggression."64 Despite the failure of area bombing to deliver results, and the clear evidence that precision bombing of oil was working, few people in the British military command were entirely willing to give up on the idea of area bombing. Tedder showed great interest in the idea of attacking morale, and even Portal seemed for a while to favour it.65 In the end, the plan foundered-at least tempora
