towns if they could, but hit towns if they could do nothing else. Wasting towns-deliberately, not incidentally-was of course exactly what Harris wanted to do. On September 6, a week before the September directive, Harris sent his bombers to attack Emden. The daylight raid, free from the recov- ering Luftwaffe, destroyed the city at the cost of one Lancaster. Four days later, Bomber Command "tore out the heart" of Mönchengladbach without losing a single plane.8 Two days after that, it was Darmstadt's turn. In the early morning of September 12, the city in which Cherwell had studied, loved by English tourists for its richly detailed residential architecture, was set alight. At five minutes before midnight, 221 Lancasters and 14 Mosquitoes dropped 5000 pounds of bombs on the city.º A Hamburgesque firestorm tore through the city, levelling its centre and the city's castle. Temperatures reached 1000 degrees Celsius, and the flames could be seen 180 miles away. By morning, ten thousand people were dead. For the RAF it was, as one captain reported, "A quiet trip all around with everything going to plan."10 All of the city's industry was located in the suburbs, and the incidental damage it suffered was repaired within a month." Two days before destroying Darmstadt, the RAF attacked oil refineries at Dortmund, Beur, and Wanne-Eickel. The Dortmund refinery was badly dam- aged, but smoke pots and flak protected the other two.12 Seven aircraft were lost. The day after, on September 12-13, RAF area raids smashed what was left of Münster (killing 144 people), Frankfurt (killing 469), and Stuttgart (killing 1171). Three nights later, Bomber Command devastated the centre of Kiel. Then, a week after the mid-September directive on oil and transportation, on Sep- tember 23-24, Bomber Command dropped three thousand tons of bombs on the town of Neuss in a single night. Shortly after the Neuss raid, Churchill invited Harris to Chequers to dine and discuss an ULTRA report confirming that
