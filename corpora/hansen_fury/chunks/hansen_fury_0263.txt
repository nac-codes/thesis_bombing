German cities, October was worse still. Harris launched his heaviest attack ever. In October, 80 percent of RAF bombs fell on cities. Harris launched twenty raids, nine of them by daylight. Two of these attacks-on Kleve and Emmerich on October 5 and 7-were requested by the Allied ground forces to aid advancing troops, but they were pushing on an open door. On October 14, Duisburg was smashed twice in 24 hours: 5029 tons hit the centre by day, 5093 by night. "The record," writes historian Richard G. Davis, "of more than 10,100 tons of conventional explosives dropped on a sin- gle target in a day probably still stands."14 On the same night, the RAF destroyed-on its fourth try-Brunswick. Fire engulfed the old city centre, and only the firefighters' determination kept the death toll to a relatively low 561. Over four hours, they fought their way through the ring of fire until they man- aged to reach eight public shelters housing twenty-three thousand people.15 They got all but two hundred out. Without their efforts, Brunswick might have been another Hamburg. Three nights later, in Bonn, the university, many cultural and public buildings, and large residential areas were smashed. The firefighters man- aged to save Beethoven's house; they weren't able to do the same for 313 people. What was left of the Ruhr cities of Essen, Dortmund, and Duisburg was also bombed, as were untouched residential parts of Cologne. Throughout September and October, the RAF's loss rate was a low 1.8 percent. In September, U.S. Air Forces continued their assault on the Luftwaffe, drop- ping five thousand tons of bombs on aircraft targets.16 They dropped an equal amount on tanks, and somewhat more-fifty-six hundred tons-on oil. Another twelve thousand fell on marshalling yards, which had positive knock-on effects  FIRE AND FURY 204 Harris's and Spaatz's orders | 205 for the oil offensive: they destroyed rail lines, trains, and trucks and interfered with Speer's race to repair the oil damage.
