e flak guns began shooting. Gelsenkirchen was not, however, the target. Seven hundred and fifty RAF aircraft flew just south of it and bombed the centre of Bochum. More than 4000 buildings were destroyed or seriously damaged; 980 Germans and 14 foreigners were also killed.25 The same night, Harris sent 176 aircraft to the Dortmund-Ems Canal. The banks of the canal were breached, barges were stopped, and smelting coke en route to steelworks at Brunswick and Onsabr√ºck was stranded.
