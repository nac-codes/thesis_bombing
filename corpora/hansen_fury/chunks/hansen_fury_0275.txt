way anything in this battle the Germans may get into quite a strong  FIRE AND FURY Harris's and Spaatz's orders 1 position in the air and hold it long enough to prolong the war by several months at least. Feeling like this I am bound to put you to a certain amount of trouble but I assure that I am perfectly ready to be convinced by reasonable arguments.26 After ending the letter in the same apologetic style in which it began, Portal signed it and passed it on for delivery to Harris.
