hout number, and hardly a vestige of damage has ever been done to it. So much is this so that it has become a jest in Bomber Command that either there is no such place as Gelsenkirchen, or that it is marked wrong on the map. . .. I keep the most up to date photographs available of all the oil plants, and those taken on the 28th October of both the oil plants near Gelsenkirchen seemed to show no manufacturing activity. Having stood his ground, Harris reverted to his emollient tone. "I am sorry" he wrote, "[that] you seem to think that I do not understand the importance of the oil war, because that is entirely wrong . . . [B]efore I had received your letter, 213 I had already impressed upon my Staff the necessity for getting on with the oil as hard as we could whenever opportunity really served. I had in fact hauled them over the coals for not putting a specific part of the force that attacked Gelsenkirchen on the oil plants. Unfortunately that attack was laid on when I was taking a day off, otherwise it would have been done."28 Harris might have left it at that, but he couldn't resist a parting shot at the Air Ministry and, above all, the Ministry of Economic Warfare: It would be of interest to know how we arrive at so exact figures of German oil production. The form in which the information reaches me savours sometimes of the type of Admiralty paper which starts with a series of assumptions and works them in three places of decimals! Harris's claims about Gelsenkirchen were disingenuous; he had in fact launched a successful raid on the Nordsten oil plant there on September 13-14, using only 102 aircraft.29 It is also hard to credit the claim that his staff ignored his orders (a brave staff member that would be). Nonetheless, the letter seemed to keep Portal happy and Harris was able to get back to work. Over the next few days, he bombed Gelsenkirchen, Koblenz, Homburg, Harburg (now a residen- tial suburb of Hamburg), and Dortmund. Clearly feeling Portal's pressure,
