rything the Americans and the RAF had at oil, the campaign would not be effective. "The crux of the matter," Portal wrote, "is that German oil production has risen from [its] September level, and seems likely to go on rising unless we can make our attack more effective than it was throughout October. We have not been hitting oil hard enough, and we must devise means to ensure that we do hit it hard enough over the next few months." The letter also directly addressed two claims made by Harris against bomb- ing oil: that an operation had to go after the easiest target and that going after difficult oil targets would send Bomber Command casualties through the roof. In his November 6, 1944, letter, Harris had followed his sentence on agreeing with the "urgency and effectiveness of the oil plan" with these words: It is my concern and constant anxiety to try to get the best overall effect out of the available sorties in the prevailing weather, and in that regard I cannot and should not, in my view, throw any opportunity of doing something valuable with some better degree of certainty by trying to do  1 FIRE AND FURY 216 Harris's and Spaatz's orders 1 something else which in the conditions prevailing at a particular moment I regard as being too chancy.33 This claim, wrote Portal, made oil bombing almost a logical impossibility "You state that it is your constant anxiety to try and get the best overall effect from the effort available. Surely that would represent a falling away from the sharply defined policy of attacking oil." Harris defined "overall effect" as a func tion of the ease of the attack and its likelihood of success, and success was defined as the extent of destruction. Cities would almost always be easier to bomb than specific targets, so this calculus would almost always lead to the bombing of cities rather than oil. Given what the Allies knew by late 1944, Por- tal argued, "in my view our aims now should be to go for maximum effect on oil whenever a reasonab
