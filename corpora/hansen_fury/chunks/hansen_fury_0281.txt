t always lead to the bombing of cities rather than oil. Given what the Allies knew by late 1944, Por- tal argued, "in my view our aims now should be to go for maximum effect on oil whenever a reasonable chance presents itself, even though this may be at the expense of an attack with greater certainty upon a lower priority target."34 In other words, since bombing oil gave more results than bombing cities, oil should be bombed even if it were more difficult. It was better to lose more planes to a useful oil raid than few to a pointless city raid. Portal might have added that when Harris had in the past believed a target was worthy, he was willing to assume greater risks to take it out: Cologne in the 1000-bomber raid. Berlin throughout 1943 and 1944, and, once he had signed on, the Sorpe, Eder. and MÃ¶hne dams. Portal also directly addressed Harris's point about repeated attacks, allowing German defences to concentrate, and the ensuing casualties among British bombers. "I must," he wrote, make reference to the problem of concentrating on the Ruhr. From the statistics I have available, there is little evidence so far of our concentra- tion in this area "putting the casualty rate up enormously." Since Ist Sep- tember, our losses in the Ruhr area have averaged only 1.3% and these have been spread fairly evenly throughout the period. This rate is well below your average against some 42 of the major cities which has been 3.8% since January, 1942. There would seem no reason as yet for [deviating] in our attacks on the Ruhr.35 On the contrary, it would surely be better to concentrate against the Ruhr oil and the Ruhr now, before the enemy can solve his early warning difficulties. It will be time enough to change when heavy casualties do in fact materialize. We should if we can secure maxi- 217 mum effect on the Ruhr itself, and the quickest direct and indirect effect upon the Ruhr oil. Incidentally, I was delighted to see that you managed to attack the plant at DORTMUND last
