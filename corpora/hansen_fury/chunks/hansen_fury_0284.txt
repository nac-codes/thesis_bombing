shown to the Americans. It was a patronizing dismissal of the efforts made by the USSTAF to destroy the Luftwaffe. Their effort, Harris implied, had been pointless and only his skill at moving RAF bombers around Germany had saved them. Harris added one more argument against oil targets-bombing the same target is boring for crews-and sent the letter to Portal. Portal took more than a week to respond. During that time, the bombing went on relentlessly. On November 27, the southern German city of Freiburg, which until then had remained untouched, was set alight. Fires tore through the narrow streets of the 875-year-old city. Within two hours, the heat and flames made it impossible for fire crews to reach the citizens, or to rescue those still in cellars.38 When it was over, only a hollow shell of the old city remained and three thousand people were dead. Over the course of November, Harris had dropped 60 percent of his bombs on cities, 24 percent on oil, and 9 percent on transportation. American raids at the same time made clear that there was nothing inevitable in this. The figures for the Eighth Air Force were 41 percent on oil, 33 percent on marshalling yards, and the rest mostly on ground support. For the Fifteenth Air Force, they were 35 percent on oil and 51 percent on transportation.39 Cities were not being destroyed because "weather made other targets impractical," but because Harris was disobeying orders. 1 219 December also opened with a city raid. On December 4, Harris sent 244 planes to Heilbronn, a 600-year-old city of 77,500 people and no industry. In just over 20 minutes, the RAF dropped 1249 tons of bombs on the city (40 per- cent incendiaries) and 170 tons of high explosives on the raid yard. 40 The city was decimated-every building in the old city was destroyed-and seven thou- sand people were killed, levelling the old city centre.41 The same night, Harris also bombed Karlsruhe, killing 375 people.42 A September 26-27, 1944, attack had already carpet
