stroyed-and seven thou- sand people were killed, levelling the old city centre.41 The same night, Harris also bombed Karlsruhe, killing 375 people.42 A September 26-27, 1944, attack had already carpet-bombed the city centre, leaving fifty dead. The two raids left only burned-out facades standing in the centre, but some nearby houses and public buildings were intact. Harris would try one more time to flatten the city-on February 2, 1945-before leaving it alone. From late November to mid-December, Harris also bombed MÃ¼nster, Cologne, Neuss, Essen, Dortmund (twice), Bottrop, Osterfeld, Duisburg, Ober- hausen, Osterfeld, Karlsruhe, Hallendorf, Hamm, and Hagen. A handful of these raids-on Kalk Nord railway yards in (obliterated) Cologne, on a tar and benzol plant in Dortmund, on a coking plant at Bottrop, and on steelworks in Hallendorf-were precision attacks. More than two thousand tons of bombs were dropped on Hagen, Karlsruhe, Essen, and Duisburg. Two days after Heilbronn, Portal's letter arrived. Portal rejected outright Harris's argument about German air defences and tolerable casualty rates. "While losses might go up on a particular raid, where German flak defences secured unexpected successes, the overall casualty rate was less than 1%." While this could, of course, change, "there is some force in the argument that we should exploit [Germany's] present confusion by making a maximum effort while it lasts."43 He also rejected the argument, made in Harris's last letter, that a higher casualty rate was tolerable in 1943 but not in 1944. How, Portal asked, could Bomber Command give up the opportunity to press home a winning strat- egy? "In this, the culminating phase of the war we would not be justified in pulling our punches." The letter also reminded Harris-again-that oil and transportation were the first priorities. Portal dismissed Harris's "boredom" argument. Morale could only benefit from bombing over a strategically important target under relatively safe condi-
