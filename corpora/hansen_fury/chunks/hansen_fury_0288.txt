As ever, when Speer protested his technical limits, Hitler was dismissive. "Everything," he said, "must be put aside for the sake of this. This will be a great blow which must succeed."3 Hitler's confused vision drew on the early glories of the Blitzkrieg, the dis- aster of Stalingrad, his own crude Darwinian ideas, and the smouldering ruins 221  222 1 FIRE AND FURY Portal pleads of once-magnificent German cities.

Jodl rejected these modest ambitions out of
