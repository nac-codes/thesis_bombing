More importantly, it would be suicide to decrease troop concentrations on the Eastern Front, where the Russians were likely preparing their own offensive. Jodl rejected these modest ambitions out of hand. The result had to be so stunning that it would "make the western powers ready to negotiate."6 Speer's task was to wrest enough fuel and materials from the Eastern Front to make the western counteroffensive possible. Speer thought the mission had little chance of achieving its objectives, but, if it was going to happen anyway, he had better be sure that it was as impressive as possible. Speer was a Nazi, and he still hoped to win the war. He got down to work. He took a trip to the Ruhr, where he met Albert Vögler, a loyal Nazi, a Ruhr industrialist, and one of the most important munitions producers in the region. Speer was in the region in part to determine its ability to contribute to the Ardennes offensive, and he would later appoint Vögler his Ruhr plenipotentiary in charge of maintaining arms output. Speer was shocked to see the extent of destruction inflicted by Allied-above all, American-attacks on synthetic oil plants and transportation. On November II, he wrote a report for Hitler. Speer told him that the Ruhr could no longer play its role in the Reich's industrial divi- sion of labour.7 Although he had been ordered to keep it top secret, Speer discussed the offensive in vague terms with Vögler, who had bluntly asked him, "When are 223 we going to call it quits?" Speer replied that Hitler was staking everything on a last effort. In language that could have got him killed, Vögler asked, "But does he fully realize that after that we have to end it? We're losing too much of our substance. How will we be able to reconstruct if industry goes on taking such a beating even for a few months more?" "I think," Speer replied slowly, "that Hitler is playing his last card and knows it, too." Vögler flashed Speer an almost contemptuous look. "Of course it's his last card
