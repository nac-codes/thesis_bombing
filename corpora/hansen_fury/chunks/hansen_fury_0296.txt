her twenty-three thousand were captured and forty thousand wounded. The scale of the blow temporarily destroyed Eisenhower's nerve and delayed another major American offensive against Germany by seven weeks.28 The Ger- mans were able to launch their counterattack, and to inflict such material and psychological damage so late in the war, because they could draw on Germany's remaining oil supplies. Four days before the German counteroffensive on December 16, Harris wrote again to Portal, making yet another combination of his "I can't do it-it's not worth doing" arguments. Based on his staff's calculations, Harris concluded that knocking Germany's synthetic oil plants out of action, and keeping them there, would require 13 day raids of 200 aircraft and 18 night raids of 350 aircraft, or 56,500 sorties and 226,000 tons of bombs. Assuming the weather was clear on only three or four nights per month, Harris continued, it would be impossible to launch these eighteen night raids. Harris then switched arguments: You will recall that in the past M.E.W. experts have never failed to over- state their case on "panaceas" e.g ballbearings, molybdenum, locomotives etc. . . . [A]fter the battle has been joined and [these] targets attacked, more sources of supply or other factors unpredicted by M.E.W. have become revealed. The oil plan has already displayed similar symptoms. The benzol plants were an afterthought. I am quite certain that there are dozens more benzol plants of which we are unaware and when and if we knock them all out I am equally certain we shall eventually be told by M.E.W that German [industry] is continuing to run sufficiently for their purpose on producer gas, steam, industrial alcohol etc., etc.29  FIRE AND FURY 228 | Portal pleads 1 Five days after writing the letter, and one day after the Germans opened the Ardennes offensive, the RAF obliterated Ulm, leaving nothing of the old city and 707 people dead.
