er, and one day after the Germans opened the Ardennes offensive, the RAF obliterated Ulm, leaving nothing of the old city and 707 people dead. On December 22, as the German offensive was thinning and slowing due to lack of fuel, Portal replied. The essence of the immediate task before the Allied strategic bombers is to put out and keep out of action the II synthetic [oil] plants in Central Germany. These are producing 70% of the enemy's current supplies of aviation and motor spirit. There is no doubt in my mind that their immo- bilisation and the continued immobilisation of the remaining major pro- ducers would represent by far the greatest and most certain contribution that our strategic bombers could make to the achievement of an early decision in the German war. It is not expected by anyone that your Com- mand can do this job by itself; neither can the US Eighth Air Force by itself. Over the winter months it is essential, however, that no single opportunity is lost, whether by day or by night.30 Portal urged Harris to view the bombing campaign in the overall context of the war, and to be sensitive to history's judgment. Were the Americans and the British to join in a coordinated campaign against oil, using every available opportunity to attack Germany's refineries, strategic bombing will go down to history as a decisive factor in winning this war. On the other hand, if by any weakening of determination or any reluctance to implement the policy which we have laid down our grip on the oil position is relaxed, the vast effort we have expended against oil will have been largely fruitless.

Naturally while you hold this view you will be unable to put your heart into the attack of oil. Your letter gave me the impression that while you have somewhat reluctantly agreed to attack
