The circle met these proph- esies in silence, some averting their eyes. Only Bormann, ever the sycophant, nodded furiously. A day later, Bomber Command attacked Nuremberg. On the night of Janu- ary 2, 1945, Bomber Command flattened the city's medieval centre, killing two thousand people and leaving a hundred thousand homeless. Two days later, Hitler, Keitel, Goebbels, and Bormann sat at a grand conference table. They were talking about the war.
