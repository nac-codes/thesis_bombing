effectiveness that nobody would even have thought possible at the time when the ball-bearing plan was initiated." The facts scarcely seem to me to support your appreciation of your achievements. That the American attacks on the German fighter force were futile: Had the American forces joined with Bomber Command in bombing cities instead of fighter production, there is every possibility that the whole combined bomber offensive might have been brought to a standstill. It was only by a narrow margin that they gained the ascendency which vir- tually cleared the skies for "OVERLORD," the prerequisite condition for its launching, and obtained freedom to proceed to the attack of oil. That area bombing would have proved decisive if the Americans had joined the campaign: [The enemy's] counter measures would have prevented us from maintain- ing such a policy to the decisive point. We would have been forced to pre- cision attack to maintain the air situation needed to continue the offensive at all. The Americans did this for themselves in 1943/1944 with a little help from Bomber Command. Under cover of the favourable air situation which was created "OVERLORD" was launched successfully, and the advance to the German frontier gave night bombing a new lease on life. But for this it is possible that the night blitzing of German cities would by now have been too costly to sustain upon a heavy scale. These factors must not be overlooked when considering the past and future results of area attacks. Portal, the erstwhile backer of area bombing, ended the letter with a full- even passionate, if such a word can be used to describe such a gentlemanly character-embrace of precision attacks on oil: We have determined to exploit our period of tactical freedom over Ger- many by the attack of the vital element in her war economy-oil. We have reduced their production to 30% of the pre-attack figure and her reserves  FIRE AND FURY 236 | Speer despairs, Harris threatens, Portal blinks are now v
