We have reduced their production to 30% of the pre-attack figure and her reserves  FIRE AND FURY 236 | Speer despairs, Harris threatens, Portal blinks are now virtually exhausted. ... The completion of the oil plan lies so well within our capabilities that it can be pressured to a point at which the oper- ational effectiveness of the German armies and air forces on all fronts will be decisively restricted; but to do this it is essential to hold firmly to this aim. The energy, resource and determination displayed by the enemy in his efforts to maintain his oil production must be more than matched by our own determination to destroy it.

The same day, Portal and Spaatz issued Strategic Directive No. 3, making oil again the first priority followed by transportation. The category of "important industrial areas" to be attacked when weather demanded it was a distant third. Having obliterated another four German cities, Harris answered Portal.s The jig was up. Portal would not accept his assurances that he was doing everything he could to implement the oil directive. Although January was the peak of his contribution to the oil campaign, only 30 percent of his bombs hit oil targets, while 40 percent fell on cities.
