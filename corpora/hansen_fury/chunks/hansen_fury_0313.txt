ers at the present times lies in maintaining the attack upon German oil plants whenever weather permits. The benefits of these attacks are felt equally by the Russians and ourselves and nothing should be allowed to interfere with them. These opportunities might be used to exploit the present situation by the bombing of Berlin and other large cities in Eastern Germany such as Leipzig, Dresden and Chemnitz. ... To achieve results of real value, a series of attacks would proba- bly be required, and weather conditions at this time of year would certainly pre- vent these being delivered in quick succession. The possibility of these attacks being delivered on the scale necessary to have a critical effect on the situation in East Germany is now under examination."17 For Churchill, the response was too equivocal. He wanted it bombed imme- diately. "I did not ask you," he shot back on the same day, "about your plans for harrying the German retreat from Breslau. On the contrary, I asked whether Berlin, and no doubt other large cities in East Germany, should not now be con- sidered especially attractive targets. I am glad that is 'under examination' Pray report to me tomorrow what is going to be done." Sinclair passed the prime minister's minute on to Bottomley, who issued orders to Harris. Bottomley attacked the Joint Intelligence Committee report and told Harris that in "the opinion of the Chief of Air Staff . . . it would not be right to attempt attacks on Berlin on the 'THUNDERCLAP' scale in the near future. He considers it very doubtful that an attack even if done on the heaviest scale with consequent heavy losses would be decisive. He agrees, however, that subject to the overriding claims of oil and the other approved target systems within the current directive, we should use available effort in one big attack on Berlin and related attacks on Dresden, Leipzig, Chemnitz or any other cities where a severe blitz will not only cause confusion in the evacuation from the East
