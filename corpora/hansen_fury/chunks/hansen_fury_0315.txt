the Berlin-Leipzig-Dresden corridor. Eisenhower and Bradley signed on: there was no need to ask Roosevelt, as the president had for years called for hell's fury to be unleashed against Germany. In 1942, he told Congress that the Allies would hit Germany "from the air heavily and relentlessly. The people who bombed Warsaw, Rotterdam, London, and Coventry are going to get it."20 On January 31, Bottomley radioed a message to Portal: oil would be the first prior- ity, followed by Berlin, Leipzig, and Dresden.21 With V-2 rockets raining down on London, few people disagreed with Roosevelt's sentiment. Few, but not no one. When Spaatz presented the plan to Doolittle on January 30, Doolittle viewed it as what it was: terror bombing, which U.S. air forces had ruled out as immoral and pointless. He wrote back to Spaatz, urging him to reconsider. Doolittle pointed out that there "are basically no important, strictly military, tar- gets in the area indicated." He dismissed the idea that Berliners could be terror- ized into surrender. "The reactions of people of Berlin who have been bombed consistently will be very different from the people of London who have not expe- rienced a heavy raid in years. Terror is inducted by the unknown. The chances of terrorizing into submission, merely by an increased concentration of bombing, a people who have been subjected to intense bombing for four years is extremely remote."
