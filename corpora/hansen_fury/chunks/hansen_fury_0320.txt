American Air Forces."35 Their tar- get would not be Germany's rail nexuses or even large railway stations in major cities. Rather, it would be untouched transportation targets in "undefended or lightly defended targets": small towns and villages. Waves of bombers and fight- ers would, taking advantage of Allied air superiority, fly in low and cover the train stations-and much around them-with bombs and bullets. "The 1 247 destruction of facilities with all means available, using bombs and machine guns and NAPALM where warranted." The absence of significant flak or fighter defence and low-altitude attacks would allow heavy and low-medium bombers to open up "tremendous machine gun power .. . for strafing." The aim in all of this? Morale, this time of railway workers: "As a result of continued pressure against transportation objectives, morale of railway employees is known to be infirm at best and it may well be that repeated attacks using all forces available will result in mass desertion from work."36 The raid would "bring home the effects of the war upon German industry and people as no other method could do," pushing them perhaps "over the brink."37 When Spaatz passed the order on to Doolittle and Eaker, both objected. Oil targets should be bombed, not railway workers. If executed, Eaker wrote Arnold in an emotional letter, the plan would "absolutely convince the Germans that we are the barbarians they say we are, for it would be perfectly obvious to them that this is primarily a large scale attack on civilians .. . Of all the people killed in this attack over 95 percent of them can be expected to be civilians." As Spaatz had done over THUNDERCLAP, Eaker appealed to the Eighth's historical legacy: "We should never allow the history of this war to convict us of throw- ing the strategic bomber at the man in the street." Brigadier General Charles Cabell was blunter: "This is the same old baby killing plan of the get-rich quick psychological boys, dressed up in a new
