took a direct hit, they would die instantly. If a high explosive landed near the building and flattened it, there would be less rubble out of which to climb. Either way, the cellar would not become their coffin. In the thirty-square-yard room, they sat and waited for the bombs to fall. When one of the first high explosives landed, the air pressure bent the shelter's large steel door. The sounds of exploding bombs and shattering buildings became louder. Everyone in the cellar began to pray, reciting a particular Franken devotion to the Virgin Mary: "Maria breit den Mantel aus, mach Schirm und Schild für uns daraus, lass uns darunter sicher stehen, bis alle Feinde vorüber gehen [Mary, make your coat a shield, and let us seek shelter under it, until the enemy has passed over us]."
