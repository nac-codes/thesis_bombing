medieval centres of Frankfurt, Ulm, Aachen, Würzburg, Cologne, and Nuremberg were simply wiped off the face of the earth. A mil- lennium of Europe's finest architecture and culture were gone. Twenty million books had been burned. The destruction often took no longer than an average coffee break. The cities were nonetheless rebuilt, often at breakneck speed. Some- Frankfurt, Cologne, and Darmstadt-decided to embrace modernity. Others, often but not always the more conservative ones, rebuilt their cities according to original plans. Nuremberg was partially rebuilt in pre-war style, and its famous old city (Altstadt) was restored to at least some of its former glory. Munich also bears much resemblance to its old self. A few of Würzburg's most important buildings-the City Hall, some of the churches, and above all the palace-were restored, but the rest of the city dates obviously to the 1950s. It looks its best from the hills above, where the red rooftops evoke the pre-war city. In Hamburg, much of the old city-the narrowest lanes and tiny courtyards-is gone, but the administrative and commercial centre-around the City Hall-was sensitively rebuilt, and today Hamburg resembles the pre-war city. The St. Nicholas church-which was in the centre of the aiming point on July 28, 1943-was left in ruins, a memorial to the horrors of war. Bombing in part brought these horrors home to the German people. It is often said that they were spared horror during the First World War (as if mass starvation and the loss of a generation of sons are not horrors), and that bombing thus played a role in the pacification of postwar Germans. It might have, but bombing was hardly needed. Seven million dead, occupation, divi- sion, more than ten million people expelled, Soviet prisoner of war camps, and mass rapes in the Soviet sector would have made it clear to the Germans that war had consequences. It was, in any event, not certain that these expe- riences and bombings would turn the Germans into
