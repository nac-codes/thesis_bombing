mass rapes in the Soviet sector would have made it clear to the Germans that war had consequences. It was, in any event, not certain that these expe- riences and bombings would turn the Germans into pacifists. They could have as easily been the foundation for a new bitterness among the German  268 1 FIRE AND FURY people and the anchor for efforts to minimize Germany's own crimes. That they did not (despite a few Germans' and non-Germans' best efforts) was due to insistence on the part of both the Allies and the Germans themselves to ensure that the German people understood their history, and their responsibility. 29 1 Conclusion May 1945, the bombing war was over. Almost two million tons of bombs Dhad been dropped on Germany; more than sixty cities had been destroyed and hardly a town or village in the Reich had escaped the bombs. Bombing had left almost 593,000 people in Germany and 80,000 aircrew dead. From the moment the last bomb fell, the bombing campaign has been surrounded by controversy-always lively, sometimes hysterical. At its centre lie two overlapping but not identical questions: were the bombings justified, and did they work? Answering the first question depends on the answer to a third question: justified against which standard? Whether the bombing could be justified depends inevitably on one's theory of war. According to some absolutist positions, waging war-intentionally or accidentally-against civilians is never justified. By this standard, neither the American nor the British bombing of Germany could at any point be justified. At the other extreme, the whole point of bombing is to terrorize, make homeless, maim, and kill civilians. President Roosevelt came close to such a view of bombing when he said that "too many people here and in England hold to the view that the German people as a whole are not responsi- ble for what has taken place-that only a few Nazi leaders are responsible. That unfortunately is not based on fact. The German people as a
