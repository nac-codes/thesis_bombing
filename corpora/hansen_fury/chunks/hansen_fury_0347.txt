the view that the German people as a whole are not responsi- ble for what has taken place-that only a few Nazi leaders are responsible. That unfortunately is not based on fact. The German people as a whole must have it driven home to them that the whole nation has been engaged in a lawless con- spiracy against the decencies of modern civilization." Of course, there were many ways to do this short of killing them, but this seems to be what Roosevelt had in mind: in 1942, he called for the Allies to hit Germany "from the air heavily 269  FIRE AND FURY 270 | Conclusion and relentlessly." The people who "bombed Warsaw, Rotterdam, London and Coventry are going to get it."1 Bombing, in his view, would accomplish that. Most people place themselves between these two extremes. Only a few moral absolutists believe that bombing would not be worth the death of a single Ger- man civilian, still fewer that the Germans should not suffer at all for what they did. Similarly, only a few extremists would hold the view that all German civil- ians were fair targets and that Allied soldiers should have gone from house to house mowing them down in the millions. Those in the middle contend that it would be acceptable if some civilians died, but only if their deaths substantially aided the outcome of the war. This is necessarily an indeterminate standard- no one can say exactly how many deaths were acceptable. For my part, I would argue that even the level of destruction and death meted out at Hamburg would have been justified if it had led to a quick and immediate end to the war. With this view, it is possible to justify the area bombing campaign-against Rostock, LÃ¼beck, Cologne, and a few other cities-up to the end of 1943. From then it's clear-and increasingly so-that area bombing was not delivering the goods. The RAF's switch from precision bombing to area bombing in 1942 was based on more than the fact that precision bombing was, this early in the war, difficult. After all, they might
