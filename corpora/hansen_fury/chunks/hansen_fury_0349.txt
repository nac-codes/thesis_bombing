the overall German economy). The U.S. official history estimates that the production loss for Hamburg, which suffered the most devastating raid of the entire war, was 9 percent of a month's production spread over eleven months following the attack.2 As the official British history concluded after the war, the area bombing of Hamburg "had only an irritant effect on German production." The much smaller raids, late in the war, on Hamburg's transportation links with the Ruhr had a much greater effect on production. Area bombing-working "on the principle that in order to destroy anything it was necessary to destroy everything"3-simply failed to deliver the results that Harris and its other supporters promised. Given Britain's isolation during 1941- 1942, the spectre of a Nazi-dominated Europe, and the pre-1943 inability to bomb with any measure of precision, the choices were area bombing or nothing. But, as bombing became more intense and more destructive of lives and property, the argument against it became stronger with each passing day. Area bombing not only failed to win the war, it probably prolonged it. Sup- porters of Bomber Command are very keen to quote Speer's observation that bombing opened a "second front" right over Germany. They are less keen to quote his observations on area bombing-"pointless"-or to examine his views on bombing in greater detail. The Americans interrogated Speer on May 15, 1945, asking him about the effects of the different bombing campaigns. His answers were unequivocal. He was asked: "Which, at various periods of the war, caused most concern; British or American heavy bomber attacks, day or night attacks; and why?"+ Speer replied, "The American attacks which followed a def- inite system assault on industrial targets, were by far the most dangerous. It was in fact these attacks which caused the breakdown of the German armaments industry." He said exactly the same thing to British interrogators. At three points, a limited number of preci
