by the invading U.S. forces. Florence, Rome, Venice, and Tocello were never to be bombed without express authority. General Eisenhower sent his air force officers these instructions: If we have to choose between destroying a famous building and sacrificing our own men, then our lives count infinitely more and the buildings must go. But the choice is not always so clear-cut as that. In many cases the monuments can be spared without any detriment to operations. Nothing can stand against the argument of military necessity ... but the phrase "military necessity" is sometimes used where it would be more truthful to speak of military convenience or even of personal convenience. I do not want it to cloak slackness or indifference.20 That Italy today remains a land of endless architectural and cultural wonder owes something to American care and American constraint. When Athens was prepared to see Europe burn, Sparta spared it. The question is why this moral concern was less fully extended to the Japan- ese, whose cities were firebombed (with perhaps the exception of Kyoto) and then hit with nuclear bombs. Or to the Jews. The Allies could have tried to use the air forces to hinder the genocide later in the war-from the summer of 1944. It is true that, by then, 95 percent of what would come to be called the Holo- caust was over. It's also not clear that such an attempt would have succeeded.21 But the fact remains that the Allies never tried. That they did not casts cold water on the suggestion that the Holocaust in some way justifies or mitigates the bombing campaign. It does not. It is possi- ble to reflect at an abstract level on whether civilian bombing might be just pun- ishment for genocide, but it can be no part of a real-world historical explanation for the justification of the campaign. No RAF official, politician, or official document mentions the Holocaust as a justification for bombing. Whatever the bombing war was about, it was not about saving Jews. After the wa
