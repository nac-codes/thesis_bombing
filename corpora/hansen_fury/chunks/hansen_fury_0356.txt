of the campaign. No RAF official, politician, or official document mentions the Holocaust as a justification for bombing. Whatever the bombing war was about, it was not about saving Jews. After the war, the geno- cide certainly meant that people had less pity for German suffering, and this is no surprise. It is grating to read early postwar publications that bemoan in self- pitying tones the destruction of German cities without mentioning anti- Semitism, or the harassment, persecution, and eventual deportation and murder of the Jews.22 But this reaction does not change the argument: the Holocaust is neither an explanation nor a justification for the bombings.  FIRE AND FURY 276 1 Conclusion It also casts cold water on another popular idea: that area bombing saved Jewish lives (for example, Victor Klemperer, a Jew, was saved by the bombing of Dresden; he was about to be deported). Indiscriminate area bombing killed more hidden Jews and foreign slave labourers than it spared. Neither Jews nor foreign workers were allowed into shelters. In a single 1943 raid on Berlin, eighteen forced labourers died when a house collapsed in the Joachimsthaler Strasse.23 A raid on Dora in the same year killed five hundred. By the end of the war, Allied bombing had killed thirty-two thousand foreign civilians and prisoners of war.24 Their deaths were unintentional and very much regretted, but, in the light of them, one cannot pretend that the few Jews and POWs who were saved (or even heartened) by bombing justified the campaign. The failure of area bombing to deliver any clearly measurable results has led its sympathizers to its secondary effects. Bombing did not win the war directly- as no one but its advocates said it would-but it had important indirect effects. The defence of the Reich against bombing forced a diversion of resources from the rest of Germany's war effort: By 1944, some two million soldiers and civilians were engaged in ground anti-aircraft defence. This was more than
