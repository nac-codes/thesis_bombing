production. Taking the last, there is no flak without bombs: the large German output on flak has to be set against the large Allied output on bombs. Absenteeism, for its part, could be problematic, but as the U.S. official history emphasizes, it had little effect: absenteeism was highest among women (who generally were not directly involved in German industrial production), absentee  FIRE AND FURY 278 | Conclusion workers were often replaced with forced labourers, and absentee workers found jobs in other German cities.10 These statistics do not fully compare like with like, and can only provide a rough picture. It is nonetheless one that gives us no reason to believe that the resource transfers needed to protect German cities were significantly greater in absolute terms than the resource transfers needed to bomb them. Resource transfers on both sides to some degree cancelled each other out," though it is likely that the larger American economy bore this trans- fer more easily than did the German one. More importantly, most, if not all, of the resource transfers created by bomb- ing could have been created by precision bombing alone, with no recourse to area bombing. During the war itself, the Americans recognized and exploited the diversionary effects on precision bombing.32 This fact explains why Speer, dur- ing his Allied interrogation, said both that area bombing had an insignificant effect on the outcome of the war and that bombing led to the resource transfers mentioned by Overy (indeed, the two statements are a few paragraphs apart in the transcript).33 Intense, targeted precision bombing raids wrecked havoc with German industrial production, and defence of industrial targets was a mam- moth task. A countrywide precision bombing campaign of the sort achieved during the transportation plan would have required a massive, coordinated Ger- man defence. The Americans recognized this early on, as they tried to develop the capability to bomb aircraft industry in the
