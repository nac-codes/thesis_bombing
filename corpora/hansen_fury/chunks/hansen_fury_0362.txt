to ten additional attacks. The RAF might also have accompanied the Americans on their bombing raids or followed up on them. This would have sharply increased the number of RAF bombs falling on oil targets and wrecked much greater damage. Again, as German oil pro- duction was teetering on the brink of collapse, increased damage on a few more raids might have proved decisive. As Speer told his interrogators in May 1945, "You have to understand that such a concentration of bombers which was almost daily over  280 | FIRE AND FURY Conclusion | Germany and with only one target you could have brought about the collapse of Germany within eight weeks so that further resistance would have been impossible either in the east or in the west. .. . For instance, in the attacks on the chemical plants only a part of the bomber formation attacked the chemical plants. As far as I know only 20 to 30 percent of the bombers. Had you concentrated 100 percent instead of 20 percent, reconstruction would have been impossible. No labor would have entered plants because of the continued bombing. In that case the war would have ended within 6 to 8 weeks."39 Harris frequently sent massive bombing formations into the air, but otherwise his strategy was the opposite of Speer's suggestion: one area target after another, spread over the whole country. There are other reasons for thinking that eight weeks was not the upper limit. As the official British narrative noted, the Ruhr valley contained large numbers of benzol plants, on which the Wehrmacht increasingly had to rely as eastern supplies of oil vanished to retreat and bombing.40 The Ruhr was easier to reach than eastern Germany, and Harris hit it many times throughout 1944-1945. As Portal himself noted, it is hard to believe that weather conditions varied so much in this compact corner of Germany. Finally, the statistics again give the lie to Harris's argument, and that of his apologists: over the course of the war, the Americans made 347 sepa
