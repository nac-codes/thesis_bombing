Harris. The Polish contingent exploded in applause, table banging, and cheers when they saw Harris. The commander-in-chief did not smile; he looked directly at them and, saying nothing, nodded sharply, turned on his heels, and left the room.47 These characteristics allowed Harris to serve Bomber Command well. He was steadfast in his refusal to see the organization folded into the other two main military wings; he fought tirelessly for more and better planes and for improved pay and conditions for his men; and he managed to maintain  282 1 FIRE AND FURY Conclusion 1 throughout the war morale among a group of volunteers whose chances of survival over a tour stood at around 50 percent. Harris was in many ways almost a revolutionary. The thousand-bomber raid seemed impossible before 1942; by the end of the war, it was common- place. Like many revolutionaries, his actions were driven by ideology. Harris's commitment to area bombing was total, and he was at best blind and at worst hostile to any evidence challenging it. When area bombing did not work, and when intelligence reports suggested it could not work, Harris found himself backed into a corner. He could only respond by denying the evidence (hence his invectives against experts) and by calling for more bombing. As techno- logical developments and industrial production made bombing more effec- tive and more deadly, the result was ever more death and destruction. By the end of the war, Harris had made the complete obliteration of German cities the end goal. The bombing of German cities-originally adopted because all other options were impossible or unpalatable and because it promised to save lives-had become an end in itself, one that appeared to be something like indiscriminate slaughter. It is important to recognize that, while the start of the area campaign was probably inevitable given Britain's position in 1941-1942, its end was not. It is not the case that once area bombing started, it couldn't be stopped.48 On
