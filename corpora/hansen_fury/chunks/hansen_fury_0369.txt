it the first priority. POINTBLANK had left the door open to destroying cities, mainly to appease Harris, but the cities he selected for destruction had-almost brazenly-nothing to do with POINT- BLANK. A September 1943 Air Ministry memorandum urging the destruction of Augsburg, Brunswick Gotha, Kassel, and Leipzig as centres of the German air- craft industry expressed mystification over the fact that Harris was attacking Hamburg, Berlin, Nuremberg, and Mannheim.60 A few months later, the Air Staff ordered Harris to leave Berlin and Germany's other big cities alone and to attack smaller cities with a high concentration of POINTBLANK-relevant industries.61 Harris refused. By this point in the war, the Air Staff were in favour of precision bombing. "The difference in view between the Air Staff and Bomber Command," an official wrote in January 1944, "may, I think, be accurately described by saying that the Air Staff advocate throwing the weight of Bomber Command around the weak places in the German structure, whereas [Harris] believes more in piling the maximum on to the structure as a whole."62 Harris dismissed and did everything he could to block the precision bomb- ing campaigns-against ball bearings, oil, the Luftwaffe, and transportation- that did so much damage to the German cause. These facts come out at many points in the history. What's striking about the Harris-Portal exchange in 1944- 1945 is the accuracy of Portal's assertions (about the state of the German econ- omy, about the shortage of oil, about the importance of destroying the 285 Luftwaffe, about the need to overwhelm the choke points in German industry through repeated attacks, and about the complementary nature of oil and transportation attacks) and the inaccuracy of Harris's arguments (about oil's irrelevance, about the time wasted on the Luftwaffe, about the role of city bombing in aiding the armies' advance on Europe, and about the problems caused by city bombing for the Germans).
