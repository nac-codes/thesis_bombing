e at critical moments during the war. From 1939 Sir Arthur Harris was con- fident in Bomber Command as a poten- tially decisive weapon, and he now recounts the very complete story of how, from a nucleus of untrained men and obsolete machines, was built up the awe- inspiring force which could carry out the 1000-bomber raids. He tells of the lessons learned from German bombing; of what was achieved during the year of prepara- tion and experiment before the main attack began in March 1943; of the success of particular operations such as the destruction of the Mohne and Eder dams, and of the bombing of Berlin.
