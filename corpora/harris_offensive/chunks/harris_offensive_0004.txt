an outstanding man. As Commander-in- Chief Bomber Command, Sir Arthur Harris was responsible for directing the policy of a bomber offensive, and his views on the controversial questions— whether the results of this were worth the expenditure of lives and materials or whether area bombing was morally justifiable—will be read with universal interest. A feature of the book is the author’s numerous reports of conversa- tions with Mr. Churchill, Field-Marshal Smuts and other leading men, which took place at critical moments during the war. From 1939 Sir Arthur Harris was con- fident in Bomber Command as a poten- tially decisive weapon, and he now recounts the very complete story of how, from a nucleus of untrained men and obsolete machines, was built up the awe- inspiring force which could carry out the 1000-bomber raids. He tells of the lessons learned from German bombing; of what was achieved during the year of prepara- tion and experiment before the main attack began in March 1943; of the success of particular operations such as the destruction of the Mohne and Eder dams, and of the bombing of Berlin. Finally, he is able to tell of the actual ‘results’ discovered since the end of the war, and how far we were right in our estimates of the effect of air attack.  In a last chapter ‘ Bomber ’ Harris looks to the future, discussing the atomic bomb and the scope of Service responsibility in a scientific war.  *Rostock Wismar Hambur } g Iettin darburg  x Rs = 5 I  “MAP OF ERMANY shaving Principal Cage  ick Potsdam IS  usen, Meigs | ‘peers Lei pziget “ Leitz, Bohlen th Reece Freiberg: Chemnikz : \ (a ashi L, Kamen irzburg of \ | obtrop_yrnte $ é ,  | \  | \  | “Cn |  : \ Ae  fegensburg WW 2 F Hagen  / Krefeld ;  4 / Wuppertal i M.Gladbach ian BE,  o Augsburg ‘ Neuss @Munich  OFFENSIVE  ny al oni ts this Tar oli ev vhe Xpe vhe ust ite: uth on mu lac Fr der all:  or ye) spi 00- arn as  on  tac cce e¢ ms nal esu  im [ni the LG cie  BOMBER OFFENSIVE  iny  oni yuts this Tar oli le
