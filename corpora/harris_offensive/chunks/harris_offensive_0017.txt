Whatever may be the result of the war it is a foregone conclusion that he will lose by it. For if the war is won, there will be a wholesale retrenchment of regular forces. This always happens after every major war, when it is assumed that everybody will be too tired for another major war within at least the next ten years.

Yet it isa view widely held and disseminated by the loose thinking of interested parties and political dema- gogues, who blame the fighting man to conceal their own folly.  Before I undertook any new task at all I was determined to get a week or two’s rest; all the more so because I knew how close we were to war and how difficult it would be in any war to get even such rest as is physically necessary.
