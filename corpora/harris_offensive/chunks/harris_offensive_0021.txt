to be thrown out of the Continent neck and crop just as soon as it suited the Boche to do it, but like everybody else I had not foreseen the possibility of the long “phoney-war” period. To say that I was depressed by the prospect was to put it mildly.  Apart from everything else, a rule had been first tacitly and then explicitly in force for some twenty years which could not have been more effectively designed to secure our unreadiness for war. This was the iniquitous “Ten Year Rule,” as it was called. After the 1914-1918 war the Chiefs of Staff sought political guidance on which to base the establishments and plans of the three services. They were told to base their plans on the assump-  FACING THE WAR 13  tion that there would be “no major war for ten years.” That was a simple and, at the time when it was made, justifiable ruling. But that rule remained in force year after year, and no one had observed the logical conclusion that the progressive plans should thereafter have been based on an amended ruling that there would be no major war within nine years, within eight years, and so on each year, to zero. Until Hitler was already in power the passage of the years was ignored, and as year succeeded year each was still assumed to be the first of the ten years of immunity from any major war. Then, with all the services still, through force majeure on the part of the Treasury, basing their plans on this ruling, it was in force one day and completely abrogated the next. It was this absurd procedure, as much as anything else, which had brought the Royal Air Force and the other services to the position they were in in 1939, when every- thing we had—and that was little—was in the shopwindow, with nothing behind it.  In 1923 there was a panic about the size of the French Air Force and the French occupation of the Ruhr. The French could safely ignore our protests, and they did, because we had no force with which to back them, In particular, the French had, in the previous
