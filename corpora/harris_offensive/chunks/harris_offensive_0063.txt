nor anyone else predicted, or could have predicted, all the incredibly stupid mistakes that Germany was going to make. In point of fact, I do not know why such papers should not be published by the Stationery Office, if only for the purpose of showing that the Ministry staffs of the fighting services are not quite so incompetent as they are widely believed to be.  It was while I was at the Air Ministry, in 1935, that the specifications for the heavy bomber which later developed into the Manchester, Stirling, and Halifax were laid down. Three years later it was decided that all the main bomber force should be of this type. In 1936 the shadow factory system came into being, a method of using the automobile and related industry in Britain as a second line behind the aircraft industry, and in the same year the R.A.F. was divided up into the various com- mands, Bomber, Fighter, Coastal and Training Commands.  In 1938 I took command for a short time of No. 4 Bomber Group, in Yorkshire, which was just forming and sadly lacked every sort of equipment. We did cross-country flights and night bombing training in Whitley aircraft, but we were up against every conceivable sort of trouble when we tried to get training areas for bombing. We wanted Abbotsbury, but the use of this as a bombing range was postponed by prolonged and bitter opposition, with a vast correspondence in the Press; the objection was that the swans at Abbotsbury would not lay eggs if we used this as a range. In actual fact, once the site was given to us and we started bombing, the swans laid more eggs than they had ever done before. The reason was that they soon learned to regard the aircraft and the practice bombs as harmless things which served, at the same time, to keep unwanted human beings away from their nests.
