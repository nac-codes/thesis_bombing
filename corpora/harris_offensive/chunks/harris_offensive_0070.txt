I was allowed by Colonel Olds, then commanding a bomber squadron, to look over his “Forts.” I had a long and very interesting after- noon with him. I was not impressed with the armament then carried by the Fortress; in particular, the gun-mountings were wholly impractical. When I later headed the R.A.F. delegation to Washington the fruits of the discussion with Olds were already visible in the newer types of Fortress.

Needless to say I had other reasons besides that.  I spent the next year in Palestine. While there we made considerable progress with new methods of army co-operation, at first against suspicion and opposition, but later with the most enthusiastic co-operation of the junior army commanders. The Air Ministry had assumed a special responsibility for Palestine and Transjordan in 1919, but only because this was considered administratively more convenient.

We then did the
