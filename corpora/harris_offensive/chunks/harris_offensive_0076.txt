For one thing, the Group itself was equipped with an aeroplane which failed to meet many requirements of the normal specifications, especially with regard to comfort for the crew. It appeared to have little to recommend it except a very reliable brand of engine and the fact that this particular aeroplane, the Hampden, had at least materialised in a hurry, and was available in some numbers; most of the other types were still largely on paper.
