it might  34 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  we had to go still further and split the Group organisation up into Base organisations, each base dealing with an average of three airfields. The Group Commanders sent to the Bases more detailed explanations of the orders they themselves had received from Command, and the Bases in turn expanded the orders they had been given by Group Headquarters. The Group Commanders were given absolute freedom within the limits set by the necessity of co-ordinating an attack. At the beginning of the war, before concentration of attack made it necessary for Command itself to plan routes and timing very exactly, the Groups had even greater freedom in planning an operation.  During peace-time the enormous organisation and the large number of airfields and aircraft needed to train an adequate number of crews up to operational standards could not be pro- vided within the limits of the endurance of the British tax- payer. Flying Training Command and the Empire Training Scheme provided us with recruits trained up to a certain standard, but very far from being fit for operations; for one thing, none of these men had yet been trained to work together as a bomber crew. This was all right when we had bombers, such as the Battles, Hinds, and Vickers Wellesleys, which usually had only a crew of two, but with the newer types, carrying crews of four, five and six, such training of the men as individuals was wholly inadequate. All the rest had to be done by Bomber Command itself, and there had been no provision for such training in peace- time outside the squadrons themselvesâ€”which in war could not undertake both training and operations.  On the outbreak of war we had, in consequence, a force almost without reserves and without any adequate training organisation behind it; any sustained campaign in the autumn of 1939 would very quickly have brought us to the end of our small supply of trained crews. And even what we had in the shop window, though there was nothing
