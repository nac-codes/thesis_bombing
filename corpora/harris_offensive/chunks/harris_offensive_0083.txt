it; any sustained campaign in the autumn of 1939 would very quickly have brought us to the end of our small supply of trained crews. And even what we had in the shop window, though there was nothing behind it, had to be bled white if we were going to provide the instructors, aircraft, and unit organisations for the training that was essential to maintain the force for the bombing offensive of the future. Only the most experienced pilots and other aircrew were fitted to serve as instructors, and these experienced men were all, of course, in the front line. Minute as was the bomber force with which we started the war, we had at once to convert a number of front line squadrons into operational training units, each unit consisting of the squadrons, usually two, of one bomber station. We began with eight such  THE FIRST BOMBING 35  operational training units, and this was, of course, a very serious drain on our front line strength, even though this training organisation was nothing like adequate for building up a large enough force to do the enemy any real harm; at the peak of our training effort, in December, 1943, we had 22} operational training units to meet the wastage of a front line strength of some 1000 aircraft.  During the first year of the war we were therefore tied down to an absolute minimum of operational work and operational risk, and it would have been the same whether or no we had  - taken squadrons from the front line for training; the only  difference would have been that if we had had no O.T.U.s there could have been no bomber offensive in the future.  Air Chief Marshal Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt was the chief of Bomber Command at that time, and we could not have wished for a better leader to serve under. He was a man with a minute and detailed knowledge of every aspect of his job. He was far and away the most brilliant officer I have ever met in any of the three services. If he had a fault, it was that he had such immense knowledge of every technical an
