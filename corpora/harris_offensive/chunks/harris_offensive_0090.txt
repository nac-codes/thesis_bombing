never get these instructions withdrawn. Many of these pamphlets were patently so idiotic and childish that it was perhaps just as well to keep them from the knowledge of the British public, even if we did risk and waste crews and aircraft in dropping them on the enemy.  I suppose that propaganda of this kind, properly timed and efficiently turned out, might have the effect, in certain circum- stances, of shortening a victorious and overwhelming offensive by a day or two. Leaflets are said to have had some effect right at the end of the previous war, though such claims generally originated with those who got the leaflets out. But if so, why go to the trouble of inoculating your enemy at the very beginning of a long war against a weapon you might conceivably use with some profit at the end of it? .  The first magnetic mines began to take effect round our coasts and ports in October, 1939, and I remember the alarm and despondency which this caused. We then had the extraordinary task of bombing the flare path on the sea from which the German minelaying aircraft were supposed to take off. Actually we did some good, but it is an amusing sign of the countryâ€™s political attitude to the air war that we were not allowed to go and bomb the aerodromes on land from which other minelayers took off in case we hurt somebody. This ban was temporarily lifted when German aircraft dropped some bombs on Scapa Flow and three nights later we attacked, by way of reprisal, the seaplane base on the island of Sylt.
