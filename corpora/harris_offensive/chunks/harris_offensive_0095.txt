he introduction of this weapon would be very much to our detriment as a seafaring nation and that logically we should therefore do our utmost to develop this weapon, because it is only by developing and experimenting with weapons that it is really possible to arm yourself in time with the antidote. This proposal of mine led to a furious fight between the Air Ministry and the Admiralty about which of the two was to make the magnetic mine. The Air Ministry asserted that the mine was airborne and therefore their responsibility, while the Admiralty said that as it fell in the water it was theirs. I was not personally involved in this dispute, which was no doubt as futile and silly as most other inter-service disputes and rivalries and caused long delay in getting on with the job. But now that the weapon had started showering down around our coasts and blowing the bottom out of our own ships I rang up Ludlow-Hewitt and told him that I had started people thinking about the magnetic mine years ago with the idea of finding an antidote to it—as they did not appear to have found the antidote, had we yet got as far as producing the mine itself? Because, if so, I should like to give the Germans some of their own medicine. Inquiry elicited the fact that the Air Ministry and the Admiralty had eventually agreed to allow the mine to be produced by a naval shore establishment which I have always found an extremely efficient and capable organisation and where the torpedo and mine experts of the Navy work. Not only had this establishment agreed to produce it, but prototypes had in fact been produced, with the usual speed and high skill that I have always found in the technical departments of the Navy. ‘They very soon got the mine into production and then— poetic justice—it was discovered that my particular aircraft, the Hampden, was the only aircraft that would carry the mine; sthis  THE FIRST BOMBING 39  was exactly what might have been expected of it, since in general it would do li
