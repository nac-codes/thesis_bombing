The Air Ministry asserted that the mine was airborne and therefore their responsibility, while the Admiralty said that as it fell in the water it was theirs. I was not personally involved in this dispute, which was no doubt as futile and silly as most other inter-service disputes and rivalries and caused long delay in getting on with the job. But now that the weapon had started showering down around our coasts and blowing the bottom out of our own ships I rang up Ludlow-Hewitt and told him that I had started people thinking about the magnetic mine years ago with the idea of finding an antidote to it—as they did not appear to have found the antidote, had we yet got as far as producing the mine itself? Because, if so, I should like to give the Germans some of their own medicine. Inquiry elicited the fact that the Air Ministry and the Admiralty had eventually agreed to allow the mine to be produced by a naval shore establishment which I have always found an extremely efficient and capable organisation and where the torpedo and mine experts of the Navy work. Not only had this establishment agreed to produce it, but prototypes had in fact been produced, with the usual speed and high skill that I have always found in the technical departments of the Navy.
