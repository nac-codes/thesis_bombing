ot on and did it.  When Germany opened the offensive in the West most of our information about the Battle of France came from what we read in the newspapers. The Command’s effort was directed, or misdirected, to the task of blocking the enemy’s communications, and for my Hampdens this mostly took the form of attempting to push down houses in French towns in such a manner as to block the important crossroads. With the bomb load that my aircraft could carry and the lack of navigational aids this was, of course, a quite impracticable employment; and except in the brightest moonlight we had no conceivable means of identifying a pinpoint target like a crossroads, or even, for that matter, an averaged-sized town. At that time it was almost impossible to hit any inland target by night except when there was a bright moon; on the coast one could find a target on dark nights because the shore line and the surf showed up. Even in moonlight it was difficult to find an inland target unless this had some identifiable landmark beside it, such as a thick wood, a river bend, or a lake, or unless there was a very big open space or park in the middle of a densely built-up area which had some definite  THE FIRST BOMBING 41  shape. The principle of blocking crossroads by bombing was sound, and this eventually proved an important contribution of the bomber force during the Allied invasion of Europe, but during the Battle of France we were attempting the impossible with the equipment then at our disposal.  Before the war the French were promised that the whole of the R.A.F.’s bomber force would be used to resist an invasion of France, and that all our bomber squadrons should operate, in the event of invasion, under the general direction of the French High Command. This included, not only the Advanced Air Striking Force of short-range bombers which was actually based in France, but also the longer-range bombers in England. The French had been much afraid, before the war, that the English w
