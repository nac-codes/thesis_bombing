Advanced Air Striking Force of short-range bombers which was actually based in France, but also the longer-range bombers in England. The French had been much afraid, before the war, that the English would proceed at once to the strategic bombing of German industries and leave the air support of the French army to the French; this was naturally an alarming prospect, the French air force being what it was, but they were reassured, and promised everything we could give them. At the same time we had to warn them not to hope for too much from the bombers. We knew that the enemy would have vastly superior numbers of aircraft, that most of our bases would have to be far from the battle-front because we should not have the facilities for handling even a force of medium bombers in France, and that the Germans would have at their disposal an immense and therefore at that time an indestructible network of communications. Nevertheless the French continued to expect much from the bombing of railways behind the German lines and were inclined to think, when our bombing proved as ineffectual as we had said it would be, that this was because the R.A.F., in spite of all its promises, had concentrated on targets east of the Rhine. :  Oddly enough, in spite of the French insistence on the support of the whole bomber force for their army, when the invasion started, it proved impossible to persuade General Gamelin to permit the use of bombers at all. Gamelin was quite rightly afraid of the effect of bombing on his own army and he suffered from the extraordinary delusion that if he did not use the bombers, the enemy, by a sort of gentlemanâ€™s agreement, would also omit to use them. Eventually Barrett, the Commander-in- Chief of the British Air Force in France, had to order his squadrons into action on his own initiative. It was soon discovered that the French High Command was really quite incapable of directing any bomber force at all, and the British Air Staff had to do most  40 BOMBER OF
