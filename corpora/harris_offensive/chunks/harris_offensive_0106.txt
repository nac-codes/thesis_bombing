There were occasions when the Air Staff had to refuse to attack targets chosen by the French Com- mand because we knew that the attack would have caused us heavy casualties without having any influence whatever on the course of the battle.  From the point of view of Bomber Command the Battle of France was a complete muddle, and, even if we had had a large enough force to intervene with success, we should seldom have had enough information to plan our attacks. The influence, actual or potential, of our bombers on this battle was much exaggerated, but later on, during the Battle of Britain, the influence of the bomber force has been much underrated; all the credit for preventing the invasion of Britain has been given to Fighter Command, and the significance of Bomber Command’s share in the battle, which was, of course, the bombing of in- vasion ports and the barges in them, has'been largely over- looked. I am very far from wishing to belittle the achievement of Fighter Command, though it must be pointed out that once we had confirmed what we were already sure of, that the eight-gun fighter could in fact catch the almost unarmed German bomber, then the destruction of the German bomber squadrons outside their own fighter cover was very similar to shooting cows in a field, and our own casualties showed that this was so. Almost the only danger was from the Ger- man escort of fighters, and the escort was by no means always there. In point of fact, Fighter Command’s losses were very low as compared with the normal casualty rate for our bomber operati
