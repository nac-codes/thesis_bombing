the Ger- man escort of fighters, and the escort was by no means always there. In point of fact, Fighter Command’s losses were very low as compared with the normal casualty rate for our bomber operations.  The Germans never make a small mistake, because they are cautioned against all small mistakes in their manuals, without reference to which they seldom do anything whatever. But they can always be relied upon to make all the imaginable large and catastrophic mistakes, together with a good many that only a German could think out. No one but a German would have thought of attacking Russia quite needlessly before the rest of the  world had been finished off. Nobody but the Germans would have thought themselves so clever at designing aeroplanes that they could afford to use almost unarmed bombers against us; they never grasped the simple fact that even a bad fighter is bound to catch the average bomber. At the beginning of the Battle of Britain the German bombing was certainly very good but they were then using their regular and highly trained crews}  THE FIRST BOMBING 43  as they were flying in almost defenceless aircraft the supply of really good crews soon began to run out.  The facts about the projected invasion of England came out at the Nuremberg trials and here may be briefly summarised.

The first essential condition for the landing was that the English Air Force should be so effectively overcome that it could no longer “show any considerable aggressive force against the German attack.” By the beginning of September Hitler was beginning to think about attacking Russia instead of invading England; Raeder said that this was because Hitler feared that control of the air over the Channel in the autumn of 1940 could no longer be attained. What Hitler wanted was protection from air attack for a seaborne invasion and at that time our fighters could not hav
