could be used to put troops across the Channel or of the enormous number of them available.  During the summer and autumn of 1940 we began the strategic bombing of German industries, though on an infinitely small scale. Before the war there had been a great deal of theoretical study of the problem of attacking industrial targets, all of it based on the assumption that the precise identification of targets would be far easier than in fact it proved to be. This was partly because it was more or less assumed that much of the strategic offensive would be carried out by day, and partly because the difficulties of navigation by night were not fully appreciated Manuals of bombing tactics, which might have done us more harm than they did if we had been as manual-minded as the Germans, went to great pains to pick out the more vulnerable parts of specific factories and to recommend various elaborate sequences of attack with different kinds of bombs. The more vulnerable parts of gasworks, for example, were considered to be the power plant, exhausters, pumping station and benzol plant; it was understood that these parts of the plant were usually to be found standing together in line and were easily distinguishable by the scrubbers. Since it was assumed that bombs could be readily directed at the more vulnerable parts of a plant, the use of ridiculously small bombs was recommended, the 250 Ib. general purpose bomb, for example, was considered best for the pre- liminary stages of an attack on certain sections of fuel production plants—this would include synthetic oil plants—to be followed by incendiaries when the high explosives had spilled the in- flammable oil out of the tanks and pipes. Even smaller bombs would do for smaller targets, as, for example, the 4o Ib. general purpose high-explosive bomb for the smaller electric transformer stations.  It was very much a gentleman’s war that our manuals con- templated; houses, for example, were conceivable targets but they were descri
