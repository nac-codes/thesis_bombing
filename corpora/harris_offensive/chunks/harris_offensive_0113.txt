It was very much a gentleman’s war that our manuals con- templated; houses, for example, were conceivable targets but they were described as of two kinds, multi-storeyed, such as barracks, and single storeyed, such as the smaller types of dwelling  THE FIRST BOMBING 45  houses used as billets by troops. The right method of attack against billets was by 40 lb. general purpose bombs, to be followed if necessary by incendiaries. Incendiaries, it was held, should always be dropped at the end of an attack when inflammable debris has been scattered and could most easily be set alight; this particular doctrine persisted during the first two years of the war, though anything less easy to set alight than a heap of rubble it would be hard to imagine.  In 1940 the Ministry of Economic Warfare was in its glory, planning a campaign against Germany’s synthetic oil plants, together with factories making aluminium, and aircraft works. There were several factors which tended to conceal the futility of planning such a campaign during the early stages of the bombing offensive. The forces we were able to send against such targets were extremely small and their bomb load negligible, but it was known that this could be remedied in time and mean- while our weakness could be considered sufficient reason for the failure of any campaign. At the same time we were using a number of regular and highly-trained crews who were much better able to find their targets by night than the average crew, and the defences of Germany were then in a rudimentary stage, so that it was possible to come down low and visually identify targets even in the Ruhr; this suggested that there was nothing radically wrong with the idea of bombing individual German factories one by one. But, like the greater part of our economic warfare at the beginning of the war, the whole plan of attack overlooked the fact that Germany was not effectively encircled as she
