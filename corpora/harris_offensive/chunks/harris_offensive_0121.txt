e war with insufficient stocks of aluminium for the aircraft industry, but the rather obvious fact that Germany had just conquered France, where there were huge stocks of bauxite, in addition to alesis plants, was forgotten. The bombing of synthetic oil plants had a much longer history, which I shall discuss later, but it is worth remarking here that Germany had captured Poland, where there were some oil supplies, and could get oil from Rumania and Russia.  Anyone of the three classes of industrial target—synthetic oil plants, aircraft factories, and aluminium plants—attacked by Bomber Command in 1940 would, in the later stages of the war have had to be given first priority for attack by both Bomber Command and the U.S.A.A.F. for a considerable period if a campaign against them was to have any chance of success. But in 1940, besides these industrial targets, we were also required to bomb German communications, both railways and canals, in the area of the Ruhr and Rhineland. This was really a continua- tion of the campaign against communications which Bomber Command had been required to carry out during the Battle of France, when any damage we did to railways, bridges, and the like v yas quickly repaired or easily by-passed. ‘But it was probably not until we ourselves had experience of bomb damage to rail- ways during the Blitz that it was fully understood how very quickly all but the heaviest and most widespread and onside damage can be repaired.  Throughout 1940 and the first half of 1941 attacks continued to be made on the marshalling yard at Hamm, which never was and never could be a bottleneck in the German railway system; there are far too many marshalling yards in the Ruhr area for any practicable attack on them to have any decisive or lasting effect on the running of the railways, and this fact was to te fully appreciated in the successful attack on communications which eventually brought the German war machine to a sto; As it was, it is very doubtful if our
