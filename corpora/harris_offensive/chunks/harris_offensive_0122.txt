g of the railways, and this fact was to te fully appreciated in the successful attack on communications which eventually brought the German war machine to a sto; As it was, it is very doubtful if our attacks in 1940 had any ap a ciable effect, even for a few hours, on the efficiency even of th one marshalling yard at Hamm. ‘  It was appreciated, even at this early sta a German communications could be tepals ied  1 « ncluded coastal traffic, which was being attacked by minelaying, and inland waterways as well as the railways. The qutebaleehechel Hitler had built could be neglected because road traffic can never  THE FIRST BOMBING 47  supply the place of railways and shipping, especially when there is anything approaching a shortage of oil and rubber, and because in any case roads are wholly unproductive targets for bombing. It so happens that there is a genuine bottleneck in the German system of inland waterways; this is the Dortmund-Ems Canal, and it is vulnerable to air attack at points where there are aque- ducts or where the canal passes between embankments over low lying ground. This canal is the only link by water between the Ruhr and Eastern Germany or the North Sea and the Baltic; iron ore from Sweden inevitably goes through the canal to the Ruhr, and its barges carry millions of tons of freight to and from the Ruhr. The canal was accordingly attacked several times in 1940, and Hampdens from my Group succeeded in damaging both of its aqueducts in low level attacks against very heavy flak. Five Hampdens were dispatched on one attack and all of them were damaged by gunfire, two of them being shot down at once. The pilot of the last of the five, Squadron Leader Learoyd, was rightly awarded the Victoria Cross for his determination; it was his bombs that hit the aqueduct. But any operation which deserves the V.C. is in the nature of things unfit to be repeated at frequent intervals, and it was obvious that the Dort- mund-Ems canal could never be blocked for long u
