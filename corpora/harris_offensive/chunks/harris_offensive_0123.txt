uct. But any operation which deserves the V.C. is in the nature of things unfit to be repeated at frequent intervals, and it was obvious that the Dort- mund-Ems canal could never be blocked for long unless accurate attacks could be repeated at frequent intervals to keep pace with repairs.  It might be argued that since it must have been clear that we could do the enemy no harm by bombing his industries and communications in 1940 we should not have wasted men and aircraft on these attacks, but should have conserved our strength for use in a possible invasion of England and for offensive action in the future, But after the Battle of France strategic bombing at once became the central point in Allied strategy, so that it was necessary to begin attacking at once, on however minute a scale, if only for the purpose of testing and probing the enemy’s defence. A policy of conserving our front line strength until such a time as it could be used on an effective scale would have meant that we should have had no chance of keeping pace with the enemy’s counter-measures. As it was, we were able to appreciate without any sudden and catastrophic rise in casualties, the effect of the enemy’s growing defences; we were able, for example, gradually to increase the height at which our bombers operated and eventu- ally to find means of identifying the target even from such great heights as became necessary.

To resist invasion, that force would have been available, and it did in fact contribute to the bombin  of the invasion barges i
