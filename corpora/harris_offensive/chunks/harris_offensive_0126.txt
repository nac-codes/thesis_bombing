suggested reducing the staff. It was quite obvious that to discuss every individual appointment mentioned in the files would offer no solution and would take up all my time. A much simpler and more effective way of reducing staff was suggested to me. This was merely to issue a fiat that the whole of the Air Staff should be reduced by so much per cent, and no back answers; 40 per cent was put forward. We issued the fiat and as the missive crept round the corridors I almost thought I could hear the wail of despair with which the embusqués in the bowels of the building were greeting it.
