itm any way my decision to build up a force of this size; to put o large a part of the nation’s war effort into the production of ne weapon was a decision that could only be made by the War jiu Cabinet advised by the Chiefs of Staff. z  thiitt It is worth remarking that no other country in the world had wohcsat that time conceived the possibility of using an air force in diithis way, to fight a war by itself and, within certain limits, win “wrta war outright.
