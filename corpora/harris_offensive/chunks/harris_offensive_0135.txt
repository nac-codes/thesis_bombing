regarded this, not only as the only alternative then available to us, but also as an entirely practicable method of beating the enemy, provided only that we got on quickly enough to keep ahead of the enemy’s counter-measures. But in the light of our experience I was not at all happy about our ability to beat the enemy’s growing defences; we ourselves seemed to have been quick enough in finding methods of confusing or beating off the German attacks on Britain, by interfering with the enemy’s radio beams for navigation at night, by starting  dummy fires, and later on by equipping our night fighters with the first of the radar devices which enabled them to find the bombers in the dark. I did not then have that high regard for the ability of our scientists that I subsequently acquired as the war progressed and as I saw their inventions pull us time and again out of a mess.  If we could keep ahead of the Germans, I was convinced,  IN THE AIR MINISTRY AND U.S.A. 53  having watched the burning of London, that a bomber offensive of adequate weight and the right kind of bombs would, if con- tinued for long enough, be something that no country in the world could endure. I knew also that others besides myself, including Portal and Winston Churchill, were convinced that to carry out a bomber offensive was about the only thing we could hope to do in the foreseeable future. It was, of course, anybody S guess what effort would be required and over what period the offensive would have to be continued, but working it out as best we could on the data then available we asked for a front-line strength of some 4000 heavy bombers, about three times the strength we were ultimately to achieve. It was not, of course, in any way my decision to build up a force of this size; to put so large a part of the nation’s war effort into the production of one weapon was a decision that could only be made by the War Cabinet advised by the Chiefs of Staff. ,  It is worth remarking that no other country
