rt of the nation’s war effort into the production of one weapon was a decision that could only be made by the War Cabinet advised by the Chiefs of Staff. ,  It is worth remarking that no other country in the world had at that time conceived the possibility of using an air force in this way, to fight a war by itself and, within certain limits, win a war outright. The French believed that bombers could only be used to serve as long-range artillery for the army and had very vague ideas even about how this artillery should be used; in any case, they had no bombers and left it to the British to give this support to their army. The Germans completely subordinated their whole air force to the land operations of a Continental army. The Russians never seriously attempted strategic bombing after they had entered the war against Germany or in their war against Finland. They had neither the knowledge nor the productive capacity to equip a heavy bomber force, so that it may be supposed that they either had never entertained, or had rejected, the idea of using an air force on independent operations; in any case the Germans have stated that the Russian air force was comparatively ineffective even when reinforced by large numbers of British and American aircraft flown by Russians. The Japanese entirely subordinated their air force to the operations of their army and navy. And it is certainly true, as Major Alexander de Seversky has said in his published report on Pacific Air Power, that the United States, as well as the Japanese, had not originally visualised the use of aircraft in any but a close strategical-tactical role; undoubtedly they took the main idea of the strategic use of air power from the R.A.F. and only because of the incredible efficiency of their industrial organisation were they able to produce strategic  54 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  bombers in time for them to take part in the war against Germany and Japan. Seversky says that the tactical use of aircraft was “the only rol
