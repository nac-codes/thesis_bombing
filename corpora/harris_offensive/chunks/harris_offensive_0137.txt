were they able to produce strategic  54 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  bombers in time for them to take part in the war against Germany and Japan. Seversky says that the tactical use of aircraft was “the only role at first visualised by military leaders of all warring nations including our own,” but this was certainly not true of the British. General Smuts had reported to the War Cabinet in the last war that air power could and would be used strategically before long and the R.A.F. was using air power strategically in Irak in 1922. The idea was a natural one for a country which has never maintained an army of Continental proportions, has a large empire which must be defended as cheaply as possible, and has in the past largely won its wars by the strategic use of sea power working as an independent weapon; the same principle of strategy that made England a sea power in the past had only to be applied to the new weapon which had rendered obsolete the old one, the battleship.  Winning a war by bombing, as at that time'we were proposing to do, can mean several things. It may mean bringing the enemy’s war effort so completely to a standstill that you are invited into the country to clear up the mess; in which case the only army you will need will be a well-trained police force. Or it may mean little more than softening up the enemy’s defences, communica- tions, and war industries so effectively in advance of a well prepared invasion that that invasion goes according to plan; in which case you will need a large and very well-equipped army. And, of course, it may mean, and probably does mean, something between these two alternatives. As things were after Dunkirk, it seemed inconceivable that any army we could raise and equip in Great Britain would ever be able to get back on the Continent unless there was some internal rot in Germany or effective revolt in the German-occupied territories. Certainly those responsible for the war did not seem to need convincing that this was so; if we h
