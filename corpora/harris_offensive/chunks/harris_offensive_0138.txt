unless there was some internal rot in Germany or effective revolt in the German-occupied territories. Certainly those responsible for the war did not seem to need convincing that this was so; if we had had any allies, or had expected any, the situation would have been different. After Dunkirk it became obvious that the army would need for the re-invasion of the Continent, something like 15 armoured divisions and 70 other divisions over and above what might be needed to defend Great Britain or any other part of the Empire. To raise such a force by ourselves was wholly impracticable; we should never have had the man power to recruit such an army or the shipping to mount so vast an invasion.  It was, of course, the army’s business to think in terms of the moment when they could get back on to the Continent after the enemy had been sufficiently weakened, either by bombing or by  IN THE AIR MINISTRY AND U.S.A. 55  some other means, for this to be possible. When the moment for invasion came air power would probably not have finished its work, but would still be needed; in fact the soldiers had been convinced by the swift succession of German successes that it would be absolutely indispensable at this stage, and they asked for a huge force to serve as a specialised air component of the army; such an air component, they believed, had been largely responsible for the German victories. “We in the R.A.F. had to point out that the highly specialised types required by the army would not be able to hold their own against a powerful air force, and perhaps not even against powerful ground defences. The Germans had won their victories in circumstances entirely differ- ent from any that we could contemplate for our own forces; they had used their air force against armies which had scarcely any air protection or air support and were very ill-provided with anti- aircraft guns, but this would not be the case if we encountered the German army in the future. Admittedly the specialised ar
