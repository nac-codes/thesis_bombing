ely any air protection or air support and were very ill-provided with anti- aircraft guns, but this would not be the case if we encountered the German army in the future. Admittedly the specialised army co-operation types of aircraft might be rather more suitable on special occasions than the general-purpose bombers and fighters we were proposing to build, but they could not by themselves gain or maintain air superiority. The German dive-bombers were a casein point. They were no doubt accurate and alarming when used against undefended troops, but they were so easily shot down by efficient anti-aircraft fire, or, of course, by any normal fighter, that they were rapidly becoming obsolete at the very moment when a “why no dive bombers?” campaign was being run in the Press and in Parliament; even in Russia, it was not long before the Germans found they could only use them by night. It would, of course, be a good thing if we could afford to build all the specialised types as well as the main air force, but here again we altogether lacked the man-power and industrial resources to do anything of the kind. What we therefore proposed to do was to build a force which, acting independently against the enemy’s air force and other defences, would, it was hoped, gain air pre- dominance, and then, when that was achieved, could work in close co-operation with the army; for this co-operation there would eventually be special training and exercises.  There were some doubts at the beginning of the war, whether any such air force could, in fact, be sufficiently flexible to do all the work that might be required of it. In particular it was gravely doubted whether any one type of bomber, or crew trained in one way, could serve for strategic bombing, close support of the army,  56 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  attacks on capital ships, and sea mining. In the event, the heavy bombers proved so extremely useful in all these roles that I had the greatest difficulty in preventing them from being continua
