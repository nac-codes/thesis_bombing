exactly how much air power should be allotted to defensive operations at the expense of the coming offensive. Of course the Chiefs of Staff have almost as much responsibility in putting the facts before the War Cabinet as the War Cabinet has in deciding what to do in the light of those facts. Portal could not, for example, delegate the real responsi- bility for the overall running of the bomber offensive to me or anyone else; that it was carried out as it was was finally the decisions of the War Cabinet, acting on the advice of the Chiefs of Staffs, and when America entered the war the decision of the British and United States Governments advised by the Combined Chiefs of Staff Committee on which Portal acted for the R.A.F. and General Arnold for the United States Air Force.

Portal had great strength, though he seldom showed it. His intellectual powers were outstanding; nobody could be more lucid; nobody could write a better minute. And he was a fighting man through and through, in spite of his quiet and modest manner.

I noticed at the Air Ministry that there was a marked tendency —not on the part of Portal—to go cap in hand to the other services. In the early stages of the war, the R.A.F. very definitely had an inferiority complex; it seemed unduly conscious of lacking tradition—though
