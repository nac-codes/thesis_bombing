ly useful in all these roles that I had the greatest difficulty in preventing them from being continually switched, to meet the demands of one or other service or of one or other of the Government departments, from one duty to another. It was much like my experience in Palestine over again; at first nobody thought our aircraft would be of any value, and then there were incessant demands for the use of them.  Rather naturally the soldiers wanted the specialised air com- ponent to be as much a part of each army corps or army as its tanks or artillery. It had to be pointed out that this was not in point of fact how the Germans had used their air force in their successful campaigns, and that it overlooked the main advantage of an air force, that it can be concentrated at very short notice at the point where it is needed. This concentration of the force at the decisive time and place cannot be brought about if the force is split up into penny packets; unified control of all the available air power is necessary because, with the rapid changes of situation that are always characteristic of air warfare, a number of small and separate air components will always provide too few or too many aircraft at any given time and place.  At this time, when those who were responsible for the conduct of the war had to all intents and purposes placed the whole management of all offensive action in the hands of the Royal Air Force, Portal, as the Chief of the Air Staff, had immense responsibilities. It was not only that he had to see that the offensive was correctly planned, and with the odds as much against us as they were then the least blunder seemed likely to prove fatal. He had also to decide exactly how much air power should be allotted to defensive operations at the expense of the coming offensive. Of course the Chiefs of Staff have almost as much responsibility in putting the facts before the War Cabinet as the War Cabinet has in deciding what to do in the light of those facts. Por
