running round in circles the Rodney plugged most of her ammunition through the hulk. The Rodney closed to such short range that she had in the end depressed her guns so low as to tear up her own deck planking and slightly depress the steel decking underneath. The Rodney’s great guns were all still blis- tered and peeling and you could see where her deck planking had been patched up, but apart from this she had no other damage from this encounter except a hit by one shell fragment which went through the screening of a searchlight station on the after structure of the ship. Nevertheless it must have been a fairly hair- raising task for this ancient old battle wagon to wade into the Bismarck, especially as this was within a few hours of the Bismarck’s having disposed of the Hood at extreme range and apparently with only one salvo.  Somewhere and some time in the past the Rodney had been hit bya German bomb, apparently of about 2000 pounds weight, which had failed to explode. Isaw the dent in one of the workshop flats where the bomb had finished up. I must say I was rather depressed by the attitude of the enthusiastic sailors who showed me round; it was obvious that they had not yet learned to take aircraft as seriously as their later experience forced them to do.  I think it was on the second night out that when we were at dinner in the Admiral’s flat we heard a tremendous racket and roar overhead. There was also a shower of white paint and cork fragments off the deckhead above; the “Chicago piano” or multiple pom-pom anti-aircraft gun on the quarter deck had opened fire.
