This seemed so normal to me that I required no further reassurance, but as a matter of curiosity we went up to have a look. A poor innocent old Whitley was then circling round that part of the Atlantic; it appeared that she had come out of the low clouds and had been received in the usual manner by the Navy, and no questions asked. I must say it annoyed mea little; the airman  60 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  although he was a healthy specimen by nature, he worked himself to a shadow.  As America was not then at war I knew well, from my previous experience there when I spent six weeks buying aircraft in 1938, that we should have to do a considerable amount of return entertaining. But there was the usual frightful struggle with the Treasury to obtain the wherewithal even to exist in the country, let alone to do any entertaining.
