I discovered something better, but it seemed difficult to get rid of the rooms that had long been reserved for us. However the problem was solved in an amusing way. After a stay in the country my wife arrived at the hotel and asked for the keys of my room. The reception clerk denied that there was any such person as myself staying in the hotel.
