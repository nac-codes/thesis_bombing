We had rather a similar experience with a young lady whom we christened Olga Petrovska, the beautiful spy. She continually  IN THE AIR MINISTRY AND U.S.A. 8  tried to get in touch with me for some purpose best known to herself, and gave my wife and me some amusement.

I must say I was too tired to find out what this was. We never learned what her purpose was; it was not the usual one, and we had little doubt that it was either blackmail or something on behalf of some foreign power. While I was in America I found that our Government’s habit of issuing communiques in which the phrase “Imperial troops” was invariably used had the effect of convincing all Americans that in North Africa, where our troops were then putting up a good show, all the fighting was being done not by the British but by “colonial troops,” and probably black ones.

I do not know what the word “Imperial” means in official circles in England, except that the words “Empire” and “Imperial” are never uttered at all by Dominion Office officials, if they can possibly avoid doing so, in case some one should feel insulted.

I am always astounded by the idiotic behaviour of the British islanders in crying down their own efforts and giving all the credit to others, I do not myself ascribe this habit, which is a widespread one, to
