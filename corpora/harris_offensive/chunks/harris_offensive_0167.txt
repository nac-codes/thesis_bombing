ess and until they have been put through the standard riding school procedure, in the days when horsemen meant something, and the standard musketry drill of the armed forces. After which they are no better and no worse than the British themselves. I have myself watched with great amusement a complete regiment of these colonial “ crack shots,” over 500 of them, open fire at half a dozen 5-foot-square targets out in the desert at 500 yards range with 5 rounds apiece. Later I examined the targets for myself and found that out of 2500 rounds fired precisely three hits had been scored. Yet I have no doubt that if they had been put through a British musketry course these 500 “hard riding hard shooting” colonials would have been just about as good as the ordinary British infantryman —and no better.  There is, in fact, nothing to choose between trained British and colonial or dominion troops except that the British, being in general better educated and more amenable to discipline, are apt to be quicker in the uptake during the complicated training which has to be given before troops can handle modern machines of war.  I have had under my command tens of thousands of fighting men from every part of the Empire and from every part of the British Isles, and I say without hesitation that the finest fighting aircrews of the whole lot were beyond doubt the British crews; when I say this, it is in no way to belittle the magnificent per- formance of crews from other parts of the Empire.
