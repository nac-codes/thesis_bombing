Yanks told me—and even President Roosevelt once seriously  IN THE AIR MINISTRY AND U.S.A. 65  impressed this on me—how quickly the average American could pick up flying and crew duties, “because you see our boys are all used to mechanical things—they can all drive a car long before they are legally allowed to”—and so on and so forth. Well, the answer to that sort of statement is that any moron can drive a motor car and it is generally the moron who takes most delight in doing so.  This diffidence, or as I call it stupidity, of the British, still continues and is really a serious menace to them. When so many people are told that the British are inferior as fighting men to everyone, from a New Zealander to a Gurkha, they are apt to believe it, coming as it does, over and over again, more or less straight from the horse’s mouth. History shows that the British are as good fighters as any and better than most.  I saw nothing while I was in America to shake my belief that the Americans were not going to get into the war. Of course, they were doing a great deal to help us to get weapons, but we had to do a great deal as well to get them made in America; for instance, we had to build factories there, and Lease Lend—“ the most unselfish act in history”—coincided with the expenditure ofour last dollar. Iheard the news of Pearl Harbour as I was going up in a lift in Washington (in 1945 I was in the same lift when I heard that the Japs had surrendered—I am not sure whether it was the same lift-man who gave me the two items of news).  The Americans were very raid-consssous after Pearl Harbour. My wife and I were having lunch in our apartment when we tuned in the radio to get the local news and heard a running commentary on a most terrible air raid on New York which was apparently then going on. We got quite worked up about it, but it turned out that it was only a training aircraft that had gone slightly adrift over the Bay. We had understood that casualties were not negligible.
