iked. More important still, I should have liked to have been able to see far more than I did of my air-crews, but it was quite out of the question for a Commander-in-Chief during the war to get round to most of the stations. At Springfield we had a continuous succession of visitors whom I had to convince of the vital import- ance of the bomber offensive; if I had not been able to persuade those in the charge of the conduct of the war as a whole that we were really hurting Germany we should not have got even that small fraction of what we needed that was eventually granted us. And this, of course, had to be done in what time I could spare from my real work, the strain of which I do not think had ever been fully understood.  For that matter I wonder if the frightful mental strain of commanding a large air force in war can ever be realised except by the very few who have experienced it. While a naval com- mander may at the most be required to conduct a major action once or twice in the whole course of the war, and an army com- mander is engaged in one battle say once in six months or, in exceptional circumstances, as often as once a month, the com- mander of a bomber force has to commit the whole of it every twenty-four hours; even on those occasions when the weather forces him to cancel a projected operation, he has to lay on the whole plan for committing the force. Every one of these opera- tions is a major battle, and as much depends on the outcome, success is as vital and disaster as grave, as on any other occasion when the whole of a force engages the enemy. In addition, there is the continuous and fearful apprehension about what the weather may do, especially in the climate of North-West Europe. Meteorology is an inexact science; in fact it is still in the con- dition of being rather an art than a science. This being so, and our climate being what it is, I should have been able to justify myself completely if I had left the whole force on the ground, if I had don
