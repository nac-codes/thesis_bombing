n of being rather an art than a science. This being so, and our climate being what it is, I should have been able to justify myself completely if I had left the whole force on the ground, if I had done nothing whatever, on nine occasions out of ten. But this would have led to the defeat of Britain in the air. The whole of the responsibility, the final responsibility, for deciding whether or not to operate falls fair and square on the shoulders of the Commander-in-Chief, and falls on them every twenty-four hours. For all he knows he may lose the whole of a very large proportion of the force by weather alone, to say nothing of enemy  BOMBER COMMAND 73  action. It is best to leave to the imagination what such a daily strain amounts to when continued over a period of years.  When I took up my Command the bomber force had played its very great part in stopping the projected invasion of England, but had done nothing else worth mentioning to injure the enemy. The force had been too small for that, and was still, in February, 1942, much too small to achieve anything lasting, it was also poorly equipped. On the day that I took over there were 378 aircraft serviceable with crews, and only 69 of these were heavy bombers. About 50 aircraft in the force were not even medium bombers but the light bombers of No. 2 Group. These, apart from making intruder attacks on airfields, could take no part in the main offensive and were mostly used as bait by Fighter Command; they took part in fighter sweeps over France in an attempt to make the German fighters accept battle. In effect, this meant that we had an average force of 250 medium and fifty heavy bombers until such time as the Command really began to expand. Equipment was no more impressive than these numbers. The German defences were so strong that it was impossible to operate regularly or with any sizable force by day, so that all our main operations were confined to the hours of darkness. But at night the bomber crews were hardly
