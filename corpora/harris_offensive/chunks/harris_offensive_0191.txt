But at night the bomber crews were hardly ever able to find their targets even though, before I took command, it had already been decided (it was a decision with which I had nothing to do) that all our main attacks should be against large industrial areas, which meant, of course, large industrial cities as a whole. Up till then the Command had had no radar navigational aids, though the first of these was just being issued, to enable the bomber crews to navigate or find the target without seeing the ground, and it had become glaringly obvious that the average crew in average weather could not find their way to the target by visual means alone. It had also become obvious to all who had studied Bomber Commandâ€™s previous operations that it would be necessary to concentrate the force in time and space, both for its own pro- tection against enemy defences, and to ensure the destruction of the target. But the tactical and technical problems involved in achieving such a concentration had scarcely been tackled, nor was it realised what degree of concentration was necessary; it was hoped eventually to reach a total of a hundred aircraft over the target per hour. There was also a serious deficiency of trained  crews.
