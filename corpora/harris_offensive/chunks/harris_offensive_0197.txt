They were good enough to say that they wished this to be arranged in such a way as to cause the least possible hindrance to the expansion of the R.A.F. for strategic action; it would, of course, have stopped this expansion altogether.  I was also fully aware that such large demands would be made  74 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  ate offensive against Germany ; it was also the only force in the west which then could take any offensive action at all against Germany, our only means of getting at the enemy in a way that would hurt at all. I knew well from what I had seen in America and from what I knew of our own difficulties at the beginning of the war that it would take the Americans at least a year and probably two before their might could really begin to make itself felt in the air or on the ground, and at that time America had been in the war less than three months.  The importance of beginning the offensive as soon as possible could hardly be overestimated. The bomber offensive, or rather what could be made of it, was the only means we had of actively helping the Russians, who, though the German offensive in Russia had been halted, had every appearance of being in extremis. Even if this could not be done directly, by destroying the enemy’s war industries and communications, at least it could be done indirectly, and to a very material extent, by forcing the enemy to keep his fighters in Germany. In the same way, if not directly, then indirectly by containing the enemy’s air force and com- pelling it to be used for the defence of Germany, the bomber offensive was at that time the only means we had of doing any- thing to give any measurable help to our armies engaged in a desperate struggle in the Middle East; a bomber offensive would also have the effect of making the enemy keep his anti-aircraft guns at home, and every German anti-aircraft gun was a dual- purpose weapon, convertible at will into an anti-tank gun,  By the bomber o
