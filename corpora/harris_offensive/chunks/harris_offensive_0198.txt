In the same way Bomber Command, by getting on with its minelaying campaign, could put a large part of the German navy on to the work of minesweeping, and many workers on to the repair of ships.  A bomber offensive was the only means that I could see, and the results eventually bore out this conclusion, of preventing the allied armies from suffering enormous casualties when they eventually invaded the Continent. And it was then under con- sideration to invade Europe, not in two but in one year’s time,  in 1943.
