rmans had just as much chance of getting it, and just as good facilities for making it, as anyone else. In no circum- stances whatsoever did there seem to be any means of preventing Germany from making progress with the atom bomb except by bombing industry generally in the hope that this would hit where it was most likely to hurt the production of the atom bomb. Parachutist attacks on'the production of heavy water in Norway might certainly cause delays, but if the Germans chose to give priority to atom-bomb research, and to the manufacture of the materials needed for it, they could always get ahead of such attacks on individual plants or facilities; only in the event of industry in general being badly dislocated by bombing would attacks on such individual targets count for more than brief damage. Here we came up against the same problem and the same objections that I had to make when panacea targets, as I called them, were so frequently put before me, targets like synthetic oil plants, ball-bearing factories, molybdenum mines and the like; I shall go into this later.  I knew at the same time that the ever-increasing demands from the Middle East, as well as from elsewhere, and of course, the inordinate demands of the Admiralty for every conceivable thing to be turned to their use, would bring any bomber force offensive to a standstill. In 1941 the Air Force had already had a tough struggle with the army who were asking for an army air component for the invasion of Europe rather larger than our whole front line strength at that time. They were good enough to say that they wished this to be arranged in such a way as to cause the least possible hindrance to the expansion of the R.A.F, for strategic action; it would, of course, have stopped this expansion altogether.  I was also fully aware that such large demands would be made  BOMBER OFFENSIVE  74  ate offensive against Germany ; it was also the only f west which then could take any offensive action at Germany, our onl
