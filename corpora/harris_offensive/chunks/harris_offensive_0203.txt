at there would immediately be demands for every conceivable dispersal of effort, in almost any direction except the right one. If these demands should be answered, we should never catch up with the German repair squads; as was obviously happening at the beginning of 1942, the German war potential would increase far more rapidly than our capacity to damage it. I had to prove, and prove quickly, to the satisfaction of those who mattered, that the bomber force could do its work if it was large enough and if its efforts were not frittered away on objectives other than German industry as a whole.  The general idea at this time on what civil servants always call “a high level,” was that the main and almost the only purpose of bombing was to attack the morale of the industrial workers. This was to be achieved by destroying, mainly by incendiary bombs, the whole of the four largest cities in the Ruhr, and there- after fourteen industrial cities elsewhere in Germany. The idea of attacking morale might be described as a counsel of despair, based on the previous failure of night bombing, and the break- down of the theory of precision attacks on key factories, a theory which got much publicity when our attacks on Germany first began in 1940. But it also implied an unbounded optimism, not, indeed, about the strategic effects of a bombing offensive, but about what could be achieved at this moment. Portal and I, when we discussed the bombing of Germany during the London blitz, had thought in terms of a front line strength of 4000 heavies. We were now expected to use a force of 50 heavies and 250 medium bombers to knock out whole German cities; three months, it was suggested, was a reasonable time in which to destroy the four cities in the Ruhr. As we had done nothing more than scratch at the Ruhr in the previous two years and as attacks on targets in this area had almost without exception failed in the past, such a degree of confidence in the future requires some explanation; the
