at the Ruhr in the previous two years and as attacks on targets in this area had almost without exception failed in the past, such a degree of confidence in the future requires some explanation; the explanation is that the non-visual aid to navigation which had the code name of Gee was just being introduced into the Command, though as yet, and for some considerable time to come, only a small fraction of the force could be equipped with it. Far more was expected of this extremely useful device, one of the many really brilliant things the scientists gave us, than it could in fact achieve. And, of course, far more was expected of  BOMBER COMMAND 77  a very small bomber force than was at all reasonable, even if the new Gee equipment should come up to the most optimistic fore- casts; so I had to prove, not only what an adequate and adequately equipped force could not achieve, but also what a small and inade- quately equipped force could achieve. I had to dispose of all wishful thinking, while at the same time making perfectly clear the grounds of my complete confidence in a bomber offensive if this was given a real chance.  The switch over from precision to area bombing, from attack- ing key factories, or even individual sections of key factories, to attacking large industrial towns as a whole, had been made some time before I took over the Command. The decision to con- centrate on the complete destruction of four Ruhr cities, with a view to breaking German morale, was conveyed to the Command just before I took over, but attacks on whole cities and an offensive primarily against morale were under discussion in the summer of 1941, when I was in America. At least by the early summer of 1941 everyone who had anything to do with staff policy knew that the great majority of our attacks on Germany were, in fact, though not in intention, area attacks; the area concerned was, more often than not, a very large one in open country. Very little material damage could be seen in the
