attacks on Germany were, in fact, though not in intention, area attacks; the area concerned was, more often than not, a very large one in open country. Very little material damage could be seen in the photographs, taken by the photographic reconnaissance unit, but as against this the Germans were showing definite signs of agitation. The large bombs we were dropping, the 4000 pounder and a very few 8000 pounders, were obviously having some effect on morale. The principle of attacking morale was at any rate half-admitted, though proposals to concentrate exclusively on this were turned down; the idea was to keep on at small targets for their strategic importance but, to put it crudely, not to mind when we missed them, or at any rate to regard a miss as useful provided that it disturbed morale. Just before Germany invaded Russia a scheme was worked out for attacking German railways; it had become obvious that no good could be done by attacking synthetic oil plants, partly because we always missed them and partly because Germany could then get the oil she wanted from elsewhere, so the plan was to prevent the enemy from getting oil and other supplies to the places where they were wanted. The targets chosen were in congested industrial areas and were carefully picked so that bombs which overshot or undershot the actual railway centres under attack should fall on these areas, thereby affecting morale. This programme amounted to a halfway stage between  76 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  by other services and for the purpose of conducting other cam- paigns as would wholly prevent the projected expansion of the bomber force. And even if the force did expand, I was well aware that there would immediately be demands for every conceivable dispersal of effort, in almost any direction except the right one. If these demands should be answered, we should never catch up with the German repair squads; as was obviously happening at the beginning of 1942, the German war potential would increase far m
