This being the position, there was inevitably a good deal of evasiveness and contradiction when the object of an attack was described, some of this being due to the belief that if air-crew got the idea that it was permissible to bomb anywhere in a given built-up area they would soon feel it was permissible to bomb anywhere in Germany. The aiming points in a large number of towns were then chosen at the Air Ministry, and the theory was that they should be in themselves well worth destruction as well as being in such a position that damage all round them would have the maximum effect on the economic life of an industrial city. Unfortunately for this argument, though some of the aiming points might be railway stations, garrisons, or post offices, others were large open squares. In point of fact a good many of them were chosen because it was hoped that they would be easy to see, and the fact that they were often parti- cularly difficult to see does not affect the argument.
