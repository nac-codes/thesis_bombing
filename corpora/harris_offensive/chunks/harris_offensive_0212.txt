Germany had built up what seemed to be a highly artificial economy, using factories to produce raw materials synthetically at vast cost in labour in order to be self-sufficient. But the theory did not, of course, take into account the possibility of Germany overrunning Europe. Nor did it take into account the practical impossibility of hitting their factories, by day because of the German air defence, and by night because we could  78 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  area and precision bombing. This being the position, there was inevitably a good deal of evasiveness and contradiction when the object of an attack was described, some of this being due to the belief that if air-crew got the idea that it was permissible to bomb anywhere in a given built-up area they would soon feel it was permissible to bomb anywhere in Germany. The aiming points in a large number of towns were then chosen at the Air Ministry, and the theory was that they should be in themselves well worth destruction as well as being in such a position that damage all round them would have the maximum effect on the economic life of an industrial city. Unfortunately for this argument, though some of the aiming points might be railway stations, garrisons, or post offices, others were large open squares. In point of fact a good many of them were chosen because it was hoped that they would be easy to see, and the fact that they were often parti- cularly difficult to see does not affect the argument. It was also decided in 1941 that aircraft should not bring their bombs back from Germany; it had previously been the rule that this should be done if the target, or a specified alternative, could not be identified.  The idea that the main object of bombing German industrial cities was to break the enemyâ€™s morale proved to be wholly un- sound; when we had destroyed almost all the larger industrial cities in Germany the civil population remained apathetic, while the Gestapo saw to it that they were docile, and, in so far as th
