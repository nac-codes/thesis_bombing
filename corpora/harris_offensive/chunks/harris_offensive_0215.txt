Nor did it take into account the practical impossibility of hitting their factories, by day because of the German air defence, and by night because we could  8  are ine obj bel an} per ini anc des rou of son or  ag the cul dec bac sho not  citi sou citi the wat an nat firs the not dyi Ar wel tha pro effe afte star in} cou was  80  BOMBER OF  FENSIVE  not find them in the dark. Our attacks on German naval units during the “phoney” war had shown that we could not operate by day over Germany without completely prohibitive casualties for  day fighters, and we at once began to  prepare and train for  bombing at night. The immense difficulty of this task, unless some effective non-visual navigational aid is provided, is seldom appreciated. The only aids then available to the navigator, who  was then also the bomb aimer, were  his compass, map, sextant,  and direction-finder loop, together with what he could see of the ground by starlight, moonlight, or by the light of an occasional flare, which was not then shaded as flares afterwards were and so more often than not proved so dazzling that he could see better without it. It was hard enough by such means to get to the target  area,  ut if and when the aircraft  got there, the navigator had  the still more difficult task of getting a visual fix, either of the  target identi  itself or of some landmar! y and from which he could  k which he could positively make a run of a few miles by  dead reckoning to the target. This search for a visual fix almost always took half an hour or so, and sometimes lasted for more than an hour; to spend so much time in the target area was just  possib!  le when the German defences against night attack were in  their first and rudimentary stage, but it would have been fatal from 1942 onwards.
