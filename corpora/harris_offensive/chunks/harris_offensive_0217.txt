and more before then, there was enough evidence to show that the odds were enormous against hitting individual factories in Germany with the equipment the Command then had, or with any equipment it was likely to get in the near future. With the equipment then available it would be extremely lucky to hit a large town by night. This did happen occasionally; for example, some 30 aircraft bombed Stettin in September, 1941, and got 80 per cent of their bombs within two miles of the aiming point, or rather, 80 per cent of the photographs taken were plotted within two miles of the aiming point. But this was wholly exceptional, and had to be regarded as such. Night photographs taken during June and July of 1941 showed that of those aircraft reported to have attacked their target in Germany only one in four got within five miles of it, and, when the target was in the Ruhr, only one in ten. The proportion of total sorties, including those aircraft not reported as having attacked the target was, of course, much lower. The situation would have seemed hopeless if it had not been known that radar aids to navigation were in existence and would eventually be provided, if and when the necessary priorities were allotted to Bomber Command.  Night photography revised or reversed a good many views that were previously held. Lakes and rivers, previously con- sidered valuable landmarks and very popular with crews, proved most unreliable. Coastal features, and especially docks, were much more easily identifiable. Investigations showed that to identify, or to believe that one had identified, a single landmark was very seldom enough; it was only when crews claimed to have identified more than two landmarks that their claims were borne out by the night photographs. As one might have expected, photographs proved that moonlight and clear weather were indispensable to a successful attack at that time; in poor weather very few aircraft indeed got within five miles of the target.
