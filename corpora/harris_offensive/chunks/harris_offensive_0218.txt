otographs proved that moonlight and clear weather were indispensable to a successful attack at that time; in poor weather very few aircraft indeed got within five miles of the target. Coastal targets were easier to attack than inland towns, and the  B.O. F  80 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  not find them in the dark. Our attacks on German naval units during the “phoney” war had shown that we could not operate by day over Germany without completely prohibitive casualties for day fighters, and we at once began to prepare and train for bombing at night. The immense difficulty of this task, unless some effective non-visual navigational .aid is provided, is seldom appreciated. The only aids then available to the navigator, who was then also the bomb aimer, were his compass, map, sextant, and direction-finder loop, together with what he could see of the ground by starlight, moonlight, or by the light of an occasional flare, which was not then shaded as flares afterwards were and so more often than not proved so dazzling that he could see better without it. It was hard enough by such means to get to the target area, but if and when the aircraft got there, the navigator had the still more difficult task of getting a visual fix, either of the target itself or of some landmark which he could positively identify and from which he could make a run of a few miles by dead reckoning to the target. This search for a visual fix almost always took half an hour or so, and sometimes lasted for more than an hour; to spend so much time in the target area was just possible when the German defences against night attack were in their first and rudimentary stage, but it would have been fatal from 1942 onwards,  These difficulties were fully understood, though it was hoped by a period of intensive training, during and after the period of the “ phoney war,” to overcome them. What was not understood was how often a crew genuinely thought they had found the target when they had bombed miles away from it. Whe
