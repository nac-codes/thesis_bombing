If the bombs used in the early stages of the war had found their target, they would have done it very little harm. High explosive bombs were invariably too small, and of the wrong kind; the standard 250 Ib. general purpose bomb, as it was called, was a ridiculous missile. High capacity bombs, blast bombs, were hardly considered, although these have the advantage of bringing down a large number of buildings in proportion to their weight and at the same time of causing few casualties, provided the population is in shelters. When the Germans used them, and they were a long way ahead of us in this, it was supposed to show their unmilitary mania for indiscriminate terrorism; it was considered that the really sound thing to do was to drop bombs which consisted almost entirely of metal, fragments of which would do great destruction among factory machinery. By 1941 the R.A.F. had the 4o00o-Ib. high capacity blast bomb. This was designed as a direct result of observing what the Germans did with their blast bombs in this country. For some reason the enemyâ€™s high capacity bombs were called land mines, perhaps because, like our airborne sea mines, they were fitted with para- chutes instead of tails. The first of our high capacity bombs was, in fact, a modified sea mine, also equipped with a parachute. It was carried in a Hampden, the aircraft then mainly used for sea mining, and there would have been no room for the huge tail that would have had to be given to this 2000-lb. bomb. A most ingenious device enabled the 4000-Ib. bomb to be aimed without the huge tail that
