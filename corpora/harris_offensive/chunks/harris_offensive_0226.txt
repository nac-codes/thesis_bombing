losive bombs there is an irresistible temptation for the fireman to keep his head down. The Germans again and again missed their chance, as they did in the London blitz that I watched from the roof of the Air Ministry, of setting our cities ablaze by a con- centrated attack. Coventry was adequately concentrated in point of space, but all the same there was little concentration in point of time, and nothing comparable to the fire tornadoes of Hamburg and Dresden ever occurred in this country. But they did do us enough damage to teach us the principle of concentration, the principle of starting so many fires at the same time that no fire fighting services, however efficiently and quickly they were reinforced by the fire brigades of other towns, could get them under control.  The principle of concentration in time and space would have been forced upon us in any case by the growing strength of the German defence. It may seem surprising, in view of the weakness of our bomber force in numbers and equipment, that the Germans should have reinforced their defences in 1941, but they were looking ahead. Moreover German strength and war production was still increasing and there was so much to spare that ample provision, as the enemy thought, could be made for the defence without robbing the armies who were taking the offensive. It was not till the following year that there was any need to take any of the German army’s fighters and bombers for the defence of Germany.  With the occupation of France and the Low Countries the Germans were able to build up a formidable system of defence. They set up an early warning system along the coast, as well as on the coast of Denmark, together with a belt of stations for the control of fighters from the ground through Denmark and  82 BON  Ruhr was a quite impos over the whole area anc  If the bombs used i their target, they wou explosive bombs were kind; the standard 250 was a ridiculous missile hardly considered, alth« down a large number c
