this belt in a continuous stream, with the fighters only able to concentrate on one or two of them, rather than to g0 through it at long intervals and be picked off one by one, The same principle of saturating the defences applied to anti-aircraft guns and to the searchlights operating in conjunction with them,  A few ground control stations were probably working at the  beginning of 1941, but by  the end of the year they had become  numerous and efficient, and bomber casualties were rising fast. The difficulty was to bring about any real concentration. “Gee” the first radar aid to navigation, was the real answer, but even  before we had the Gee equi on a bright, clear night,  pment in any quantity it was possible, to plan the route and the attack so  thoroughly that the bomber stream became compact. At first  even the minute figure, asi over the target and along seldom achieved; for one t t  s  with much else from the idea of searching first for t alternative target, and, if  ance towards the end of  t seemed later, of 100 aircraft an hour, the route, was only an idea, and very hing, captains of aircraft were so used  peing told to search for their exact target or aiming point until they found it, that it seemed contradictory to order them tobomb and leave the target area ata particular moment, Along  past it was necessary to abandon the he primary target, then for a specified this could not be found, for a self-  evident military objective; military objectives were not apt to be self-evident, but that was the term, usually contracted into “Semo,” that was often and solemnly used, Quick as well as definite identification of the tanget became of increasing import-  Ig41, and at that time most of the  methods we afterwards used were under discussion, the training,  for example, of special squadrons to find the target, the use of  BOMBER COMMAND 85  marker bombs with a distinctive colour to be dropped on the target, at the beginning of the attack, and so forth.
