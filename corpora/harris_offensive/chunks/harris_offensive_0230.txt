would have taken Bomber Command longer to learn how to attack Germany if it had not been for the lessons of the German attack on Britain. We learned as much from their few successes as from their failures, from what they did as from what they did not do. The blitz was another instance of the German capacity for making every possible big mistake and no small ones. After the almost incredible folly they showed in the Battle of Britain they at last saw the hopelessness of facing up to our fighters in daylight and said, “Well, we will do what the British do and bomb by night.” This was the final disastrous mistake they made in the air campaign against Britain, and they never recovered from it. Had they known anything about the exercise of air power—and they certainly knew very little—they would have known that night bombing requires not only a vast amount of  84 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  Holland and down the Western frontier of Germany. Each ground station controlled one fighter within a rather small “box,” and the belt consisted of a whole succession of these boxes touching each other. When the coastal radar stations gave warning, the fighter in each box was ready to intercept any single bomber coming into its box. If a bomber force was scattered, many single aircraft would naturally be entering a large number of boxes at any given time. But if it could be arranged that many bombers passed through one box at the same time, the fighter in that box would only have time to attempt the interception of one of them. A continuous searchlight belt covering the Ruhr made it easier for fighters to intercept the bombers passing through it, and here again it would be better for the bombers to get through this belt in a continuous stream, with the fighters only able to concentrate on one or two of them, rather than to go through it at long intervals and be picked off one by one. The same principle of saturating the defences applied to anti-aircraft guns and to the searchlights operating i
