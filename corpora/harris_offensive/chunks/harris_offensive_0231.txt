wo of them, rather than to go through it at long intervals and be picked off one by one. The same principle of saturating the defences applied to anti-aircraft guns and to the searchlights operating in conjunction with them.  A few ground control stations were probably working at the beginning of 1941, but by the end of the year they had become numerous and efficient, and bomber casualties were rising fast. The difficulty was to bring about any real concentration. “Gee” the first radar aid to navigation, was the real answer, but even before we had the Gee equipment in any quantity it was possible, on a bright, clear night, to plan the route and the attack so thoroughly that the bomber stream became compact. At first even the minute figure, as it seemed later, of 100 aircraft an hour, over the target and along the route, was only an idea, and very seldom achieved; for one thing, captains of aircraft were so used to being told to search for their exact target or aiming point until they found it, that it seemed contradictory to order them to bomb and leave the target area at a particular moment. Along with much else from the past it was necessary to abandon the idea of searching first for the primary target, then for a specified alternative target, and, if this could not be found, for a self- evident military objective; military objectives were not apt to be self-evident, but that was the term, usually contracted into “Semo,” that was often and solemnly used. Quick as well as definite identification of the target became of increasing import- ance towards the end of 1941, and at that time most of the methods we afterwards used were under discussion, the training, for example, of special squadrons to find the target, the use of  BOMBER COMMAND 85  marker bombs with a distinctive colour to be dropped on the target, at the beginning of the attack, and so forth. Whether or no to begin an attack with fire-raising aircraft was much debated. It had been a widely accepted belie
