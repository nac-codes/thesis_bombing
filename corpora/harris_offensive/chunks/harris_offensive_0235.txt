On the day after this attack production in all the war factories of the town was one-third of what it had been before. Some damage had been done to the factories themselves, but it was very slight compared with non-industrial damage. The loss of production was almost entirely due to the interruption of public utilities, the dislocation of transport, and absenteeism caused by the destruction, of houses, and many other causes. There was very heavy damage, for example, to sewers, water supply pipes, electric cables, gas pipes and so forth, and this had an immediate effect on production. Output was back to normal again in about two months, but there were special circumstances which led us to believe that production would not recover so quickly in Germany as in England. War industries in Britain were not fully expanded at the time of the German attacks on us, and there was therefore much labour to spare for the work of repair. A large army was also standing idle in Britain, with nothing to do except to train for a second front which then seemed infinitely remote; many hundreds
