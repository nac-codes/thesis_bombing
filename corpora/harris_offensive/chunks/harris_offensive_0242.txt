rs.  After the extent of devastation in a number of towns had been compared with the loss of output in these towns over a period of months, a definite correlation was found between acreage of concentrated devastation and loss of man hours; the one was a function of the other. Scattered damage, produced over a long period, had, as one might expect, less effect on production than concentrated damage and the relation between the two was more difficult to estimate. It was also found that production took longer to recover after a second successful attack on a town than after a first. On the whole, output which had been cut down as a result of industrial damage was less quickly restored than output which had been cut down as a result of non-industrial damage, but on the other hand non-industrial damage always caused greater loss of output than industrial damage in the first weeks after an attack. What could not be fully appreciated from any survey of air raid damage in Britain was the cumulative effect on industry of its extensive destruction in a large number of towns; this was the point at which the comparison broke down between the small scale German bombing and the much heavier attacks that Bomber Command proposed eventually to deliver.
