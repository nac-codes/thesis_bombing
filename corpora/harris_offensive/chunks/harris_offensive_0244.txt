ef in the field but by the Ministries, by the Chiefs of Staff Committee, and by the War Cabinet. The decision to build a great force of bombers for strategic attack on industries and communications was made long before the war; the prototype of four-engines bombers we used against Germany was designed in 1935, which gives some idea of how long it takes to organise a bomber force. The decision to attack large industrial areas instead of key factories was made before I became Commander-in-Chief. But whenever anyone wishes to blackguard me, as the Economist and the Daily Worker have done (a compliment from such sources), they accuse me of being not only the executor of the bombing policy but also its author. The idea is that when I went to Bomber Command I said, “Let there be thousands of bombers and let there be tens of thousands of crews and let there be all their ancillary equip- ment and the personnel enlisted and the aerodromes made.” Whereupon, rather as in the first chapter of Genesis, I obtained all these things by sheer force of blarney in the space of a few months. What actually happened was that by the end of 1942, the first year of my Command, I had as few aircraft as when I took over.  of my taking over the Command the force was able to seize the Opportunity to bomb two key factories, one in France and the other in Germany, with a large measure of success, Moreover, now that the Americans were in the war with us, their bombers, operating by day, would be able to attack just those factories in Open country or on the outskirts of towns which we could not as yet hope to attack by night in normal circumstances. The American campaign and that of our bombers would be exactly complementary, but all the facts at our disposal showed that it would not be sufficient, even if by any chance it became possible, to attack only the key factories. When the’Americans came to bomb Japan in force, although they had begun the war as one hundred per cent advocates of “ precisio
