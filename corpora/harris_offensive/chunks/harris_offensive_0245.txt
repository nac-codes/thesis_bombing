n if by any chance it became possible, to attack only the key factories. When the’Americans came to bomb Japan in force, although they had begun the war as one hundred per cent advocates of “ precision” bombing, they also discovered that it was necessary to carry out area attacks, There is a widespread impression, which has often got.into print, that I not only invented the policy of area bombing but also insisted on carrying it out in the face of the natural relucte  were going in 19, object of bombing military objectives the Germans, as so military objectives And in this they h: however little fore undefended countr The Germans strategic possibilit only too well plac Coventry, which s proposed to make “Coventrated” if hundred acres in th was a large and in inhabitants engag  88 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  of devastation in a town would cause more than ten times the loss of output resulting from the destruction of one hundred acres, but also that when a large number of towns was similarly devastated the total loss of output could not be estimated merely by adding together the various acreages of devastation in all the towns. It was obvious if air attack was continued a time would come when factories in an undamaged town would stand idle for want of materials that should have been supplied by the factories of a damaged town.  As a matter of strict calculation it was therefore obvious that the policy of destroying industrial cities, and the factories in them, was not merely the only possible one for Bomber Command at that time; it was also the best way of destroying Germany’s capacity to produce war material. The morale of the enemy under bombing could be taken as an imponderable factor. Just possibly a break in morale might lead to the collapse of the enemy, and more probably bad morale would add to the loss of production resulting directly from air raid damage, but it was not necessary to take these possibilities into account; bombing, there was every reason to suppose, woul
