morale would add to the loss of production resulting directly from air raid damage, but it was not necessary to take these possibilities into account; bombing, there was every reason to suppose, would cripple the enemy’s war industries if it was carried out for long enough and with sufficient weight. There was no reason, of course, to confine our bombing exclusively to the large industrial cities; if this should at any time be possible it would be of great advantage to attack key-point factories out- side the cities as well. And in point of fact within a month or two of my taking over the Command the force was able to seize the opportunity to bomb two key factories, one in France and the other in Germany, with a large measure of success. Moreover, now that the Americans were in the war with us, their bombers, operating by day, would be able to attack just those factories in open country or on the outskirts of towns which we could not as yet hope to attack by night in normal circumstances. The American campaign and that of our bombers would be exactly complementary, but all the facts at our disposal showed that it would not be sufficient, even if by any chance it became possible, to attack only the key factories. When the Americans came to bomb Japan in force, although they had begun the war as one hundred per cent advocates of “ precision” bombing, they also discovered that it was necessary to carry out area attacks.  There is a widespread impression, which has often got into print, that I not only invented the policy of area bombing but also insisted on carrying it out in the face of the natural reluct-  BOMBER COMMAND 89  ance to kill women and children that was felt by everyone else. The facts are otherwise. Such decisions of policy are not in any case made by Commanders-in-Chief in the field but by the Ministries, by the Chiefs of Staff Committee, and by the War Cabinet.
