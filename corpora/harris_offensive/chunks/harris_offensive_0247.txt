nders-in-Chief in the field but by the Ministries, by the Chiefs of Staff Committee, and by the War Cabinet. The decision to build a great force of bombers for strategic attack on industries and communications was made long before the war; the prototype of four-engines bombers we used against Germany was designed in 1935, which gives some idea of how long it takes to organise a bomber force. The decision to attack large industrial areas instead of key factories was made before I became Commander-in-Chief. But whenever anyone wishes to blackguard me, as the Economist and the Daily Worker have done (a compliment from such sources), they accuse me of being not only the executor of the bombing policy but also its author. The idea is that when I went to Bomber Command I said, “Let there be thousands of bombers and let there be tens of thousands of crews and let there be all their ancillary equip- ment and the personnel enlisted and the aerodromes made.” Whereupon, rather as in the first chapter of Genesis, I obtained all these things by sheer force of blarney in the space of a few months. What actually happened was that by the end of 1942, the first year of my Command, I had as few aircraft as when I took over.  88 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  of devastation in a town would cause more than ten times the loss of output resulting from the destruction of one hundred acres, but also that when a large number of towns was similarly devastated the total loss of output could not be estimated merely by adding together the various acreages of devastation in all the towns. It was obvious if air attack was continued a time would come when factories in an undamaged town would stand idle for want of materials that should have been supplied by the factories of a damaged town. ‘  As a matter of strict calculation it was therefore obvious that the policy of destroying industrial cities, and the factories in them, was not merely the only possible one for Bomber Command at that time; it was also the
