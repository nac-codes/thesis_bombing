There is a widespread impression, which has often got into print, that I not only invented the policy of area bombing but also insisted on carrying it out in the face of the natural reluct-  ‘echnlgltugtsdm  sulla  Daina eek id  FA Sonya h  leap  il im  at  asa  i nye gel at ac,  ia anal  THE PRELIMINARY PHASE gI  ‘jority in the use of brains was at least as important tiority in production. The principle of Gee is simple © stations, a master and a slave station, simultane- it a radar pulse signal. The Gee apparatus in the ures the difference between the times at which the ‘re received, and so indicates the difference between distance from one station and its distance from the shows the navigator that the aircraft is somewhere ine, and this line is marked on a chart prepared for Gee apparatus. But the same master station and a tation—there are three stations in all—also transmit of synchronised signals, from which, by the Gee e navigator can place aircraft on a second line on ie actual position of the aircraft is therefore at the ‘section of the two lines. illy this should have made the navigator independent f the ground, and navigation by night less dependent er than it had been before. If the apparatus worked was expected to do, it looked as if it would be un- carry out that long search for landmarks in the od of the target which was not only extremely nd not only almost impossible at any reasonable eight, but also tended to prevent any effective con- attack. And unlike the various radio—not radar— ‘eams which had been in use before the Command r aid to navigation, the Gee stations could give a ize any required number of fixes. en decided in 1941 to equip every aircraft in the th the Gee apparatus as soon as it could be got into on. In June, 1941, a few experimental sorties by iped with Gee had been made over enemy territory, en ruled that no more such sorties should be made ald be
