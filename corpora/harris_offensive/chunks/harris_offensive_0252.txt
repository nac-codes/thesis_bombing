er pair of synchronised signals, from which, by the Gee apparatus, the navigator can place aircraft on a second line on his chart. The actual position of the aircraft is therefore at the point of intersection of the two lines.  Theoretically this should have made the navigator independent of any sight of the ground, and navigation by night less dependent on the weather than it had been before. If the apparatus worked as well as it was expected to do, it looked as if it would be un- necessary to carry out that long search for landmarks in the neighbourhood of the target which was not only extremely dangerous, and not only almost impossible at any reasonable operational height, but also tended to prevent any effective con- centration of attack. And unlike the various radio—not radar— devices and beams which had been in use before the Command had any radar aid to navigation, the Gee stations could give a force of any size any required number of fixes.  It had been decided in 1941 to equip every aircraft in the Command with the Gee apparatus as soon as it could be got into full production. In June, 1941, a few experimental sorties by aircraft equipped with Gee had been made over enemy territory, but it was then ruled that no more such sorties should be made until Gee could be used on a larger scale; this was because it was essential that the apparatus should not fall into enemy hands or the fact of its proposed use be otherwise disclosed. For it was a serious drawback to Gee that, as we knew, the enemy would be able to jam the transmissions of the ground stations when he discovered them. It was taken for granted that this would eventu- ally happen and from the first the system was given, as a working hypothesis, an operational life of anything up to five months. As an extra precaution, in the hope that the enemy would attribute the increased accuracy of our attacks to the use of a radio beam,  THE PRELIMINARY PHASE gt 93  measures; priority in the use of brains was at l
