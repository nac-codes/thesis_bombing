After the enemy had begun jamming Gee the Command would have to use one of the other radar aids to navigation which were in course of development some time before the operational use of Gee; in point of fact there was a long gap, which might have been very serious, between the jamming of Gee and the introduc- tion of the later radar aids.  Another limitation of Gee was that it would only work efficiently within a range of 350-400 miles. This limitation was considered so serious that there was at first considerable reluctance on this account alone, to equip the force with Gee. But a range of 350 miles meant that Gee fixes could be got in the Ruhr area, and, by using Gee up to the limit of its range aircraft, could be flown to more distant targets with greater accuracy than before.  But the real question was, not whether Gee would or would not be very useful
