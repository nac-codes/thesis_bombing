r Staff was ulti- mately aiming. Many thought it a fanciful figure, the main objection being that we should never get the training establish- ment, the maintenance personnel, or the aerodromes to run such a force. It was also objected that England was far too small an island on which to base such a force. It must, of course, be remembered that if we had had no allies and the bomber offen- sive had been our only method of attacking the enemy, we should have had to get the men for the force at all costs and the other services would have had to give them up. As to England being too small, the Americans based great numbers on far smaller islands in the Pacific, and, in point of fact, something like 4ooo heavies, when the U.S.A.A.F. bombers were added to Bomber Command, did eventually operate from England in the later stages of the war. However, we now had Russia and America for allies, and the prospect of an all-out bomber offensive was receding and an eventual invasion of Europe becoming more and more feasible. The target figure of 4000 heavies was therefore allowed to drop.  Just before I took over command, two exercises in the use of Gee were held, one over the Isle of Man and the other over North Wales. These were not carried out in cloudy weather and were therefore no real test of the value of Gee for blind bombing. The idea was to discover how a small number of Gee-equipped aircraft —and it looked as if only a small number would be available for some time to come—could best lead the main force, unequipped with Gee, to the target. The Isle of Man was chosen for the first exercise because the accuracy of Gee in relation to the ground stations was about the same in that area as it was expected to be over the Ruhr. Twelve aircraft equipped with the Gee apparatus were to arrive at a given time and each of them was to drop a single flare over the aiming point. Then they had to orbit the aiming point, make a second run up to it, and after the crews had made every effort
