nd H2S, came along, to concentrate on he visual identification of targets. We had to accept always fully recognised in 1941, that visual identifica-  94 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  This exercise, which was called Crackers, went wrong because of a fault in one of the ground stations, as a result of which the flares were laid in two groups som√© miles apart. It was held on the night of February 13-14th, 1942, and a few days later a second exercise, Crackers II, was held, on the night of February 19-20th, with the railway station at Brynkir, North Wales, serving as target. Even with the flares serving the double purpose of lighting up the target as well as attracting the main force to the area, and only the second of these two functions would have been performed by the flares in a blind-bombing attack through ten-tenths cloud, photographs taken at the time of the exercise suggested that if bombs had been dropped most of them would have fallen within a radius of two to three miles of the target. There was no cloud, but some haze, and in these conditions, which were rather better than could be expected in the Ruhr, the flares proved so dazzling that it was difficult to see the ground. Thus from the beginning there was some reasom to suspect that bombing by Gee might prove nothing like as accurate as the theoretical calculations of the Air Ministry had predicted it would be, especially as much less accuracy could be expected over a heavily defended area in enemy country than during an exercise in Great Britain.  I laid on an attack on Essen at the earliest opportunity, which was on the night of March 8-9th. Essen was the first on my list of Ruhr towns, as it was the largest city in that area and in- dustrially the most important. Two hundred and eleven aircraft were dispatched, 74 of them being equipped with Gee. The weather was good, though there was, of course, the usual in- dustrial haze which never disappeared until Bomber Command had put out of action Krupps and a number of oth
