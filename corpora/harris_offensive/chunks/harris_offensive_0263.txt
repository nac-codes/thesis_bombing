on Krupps itself. But clearly the fault was not entirely that of the Gee apparatus, for in the interval successful attacks had been made on other towns by the use of Gee. None of the targets we attacked successfully was, however, in the Ruhr, and the obvious conclusion was that our attacks on this area failed because of its special characteristics, first, the invariable smoke and haze, and secondly the absence of any good landmarks. In the Rubr it was extremely easy to mistake one town for another and this was often done; on the night of March g-10th, 1942, Bomber Command attacked Hamborn by mistake for Essen. There was also the fact that the enemy used many decoy fires with good effect in this area. During March of 1942 a serious proportion of the whole bomb-load fell on decoy fires lighted at Rheinburg, about 20 miles from Essen. The large incendiary bombs dropped as a beacon on the night of March 1o-11th did not provide the distinctive mark that had been hoped for, and though our flares were satisfactory when the weather was perfectly clear, their light was invariably scattered by haze; the crews said that the effect was so dazzling in the Ruhr that it was almost easier to see without them. 5 . Clearly Gee was quite inadequate as an instrument for blind- bombing; our attacks succeeded when the target could be identified visually after Gee had brought the aircraft into its neighbourhood; they failed when visual identification was impossible or very difficult, as it was now clear that it always would be in the Ruhr. So for the time being the only thing to do was to get all the good we could out of Gee, but, until the new aids to navigation, Oboe and Ha2s, came along, to concentrate on improving the visual identification of targets. We had to accept the fact, not always fully recognised in 1941, that visual identifica-  94 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  This exercise, which was called Crackers, wen of a fault in one of the ground stations, as a res flares were laid in two group
