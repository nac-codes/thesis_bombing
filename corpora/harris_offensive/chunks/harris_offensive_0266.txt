possible to give the two pilots an equal amount of training unless the whole crew went through double the number of flights, circuits, and landings they needed, and the result was that neither pilot was trained to the standard that was rapidly becoming necessary, the standard required for the heavy bombers. So the second pilot was left out of the crew, and the air-bomber put in his place. At this time all night bombers carried front guns, so the air-bomber was trained to man the front guns, and he was also given a small amount of training as pilot, so that he could at a pinch take over the controls. Another change was also made at the same time; only one man was from then on trained both as wireless-operator and air-gunner; the fifth member of the crew was trained as a full-time gunner. The O.T.U.s then settled down to a five-monthsâ€™ course involving 80 flying hours, and maintained this standard until the end of the war; there were times when it looked as if we should have to reduce the length of the course, but in the end we got through without lowering the standard of training. It would, of course, have been easy at  B.O. G  96 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  tion of targets was impossible except in moonlight and clear weather, and this meant that we had for the time being to accept a high casualty rate from fighter and flak. And we had to accept the fact that the Ruhr was for the time being impregnable, because in this area industrial haze made visual identification almost impossible.  The advantages to be got from Gee, at any rate as soon as the whole force was equipped with it, was very great. Con- centration along the route, as a protection against night fighters, and over the target, as a protection against flak and fighters and as a method of increasing the damage, demanded accurate track and time-keeping, and Gee was indispensable for this. With such a concentration, large numbers of bombers had to be landed at the same time, and here again this could not have been done
