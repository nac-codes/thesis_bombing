d not haye been done without Gee, which increased in accuracy as the aircraft got nearer home so that a large force could be marshalled with great pre- cision over England. Hitherto the last lap had been one of the most dangerous parts of an operation, for many aircraft would be damaged, the crews would be tired, and landing by night was always perilous. With Gee most of these dangers were removed. Whereas in 1940 and 1941 it often happened that more aircraft and crews were lost by crashing in England on the return flight than over Germany, in 1942 Gee progressively reduced this wastage until it became almost insignificant. When it is remem- bered that the Germans had to give up the night bombing of England mainly because they lost so many aircraft and crews in crashes on returning to base, the immense advantage we derived from the use of Gee will be understood.  My first step was to ask for two things, a marker bomb or target indicator, and the introduction of a new member of a bomber’s aircrew, a bomb-aimer or air-bomber whose job would be to relieve the navigator of the task of identifying the target visually. The use of a target indicator bomb was obviously necessary; the leading aircraft had to be able to draw the rest of the force to the aiming point by marking it with some sort of firework or coloured light which could easily be distinguished. Fires were no good, because they could not be distinguished from the enemy’s decoys; moreover aircraft which had got into difficulties could not be prevented from jettisoning their in- cendiaries at some point along the route, and it was always possible for these to be mistaken for the beacon fires of the leading aircraft.
