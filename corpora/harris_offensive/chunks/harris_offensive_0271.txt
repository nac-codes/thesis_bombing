conditions the instructors and instructional titty ews ran almost as much risk as the fighting crews, and they ‘wily mn these risks over a much longer period than that of an opera- ‘mi onal tour. It was and is a matter of great distress to me that «lh; Cognition of their work and of the risks they ran was refused.  ‘tii In preparation for the expansion of the Command the O.T.U.s tid the heavy conversion units—these were the units which ained crews to operate heavy bombers—did magnificent work ikxwing 1942. During the whole of that-year the Command and .¢ O.T.U.s and conversion units struggled to raise new squad- ms, complete with crews. But as far as the offensive against ata ermany was concerned, the greater part of all this work might well not have been done.
