r to raise and itu ain every bomber crew for the whole of the Royal Air Force nl over the world. In these circumstances, when one Command hic supplying the cloth for another Command to cut its coat out \ the coat cut is naturally of generous, and even luxurious tm-oportions. This supply of crews to overseas was an additional atirain on top of the supply of 13 complete squadrons in 1942, inlid it could only be done by keeping the crew-strength of our  ‘en. There were times when we sent as many as 50 trained ‘ellington crews a month overseas, mainly to the Mediterranean ‘itty lied Air Forces, and this was in addition to some trained to sty alifax crews. At first the demand was met entirely by posting \ily ews from any O.T.U., or even by taking them from operational  98 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  any time to improve the standard of training at the expense of the front line. The length of the course could have been increased, all the best air-crew could have been taken off operations at an early stage in their career and sent back to the O.T.U.s to serve as instructors, and new equipment could have been allocated to the O.T.U.s before the operational squadrons got it so that the new crews could all have been fully trained in the new devices. But this would have had a profound effect on our front-line strength and would therefore have lengthened the war. A balance had to be struck, and I am convinced that it was the right one. As it was, we had to reject some crews who learnt slowly because there was simply not time to persevere with training them, although if there had been time they might well have made good crews in the end. But it was in this, and not in any falling-off in the standard of training of the average crew, that the pressure of events showed itself. ;  I ought perhaps to explain that the training at O.T.U.s only comes right at the end of a long period of flying training for each individual; the training we gave in Bomber Command was for the crew as a whole; it was
