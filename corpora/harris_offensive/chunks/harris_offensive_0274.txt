onger period than that of an opera- tional tour. It was and is a matter of great distress to me that recognition of their work and of the risks they ran was refused. In preparation for the expansion of the Command the O.T.U.s and the heavy conversion units—these were the units which trained crews to operate heavy bombers—did magnificent work during 1942. During the whole of that-year the Command and the O.T.U.s and conversion units struggled to raise new squad- rons, complete with crews. But as far as the offensive against Germany was concerned, the greater part of all this work might as well not have been done. As fast as each squadron was raised, it was transferred, not to the front-line strength of Bomber Command, but to the Middle East or to other Commands not concerned with the offensive against Germany. In all, 19 new squadrons were formed in the Command during 1942, and 13 of these were taken from us. And of the new squadrons that were left to us, three were on more or less permanent loan to Coastal Command and engaged in anti-submarine patrols. From May, 1942, to the end of February, 1943, additional aircraft lent to Coastal Command made 1000 sorties while engaged in this work. At the same time the crews in the squadrons we succeeded in keeping were never, until May, 1943, at more than 80 per cent of the proper strength. This was due to the inordinate demands for crews overseas, and especially for the Middle East, where large numbers were misemployed in a very extravagant way. Few people realise that amongst all its other duties Bomber Command had until well towards the end of the war to raise and train every bomber crew for the whole of the Royal Air Force all over the world. In these circumstances, when one Command is supplying the cloth for another Command to cut its coat out of, the coat cut is naturally of generous, and even luxurious proportions. This supply of crews to overseas was an additional strain on top of the supply of 13 complete squadrons in
