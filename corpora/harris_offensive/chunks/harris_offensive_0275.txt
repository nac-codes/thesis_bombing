This supply of crews to overseas was an additional strain on top of the supply of 13 complete squadrons in 1942, and it could only be done by keeping the crew-strength of our own squadrons at twenty per cent below what it should have been. There were times when we sent as many as 50 trained Wellington crews a month overseas, mainly to the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, and this was in addition to some trained Halifax crews. At first the demand was met entirely by posting crews from any O.T.U., or even by taking them from operational  98 any time to imprc the front line.

It woul  obviously have been  a good idea to have these crews trained by instructors with operational experience overseas, We repeatedly asked for crews Who had had this experience to be sent home from the Middle East, but for a long time we could not get them.
