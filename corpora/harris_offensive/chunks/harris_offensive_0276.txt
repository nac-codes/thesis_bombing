No proper record of the whereabouts of air-crews trained in Bomber Command 0.T.U.s was kept by the Air Ministry and ho arrangement was made to ensure that these indispensable men were properly employed. In the Middle East and elsewhere there Was at times a great surplus of air-crew, amounting to hundreds of men, which we had trained in Bomber Command O.T.U.s; they were either kept in idleness or misemployed in one fashion or another, at a time when the 0.T.U.s themselves were short of  several hundred air-crew and instructor  jlots.
