ts of air-crews trained in Bomber Command O.T.U.s was kept by the Air Ministry and no arrangement was made to ensure that these indispensable men were properly employed. In the Middle East and elsewhere there was at times a great surplus of air-crew, amounting to hundreds of men, which we had trained in Bomber Command O.F,U.s3 they were either kept in idleness or misemployed in one fashion or another, at a time when the O.T.U.s themselves were short of several hundred air-crew and instructor pilots. We made great efforts to get this put right, and in this we were supported by the Inspector-General, Air Chief Marshal Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt; eventually we got some of them back. In the end the obvious solution of the whole problem was adopted and Wellington O.T.U.s were formed in Palestine and elsewhere in the Middle East. The demands from overseas and Coastal Command were the main reason why Bomber Command failed to expand during 1943. Another hindrance to beginning the offensive at once was that the Command itself was in process of converting from medium two-engined to heavy four-engined bombers throughout the year. This, of course, was indispensable. As I have said else- where, the original decision to equip the R.A.F.’s bomber force with four-engined bombers of the type we eventually had was taken long ago, and the first specifications were drawn up in 1935, but the wisdom of this decision was frequently discussed at a later date. We had in England those who took the same view as the leaders of the German air force, that bombers should be light and rely on their speed and manceuvrability to evade the enemy’s air defence. The Mosquito, was, in fact, the direct out- come of this controversy between supporters of the light and supporters of the heavy bomber; when rearmament was being planned there seemed to be no reason why we should not have the best of both worlds and add something like a thousand or so light bombers to the four thousand heavies, Unlike the Germans
