Besides the time lost in converting to heavy bombers in 1942 our expansion was limited, especially in the first half of that year, by trouble with our airfields. The need for runways of adequate length for heavy bombers was not understood, except by, those who knew something about heavy bombers and had seen and handled them.  As early as October, 1941, the Air Ministry had agreed to allow airfields of the size that became normal towards the end of the war, but it was more than a year before this policy was  102 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  introduce crews to the new aircraft, no longer a process than ae a crew from Whitleys to Wellingtons.
