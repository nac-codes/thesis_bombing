ot only were there fewer accidents with this than with other types; throughout the war the casualty rate of Lancasters was also consistently below that of other types. It is true that in 1944 the wastage of Lancasters from casualties became equal to, and at times even greater than, the wastage of Halifaxes, but this was the exception that proved the rule; at that time I invariably used Lancasters alone for those attacks which involved the deepest penetration into Germany and were consequently the most dangerous.  The Lancaster was so far the best aircraft we had that I con- tinually pressed for its production at the expense of other types; I was even willing to lose nearly a yearâ€™s industrial production fromthe Halifax factories while these were being converted to produce Lancasters. I did not get my way in this, but by other means we succeeded in the later stages of the offensive in re- equipping many Halifax squadrons with Lancasters. The superiority of the Lancaster also had its effect on our policy in training and the conversion of crews to heavy bombers. I wanted all the Lancasters I could get in the front line, and this meant we had to use Halifaxes and Stirlings for the greater part of the training in the heavy conversion units, with only a brief course at a Lancaster finishing school, as it was called, at the end; in this way large numbers of Lancasters were saved for operations, though at the expense, which was well worth while, of some increase in the time taken to train Lancaster crews.  Besides the time lost in converting to heavy bombers in 1942 our expansion was limited, especially in the first half of that year, by trouble with our airfields. The need for runways of adequate length for heavy bombers was not understood, except by, those who knew something about heavy bombers and had seen and handled them.  As early as October, 1941, the Air Ministry had agreed to allow airfields of the size that became normal towards the end of the war, but it was more
