was capable. There were two occasions during the later offensive  106 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  when the losses were for a considerable period more than 5 per cent of the total operational sorties of the Command, and on each occasion expansion was extremely small, while operational intensity was comparatively low—if it had not been, the Com- mand would have contracted instead of expanding. At the height of the offensive we were getting not much more than 200 aircraft a month from production, and it was only by unremitting effort and ingenuity that we kept our monthly casualty rate below that figure. We were working throughout the war with an extremely small margin for error and unless this is clearly realised it will be impossible to understand the nature of the prolonged battle we had to fight.  At times, as the offensive continued, I found impinging upon my consciousness, the fact that whereas in England both the public and the politicians expected our fighter and anti-aircraft defences, infinitesimally small by comparison with what the Germans had, to put a stop to the blitzes—which they and the Germans themselves did within a few months—both the public and the Government were equally convinced that Bomber Com- mand ought not at any time to incur any really serious casualties. Though Bomber Command had on the average four or five times as far to fly over enemy territory as the Germans had to fly over England, and though this enemy territory had vastly better anti- aircraft defences than any part of England in 1940-1941, we were expected to get on with our job with ever-increasing success, at ever-increasing tempo, regardless of the weather, and if we ever suffered losses in any way comparable with those of the enemy there was immediate indignation and surprise. I naturally find these two attitudes of mind, the attitude to the enemy and the attitude to ourselves, not only quite incompatible but also quite incomprehensible. The two attitudes were nevertheless to be found i
