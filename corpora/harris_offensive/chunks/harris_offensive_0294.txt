ind these two attitudes of mind, the attitude to the enemy and the attitude to ourselves, not only quite incompatible but also quite incomprehensible. The two attitudes were nevertheless to be found in the minds alike of the highest and lowest of the land. Though the Prime Minister would vehemently complain (but invariably in a highly encouraging and heartening manner) if our defences seemed to be getting somewhat meagre results or building up rather slowly, yet he would at the same time be the first to express distress if our own casualties, the casualties we incurred on the offensive, were occasionally above the averageâ€” and if they had not sometimes been above the average we could not even have begun to strike an average. But I want to make it quite clear that I was never pressed by Mr. Churchill to do any- thing at his dictation, or anything with which I was not person-  THE PRELIMINARY PHASE 107  ally satisfied.

As a matter of fact, that was precisely what we always had to do, to fight the weather as well as the enemy.
