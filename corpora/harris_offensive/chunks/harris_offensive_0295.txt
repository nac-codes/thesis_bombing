ostock, a rather more important target than Liibeck and at greater distance from base, but still in no sense a major industrial city; once again it was clearly proved that we had the force and equipment to tackle secondary targets, however completely we failed against major targets like the cities of the Ruhr. Rostock was another Baltic port, of some importance, and it had a large Heinkel aircraft factory on the outskirts, It took four attacks, on four consecutive nights of moon and clear weather, to wreck the town, and only 12 aircraft were missing out of a total of 521 sorties. The Lancaster operated on this attack for the first time, but as far as I can remember, only one of them. An interesting point about this attack was that it was a combination of area and precision bombing; the Heinkel factory was the aiming point for aircraft from No. 5 Group, and was seriously damaged. Picked crews from this Group, which throughout the war specialised in accurate bombing either of large or small areas by visual means, succeeded in identifying the factory and even the large assembly shed which was the most important part of it. But they had, of course, a burning town to guide them to within a short distance of their objective; there was also no similar factory outside the town which could be mistaken for the target, the defences were very light, and there were no decoys. These two attacks, against Liibeck and Rostock, brought the total acreage of devastation by bombing in Germany up to 780 acres, and in regard to bombing about squared our account with Germany. There is also no doubt that these two successes had a marked effect on the general morale of Bomber Command itself; throughout 1941 both air-crew and  108 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  ground staff had been getting more and more depressed by the obvious failure of their attacks, and they, as well as the country at large, needed the stimulus of some definite achievement. And there is the possibility that the destruction of two tow
