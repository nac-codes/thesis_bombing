essed by the obvious failure of their attacks, and they, as well as the country at large, needed the stimulus of some definite achievement. And there is the possibility that the destruction of two towns of con- siderable size, and the mass evacuation which followed, gave the enemy a jolt which he badly needed.  There remained the problem of the first-class target, the major industrial town round which the enemy was bound to concentrate effective and heavy defences. So far all that the Liibeck and Rostock attacks had proved was that we could saturate the passive defences of a town by concentration of attack; it remained to be seen whether the active and passive defences of a vital industrial area could be similarly overcome. I was convinced that a force of 250-300 aircraft was wholly inadequate to saturate the then existing defences of a major industrial town of half a million or more inhabitants. But if we attacked with a larger force, suppos- ing that we could get one, should we be able to organise it in such a way as to get a really high concentration over the target? It was becoming obvious that the degree of concentration we had achieved so far was not going to be good enough, but there was no previous experience to show whether it would be practical to put many hundreds of aircraft over a target at the rate of, say, ten a minute; in the past such a conception would have been thought as absurd as it was dangerous, for this was six times as high a concentration as had been aimed at towards the end of 1941. At that time, as it happened, I did have a force of well over 1000 aircraft in my Command; if the crews and aircraft at the O.T.U.s and conversion units were added to the front-line squadrons we could easily raise our strength to that figure. They were half-trained crews, of course, but the O.T.U.s had already undertaken the task of dropping propaganda leaflets over France, often on a large scale; it was useful training for them, it relieved the front-line squa
