crews, of course, but the O.T.U.s had already undertaken the task of dropping propaganda leaflets over France, often on a large scale; it was useful training for them, it relieved the front-line squadrons of this task, and they gained some knowledge of what it was like to be shot at by flak or even inter- cepted by night fighters. If there were great risks involved in a high concentration of aircraft, then these risks would be increased by sending out large numbers of new crews, but if, on the other hand, this high concentration was a definite protection against fighters and flak then I should not be calling on new crews to a so grave a risk as the front line squadrons had habitually taken.  The dangers were many and obvious. If anything went  THE PRELIMINARY PHASE 109  seriously wrong—and this was to be in many ways a wholly new type of operation—then I should be committing not only the whole of my front line strength but absolutely all my reserves in a single battle. Our whole programme of training and ex- pansion might conceivably be wrecked, and in any case I had very seriously to consider the inevitable interference with normal training that would occur while the force was being organised for this special purpose.  As against the dangers, the advantages of a successful opera- tion on such ascale would be very great. If we succeeded we should have before us a definite and attainable goal, a measure of what could be achieved as soon as our expansion really began. The result of using an adequate bomber force against Germany would be there for all the world to see, and I should be able to press for the aircraft, crews, and equipment we needed with far more effect than by putting forward theoretical arguments, however convincing, in favour of hitting the enemy where it would hurt him most. Such a demonstration was, in fact, the only argument I could see which was at all likely to prevent our squadrons from being snatched away and our effort diverted to subsidiary t
