would hurt him most. Such a demonstration was, in fact, the only argument I could see which was at all likely to prevent our squadrons from being snatched away and our effort diverted to subsidiary targets, or to extract the equipment we so desperately needed, the radar navigational aids and the target indicators, from the torpid departments which withheld them for so long. But it was not only, of course, a question of convincing those in power that bombing could be a decisive weapon; from such an operation we should also learn a number of tactical lessons of the greatest possible value, lessons which could not be learned in any other way and without which we could not prepare for the main offensive. As to the harm such an attack might do to the enemy, this would no doubt be considerable, even though it was obvious that Germany, with the industries of the Reich undamaged and the resources of all Europe at her disposal, would be able to restore any lost production in a comparatively short space of time. Not one or two such strokes, but the cumulative effect of hundreds of them, would be needed before the enemy felt the pinch. On the other hand there was a good chance that morale would be affected by the first really heavy blow to get through the main defences of Germany.  I got Winston Churchill to agree to the thousand bomber plan late on a Sunday at Chequers. He was prepared for a loss of 100 bombers on this operation. As I drove home from there in my Bentley at 3 a.m.—it was only ten minutes from my home at  One Om  Ce he oT er PO AM ANH eR He HO To  IIo BOMBER OFFENSIVE  Springfield—I found myself humming “Malbrouck s’en va-t’en guerre.” I suddenly realised that that tune always came into my head whenever I had just left him. The spirit of Marlborough did indeed breathe in his descendant and most emphatically was he going to war. Whether it was coincidence at first and habit thereafter I do not know. Whatever. it was, the mixture of Chequers moonlight, Winston’s
