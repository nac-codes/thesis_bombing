me time, and I might lose the good weather over England; to land such a force in difficult weather would at that time have been to court disaster and for so many aircraft it was necessary to have a large number of bases free from cloud But if I sent the force that night, the target might be cloud- covered, and the whole operation reduced to naught and our plan disclosed. From among a number of suitable targets only Colog ne was at all likely to have reasonably good weather durin he night, and there was no certainty about the weather over Colao  THE PRELIMINARY PHASE Ill  I chose Cologne and dispatched the force. It was by no means the greatest risk that a commander in the field has had to take in war, but it was a considerable risk.  The weather in those days had absolute power to make or mar an operation. In this instance, as I saw it, the weather had the power to make or mar the future of the bomber offensive; it would have been of no use whatever to argue what might have happened if the weather had been different, if thundery clouds had not covered the city, and if we had therefore been able to hit Cologne. And at that time there was much greater un- certainty about the weather than towards the end of the war, when the meteorological service had a considerably larger staff and when several important discoveries had been made. Moreover the meteorological reconnaissance flight, which sent aircraft over enemy territory to make observations just before an operation, had only recently been formed, in January, 1942. Most important of all, when the first essential for a successful attack was that the sky should be clear, we were up against a special difficulty which made accurate forecasting almost impossible. The meteorological conditions favourable to clear skies are also, most unfortunately, about equally favourable to the development of strato-cumulus cloud, either broken or continouus.  Let me here go back to a point I made before; Bomber Command was expectedâ€”even,
