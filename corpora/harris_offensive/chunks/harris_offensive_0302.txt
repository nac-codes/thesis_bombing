oo aircraft attacked out of the total of 1047, and within an hour and a half dropped 1455 tons of bombs, two-thirds of the whole load being incendiaries. The casualty rate was 3-3 per cent, with 39 aircraft missing, and, in spite of the fact that a arge part of the force consisted of semi-trained crews and that many more fighters were airborne than usual, this was considerab y less than the average 4.6 per cent for operations in similar weather during the previous twelve months. The medium bomber, mostly flown by crews from the O.T.U.s had a casualty rate of 4.5 per cent, which was remarkable, but it was still more remarkable that we lost scarcely any of the 300 heavy bombers that took part in this operation; the casualty rate for the heavies was only 1.9 per cent. These had attacked after the medium bombers, when the defences had been to some extent beaten down, and in greater concentration an was possible for the new crews in the medium bombers, he figures proved conclusively that the enemy’s fighters and flak had been effectively saturated; an analysis of all reports on the ttack showed that the enemy’s radar location devices had been le to pick up single aircraft and follow them throughout the ttack, but that the guns had been unable to engage more than small proportion of the large concentration of aircraft. Reconnaissance after the attack showed that 600 acres of Cologne had been devastated and this in turn conclusively proved that the passive defences of Cologne had been saturated in just the same way as its guns and searchlights had been, together with the air defence of the whole of Western Germany, by concentration of attack. The damage had increased out of all proportion to the increase of bomb tonnage; in fact, this single attack had caused very nearly as much damage in Germany—6oo acres as against 780—as all Bomber Command’s previous attacks, including the very successful attacks on Liibeck and Rostock, taken together.
