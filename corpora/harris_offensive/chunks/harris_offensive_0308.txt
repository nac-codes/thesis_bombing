ed Blenheims, before we had anything else, for an improvised defence during the Blitz; the modification was easily made and at first the enemy naturally used the least successful type of bomber, the Messerschmitt 110, as his main night fighter. Thus in 1941 a force of about 250 Messerschmitt 110s was formed for defence against night attacks on Germany. In June of 1942 this force was not substantially altered in numbers or character, though the ground control stations and searchlights with which it co-operated had become far more numerous and efficient.  Within the next year, as a result of decisions made after the Cologne attack, the force had increased to 530 twin-engined night fighters, with a corresponding decrease in the front line strength of the bomber force; the more efficient type of army co-operation bombers were now being turned into night fighters. But the front line strength on paper of the two forces which used the same type of aircraft, the bomber and the night fighter forces, was deceptive. Actual production of night fighters was given priority over production of bombers, and the bomber force only maintained its large front line strength, 1300 aircraft in June of 1943, by a policy of conservation which inevitably prevented any sustained offensive in the air. Thus from 1944 onwards the bomber and â€˜twin-engined night fighter strength remained roughly equal, on paper about 800 each, but the bomber strength would have been very rapidly reduced if the enemy had made any serious use of this force. It was also in 1942 that the enemy, with an eye to American daylight operations and Anglo-American aircraft production, decided on a great increase in the production of single-engined fighters. The German Chief of Air Staff in 1942, General Jeschonneck, said that he would not know what to do with a production of more than 360 fighters a month, but General Milch, in charge of aircraft procurement from November, 1941, asked for an eventual production of 1000 fighter
