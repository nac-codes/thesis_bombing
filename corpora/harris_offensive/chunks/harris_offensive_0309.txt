ould not know what to do with a production of more than 360 fighters a month, but General Milch, in charge of aircraft procurement from November, 1941, asked for an eventual production of 1000 fighters a month, and plans for increased fighter production were eventually decided on in September of 1942, after much controversy. From then on the diversion for the defence of Germany of single- engined fighters and twin-engined converted bombers was of increasing strategic importance and had a profound effect on all fronts. The growing strength of the enemy night fighter, from  THE PRELIMINARY PHASE IIs  1942 onwards, naturally had a marked and almost immediate effect on Bomber Commandâ€™s casualty rate, and if we had not been able to change and improve our own tactics either the expansion of the Command would have been stopped or a policy of conservation of effort would have been as necessary for us as it was for the German bomber force.

The broadcast itself was printed and re-broadcast in translation; it threatened the Germans with dire pains and penalties to be inflicted upon them by the bombers, though in point of fact with far less than was actually meted out to them in the event.

The fact is that I
