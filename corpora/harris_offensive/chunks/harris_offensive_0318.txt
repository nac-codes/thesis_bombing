le, I remarked, thought that bombing could never win a war. “Well,” I said, “we shall see. It hasn’t been tried yet, and Germany, more and more desperately clinging to her widespread conquests and still foolishly striving for more, will make a most interesting subject for the initial experiment. Japan can be used to provide the confirmation. But don’t expect too much yet . . .” That was in 1942 and Hiroshima heard the last word.  As a matter of fact I did my utmost during the war to avoid any sort of publicity for remarks by myself; in fact I considerably annoyed many representatives of the Press by refusing to see them or hold Press conferences.
