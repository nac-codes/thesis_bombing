A new and deadly tactic of the enemy fighters was first observed in March, 1942. The fighter climbed steeply until it got under the tail of the bomber, opened fire at close range, and continued to fire and to climb yet more steeply until it stalled. It is extremely difficult to spot another aircraft against the dark background below the tail of a bomber, and gunners were repeatedly taken by surprise; it often happened that crews reported that their aircraft had been hit by anti-aircraft fire when, in fact, as expert examination of the damage proved, they had been shot at from below, by a fighter. Instead of searching the sky for enemy fighters in the normal fashion it was now necessary for the bomber to be repeatedly banked while the area below was searched, and a corkscrewing flight was developed as a means of taking evasive action, but the radar assisted fighter using these tactics continued to be a serious menace. In June and July of 1942 we were losing aircraft, from all causes, at the rate of 5.6  tions. _The Pathfinder Force. Arguments qe ttepiatvten, thelaer oats oy, heey Jamming the enemy’s radar.
