ch, which were undefended and of only historical importance. Nevertheless the increasing diversion of Germany’s material war potential and manpower to the air defence of the Reich made the offensive more than worthwhile even at that stage.  The success of the enemy defences in 1942 was not the result of any radically new tactics, and we knew, of course, that once we could operate on dark nights and in bad weather our casualties would decline, or at all events would not increase at the same rate that they otherwise would. The enemy’s ground control stations were increased in number throughout 1942, and the night fighter squadrons were also reinforced to the point where they became of much greater importance for the defence of Germany than anti-aircraft guns even though these were now radar assisted and were becoming increasingly efficient. The one significant change that was made during the year was the removal of all  GETTING THE WEAPONS 123  searchlights previously arranged in a belt along the frontier; they were now set up in the actual target areas, where the search- lights were so dazzling that it became difficult to identify the aiming point visually even on moonlight nights. The search- lights were no longer needed to assist fighter-interception because an increasing number of fighters were being equipped with airborne radar.  A new and deadly tactic of the enemy fighters was first observed in March, 1942. The fighter climbed steeply until it got under the tail of the bomber, opened fire at close range, and continued to fire and to climb yet more steeply until it stalled. It is extremely difficult to spot another aircraft against the dark background below the tail of a bomber, and gunners were repeatedly taken by surprise; it often happened that crews reported that their aircraft had been hit by anti-aircraft fire when, in fact, as expert examination of the damage proved, they had been shot at from below, by a fighter.
