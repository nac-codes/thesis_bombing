t their aircraft had been hit by anti-aircraft fire when, in fact, as expert examination of the damage proved, they had been shot at from below, by a fighter. Instead of searching the sky for enemy fighters in the normal fashion it was now necessary for the bomber to be repeatedly banked while the area below was searched, and a corkscrewing flight was developed as a means of taking evasive action, but the radar assisted fighter using these tactics continued to be a serious menace. In June and July of 1942 we were losing aircraft, from all causes, at the rate of 5.6 per cent of all sorties, a rate, which, if continued, would put a stop to any considerable expansion of the Command.  To regain tactical superiority over the enemy much would have to be done. It would be necessary to find some means of identifying the target on moonless nights, and if possible in cloudy weather. It would be necessary to find means of breaking the extremely efficient control of the night fighters by the ground stations. And it would be necessary for the force to be doubled or trebled in size, in order that the enemy defences might be effectively saturated.  By this time the scientists had already devised the answers to the majority of our problems; it was a question either of getting the equipment we needed into full production or of getting permission to use it; such permission was apt to be withheld if the authorities feared that the Germans would be able to use a new weapon as effectively against the defences of Great Britain as we could use it against the defences of Germany.  The most important of all the new devices were the two radar aids to navigation which were known by the code names of Oboe  122 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  rest of the year, as in the intervening periods of June, July, and August between the full moon, attacks were carried out enly by the front-line squadrons. These, it will be remembered, did not appreciably expand during the year, but the German defences did, with the re
