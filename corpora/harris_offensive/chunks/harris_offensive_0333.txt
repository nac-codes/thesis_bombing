ust between the full moon, attacks were carried out enly by the front-line squadrons. These, it will be remembered, did not appreciably expand during the year, but the German defences did, with the result that we had to work with a force which was consistently too small to saturate the .enemy’s flak, searchlight and night fighter defences. Our casualty rate continually in- creased, to the point where, in the later months of 1942, the enemy appeared to have gained a serious degree of tactical superiority. And, as we were without any effective aid to navigation, the damage we did was very far from being enough to compensate for our losses. I repeatedly dispatched the force to coastal targets, which could be more easily identified than any target inland, and serious damage was done to the port of Emden. But as all major operations had to be carried out in moonlight the defences had it all their own way with our small force and continually pre- vented any real concentration of attack; though the force went again and again to Hamburg, Bremen, and Kiel, the damage was always scattered, save at Emden, where we succeeded in causing a quite large area of devastation. We also attacked some minor industrial cities, where the defences were naturally less heavy, and did considerable damage to Saarbrucken, Mainz, and Karls- ruhe. To make a successful attack on a minor industrial objective was, of course, more useful than to fail against a major objective, but in the long run such a policy would have been almost as much an admission of defeat as the later German attacks on towns like Bath, Canterbury and Norwich, which were undefended and of only historical importance. Nevertheless the increasing diversion of Germany’s material war potential and manpower to the air defence of the Reich made the offensive more than worthwhile even at that stage.  The success of the enemy defences in 1942 was not the result of any radically new tactics, and we knew, of course, that once we could ope
