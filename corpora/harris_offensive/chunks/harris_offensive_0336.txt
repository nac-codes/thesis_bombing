The intro- duction of these radar aids became all the more important when the enemy started jamming Gee, as we knew he was bound to do before long. This jamming was first suspected on the night of August 6th-7th, 1942, and became obvious on the night of August 9th-1oth when we attacked Osnabruck. The effect of the jamming was not to stop the use of Gee altogether, but it reduced the effective range of this aid by about 100 miles, so that all targets in Germany were outside the range of ground stations in Great Britain though Gee was still an extremely useful aid to navigation along the greater part of the bombers’ route. New ground stations were built in England and the frequency range of the Gee transmission was enlarged and varied; these methods were successful from time to time, but there was always the risk of interference. ;  Oboe developed out of the
