exact position at which the bombs should be dropped a signal is sent, and the bombs are released. For the bomber’s crew, the whole thing is pretty well automatic.  The main drawback to this system is that the aircraft must follow a steady course, without deviation, for a considerable distance until it reaches the target. This makes the aircraft extremely vulnerable. At the same time the range of the system is limited by the height at which the aircraft can fly, because the Oboe transmissions follow a straight liné and therefore, owing to the curvature of the earth, must be received at an increasingly greater height above the ground as the aircraft’s distance from the ground station increases.  In the first attempts to use this system, during the attacks on Brest, the Stirling, the least efficient of the four-engined bombers, was unfortunately chosen to be fitted with this equipment. Its altitude performance was, however, hopeless even when its bomb load was reduced or omitted. It was also slow, and when it flew on a steady course was in great danger from the defences. But in 1942 we had the Mosquito, an aircraft with a ceiling more than twice that of the Stirling, and an extremely fast bomber; it could fly with reasonable safety on a steady course through fighter-defended and gun-defended areas where any other bomber flying on a straight course would probably be destroyed. The Mosquito could not then carry a heavy bomb-load but in any case there could be no question, as with Gee, of equipping the whole force with this device; only a few aircraft could use the Oboe system in any one attack, for the two Oboe ground stations could only control one aircraft at a time and only a few in the course of an hour.  When the first tests were carried out in 1941 and early in 1942 Oboe was being considered simply as a blind bombing device, and if it was to be used as such the fact that only a handful of aircraft could be guided by it in any one attack seemed a fatal objection.
