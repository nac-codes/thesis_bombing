boe was being considered simply as a blind bombing device, and if it was to be used as such the fact that only a handful of aircraft could be guided by it in any one attack seemed a fatal objection. But in the summer of 1942 Bomber Command suggested to the Air Ministry that Oboe should be used as a target-marking device; we asked for six aircraft to be equipped with Oboe and two ground stations to be set up, and for this we asked the highest priority. The Mosquito’s then small bomb-load did not matter; the Oboe-Mosquito’s main work was to mark the target for the main force, though it might occasionally engage in a small scale blind bombing.  In 1940, when it was decided to proceed with the development,  124 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  and H2S; either of these, it was claimed by the designers, would make the bomber force largely independent of the weather and would greatly increase the accuracy of our attacks. The intro- duction of these radar aids became all the more important when the enemy started jamming Gee, as we knew he was bound to do before long. This jamming was first suspected on the night of August 6th-7th, 1942, and became obvious on the night of August 9th-1oth when we attacked Osnabruck. The effect of the jamming was not to stop the use of Gee altogether, but it reduced the effective range of this aid by about 100 miles, so that all targets in Germany were outside the range of ground stations in Great Britain though Gee was still an extremely useful aid to navigation along the greater part of the bombers’ route. New ground stations were built in England and the frequency range of the Gee transmission was enlarged and varied; these methods were successful from time to time, but there was always the risk of interference. } i  Oboe developed out of the methods used by the R.A.F. to “bend” and interfere with the beams used as navigational aids by the German bombers during the blitz. It was then discovered that an aircraft could fly along a certain beam and that its
