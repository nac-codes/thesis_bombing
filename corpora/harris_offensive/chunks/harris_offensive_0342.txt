r of 1942 Bomber Command suggested to the Air Ministry that Oboe should be used as a target-marking device; we asked for six aircraft to be equipped with Oboe and two ground stations to be set up, and for this we asked the highest priority, The Mosquito’s then small bomb-load did not matter; the Oboe-Mosquito’s main work was to mark the target for the main force, though it might occasionally engage in a small scale blind bombing.

But “H” was rejected for the time being because only a comparatively small force, about 100 aircraft, could use it ata time. In 1942 the posi- tion was so different, and our ideas were so much less ambitious, that a navigational and bombing aid which cculd be used by no more than a single squadron of aircraft seemed likely to change the whole course of the bomber offensive, which, indeed, it most certainly did. In the two years between 1940 and 1942 there had been so great an alteration of strategy and tactics that we were no longer thinking in terms of thousands of bombers, the crews of which were each capable of finding the t
