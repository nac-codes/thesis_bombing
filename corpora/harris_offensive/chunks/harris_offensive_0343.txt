ween 1940 and 1942 there had been so great an alteration of strategy and tactics that we were no longer thinking in terms of thousands of bombers, the crews of which were each capable of finding the target by themselves, but of a much smaller force directed to an area which had been marked by a very few aircraft. “H” had to wait for development until a much later stage of the war, when its use made all the difference between the success and failure of the offensive against oil.  It is of some interest that the Stirlings which used the primitive version of Oboe hit by accident on much the same plan of marking by Oboe. If they were to fly at the required height they could only carry a small bomb-load, so the crews used to fill up with flares; these they dropped with the idea of lighting up the target for the other aircraft attacking it.  If Mosquitoes were used with Oboe, targets in the Ruhr would be well within range, but the range did not go much beyond this area. The theoretical margin of error was about 300 yards, and if this did not in practice prove very much greater any fairly large industrial town could be marked and accurately bombed. Oboe could certainly be jammed, but it was proposed to have ready a new mark of Oboe, working on a shorter wavelength and therefore less susceptible to jamming, to be used as soon as there was interference with Oboe Mark I.  H2S was an entirely different device from Oboe. This was contained wholly within the aircraft and required no transmission from ground stations; its range was therefore unlimited and it was most improbable that its use could be seriously interfered with in any way. There was no limit to the number of aircraft that could use this aid at one and the same time. H2S was under development throughout 1942; it was a modification of the equipment used for detecting submarines or other vessels at sea. It was discovered that objects on the ground, or on the surface  GETTING THE WEAPONS 127  of the sea, would return a
