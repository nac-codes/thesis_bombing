dification of the equipment used for detecting submarines or other vessels at sea. It was discovered that objects on the ground, or on the surface  GETTING THE WEAPONS 127  of the sea, would return a distinctive radar echo to an aircraft, and after U-boats had been successfully made out in this way it was found that large buildings such as hangars and steel factory buildings would also return a distinguishable echo. Coast lines, estuaries and built-up areas could be detected through unbroken cloud or in total darkness. Nobody doubted that the principle of using this equipment as a navigational aid was sound, but at first there was a good deal of scepticism about whether it could ever be developed to such a point, as the enthusiasts thought it would be, that the navigator would.be able to map-read by means of H2S in any weather or in any conditions of light.  The difficulty was that to make the instrument effective it was necessary, as Air Commodore Bennett discovered during tests which he made in July, 1942, to use the Magnetron valve.  In May of 1942, after our experience with Gee and the ex- aggerated claims that had been made for it, we decided to investigate the H2S equipment of the type that was then being projected and we pointed out that its range with the valve it then had, the Klystron valve, was not good enough for opera- tional use. However, in July, Bennett tried out the version of the H2S equipment with the Magnetron valve and got pro- mising results. The Magnetron valve was one of the most brilliant inventions of British science and indispensable for many forms of airborne radar; it enabled a powerful trans- mission to be made from a piece of equipment small enough to be easily carried in an aircraft, and without it we could scarcely have won the Battle of the Atlantic. There was much alarm at the prospect of it getting into enemy hands, as it almost certainly would do after any considerable number of aircraft had carried it over Germany; you can and w
