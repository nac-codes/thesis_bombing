the Atlantic. There was much alarm at the prospect of it getting into enemy hands, as it almost certainly would do after any considerable number of aircraft had carried it over Germany; you can and we did attach detonators to secret equipment which will blow it up when the aircraft crashes, but you cannot guarantee that this will invariably work and sooner or later the enemy is bound to get a specimen of the equipment more or less intact. I understood the objections, but it seemed to me that it would take the Germans a considerable time to get any similar equipment into production, that is, if one could judge by the time it was taking us to produce it. Moreover the defences of Great Britain were rapidly improving, the German Air Force was deeply engaged either in Russia or in the air defence of Germany, and in general we should never get on with the offensive at all if everybody spent their time taking every con- ceivable precaution against the enemy retaliating in time. After  128  weeks of argument I got permission for the Magnetron version of H2S to be produced and for two squadrons to be equipped with it by the end of the year.  As soon as Gee was introduced it became evident that the aircraft used to find the target and mark it in one way or another should be manned by specially trained and experienced crews, and particularly by highly skilled navigators and air-bombers. As far as possible, this was always done. But in the later spring of 1942 the Air Ministry began to ask us to set up an independent target finding force of picked crews. I was entirely opposed to the idea of taking the best men from each Group; the very men who were most needed to raise the general level by their example and precept and who were required as Squadron and Flight Com- manders in their own units; the formation of a corps d’élite seemed likely to lead to a good deal of trouble and might be thoroughly bad for morale. In this I was supported by all my Group Commanders. My own plan wa
