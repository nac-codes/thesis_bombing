ty was altogether exceptional. I first met him, as I have described in an earlier chapter, when I was commanding a flying-boat base in 1930, and when his short term commission expired I got him a job in civil flying. He was a profound student of navigation, and in the early part of the war he took the major part in opening the transatlantic ferry. I then got him back into the Air Force as a Wing Commander. He commanded a Halifax squadron and in 1941 was shot down in flames over Norway when attacking the Tirpitz in his usual gallant manner; he escaped to Sweden after many adventures and was returned to England. His courage, both moral and physical, is outstanding, and as a technician he is unrivalled. He will forgive me if I say that his consciousness of his own intellectual powers sometimes made him impatient with slower  B.O.

As soon as Gee was introduced it became evident that the aircraft used to find the target and mark it in one way or another should be manned by specially trained and experienced crews, and particularly by highly skilled navigators and air-bombers. As far as possible, this was always done. But in the later spring of 1942 the Air Ministry began to ask us to set up an independent target finding force of picked crews. I was entirely opposed to the idea of taking the best men from each Group; the very men who were most needed to raise the general level by their example and precept and who were required as Squadron and Flight Com- manders in their own units; the formation of a corps d’élite seemed likely to lead to a good deal of trouble and might be thoroughly bad for morale. In this I was supported by all my Group Commanders. My own plan was to train and form target- marking squadrons in each Group; this would lead to a good deal of healthy competition and new ideas could
