ched for distinguishing features, than aircraft of the main force; the enemy might also be expected to concentrate all his defences on the Pathfinder squadrons who got to the target first, in the hope of preventing the target from being marked. As the Pathfinder squadrons were to be asked to run even greater risks than the squadrons of the main force, to work longer tours and probably to miss promotion in their parent squadrons, I proposed that the men in them should get quicker promotion and wear some sort of distinguishing badge; as we were compelled by events to have a corps d’élite it seemed to me necessary to carry the principle through to its logical conclusion. It was also desirable for recruitment to arrange for the Pathfinder squadrons to be given adequate publicity in the Press and by the B.B.C., but this was prevented by the security aspect of the matter; men of the Pathfinder Force would necessarily know all about our latest equipment and tactics and it was feared that the enemy would go to particular pains to interrogate the Pathfinder crews who fell into their hands. No doubt it was best to be on the safe side and avoid publishing the names of any Pathfinder personnel, since the enemy made a card index of all the names and details about air-crew they could get from our newspapers and found this very useful in the interrogation of prisoners.  Don Bennett, whom I had known since 1931, was the obvious man at that time available for the job of head of the Pathfinder Force. He was in his early thirties, very young indeed to become a Group Commander, but his technical knowledge and his personal operational ability was altogether exceptional. I first met him, as I have described in an earlier chapter, when I was commanding a flying-boat base in 1930, and when his short term commission expired I got him a job in civil flying. He was a profound student of navigation, and in the early part of the war he took the major part in opening the transatlantic ferry. I t
