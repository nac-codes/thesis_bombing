Aircraft equipped with H2S were also allotted to the Pathfinders and they had twelve Stirlings and twelve Halifaxes so equipped in December of 1942. But in spite of the fact that we had got permission in July for H2S to be produced with the Magnetron valve and for two squadrons to be equipped with it, we still had not got permission to fly the equipment over enemy territory and this permission was withheld for another month.  I knew that there were other ways, besides operating on dark nights and in bad weather, of counteracting the enemy’s defences, which were steadily increasing as the Germans ruthlessly stripped their armies of their air cover and air support. By the beginning of 1942 we had a good idea of the menace that the enemy’s system of ground-controlled night fighters was going to be, and during the next six months we learnt a great deal about how the system  132 BOMBER OFFENSIVE GETTING THE WEAPONS 133  me worked in detail.
