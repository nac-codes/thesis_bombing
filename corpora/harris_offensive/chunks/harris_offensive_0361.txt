ute troops made a brilliant raid on Bruneval to cap- ture a small example of the apparatus, to which the Germans gave the code word “ Wurzburg,” used for plotting the bomber and the night fighter which was trying to intercept it. By May of 1942 we had a very complete and exact idea of how the ground control of the German night fighter force was operated and we knew the wavelengths on which transmissions were made. We also knew a good deal about the enemy’s radar early warning system,*which operated in close connection with the Wurzburgs and so made it possible to get the fighters up in time to intercept the bombers. And we knew a good deal about the radio-telephone system by which instructions were transmitted to the night-fighter pilots from the ground.  We knew that any or all of these transmissions, on which the whole ground control of the enemy’s night fighters depended, could be jammed, and possibly also the airborne radar carried by night fighters for interception in the dark. For example, jamming apparatus which could be carried in an aircraft was under develop- ment in 1941 and it had been known for some time that strips of metal, or paper with a thin coating of metal, would produce radar echoes if dropped from aircraft. The difficulty was that while Great Britain was wholly on the defensive it was thought injudicious to use measures which the Germans could use with effect against our own defences. It would have been idiotic to drop metallised paper over Germany in August of 1940, but in 1942 I was certain that the time had come to take such risks, which did not seem to be very serious, for the sake of the offensive. During the summer of 1942 I continually pressed for the develop- ment and, where possible, immediate use of equipment and measures to jam and interfere with the enemy’s radar and radio transmissions. But the authorities considered that we were still  GETTING THE WEAPONS 133  too vulnerable to air attack for us to start too much in the way of a j
