But the authorities considered that we were still  GETTING THE WEAPONS 133  too vulnerable to air attack for us to start too much in the way of a jamming war. We now know that the Germans also knew all about the effect of metallised paper on radar long before it was used, but did not initiate its use because they were afraid—in their case with good reason—of its effect on their own defences.  Under brilliant young Dr. Dickens, Bomber Command’s Operational Research Section’s investigations always enabled us to know exactly where we stood. In August they reported that in the previous two months between a third and two-thirds of all our losses—our total losses amounted to 5.6 per cent of all sorties—were caused by radar-assisted enemy defences, which included radar-assisted guns as well as ground-controlled fighters. They also estimated that effective countermeasures against radar transmissions would probably cut our losses by about a third, and, because bombing accuracy was seriously diminished by the strength of the enemy defences in the target area, would increase the efficiency of our attacks. In fact, there was so strong a case for the immediate use of Radio countermeasures that we made another application to the Air Ministry asking for them to be provided at once; we said this was a matter of the greatest importance and urgency. Countermeasures were already well developed; all we wanted was to be allowed to use them. After long discussion and many conferences we got permission to use some countermeasures, but not metallised paper, or “Window” as it was named. The jamming of the enemy’s Wurzburgs, early warning system, and radio telephonic communication between ground and night fighter began on a serious scale in December. The jamming was done both by ground and by airborne equip- ment; air losses fell off appreciably after it was begun, but as this came at a time when wintry weather might be expected to reduce
