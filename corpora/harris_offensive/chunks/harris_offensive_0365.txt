objective within range. Indeed, throughout the year Berlin had been high on the priority list of targets allotted to me outside the Ruhr. But in 1942 I refused, however much I was urged, to attack Berlin; I knew that at this time we could do little damage there and declined to risk the very heavy casualties that could be expected, even though the news of an attack on Berlin might have a heartening effect on the Russians and also on our own people. The last attack on Berlin had been in December of 1941, at a time when such an attack could only have had a political effect, and our losses on that occasion were 10 per cent of the force dispatched. From whatever direction the force approached Berlin, it would have at the very least 4 hours of flying over very heavily defended areas. Berlin was the target which the night fighter force was bound at all costs to defend, and its ground defences were as heavy as anywhere in Germany. And the mere size of the target—this was not-only a town of 4,000,000 inhabitants but it was also far from densely built up—meant that only a substantial force of heavy bombers could produce any concentrated or serious damage. Moreover it was my opinion that not only were heavy bombers needed for any successful attack on the capital, but also that only Lancasters could be sent there with any reasonable degree of safety and economy of force. In the autumn of 1942 I had only from 70 to 80 Lancasters available and these were having teething troubles with their fuel installation and were for the time being unable to fly at their full height. The Halifaxes and Stirlings would have to operate at between 10,000 and 18,000 feet, whereas the normal operational height of the Lancaster was considerably greater. The Halifaxes and Stirlings would therefore attract all the flak, while the Lancasters would go comparatively free, or the Lancasters would have to come down to the same level, in the hope of increasing the concentration of aircraft in space, and so
