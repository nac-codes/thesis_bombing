fficiency was also reduce by the weather, it was more profitable to attack a huge area like Berlin than a much smaller city like Essen,  Berlin was far beyond ¢ finding would either have  was only in January that we had got permission to use HaS an as yet we knew very little about its operational use; you can tel  whether an instrument is but you can seldom know it has been used in actual the Pathfinder force shoul with incendiaries, but for  readily distinguishable target indicators, On two consecutive  nights about the middle of all the Lancasters we coul two attacks. Unfortunatel it more difficult to see the  range of Oboe or Gee and the target to be done visually or by H2S, But it  ikely to be a failure in tests at home that it is going to be a success until operations. We therefore decided that mark the aiming point visually, not the first time in any operation wit  f the month we attacked Berlin with Taise—there were 368 aircraft in the y haze and snow, which always make outlines of a built-up area, prevented  the Pathfinders from identifying the aiming point and the damage was scattered, though a few important factories were hit, On the  first night the enemy's fig  nters made scarcely any interceptions  and, though the flak was heavy nd the force too small to saturate  it, only one aircraft was mi  issing. On the next night the weather  and the light proved favourable to the enemy; night fighters operated in strength and twenty-two bombers were lost. With the force then available Berlin was really too big a job for us,  but any damage or disloca  tion caused in Berlin had much more  effect on the enemy's war effort than a similar amount of damage  elsewhere,  goth-ist, the target being  time before H2S was effectively us  Was a slow process, mark 1943.
