we could hope to do was to cause universal devastation round the pens and in the town and in the process destroy a few outside machine shops and other worskshops of the kind that are useful ina naval base; we could also give U-boat crews on shore a disturbed night, if they were foolish enough to stay in the area, but of course they did not. The Admiralty may or may not have thought that this would exert a worthwhile influence on the Battle of the Atlantic, but there was no getting out of the job, though before we began on it I protested repeatedly against this hopeless misuse of air power on an operation which could not possibly achieve the object that was intended.  In January and February the Command made about 2000 sorties against Lorient, and in February and early March three attacks, the first of them by 4oo aircraft, were carried out against St. Nazaire. We did, in fact, uselessly devastate two perfectly good French towns—the attacks were usually well concentrated —but the only effect that they had on the course of the war was to delay the opening of the Battle of the Ruhr and the main bomber offensive against Germany by nearly two months. Until the beginning of March we were able to use only a small part of our effort against Germany, for though expansion was beginning, we could at that time only raise about 400 aircraft for the average  136 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  would be possible, with some effort, to raise a force of 150-200 of them. This was also the right time of year to attack Berlin, when winter weather reduced the efficiency of the fighter defences and when, because bombing efficiency was also reduced by the weather, it was more profitable to attack a huge area like Berlin than a much smaller city like Essen.  Berlin was far beyond the range of Oboe or Gee and the target finding would either have to be done visually or by H2S. But it was only in January that we had got permission to use H2S and as yet we knew very little about its operational use; you can
