the target finding would either have to be done visually or by H2S. But it was only in January that we had got permission to use H2S and as yet we knew very little about its operational use; you can tell whether an instrument is likely to be a failure in tests at home but you can seldom know that it is going to be a success until it has been used in actual operations. We therefore decided that the Pathfinder force should mark the aiming point visually, not with incendiaries, but for the first time in any operation with readily distinguishable target indicators. On two consecutive nights about the middle of the month we attacked Berlin with all the Lancasters we could raise—there were 388 aircraft in the two attacks. Unfortunately haze and snow, which always make it more difficult to see the outlines of a built-up area, prevented the Pathfinders from identifying the aiming point and the damage was scattered, though a few important factories were hit. On the first night the enemy’s fighters made scarcely any interceptions and, though the flak was heavy and the force too small to saturate it, only one aircraft was missing. On the next night the weather and the light proved favourable to the enemy; night fighters operated in strength and twenty-two bombers were lost. With the force then available Berlin was really too big a job for us, but any damage or dislocation caused in Berlin had much more effect on the enemy’s war effort than a similar amount of damage elsewhere.  H2S was first used in an operation on the night of January 3oth-31st, the target being Hamburg. Unlike Oboe, it was some time before H2S was effectively used; its tactical development was a slow process, marked by many disappointments during 1943.  Oboe was tested in a few very small scale experimental attacks during December, 1942, and January, 1943. The weather was usually bad, so that it was not easy to get good photographs by day to show whether the attacks had been successful. But from what eviden
