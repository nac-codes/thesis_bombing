we could also give U-boat crews on shore a disturbed night, if they were foolish enough to stay in the area, but of course they did not. The Admiralty may or may not have thought that this would exert a worthwhile influence on the Battle of the Atlantic, but there was no getting out of the job, though before we began on it I protested repeatedly against this hopeless misuse of air power on an operation which could not possibly achieve the object that was intended.  In January and February the Command made about 2000 sorties against Lorient, and in February and early March three attacks, the first of them by 400 aircraft, were carried out against St. Nazaire. We did, in fact, uselessly devastate two perfectly good French towns—the attacks were usually well concentrated —but the only effect that they had on the course of the war was to delay the opening of the Battle of the Ruhr and the main bomber offensive against Germany by nearly two months. Until the beginning of March we were able to use only a small part of our effort against Germany, for though expansion was beginning, we could at that time only raise about 4oo aircraft for the average  138 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  major operation. In the event, the strategic consequences of the delay were of considerable importance, and of course, wholly advantageous to the enemy. As Bomber Command’s main offensive against the German industrial cities was only to last for about twelve months, the loss of two months, which may have seemed a small affair to the authorities at the time, may now be seen in its proper perspective. It was only after bitter argument, in which I received support from Winston Churchill in his capacity as Minister of Defence, that the Admiralty failed to get accepted their demand for Brest and Bordeaux to be similarly wiped out.  During the first year of my command we had been able, in point of fact, to exert a very considerable influence on the war at sea without in any way reducing the weight of the offensi
