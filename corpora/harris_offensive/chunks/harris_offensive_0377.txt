The attacks were far lighter than those directed against Germany at that time; not only were a similar number of aircraft sent, but at this great range a small bomb load had to be carried. Nevertheless the effect on Italian morale was enormous and out of all proportion to the weight of the attack and to the extent of the damage. Three hundred thousand people, half the population, fled from Turin after our second attack on the city that autumn and there was as great, and probably greater, panic after the daylight attack on Milan by less than one hundred Lancasters.
