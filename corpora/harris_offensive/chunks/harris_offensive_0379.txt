delays and complications in U-boat crew training and working up trials.  A good deal of the minelaying was-directed against German merchant shipping and supply ships, particularly the shipping used to bring iron ore for the Ruhr from Scandinavia to Rotter- dam and from Bilbao to Bayonne; the same vessels used to transport troops and warlike stores from the Western to the Eastern Baltic and thence on to the Eastern Front. During the whole period of the war one vessel is known to have been sunk or damaged for every 50 mines that were laid.  By the end of 1942 minelaying operations were becoming dangerous. Light flak is an extremely effective defence against aircraft flying at a height of 1000 feet or less and the enemy had disposed large numbers of light anti-aircraft guns near the most important minefields, a clear proof that the minelaying was hurting him. For a short time we had to direct our minelaying to more open areas, where the only guns could be on ships, but this was only while we were experimenting with new methods of minelaying from a greater height. If this was to be done, it would, of course, be more difficult to find the area where the mines were to be laid, and we therefore experimented with laying mines by radar fixes.  We kept up and indeed exceeded the promised monthly average of 1000 a month. During the whole year the Command laid 9573 mines and, of course, it was only in the spring that all the Groups began to do this work and the programme commenced. This work required 14.7 per cent of all sorties for the year. Mine- laying, by the way, had the code-word “ Gardening,” the mines were called “vegetables,” and the various minefields were given the names of vegetables or other plants, artichokes, onions, deodars, and so forth.  In the late autumn of 1942 there began the offensive which was to throw the Germans out of Africa. To support this the Command was required to attack the industrial cities of North Italy. There were six night attacks against
