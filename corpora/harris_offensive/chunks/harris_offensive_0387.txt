From there the bombers began the run-up to the target, which they were to reach at the rate of eleven a minute, the whole attack lasting thirty-eight minutes. The Mosquitoes dropped red target indicators, not visually but by means of Oboe on the aiming point before the bombing began, and thereafter at intervals alternately of three and seven minutes. These intervals were dictated by the fact that the Mosquitoes could only be guided to the target at the rate of one every ten minutes for each pair of ground stations with which they wereincommunication. Wenow had two pairs of ground stations instead of the single pair with which we had made our first experimental attacks by Oboe, which meant that we could get twelve Mosquitoes over the target in an hour instead of six as before, but there was always the risk, especially as the Mosquitoes could carry no great number of target indicators, that there would be intervals when
