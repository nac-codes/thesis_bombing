dispatched. In the main force there were 140 Lancasters, 69 Halifaxes, 52 Stirlings, and 131 Wellingtons, while the Pathfinder marking force consisted of 22 heavy bombers and 8 Oboe-Mosquitoes, on which and on the  equipment they carried everything in the last resort depended. 144  THE OFFENSIVE UNDER WAY 145  The force flew to Egmong on the Dutch coast, and thence directly to a point 15 miles north of Essen, which point Pathfinder heavies had marked with yellow markers on the ground as a guide to the main force. From there the bombers began the run-up to the target, which they were to reach at the rate of eleven a minute, the whole attack lasting thirty-eight minutes. The Mosquitoes dropped red target indicators, not visually but by means of Oboe on the aiming point before the bombing began, and thereafter at intervals alternately of three and seven minutes. These intervals were dictated by the fact that the Mosquitoes could only be guided to the target at the rate of one every ten minutes for each pair of ground stations with which they wereincommunication. Wenow had two pairs of ground stations instead of the single pair with which we had made our first experimental attacks by Oboe, which meant that we could get twelve Mosquitoes over the target in an hour instead of six as before, but there was always the risk, especially as the Mosquitoes could carry no great number of target indicators, that there would be intervals when no target indicators were burning on the ground. This was what the 22 heavy bombers of the Pathfinder force were for; they were to drop a large number of green target indicators, aimed at the red target indicators which the Mosquitoes had dropped, at intervals of one to two minutes throughout the attack. If the bomb-aimers of the main force could see the few but more accurately placed red target indicators they were to aim at these, but if not, at the green target indicators. In this way, though the ground might be quite invisible through haz
