see the few but more accurately placed red target indicators they were to aim at these, but if not, at the green target indicators. In this way, though the ground might be quite invisible through haze or low cloud, it was hoped that the main force would have a clearly distinguishable mark at which to aim at every moment throughout the attack. The weather on this occasion was clear, but there was the usual industrial haze of the Ruhr, and this in itself made the use of target indicators and a blind-bombing aid absolutely essential.  In the event the red target indicators proved to have fallen very close to the aiming point if not on it, the green target indicators were most accurately aimed by the highly trained bomb-aimers of the Pathfinder force, and the main force bombing was equally good. A conflagration which seemed to cover, almost without a break, a circular area some two miles in diameter surrounded the target indicators. The municipal archives of Essen afterwards revealed that the greater part of the bomb-load had in fact fallen within the built-up area under attack. The concentra- tion of the bomber force had been so great that only 14 aircraft  B.O.

This was easily the most important attack so far carried out by jomber Command. It was not only that a hitherto invulnerable target had for the first time been seriously damaged, but also that  ranean, and had also in this interval brought their radar-assisted night fighters and anti-aircraft guns to a point of extreme efficiency.
