to reduce production in the industries of the Ruhr at least as much by the indirect effect of damage to services, housing, and amenities, as by any direct damage to the factories or railways themselves. At this stage of the war there was no alternative method or means of attacking German industry, but at the same time I had good reason to believe that the indirect effects of this general damage would be extremely important in the long run.  During the first five months of the Battle of the Ruhr, Essen was by no means the only target. Dortmund, one of the most important centres of heavy industry in Germany, Duisburg, Bochum, Gelsenkirchen, Oberhausen, Mulheim, Wuppertal, Remscheid, Munchen-Gladbach, Krefeld, Munster, Aachen, Dusseldorf, and Cologne were all heavily attacked and in most instances heavily damaged, the devastated areas amounting to hundreds and in some instances to thousands of acres, usually  the last of them both Krupps and Essen were largely in ruins; even in the first three attacks of this series about half of the 300 separate buildings of Krupps were damaged, and the last attack, on July 25th-26th did as much damage to Krupps as in all the previous attacks put together. ‘The largest building in the plant, the Hindenburg Hall in which locomotives were built, was so badly damaged that the Germans never attempted to repair it, though the enemy was then giving as high priority to the pro- duction of locomotives as to the production of aircraft, tanks, and U-boats, and though Krupps was, next to the locomotive Works at Kassel, the largest locomotive building plant in Europe. From then on the production by Krupps of large shells, previously made at the rate of four hundred a month, and of fuses, previously made there at the rate of two hundred thousand a month, alto- gether ceased. The output of guns was cut by half and the production of aero-engine crankshafts—most important to the enemy at this stage of the air war—was seriously reduced.  n all 3261 s
