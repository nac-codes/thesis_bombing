The output of guns was cut by half and the production of aero-engine crankshafts—most important to the enemy at this stage of the air war—was seriously reduced.  n all 3261 sorties were made against Essen between March and July of 1943. This should be compared with the 3724 sorties made against Essen in 1942 which did no significant damage to Krupps and very little damage to the town of Essen, And in 1942 201 aircraft were missing from the 3724 sorties dispatched against Essen, a casualty rate of 5.4 per cent, but in 1943, 138 aircraft  Germany b: 5-6th, 1943, of success t took over th of destroyin ever, the scc of the Casab a joint Ang industry.

This was easily the most important attack so far carried out by Bomber Command. It was not only that a hitherto invulnerable target had for the first time been seriously damaged, but also that there was no reason why the success should not be indefinitely repeated in attacks on any targets within Oboe range. This had never been the case before, every previous success had bee
