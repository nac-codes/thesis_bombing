compared with the 3724 sorties made against Essen in 1942 which did no significant damage to Krupps and very little damage to the town of.Essen. And in 1942 201 aircraft were missing from the 3724 sorties dispatched against Essen, a casualty rate of 5.4 per cent, but in 1943, 138 aircraft were missing from the 3261 sorties dispatched against Essen, a casualty rate of 4.2 per cent, although between 1942 and 1943 the Germans had strongly reinforced their night fighter force, to the great detriment of the German armies in Russia and the Mediter-  THE OFFENSIVE UNDER WAY 147  ranean, and had also in this interval brought their radar-assisted night fighters and anti-aircraft guns to a point of extreme efficiency.  As an objective Essen differed from a number of Ruhr towns in that the huge Krupps works, covering several hundred acres, was right in the heart of the city. Elsewhere very large and important factories might be on the outskirts of the town, where they could not easily be destroyed in the course of area attack, though there was no general rule; the Rheinmetall Borsig plant at Dusseldorf, an armament works of about equal importance to Krupps though not so well known, was not so far from the centre of the city as to be outside the target area for a general attack on the place. But it must be emphasised that in no instance, except in Essen, were we aiming specifically at any one factory during the Battle of the Ruhr; the destruction of factories, which was nevertheless on an enormous scale, could be regarded as a bonus. The aiming points were usually right in the centre of the town; the average German city had spread outwards from an old centre, which was naturally more densely built-up than the newer and well-planned suburbs; it was this densely built-up centre which was most susceptible to area attack with incendiary bombs. The objective of the campaign was to reduce production in the industries of the Ruhr at least as much by the indirect effect of damage to se
