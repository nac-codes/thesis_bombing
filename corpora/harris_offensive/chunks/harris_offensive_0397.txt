was most susceptible to area attack with incendiary bombs. The objective of the campaign was to reduce production in the industries of the Ruhr at least as much by the indirect effect of damage to services, housing, and amenities, as by any direct damage to the factories or railways themselves. At this stage of the war there was no alternative method or means of attacking German industry, but at the same time I had good reason to believe that the indirect effects of this general damage would be extremely important in the long run.  During the first five months of the Battle of the Ruhr, Essen was by no means the only target. Dortmund, one of the most important centres of heavy industry in Germany, Duisburg, Bochum, Gelsenkirchen, Oberhausen, Mulheim, Wuppertal, Remscheid, Munchen-Gladbach, Krefeld, Munster, Aachen, Dusseldorf, and Cologne were all heavily attacked and in most instances heavily damaged, the devastated areas amounting to hundreds and in some instances to thousands of acres, usually right in the centre of the city. Several of these towns were not, of course, strictly within the Ruhr area, but belonged to the same industrial complex; all were within Oboe range.  The two towns which had been most heavily damaged in 1942, Cologne and Dusseldorf, were attacked again in 1943 and  148 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  far more extensive damage was done than in the previous year. There was, I believe, some surprise when the general public learned that we were attacking Cologne again, after damaging the city so severely in the 1000 bomber attack. But, of course, the 600 acres previously damaged left a good deal of Cologne still standing and in the interval the enemy had made the most strenuous efforts to repair the place; in 1942 the Germans had been able to carry out repairs on a scale that was never possible afterwards. In the first years of the war the German policy was to conceal air-raid damage with hoardings behind which the repairs were carried out at high speed. Ther
