or even twice again to prevent recovery, could there be any decisive effect. The possession of Oboe and an average striking force of seven to eight hundred bombers had done a great deal, but we had by no means solved the problem of attacking cities outside Oboe range, and Germany still had vast industrial resources out of the Ruhr.  THE OFFENSIVE UNDER WAY 149  I therefore needed much more than I had got in the way of priorities, industrial resources, equipment, reinforcements of personnel, and aircraft, if I was to complete the task which I had only just begun. It was still as necessary as it had been in 1942 to convince those in charge of the war and, indeed, the general public, that if given the weapons the bomber force could do the work.  The results so far achieved were spectacular enough to have aroused a great deal of interest in the work of Bomber Command and this I naturally welcomed. I wanted everyone to see for themselves what the bomber offensive was doing to Germany, and to this end I took pains to get the facts properly illustrated in photographs, charts, and so forth. I had a large book prepared, which we called the blue book, in which after each attack on a German city the area of devastation was progressively marked with blue paint over an air photograph, or rather a mosaic of air photographs, of the city a as whole. This book eventually extended to two or three enormous volumes which could be sent anywhere about the Command or elsewhere. But I also wanted people to see the damage for themselves, not in diagrammatic form, and to get any real idea of the damage in an air photograph taken from a great height it is necessary to look at it through a stereo- scope; this is the method always used in the interpretation of photographs taken by reconnaissance aircraft because it brings out details which might be easily overlooked in ordinary photo- graphs. In particular, air raid damage shows up to an extent that would hardly be believed by those who have o
