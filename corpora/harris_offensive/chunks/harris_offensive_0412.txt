uch an occasion when there had been much doubt and argument between the services whether to hold on to Tobruk; it was by then a foregone conclusion that the rest of our forces would have to retire a long way farther East. I have never known Churchill at a loss on any question of pure strategy; naturally enough, the service representatives would often have to press him to reject or alter a solution he proposed when the right decision on grounds of pure strategy was unacceptable for lack of resources or for reasons of time and space—which were perhaps not Winston’s strongest suit. On grounds of pure strategy Winston was therefore arguing passionately—I never knew him overrule—for the retention of Tobruk. When Winston asked for my opinion, I supported his desire to hold on, not because it was his idea but because it seemed to me to offer absolutely the only hope of stopping the rot. I pointed out that though there would indeed be difficulties for the Navy and Air Force in supplying and supporting Tobruk, these difficulties on our side, even though our forces were inadequate, would be as nothing to the fears and uncertainties of the enemy when he came to advance far beyond a by-passed Tobruk, with our forces there threatening his com- munications while they were at extreme stretch across hundreds of miles of desert. The alternative for Rommel would be to devote so large a part of his force to the investment and capture of Tobruk that with what was left he would find it impossible to advance farther into Egypt.
