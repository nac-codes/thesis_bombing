was set up, too large to do the work without everybody interfering with everybody else, usually with people at the top who knew very little about the Press and even less about air matters, and who were also unwilling to take any responsibility; consequently the Press got a mass of useless propaganda material and few solid facts or even reasonable arguments. Correspondents of reputable papers were not treated as they should have been if they were to do any good; their questions were answered by slick evasions and they were not given much opportunity to see things for themselves. As to our own operations, I know that there was often the greatest difficulty in getting a fair report of them through the Air Ministry and out to the Press. There was also the Air Ministry’s apparently  THE OFFENSIVE UNDER WAY 157  inevitable fear of hurting someone’s feelings, especially the feelings of the other services, by putting forward its own case. The fact that the Air Force was sinking more submarines than the Navy never seemed to get published at all, just as the fact that Bomber Command sank more German naval ships has never got out, and it should most definitely have been the Air Ministry’s business to see that these facts got out; as it was, the Navy was able to hush everything up on the grounds of security. The activities of the departments responsible for censorship and security were often wholly inexplicable; for example, we were not allowed to have some facts about the Pathfinder Force published at a time when these same facts had already been given in a propaganda broadcast directed to listeners in the Luftwaffe.  However we did, by hook and by crook, get a good deal of support for the bomber offensive in the Press. Arthur Salzberger of the New York Times, a man of intelligence, was as firm a support, once convinced, as a foundation of rock. So also were Ogden-Reed of the New York Herald Tribune, Colin Bedneall of the Daily Mail, and Allan Michie of the Reader’s Digest.  T
