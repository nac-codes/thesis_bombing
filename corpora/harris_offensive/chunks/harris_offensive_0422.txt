expected much from it and was in a considerable state of excitement on the night that it occurred. I myself went with Wallis and Cochrane, who was then A.O.C. of No. 5 Group, to Grantham, the Group Headquarters which 617 Squadron ran; this was only one of innumerable successful operations carried out by 5 Group when it was under the command of Cochrane, a most brilliant, enthusiastic, and hard working leader of men. We spent the night in the operations room waiting for the signals from Gibson which should tell us of the success or failure of the attack. When I learnt that the Mohne and Eder dams had been breached I rang up Washington, where Churchill and Portal were at the time, to give them the news. The telephone personnel seemed never to have heard of the White House, and there was some little difficulty.

I don’t know whether she was eventually persuaded that Winston Churchill came into that cate- gory, but I got through to Portal in the end and told him that the two dams had gone. Another Ruhr dam, the Sorpe dam, was also attacked by two aircraft of the squadron, but this dam was of different construction from that of the other two. It was of earth with a watertight concrete blade as core, and could not be breached outright as the other two dams were, but it was hoped that the concrete core might be cracked and the water eventually seep through the earth.
