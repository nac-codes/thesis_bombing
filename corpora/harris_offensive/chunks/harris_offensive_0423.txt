he said that when he heard no protest from me he knew that the attack must have been a success,  The nature of Wallis’s weapon made it necessary to attack the targets from a height of sixty feet, and this being so, even a small amount of opposition made such an operation extremely hazardous. At the time of the attack the Méhne dam was well defended, but the others were not, and it was clear that such an operation could not be repeated against similar targets if the enemy were to defend his dams at all strongly as he was now perfectly certain to do; in particular, it was extremely doubtful  THE OFFENSIVE UNDER WAY 159  whether the operation could have been carried out at all if there had been searchlights on or near the dams. In any case, it was only possible to attack the dams during a short period of a week or two in any given year, when the dams were at their fullest. For these reasons no further attacks on dams were made with Wallis’s weapon, though the Sorpe dam was attacked with heavy bombs at a later stage in the war; this attack also failed to breach it.  Nineteen Lancasters took off for the attack. Three had to return early, and eight were missing. The Lancasters flew at a very low level the whole way, using a very carefully planned course;’ it is probable that most of the missing aircraft got slightly off course and ran into gun-defended areas. This risk had to be taken since the risk from enemy fighters on a moonlight night to a small and scattered bomber force would have been even greater if they had flown above one thousand feet. There would, of course, have been a better chance of breaching the Sorpe dam or other Ruhr dams—the Schwelme dam was also attacked without effect by one aircraft on the same night—if so many aircraft had not been lost on the way to the target, and if the whole squadron had been able to attack.  The breach of the Méhne Dam released a flood of one hundred and thirty million gallons, but the destruction caused by flooding was not,
