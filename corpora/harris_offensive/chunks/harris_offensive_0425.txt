r cent of a small force dispatched to Essen bombed within three miles of the aiming point by aiming at sky-markers; in all previous attacks on Essen without Oboe the highest percentage of aircraft attacking within three miles of the aiming point was twenty per cent. But there were occasions when even the use of sky-markers was not enough to save an operation from failure; this was when the clouds were so high that the sky-markers quickly fell into them and were lost to sight. This is what happened on the night of May 25th- 26th, when there was cloud up to 20,000 feet over Dusseldorf.  Another difficulty, which led to the partial failure of some attacks, was the small number of Oboe Mosquitoes that could be got over the target during the period of attack, and this was made worse by the fact that the Oboe equipment was inclined to break down in the early stages of its use. We could count on the equipment going wrong in one out of three of all Oboe Mos- quitoes, and as only twelve such Mosquitoes could be put over the target in an hour this was serious; in fact we were never able to maintain absolute continuity of marking during the first five months of Oboe. During the intervals when no ground markers could be seen by the main force, there was always a tendency for the bombing to drift away from the aiming point even though large fires might be burning in the target area at the time. It is true that the main force still had the target indicators dropped by Pathfinder heavies as an aiming point when the Oboe target indicators had burnt out, but these supplementary markers were also liable to drift gradually away from the true aiming point. Moreover the enemy soon began to use imitation target-indi- cators, an obvious expedient. These seldom attracted any bombs when the real target indicators could be seen at the same time; because the enemy was never able to get the imitation quite right. But when there were no real target indicators of the same colour to be seen, the
