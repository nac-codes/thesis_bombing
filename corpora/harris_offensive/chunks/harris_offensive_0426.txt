l target indicators could be seen at the same time; because the enemy was never able to get the imitation quite right. But when there were no real target indicators of the same colour to be seen, the forgery was not so easily detected and the bombing went astray.  In July, 1943, things got much better because we were able to get a third pair of Oboe ground stations working, which meant  THE OFFENSIVE UNDER WAY 161  that we could bring eighteen Oboe-Mosquitoes over the target within an hour. The most successful attack on Essen up till then, the attack on the night of July 25th-26th, was the first to be made after the third pair of Oboe ground stations had been set up, and the Oboe marking was almost continuous during the fifty minutes of this attack. Five days later, in an attack on Remscheid, con- tinuous Oboe marking was achieved for the first time, and the greater part of the city was destroyed. This was particularly significant because Remscheid was a good deal smaller than most of the towns attacked during the Battle’of the Ruhr, so that any drift away from the aiming point, such as was usual when the Oboe marking was not continuous, would have wasted a great many bombs.  By the spring of 1943 we had gota fair quantity of our aircraft equipped with a new and far more efficient bomb-sight, the “Mark XIV”; I had been asking for this “tactically free ” sight for years. As soon as the enemy really took his defences in hand it became obvious, as it had long been, that the older bomb- sights would not do for the average operation, though they might still be useful in special precision attacks by highly trained crews. With the older types the aircraft had to be flown straight and level for much too long and the risk was altogether excessive; with the Mark XIV bomb-sight the aircraft can be flown in any reason- able way the pilot chooses up till the moment of releasing the bombs, and the bombs can even be accurately aimed while the aircraft is climbing, gliding, or maki
