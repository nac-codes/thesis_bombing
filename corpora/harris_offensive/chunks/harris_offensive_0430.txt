I went on asking for this very necessary and not very complicated requirement, but I only began to get a few of them at the end of 1943, and a few of the roo Ib. type a whole year later. Production was always un- certain, the projectiles were not properly packed, and they were easily damaged by the weather or in handling. In fact almost everything went wrong, and in the event we failed to geta satisfactory projectile of this type for holding incendiaries before the end of the war. Our incendiary attacks would have been vastly more efficient and effective if the armament and production authorities had not bungled everything as they did.  _ Besides the 4
