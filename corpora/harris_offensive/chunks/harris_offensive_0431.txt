fore the end of the war. Our incendiary attacks would have been vastly more efficient and effective if the armament and production authorities had not bungled everything as they did.  _ Besides the 4 lb. incendiary we also used a 30 Ib. phosphorous incendiary, which was not so good at raising fires as the four- pounder, but could at least be aimed; its use also had a marked effect on the morale of the enemy. Another incendiary, the A he bomb, a kind of flamethrower, was under development early in 1943, and I may as well give the lamentable history of this bomb. I was told in the middle of April, 1943, that it was going to be produced in quantity. In August the enthusiasts for the bomb staged a demonstration of it at my headquarters, where a little wooden house was built and a sample “J” bomb applied to it. I Was not impressed by the design or effects of the bomb, though it certainly produced a rather spectacular jet of flame. Our own unit fire brigade did not altogether cover itself with glory on that occasion; they were supposed to put out the remains of the fire, but their hose went wrong and they only succeeded in giving me and some others a good sprinkling. After this trial I said that I did not want to judge the issue in advance, but I wanted to be certain that production of the “J” bomb would not hold up production of the 30 Ib. phosphorous bomb. Later I found that essential pyrotechnic bombs for the Pathfinders were being held up because the “J” bomb was getting priority. When a small number of “J” bombs arrived in December—a large quantity had previously been promised by October or even earlier—the first type was unsatisfactory; we got a new type in February, 1944. Next spring and summer we tried out the “J” bomb ten times on operations, and conclusively proved that ton for ton it was just half as effective as the 4 Ib. incendiary. This was a weapon which looked well on paper and was put into production without regard for the opinions or needs of the people
