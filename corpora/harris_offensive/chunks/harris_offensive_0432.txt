that ton for ton it was just half as effective as the 4 Ib. incendiary. This was a weapon which looked well on paper and was put into production without regard for the opinions or needs of the people who were going to use it In any case, we really had no need for another incendiary bomb;  THE OFFENSIVE UNDER WAY 163  what we wanted, and what we could not get was some means of preventing the 4 Ib. incendiary from scattering and of making it possible to aim it.  By contrast with the way things too often happen in this country the Americans show what seems to us a perfectly astound- ing speed and efficiency in getting things done when there is an emergency. But I do not think we have very far to look for the reason for this. If, for instance, a drastic modification is required for operational reasons to a Flying Fortress, the general who runs the Flying Fortresses says “get on with it,” and they get on with it. But in England the matter is’argued about by all sorts of junior officers at the Ministries concerned and then once again by all sorts of irresponsible and very often operationally ignorant officials in places like the Ministry of Aircraft Production. After that the manufacturer, who may not want to be bothered to undertake the modification, is very naturally inclined to play one Ministry against another, and both Ministries against the fighting man in the field. This eases the pressure, and he probably gets away with it and never has to make the modification.  Besides the instances I have given, there is the fact that it took me more than three years of bitter dispute and argument to fail to get a serviceable and useful .5 inch gun-turret through the official channels. The only time we were ever supplied with -5 inch armament as standard equipment, was when we got some American light bombers equipped with these guns for operations by No. 2 Group, which, of course, had really nothing to do with our main striking force and the main offensive.
