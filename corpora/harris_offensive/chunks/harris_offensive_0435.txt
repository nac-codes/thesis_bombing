Battle of Berlin. A revolution in tactics. The invasion of Europe ends the campaign of strategic bombing.  T WAS essential, for the whole progress of the offensive, to be able to attack targets east of the Ruhr and beyond Oboe range. In June of 1943 I was instructed to give first priority to centres of German aircraft production, because of the growing strength of the German air force, which threatened both the bomber offensive itself and the projected invasion of Europe. The 8th United States Army Air Force was to attack the principal airframe and other aircraft factories while my Command was to attack those industrial towns in which there was the largest number of aircraft component factories; most of these towns, as it happened, were farther east or south than the Ruhr. But it was not only because of the intrinsic importance of the targets themselves that it was advisable to attack objectives farther inside Germany; there was also the risk that if I concentrated exclusively on north-west Germany for too long a time the enemy would shift his defences to that area, thereby economising in men and material and at the same time increasing our losses. During the late spring and early summer the short nights would inevitably confine our attacks to the west of Germany and largely to targets within Oboe range, but I had to take the earliest opportunity to carry out operations at greater range. — ‘ On June 2oth-21st, 1943, when the nights were shortest, I laid on an attack on the former Zeppelin works at Friedrichshafen on the shores of Lake Constance, a factory which was producing radar apparatus. The defences there were comparatively light and the target would not be difficult to find, especially as a picked force of Lancaster crews of No. 5 Group was to make the attack. On this occasion No. 5 Group initiated a new tactic which was to be of the greatest importance in the later stages of the war; the whole attack was directed by an experienced officer who was 165  16, Sd
