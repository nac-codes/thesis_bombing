worked badly, and out of 15 major operations with H2S marking in the next two months, only three could be considered reasonably successful. The H2S apparatus was liable to get unserviceable even more often than the Oboe equipment in the early stages of its use; scarcely more than half the sets worked properly in the average operation. Two few aircraft were equipped with H2S—it was not until September, 1943, that all the heavy bombers of the Pathfinder Force were so equipped—and in con- sequence far too few target indicators were burning at any given moment during the attack; this meant that it was impossible for the backers-up to strike a fair average and make any correct estimate of the mean point of impact. It was also found that bomb-aimers had a tendency not to rely on the H2S equipment but to aim their target indicators at what they could see; some- times they would merely aim at target indicators already burning on the ground, and this, of course, made it quite impossible for the backers-up to strike a genuine average. As soon as this was discovered Pathfinder crews were, of course, most strictly in- structed not to aim visually and they were told that if their H2S equipment was not working satisfactorily they were not to drop any markers at all. Another cause of failure was even more easily removed. Special target maps for use with H2S had been prepared in which the built-up areas had been drawn to look as far as possible like the actual image of them that would appear in the  166 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  in touch with the rest of the force by radio-telephone. It would of course, have been quite impossible for aircraft to attack a target so far south in June and get back to base in darkness but on this occasion it was arranged that the bombers should fl on to North Africa after attacking the Zeppelin works, land ther and refuel and reload, and then fly home again. attackin the Italian naval base at Spezia on the way back. The Zeppelin wis were in themselves an impo
