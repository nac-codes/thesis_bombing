The Zeppelin wis were in themselves an important target, but a further reason for carrying out this rather elaborate operation was that it would help to spread the enemy defences; Friedrichshafen had ever reason to consider itself safe from attack, especially in the tue months, and this unexpectedly deep penetration might well caus other places outside the more vulnerable areas to scream fay defences, and it might prevent the defences from being removed from similar areas. A “shuttle service” attack was not an opera tion that could be at all frequently carried out because, as I ‘i : very well, bases outside England would not have any ade faite facilities for maintaining and servicing heavy bombers; as Pass the arrangements on the airfield in North Africa where the Lancasters landed were far from satisfactory. But it was iH worth while on this occasion to keep some of our Lanckis inactive for a week or so. The attack on Friedrichshafen was successful ; the Zeppelin works were heavily damaged—about half its equipment was probably destroyed—and a tank engine facto close to the Zeppelin works was also damaged. vd The only possible navigational and bombing aid for u outside Oboe range was H2S. At the beginning of 1943 we had very few aircraft equipped with H2S, and very little idea of tl best method of using it in operations. During the first tw ie three months of 1943 we only had an average of about 14 air i ft equipped with H2S for use in any one attack, and it he ob ine that for the time being H2S, like Oboe, would have to b diet asa Pathfinder device. Later on we might be able to take ae tage of the fact that H2S, unlike Oboe, could be used b ra see limited number of aircraft at the same time, but for the eager  we had to base our tactics on the use o: D’ e: ba ne f H2S b y a small number of  aft of the Pathfinde
