H2S would not be as cee on Db aa  aisle that some of the markers dropped on H2S alone, with no  visual identification of the target, w: ;  S arget, would scatter. To  this we used a new method of i ter Sater a d of marking. Afte i  eh let ; ‘ r the first tar  indicators had been dropped blind by H2S the main force as  LONG RANGE ATTACKS 167  instructed to aim, not at the markers themselves, but at what was estimated to be the centre of them, or to put it more technically, their mean point of impact. This was obviously a pretty difficult thing for the average crew to attempt under operational con- ditions and in the face of heavy defences, so to help the main force we appointed a number of Pathfinder crews flying heavy bombers to estimate this mean point of impact and mark it with target indicators of a different colour from those dropped by the first H2$ marker aircraft.  The forces used to mark the mean point of impact were called “backers-up” and later “visual centerers.” In the first H2S opera- tion, against Hamburg on the night of January joth-z1st, 1943, there were five backers-up, but this proved to be far too few to keep up continuous marking throughout an attack, and thereafter weused about 20 backers-up. When the weather was good enough, the backers-up were instructed to look for the aiming point in the light of flares dropped by the HS markers.  This plan of attack, though rather elaborate, sounded all right at first, In practice it worked badly, and out of 15 major operations with HaS marking in the next two months, only three could be considered reasonably successful. The H2S apparatus was liable to get unserviceable even more often than the Oboe equipment in the early stages of its use; scarcely more than half the sets worked properly in the average operation. Two few aircraft were e uipped with HaS—it was not until September, 1943, that all the heavy bombers of the Pathfinder Force were so equipped—and in con- sequence far too few target indicators wer
