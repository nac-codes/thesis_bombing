on. Two few aircraft were e uipped with HaS—it was not until September, 1943, that all the heavy bombers of the Pathfinder Force were so equipped—and in con- sequence far too few target indicators were burning at any given moment during the attack; this meant that it was impossible for the backers-up to strike a fair average and make any correct estimate of the mean point of impact. It was also found that bomb-aimers had a tendency not to rely on the Has equipment but to aim their target indicators at what they could see; some- times they would merely aim at target indicators already burning on the ground, and this, of course, made it quite impossible for the backers-up to strike a genuine average, As soon as this was discovered Pathfinder crews were, of course, most strictly in- structed not to aim visually and they were told that if their H2S equipment was not working satisfactorily they were not to drop  any markers at all. Another cause of failure was even more easily removed. Special target maps for use with H2S had been prepared in which the built-up areas had been drawn to look as far as possible like the actual image of them that would appear in the  169  : was to be By March then Berlin e hours of to prolong us a better icentration  : of March s from its impossible ised serious s from the ss premises the end of ty by H2S runs from ive a good o find any t of March mark from y identified thing went 2vented the the target he markers in January |.6 per cent, and well- aight have attacks on ings in the id sent all- and higher then either 1 so large a ters for the lalifaxes in  ro attempts which had now that  168 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  H2S screen or cathode-ray tube, but it was found that these maps were not always up-to-date. On the night of February rgth-2oth, 1943, the Pathfinders mistook a new suburban area in Wilhelms- haven, which had not been marked on their maps, for the actual target area. We had all the H2S target maps revised at once to accord with the late
