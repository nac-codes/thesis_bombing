Pathfinders mistook a new suburban area in Wilhelms- haven, which had not been marked on their maps, for the actual target area. We had all the H2S target maps revised at once to accord with the latest air photographs of the targets.  There had been a great deal of scepticism in the early days of the war about whether H2S could ever be developed beyond the point of being a mere scientific curiosity; the idea of being able to see what amounted to a complete map of a iown in total dark- ness or through unbroken cloud, is indeed, so astonishing that there is no wonder that some too hard-headed people had their doubts about it. For myself in spite of my wide experience of lunatics and lunatic weapons, I have seen too many apparently mad ideas put into practice to reject one of them, provided it is backed by men who obviously knew their job. But it must be admitted that some of our first experiences with H2S did suggest that the scientists had been rather optimistic about it. In practice there was sometimes little or no relation between the real shape of a town and the image of it that appeared in the H2S apparatus; it seemed that much depended on the angle or direction from which the town was viewed. In fact, it was impossible without previous experience to predict exactly how any particular town was going to show up in the H2S apparatus, with the result that only the most skilful and experienced navigators could use H2S with any real accuracy; this meant that there were bound to be a good many failures while crews were still new to the job. It was found that the difference between land and water showed up far more clearly than the difference between buildings and open ground, which meant that costal targets could be more easily identified than targets inland. It was also found that small towns were more easily attacked by H2S than large built-up areas, because it was fairly easy to identify the town as a whole but extremely difficult, in most cases, to distinguish any
