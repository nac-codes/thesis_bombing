found that small towns were more easily attacked by H2S than large built-up areas, because it was fairly easy to identify the town as a whole but extremely difficult, in most cases, to distinguish any particular area in the town from the town as a whole.  In the course of the preliminary and <perimental phase in the operational use of H2S my Command carried out three attacks on Berlin. It may be remembered that I had been continually pressed to attack the German capital during 1942 and had resisted making any attack while my force was still too small to attack so well-defended a target; in January, 1943, when the force was just large enough to stand some chance against the defences of  LONG RANGE ATTACKS 169  Berlin, I had laid on two attacks in which the target was to be identified visually and without any navigational aids. By March of the same year we were getting very near the time when Berlin would be outside the range of heavy bombers in the hours of darkness, it was obviously of great importance not to prolong the immunity of the German capital, and H2S gave us a better chance than we had had before of getting some concentration of attack.  The first H2S attack on Berlin was on the night of March Ist-2nd. The target was so large that- the responses from its buildings entirely filled the H2S screen and it was quite impossible to identify the aiming point. However, the attack caused serious damage in the south western suburbs, about six miles from the actual aiming point, destroying many factories, business premises and houses. Two further attacks on Berlin towards the end of March revealed a new difficulty in attacking the city by H2S marking. This time it was decided to make timed runs from landmarks on the outside of Berlin which would give a good response on the H2S screen, but it was difficult to find any landmark which fulfilled the condition. On the night of March 2gth-3oth, a lake, the Miiggel See, was used as the landmark from which to begin a timed ru
