e H2S screen, but it was difficult to find any landmark which fulfilled the condition. On the night of March 2gth-3oth, a lake, the Miiggel See, was used as the landmark from which to begin a timed run, and this was in fact visually identified in the light of flares. Unfortunately, although everything went well with the marking, bad weather on the route prevented the main force from arriving in time to bomb before the target indicators had gone out. In another attack in March, the markers themselves were wrongly placed. For the two attacks in January and three of March of this year, our casualty rate was 4.6 per cent, which was remarkably low for so difficult, distant, and well- defended a target. Moreover, much heavier losses might have been expected owing to the fact that in these March attacks on Berlin I was compelled to include Halifaxes and Stirlings in the force. In the January attacks of the same year I had sent all- Lancaster forces, because of their greater bomb load and higher ceiling. but there were really not enough Lancasters then either to saturate the defences or do any serious damage to so large a target; by March I still did not have enough Lancasters for the task and so I reluctantly had to send Stirlings and Halifaxes in spite of the great risk they ran from flak.  In April and May of 1943, my Command made two attempts to destroy the Skoda Armament Works at Pilsen which had become of much greater importance to the enemy now that  170 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  Krupps at Essen had been so heavily damaged. Unfortunately both attacks were unsuccessful; the bombing concentrations were remarkably good for so distant a target, but the main force had aimed with great accuracy at markers placed a mile or two away from the aiming point.  By April we had developed a standard H2S marking technique which, with some small changes, we continued to use until the end of the war. The attack began with a wave of H2S aircraft, all of which at the same moment dropped target
