em at the beginning of the attack and trust to backers-up to keep the target continuously marked by aiming new flares at those previously dropped. r  It was therefore necessary, when the cloud was very thick, for the H2S aircraft to drop their sky-markers not altogether at the beginning of the attack but at intervals throughout it. The difficulty was to plan an attack in such a way as to arrange for the H2S aircraft either to mark the target altogether, or simply  LONG RANGE ATTACKS 171  at intervals, according to the state of the weather; it was obviously very difficult to organise an attack in such a way that either of two entirely different systems of timing could be used at the last moment. We did our best to get over this by dividing the H2S blind marking force into two sections, one to mark the target at the beginning of the attack and the other to mark it at intervals throughout the attack. But this meant that we had, in fact, to double the blind marking force if either method of marking was to be carried out really effectively, and we never had enough crews who were fully experienced in blind H2S marking for this. As a result, there was seldom any very close concentration of attack when the target was marked entirely by sky markers, though occasionally we did achieve a remarkable success.  Even when the target indicators could be clearly seen on the ground and had been accurately dropped around the aiming point a curious and rather unexpected difficulty turned up. If H2S had been as accurate as Oboe there would have been no trouble, but it never was, and therefore a very great deal depended on finding the mean point of impact of a considerable number of target indicators distributed over a comparatively large area. It was found that even when everything was satisfactory at the begin- ning of an H2S attack there was a persistent tendency for the focus of the bombing to shift gradually away from the aiming point, so much so that the whole attack might by the e
