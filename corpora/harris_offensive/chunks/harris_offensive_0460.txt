ad to be ready to carry the offensive deeper into Germany. This, of course, would normally mean heavier casualties than in attacks on north-west Germany and the Battle of the Ruhr had not been won without heavy losses. In spite of the fact that our navigational aids gave essential protection against the enemy’s fighters by enabling us to operate on dark and cloudy nights, in spite of the fact that we nad achieved a remarkable concentration of the bomber force in time and space and by this means had sometimes cut down our osses to as low as 3 per cent in individual attacks, and in spite of the fact that we seldom went deep into Germany in the spring and early summer of 1943, the enemy had so effectively reinforced his defences, especially the night fighter force, that the situation was almost as serious as in 1942. We were:once again getting very near the danger line when expansion would be seriously affected unless the losses could be cut down, and this at a time when we should have to accept the added risk of operating much farther east and south if we were to continue the offensive. It is true that we had the satisfaction of knowing that the harm we were doing to the enemy’s war industry was out of all proportion to our own losses and that the enemy was only inflicting these losses on us by leaving the German army in Russia disastrously short of aircraft. But even so, and however great might be the strategic effects of our operations, it would be impossible to maintain the offensive unless something was done to cut our losses down.  There was also the danger that if our loss rate increased, or even if it remained steady at somewhere between 5 and 6 per cent of all sorties, we should find it increasingly difficult to make any accurate attack beyond Oboe range; with anything less than a foolproof navigational and bombing aid, and not even Oboe was that, the accuracy of attack would always be in inverse proportion to the strength of the defence, and the complicated H
