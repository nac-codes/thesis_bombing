thing less than a foolproof navigational and bombing aid, and not even Oboe was that, the accuracy of attack would always be in inverse proportion to the strength of the defence, and the complicated H2S marking technique was most liable to go wrong when crews were distracted by an energetic defence.  As I have explained before, we had known the main answer to the German defences for a long time; there was every reason to believe that if the authorities would only allow us to drop strips  LONG RANGE ATTACKS 173  of metallised paper during our attacks we should hopelessly confuse the enemy’s radar on which he relied for the control of his night fighters and the accuracy of his gunfire. Early in 1943 there had already been developed a suitable form of this weapon for jamming the enemy’s ground control stations, radar-sighted guns, and airborne radar for interception. And we had already worked out the quantity of strips of paper that would be required, the rate at which it should be dropped, and the areas over which it should be released. It cannot be said that there was ever an occasion when we did not need to use this weapon, but we needed it as much as ever before at the end of July, 1943, and it was just at that time that the Air Ministry after I had urged the use of this weapon at repeated intervals for many months, decided that it was now possible to accept the risk of the enemy using the same weapon against our own defences. The strips of paper—they were given the code name “Window”—were dropped for the first time on the night of July 24th-25th. The target was Hamburg, beyond Oboe range and therefore attacked by means of the standard H2S marking technique described above. Like other coastal targets, Hamburg was particularly easy to identify by H2S, for the outline of water gave us a clear response on the H2S screen. Some 700 aircraft attacked, and the weather was in every way favourable. el :  A publication intended only for German official use describes what hap
