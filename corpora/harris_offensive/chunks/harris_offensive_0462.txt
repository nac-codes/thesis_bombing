water gave us a clear response on the H2S screen. Some 700 aircraft attacked, and the weather was in every way favourable. el :  A publication intended only for German official use describes what happened. On the night of July 24th-25th our attack caused gigantic fires which could not be put out even after 24 hours had elapsed.  “Coal and coke supplies stored for the winter in many houses caught fire and could only be extinguished weeks later. Essential services were severely damaged and telephone services were cut early in the attack. Dockyards and industrial installations were severely hit. At mid-day next day there was still a gigantic, dense cloud of smoke and dust hovering over the city which, despite the clear sky, prevented the sun from penetrating through. . . .

To comprehend these . . . one can only analyse them from a physical, meteorological angle. Through the union of a number of fires, the air gets so hot that on account of its decreasing specif
