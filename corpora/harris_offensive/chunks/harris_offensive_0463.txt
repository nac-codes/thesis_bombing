storms. To comprehend these . . . one can only analyse them from a physical, meteorological angle. Through the union of a number of fires, the air gets so hot that on account of its decreasing specific weight, it receives a terrific momentum, which in its turn causes other surrounding air to be sucked towards the centre. By that suction, combined with the enormous differ- ence in temperature (600-1000 degrees centigrade) tempests are caused which go beyond their meteorological counterparts (20-30 centigrades). In a built-up area the suction could not follow its shortest course, but the overheated air stormed through the street with immense force taking along not only sparks but burning timber and roof beams, so spreading the fire farther and farther, developing in a short time into a fire typhoon such as was never before witnessed, against which every human resistance was quite useless.”  Another report says that the fire storms were so violent and the suction so strong that trees were pulled out of the ground. But this was not the end of the battle of Hamburg. On the night of July 29th-3oth my Command attacked again in force, and the German impression was that this was the heaviest of all attacks in terms of the weight of bombs dropped. On this night most of the destruction was in areas that had not been hit before. The official German report described the attack as follows:  “The failure of the water system and the fires which still remained from earlier attacks severely hampered all work. The whole of Hamburg was on fire. Rescue... evacuation, clearing of vital roads, fire fighting, etc., asked the impossible from all available forces. Economically, Hamburg was knocked out, as  LONG RANGE ATTACKS 175  even the undamaged parts had to stop work on account of the destruction of water, gas and electricity supplies.”  After the attack on the night of July 27th-28th hundreds of thousands of the inhabitants of Hamburg were evacuated and only the defence forces were lef
