erefore be able to get useful imformation and make valuable deductions from what we were broadcasting; in the attempt to mislead, we might on occasion give the enemy a very good idea of the real target and lose a hundred or more aircraft. Our broadcasts therefore confined themselves to telling the enemy air-crew to land, warning them that weather at their bases was deteriorating, or making tuning transmissions. All this distracted the German crews, shook their confidence in the genuine running  g  Germany hi mainly of w the enemy h  nidsEGE wht patrolling fighters, but he gradually saw the folly of this and it commentary, and wasted the very short time that they had in much in exc became the usual practice for authority to be given to one con- which to reach the real target. We had evidence of the effectiveness  178 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  bombers’ target had been guessed they were kept circling round a number of beacons. Then, when the defence organisation had made up its mind about the target, the fighters were at once sent there, with the object of intercepting the bombers over the target or of following and intercepting them on the return flight. The fighters were now far more dependent than they had been before on visually intercepting the bombers by night, and to help them the enemy used great numbers of searchlights in the target area; the searchlights were used either to catch the bombers in their cones or to light up the cloud base so that the bombers could be seen from above silhouetted against the clouds. At the same time some of the enemy fighters were detailed to drop large numbers of illuminating flares over the targets or to lay these in lanes along the bomber’s probable route as they ran up to the target or left it. A considerable number of single-engined fighters were also thrown into the battle, and used to intercept the bombers over the target.  This method of defence did achieve some success, even in the first few weeks of its use, but it had great dis
