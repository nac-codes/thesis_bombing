my had for years been preparing an attack on England by wholly new weapons. Even before the war we had been warned of the possibility that the Germans were attempting to develop long-range projectiles such as rockets, and in the summer of 1943 the threat was obviously becoming serious and was taken very seriously by the British Government. The Germans had no bombers with which to attack our cities, largely because our area bombing had put the whole German air force on the defensive, but it looked very much as though the Germans were going to develop a very efficient substitute; in fact, their dis- coveries might well have made all bombers obsolete; there were, for example, quite substantial reports of a rocket weighing 80 tons with a warhead containing ten tons of explosive. In 1943, to raise morale at a time when terrific damage was being done to the German cities, the enemy were uttering a series of threats about new secret weapons to be used against the English; but we had much better information to go upon than this. It was known that these secret weapons were being developed at a particular  LONG RANGE ATTACKS  180 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  of this method when we began to hear the enemy controllers lose their tempers.  The enemy reacted by prefacing his messages with code numbers, but we were prepared for this and almost immediately used the same code numbers. On one occasion the enemy suddenly got a woman to broadcast the running commentary, but this had been expected and a German-speaking woman was already waiting at our broadcasting station to take over from our announcer. From time to time, while our announcers took a rest, we broadcast lively extracts from Hitlerâ€™s speeches to the German air-crew. It was very satisfactory to imagine the irritation of the enemy crews as they flew aimlessly about in darkness, trying to pick up the instructions they knew were being broadcast to them but getting only the screams of their Fuehrer.  It was in point of fact a physical im
