This was a built-up area projecting outwards from the main part  LONG RANGE ATTACKS 181  of the city in the shape of a hook; theoretically it ought to have come out very clearly on the H2S screen, but in practice it did not. In the second attack, the Pathfinders again tried to use this projecting bit of the city to get an H2S fix, but this time there was yet another cause of failure; the winds were wrongly predicted, and in consequence the main force came in to attack on the wrong track and at the wrong time. In the third attack, which was on the night of September 4th-5th, we reverted to the method of making a timed run from the same lake, the Miiggel See, which had been used as a landmark in the attacks of the previous March. Once again, the attack was not made near the real aiming point, which escaped damage. But as against this, a large area in the suburbs was destroyed. In all, about 560 acres of Berlin had now been destroyed, and the last three attacks had also caused serious industrial damage in the Siemenstadt and Mariendorf districts.  Berlin is a city half the size of London, and 500 acres were therefore not at all a large area of devastation in proportion to the whole, especially as very little of this damage was in the most densely built-up areas of the city. Nevertheless it was enough with the Germans still under the influence of the catas- trophe at Hamburg, to cause a panic evacuation; many observers said that the crowds leaving the city were as large and as terrified as those which had fled from Hamburg itself.  Meanwhile the enemy had for years been preparing an attack on England by wholly new weapons. Even before the war we had been warned of the possibility that the Germans were attempting to develop long-range projectiles such as rockets, and in the summer of 1943 the threat was obviously becoming serious and was taken very seriously by the British Government. The Germans had no bombers with
