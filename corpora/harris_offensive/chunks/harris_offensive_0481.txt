be no question of trusting only to H2S for the identification and marking of a target of this nature and Peenemunde was far beyond Oboe range. Even in moonlight, it would be an extremely difficult task to destroy the whole establishment. Its buildings lay scattered in a narrow strip along the coast line and there was obviously a great risk of wasting most of the bomb load unless some new method of attack was devised; there would clearly have to be several aiming points with different sections of the force assigned to each of them. It was also known that Peenemunde had a smoke screen and, though the target indicators would show through this and timed runs from a marked position outside the smoke screen would help, the marking itself would be a complicated business.  The tactics eventually adopted were a combination of the normal Pathfinder tactics and those worked out by No. 5 Group for attacks by specially experienced crews. There was, for example, a Master Bomber to assess the accuracy of marking and to give instructions by radio telephone to the whole force; it will be remembered that 5 Group had used this tactic in the previous June in an attack on Friedrichshaven. The main force bombed target indicators dropped by the Pathfinders and were guided by route markers laid by them, but a force of Lancasters from 5 Group were to attack separately in the later stages of the attack, when there was reason to fear that the markers would be obscured by smoke, by making a time and distance run from Riigen Island, a convenient landmark close to Peenemunde. If, when the crews had made their time and distance run, they found that the Path- findersâ€™ target indicators coincided with the position they had reached, then they were to bomb there. If the target indicators  LONG RANGE ATTACKS 183  were obscured, or obviously misplaced, the crews were to bomb on the time and distance run alone; in any case they were to be guided by the instructions of the Master Bomber provided by the
