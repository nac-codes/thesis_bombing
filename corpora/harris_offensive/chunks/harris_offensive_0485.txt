uctions of the Master Bomber provided by t Pathfinder Force, It was clear that such tactics could not be efficiently used without previous training, and exercises in track: ing and timing were carried out for several days before the attack over country near one of our bombing ranges where the coastline and other landmarks bore some resemblance to the neighbourhood of Peenemunde, The value of such exercises was shown by the fact that in the first practice errors of 1000 yards and more were common, but in the last practice the margin of error was cut down to 300 yards. The important point was that the Island of Riigen, from which the time and distance runs were to be made, should be visible on the night of the operation,  It was obviously essential not to cause alarm and despondency in England by publishing the reason for this operation and the implied fact that the Government was treating the threat of the German secret weapons so seriously; it was even necessary to keep this fact from the bomber crews themselves because if not there would certainly have been an eventual leakage. At briefing the crews were therefore told that some highly specialised radar equipment was being made and developed at Peenemunde and that if this was not stopped the German night fighter defence would be greatlyimproved and our own bomber casualties would rapidly increase, The crews were also told that this was a matter of such extreme importance that if the operation failed of its object on the first night it would have to be repeated on the next night, and on all suitable nights thereafter, regardless 0 casual ties and regardless of the fact that the enemy would obviously do everything possible to increase the defences of the place after the first attack. This warning would, it was hoped, ensure that the crews would make even greater efforts than usual to destroy the target in one attack. They were to bomb from 8000 feet, much below the usual operational height. ;  We had to accept the gr
