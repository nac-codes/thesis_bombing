the target there was again a good deal of cloud and the smoke screen was working, but the very careful planning of the attack ensured a good con- centration of bombs on all the aiming points. The master bomber’s instructions proved very helpful. It is clear that the enemy was at first deceived by the feint attack on Berlin, but not for long enough for the bomber force to get right away before the fighters came up; the last part of the force was intercepted and in bright moonlight 4o of them were shot down, a serious loss but by no means as serious as it might well have been. There was heavy damage to almost every section of the establishment and before long it was known that the enemy’s casualties had been heavy and that many scientists and important members of the staff had been killed.  This was the first counter-attack delivered by the allies against the enemy’s V-weapon offensive. A year later the Eighth United States Army Air Force carried out three attacks on Peenemunde, where the research station had been constructed, and of course, a vast bomb load was eventually dropped by allied bombers on the V-weapon launching sites, as will be described later. The “Overall Report” of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, issued in September, 1945, says that Bomber Command’s attack left the experimental work at Peenemunde unaffected, and suggests that the three later attacks by the American bombers, though they were made after the development of V.1 (flying bombs) had been completed, may possible have had some effect on the development of V.2 (rockets). In point of fact it was noticeable that after Bomber Command’s attack on Peenemunde the enemy became much less definite in the threats he uttered about the secret weapons he was preparing for England: in particular he ceased to mention any specific dates when the V-weapons could be expected. There was never, of course, any question of putting a complete stop to the use of V-weapons by bombing Peenemunde; we knew ver
