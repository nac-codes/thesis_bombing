avy aircraft of the Pathfinder Force were by then equipped with it. A question of policy then had to be decided, whether H2S should continue to be used as a Pathfinding device, or whether it should be used as an instrument for blind bombing as had been originally intended. The fact that attacks were always more successful when the H2S marking could be checked by visual identification of the aiming point suggested that there was little to gain by experimenting with a new technique, but on the night of November 17th-18th 83 aircraft of the Pathfinder Force made an experimental blind bombing attack with H2S on Mannheim-Ludwigshafen, two cities only separated from each other by the Rhine. No markers were dropped and the crews were all instructed to bomb on H2S alone. The radar people were much excited by this experiment, and it did, in fact, achieve some success. Sixty per cent of the bombs were estimated to have dropped in the target area, and 50 per cent within a mile and a half of the aiming point.
