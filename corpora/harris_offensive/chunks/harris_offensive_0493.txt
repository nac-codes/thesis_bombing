R OFFENSIVE  were got by the highly trained crews of the Pathfinder Force, all of them experienced in the use of the H2S apparatus; it is very unlikely that crews of the main force would have done so well. H2S was, however, of great value to the main force as an aid to navigation on the route, and routes were often chosen which took the force over landmarks which showed up well on the screen. By the end of the year 12 squadrons of the main force were equipped with H2S.  By the middle of November a number of Pathfinder aircraft were equipped with H2S Mark III, and the Command had also got an instrument, the Ground Position Indicator, which made it possible to carry out accurate timed runs even in very heavily defended areas. This, then, was in my judgment the right moment to begin the really heavy attack on Berlin which was so long overdue. It was, of course, most unfortunate that we had not been able to begin the Battle of Berlin as soon after the destruction of Hamburg as the nights were long enough. We should then have been able to strike just when everybody in Berlin, and for that matter in Germany, had been thrown into a state of panic by the news of what happened to Hamburg. And we should also have been able to take advantage of the confusion into which the use of Window had thrown the defences; by November, the fighter defence had been reorganised and strongly reinforced, though even so it was not as effective as it had been just before the use of Window. But the three attacks on Berlin which we had carried out in September had altogether failed to hit the centre of the city and until we got the new type of H2S I con- sidered it better to attack other cities which we had a much greater chance of destroying, especially as any attack on Berlin, even after the first disorganisation of the enemyâ€™s ground control system, was bound to be more costly than an attack on any other target within reasonable range. Moreover there was this advan- tage in attacking Berlin du
