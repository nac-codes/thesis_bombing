disorganisation of the enemy’s ground control system, was bound to be more costly than an attack on any other target within reasonable range. Moreover there was this advan- tage in attacking Berlin during the winter months that at this time of year bombing efficiency was invariably reduced, but not proportionately so much in attacks on Berlin, because of the great size of the target, as on any other town.  The Battle of Berlin, as it came to be called, began on the night of November 18th-19th and lasted until the middle of March, 1944; in all, my Command made sixteen major attacks on the German capital. The whole battle was fought in appalling weather and in conditions resembling those of no other campaign in the history of warfare. Scarcely a single crew caught a single  LONG RANGE ATTACKS 187  glimpse of the objective they were attacking and for long periods we were wholly ignorant, except from such admissions as the enemy made from time to time, of how the battle was going. Thousands upon thousands of tons of bombs were aimed at the Pathfinders’ pyrotechnic sky-markers and fell through unbroken cloud which concealed everything below it except the confused glare of fires. Scarcely any photographs taken during the bombing showed anything except clouds, and day after day reconnaissance aircraft flew over the capital to return with no information. We knew, of course, from what the Germans said, that we were hitting Berlin, but we had little idea of which attacks had been successful and which had gone astray. Then, after six attacks, a reconnaissance aircraft did bring back some not very clear photographs which showed that we had at last succeeded in hitting the enemy’s capital hard; there were many hundreds of acres of devastation, particularly in the western half of the city and round the Tiergarten. Then the clouds closed again over Berlin and the Command made eight more attacks without any means of discovering whether all or any of them had been as successful as t
