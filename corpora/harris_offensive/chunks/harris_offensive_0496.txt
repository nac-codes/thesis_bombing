Of this total 1000 acres had been destroyed in American daylight attacks and subsequent Mosquito attacks also did con- siderable damage, but all the rest must have been done in the main Battle of Berlin,  The Battle of Berlin cost us 300 aircraft missing, which was a loss rate of 6.4 per cent. This could not be considered excessive for a prolonged assault on this distant, most difficult, and most heavily defended target; it was equivalent to the loss rate, before the use of Window, against Hamburg, which was less heavily defended than Berlin and could be attacked after only a short flight over enemy territory. But it did mean that the enemy had succeeded in reorganising his defences and finding new tactics.  In spite of our jamming and interference with the instructions broadcast to fighters, and although all routes were worked out whenever possible with the intention of deceiving the enemy, our losses began to rise soon after the beginning of the Battle of Berlin and the opposition was no longer mainly over the target and on the return flight, but on the outward journey. It was clear that the long flights over Germany to Berlin and other eastern targets gave the enemy controllers ample time in which to get the fighters together from all over Germany and then direct them to the area within which it was judged that the bombers would attack. Against this wedevised a new kind of routeing; the bombers now took a course towards an important target and then turned at the last possible moment towards the real objective. But by the new year the enemy had given up directing the fighters to any particular area; they now were sent directly from the beacons they were orbiting into the bomber stream as it flew across Germany, or even when it was still on its way across the North Sea, These tactics we
