ular area; they now were sent directly from the beacons they were orbiting into the bomber stream as it flew across Germany, or even when it was still on its way across the North Sea, These tactics were not invariably successful, but when the fighters did get into the bomber stream and the weather was reasonably favourable for interception, then our losses were much above the average; in some attacks in February, 1944, we lost between 70 and 80 aircraft, though on other nights the bombers were able to make as deep penetrations with a loss of only one or two per cent of the force. It was also discovered, towards the beginning of 1944, as we had always anticipated, that the enemy was using the route markers dropped by the Pathfinders as land- marks and turning points as a guide to the movements and whereabouts of the bomber stream. To counter this, Mosquitoes were sent out to drop misleading route-markers and also fighter flares similar to those used by the enemy, but before long it was  LONG RANGE ATTACKS 189  decided that it would be best to abandon our route-markers altogether; the main force was now largely equipped with H2S, the standard of navigation was much improved by this and other measures, and route markers were no longer indispensable.  On the night of November 3rd-4th, 1943, the monitoring station in England heard the powerful broadcast station at Stuttgart interrupt its programme and issue brief instructions to fighters. This was clear proof that our jamming and interfer- ence had been highly effective against the special broadcasts to the fighter force, but by using such a powerful station as Stuttgart the enemy might have got away with it if we had not been fortunate enough to have an even more powerful broadcasting station in the country with which to jam the Stuttgart station. After a while our jamming made the enemy abandon this method, but he still used Stuttgart. After a careful watch on the ordinary broadcast programme it was suspected that the
