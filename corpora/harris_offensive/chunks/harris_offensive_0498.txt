m the Stuttgart station. After a while our jamming made the enemy abandon this method, but he still used Stuttgart. After a careful watch on the ordinary broadcast programme it was suspected that the enemy was using it to convey messages in code to the fighters; one kind of music, or the playing of a particular musical instrument, meant a particular area in Germany and indicated that the target had already been attacked or conveyed an instruction to land. This was obviously a cumbrous and uncertain method of broadcasting orders, but it was the best the enemy could do.  The jamming war, against the enemy’s early warning system, radar of all kinds, and communication with the night fighter force, had become so complicated that in December, 1943, we formed a new group, 100 Group, which did no bombing but was entirely concerned with this new and highly scientific kind of warfare. 100 Group’s heavy bombers, which included a number of Fortresses because these could fly at a greater height than our own night bombers, carried the very large and complicated machines that were now being used for jamming, and some squadrons of the Group flew Mosquito fighters equipped with an instrument for homing on the enemy night fighters’ airborne radar used for interception of bombers in the dark. These Mosquitoes were flown by a number of the most experienced night-fighter crews in England; they had gained their experience with Fighter Command, but now that German bombing attacks on this country were negligible, they were transferred to Bomber Command and so went over to the offensive. The formation of such a specialist group was put forward from Bomber Command in June, 1943, approved by the Air Ministry at the end of September, and ready to operate on a small scale in December.  188  destroy: dayligh siderabl main B  The loss rati for a pr heavily the use defende: flight o succeed¢  In sp broadca whenev: losses b Berlin a and ont that the targets , the figh them to woulda bombers turned
