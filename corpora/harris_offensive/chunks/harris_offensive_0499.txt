As an alternative, we could divide the striking force into two parts, and either send the two forces to two different targets or to the same target by different routes; this should effectively divide and confuse the enemy’s air defence and the two shorter bomber streams should be more difficult to plot. Or again, two separate attacks could be made on the same target on the same night, with a long enough interval of time between them to ensure that the fighter force which had gone up to attack the first bomber force would have landed and dispersed itself when the second bomber force arrived, Diversionary attacks by Mosquitoes were by now having little effect and the enemy appeared to have no difficulty in distinguishing between those and the main assault; it was therefore decided in February that comparatively large forces of heavy bombers should in future be used for diversions, We therefore dispatched minelaying aircraft in considerable numbers by routes which would suggest to the enemy that they were coming to attack a town, and we also sent out forces of several hundred bombers from the operational training units and heavy conversion training units which flew acros
