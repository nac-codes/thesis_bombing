est to the enemy that they were coming to attack a town, and we also sent out forces of several hundred bombers from the operational training units and heavy conversion training units which flew across the North Sea until they were near the enemy coast and could be plotted, when they at once turned back and made for home.  As soon as possible, we abolished the use of route markers, because it was known that the enemy was using them for his own purposes; an obvious plan to use radio transmitters dropped at turning points on the route had to be reluctantly abandoned because of the difficulty of procuring such equipment. And we decided to use a southern route across France and Germany as often as possible, because we had learnt that the enemy’s defences were much less efficiently organised there than in the north and west. The essence of the new tactics was variety; it was important to use as many different methods of confusing the enemy as possible and to see that no one of these methods was used too frequently or for too long a time,  The effect of these new tactics was almost immediate. In  LONG RANGE ATTACKS Igl  attacks on targets in Germany our loss rate for the first two operations in February was 7.1 per cent, and for the last three attacks in February 3.3 per cent. At theend of March our casualties went up again because on two operations we ran into most abnormal weather and lost 10.5 per cent of sorties, so that the loss rate for the whole month’s attacks on Germany was 5.1 per cent. But for the whole of April’s attacks on German targets the loss rate was only 3.5 per cent and thereafter it was clear that we had at last got the measure of the German defences and had the enemy at our mercy. We had also, by this time, got together a striking force of formidable proportions, though it is true that it was still little more than a quarter of the size of the force originally projected. In 1943 we had throughout the year an average of 570 heavy, 106 medium, and 41 l
