expected that the damage we had done to German industry—and for the size of the force it was most impressive—would be repaired in five or six months if we gave the enemy any respite from strategic bombing, and so I informed all concerned. That respite we were now proposing to give him; there was no alternative if the most formidable military problem of this and possibly of any war was to be solved and Europe was to be invaded across thesea. Naturally I did not quarrel with the decision to put the bomber force at the disposal of the invading armies once the die had been cast; I knew that the armies could not succeed without them. The entry of America into the war and the time we had gained in which to build up large and well-equipped armies had made all the difference. In 1940 and for some time thereafter, it had seemed to me that the plans some people were making for the re- invasion of the continent were wildly optimistic and absurd. It was only quite late in the day, after America was in the war and not really until adequate forces had at last been built up, that the full magnitude of the proposed task was appreciated; the in- vasion of Europe was even seriously contemplated for 1943, ata time when any such attempt would inevitably have led to the greatest military disaster of all time; I remember that I had to argue strenuously against this premature invasion. As to the campaign for starting a second front in 1942 to oblige the Russians, a campaign which was waged with considerable energy in the Press and the House of Commons and even became an issue at by-elections, I can imagine no better example of that lack of realism which seems to affect whole sections of the community in wartime. But by 1944 it was clear that we had a good chance of success provided that all the armed forces of Britain and America available in the European theatre concentrated on this single task, the strategic bomber forces no less than any other. At the same time it seemed to me necessar
