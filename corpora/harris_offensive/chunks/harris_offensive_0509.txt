he armed forces of Britain and America available in the European theatre concentrated on this single task, the strategic bomber forces no less than any other. At the same time it seemed to me necessary to take a realistic view and to appreciate the fact that if Bomber Command was now to engage almost exclusively in army co-operation work, then all the work of our single year of strategic bombing could be undone in about five months. No one could tell how soon it would be before the armies could dispense with the heavy bombers but, as it seemed to me, the part that the destruction of German  LONG RANGE ATTACKS 193  industries by the heavy bombers would play in the war as a whole would depend almost entirely on how soon they could get back to the offensive against German industrial cities.  Meanwhile the strategic bombers, both R.A.F. and American, had already done one service to the Army which was of incalcul- able importance in preparing the way for the invasion. Solely as a result of Allied bombing by day and night the German air force which had been used with exceptional efficiency to blast a path across Europe for the German armies, was now incapable of offensive action and hopelessly unbalanced. Early in 1944 the Order of Battle for the German air force was as follows: one-sixth in the Mediterranean, two-sixths on the eastern front and three- sixths on the western front, engaged almost exclusively in the defence of German cities and consisting almost wholly of fighters with the result that there was a great shortage of fighters on the eastern and Mediterranean fronts. The Germans, in fact, had already lost air superiority in Russia and this had already had a profound effect on the eastern campaign; it would have had a still greater effect if the Russians had had an air force capable of taking advantage of the situation. As far as a land campaign in the west was concerned, it was obvious that there was no hope of succeeding without complete air superiority, and t
