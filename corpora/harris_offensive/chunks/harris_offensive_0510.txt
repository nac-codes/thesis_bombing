air force capable of taking advantage of the situation. As far as a land campaign in the west was concerned, it was obvious that there was no hope of succeeding without complete air superiority, and the fact that the German air force was now largely engaged in the highly specialised task of defending German industry, and was largely designed and trained for that purpose, guaranteed air supremacy for the R.A.F. and the U.S.A.A.F. No one could say whether the German air force would be thrown into the invasion battle, but if it was, it would consist almost entirely of fighters; almost the whole German bomber force had by this time been converted to night fighters which could play no part whatever in any land battle. And if the German day-fighter force, which already tended to avoid battle except when faced with an attack on some vital target, should fight it out with the Allied air forces on and after D-Day, we were fully prepared for this engagement and would welcome it.  Since the previous June of 1943 when German centres of aircraft production had become first priority targets for both British and American bombers, many successful attacks had still further reduced the strength of the German air force. During the Battle of Berlin, Bomber Command continued to bomb many industrial cities associated with aircraft production, and in spite of the fact that winter weather could normally be expected to  B.O.

On the contrary, I expected that the damage we had done to German industry—and for the size of the force it was most impressive—would be repaired in five or six months if we gave the enemy any respite from strategic bombing, and so I informed all concerned. That respite we were now proposing to give him; there was no a
