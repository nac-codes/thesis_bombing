For it was wildly improbable that the allies would capture any port intact, and, if not, it would be impossible to land anything like the quantity of supplies that the Germans could bring up by railway. In fact, if the issue of any battle could be regarded as mathematically certain, this would be so. But if by any chance the German army failed to wipe out.the allies as they straggled ashore, then there would be the problem of breaking out of the beachhead, surrounded as it would be by an iron ring of Panzer divisions.  This appreciation of the situation was exact in all particulars except one—it overlooked the existence of a heavy bomber force, More particularly, it overlooked the existence of Bomber Com- mand, which at this stage of the war could still drop a greater weight of bombs, and much heavier bombs, than the Flying Fortresses of the U.S.A.A.F.  It was perhaps natural that the Germans should make this mistake. The Allied bombers had so far‘confined themselves entirely to strategic bombing and had never yet been successfully employed on a large scale in a tactical réle. If they were to be used in this way, the U.S.A.A.F. had certainly been trained in precision bombing, and most tactical bombing is aimed at small targets, but without Bomber Command it was most unlikely that the allies would be able to drop a large enough weight of bombs to have any decisive effect. Very occasionally, Bomber Command had attacked small targets like Peenemunde, but by far the greater part of its work had been against very large indus- trial cities, and there was little reason to think that the whole force could be rapidly switched to the destruction of small targets; on the contrary, all previous experience had gone to show that the R.A.F.’s heavy bombers, with their futile .303 defensive arma- ment, could not o
