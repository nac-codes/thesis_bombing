apidly switched to the destruction of small targets; on the contrary, all previous experience had gone to show that the R.A.F.’s heavy bombers, with their futile .303 defensive arma- ment, could not operate by day in the face of any serious opposi- tion, and could not hit small targets by night except when the opposition was negligible and the weather and light exceptionally good. Any sustained campaign against a large number of small tactical targets could not be carried out.in any reasonable period of time if the bombers had to wait for such unusual conditions.  It was obvious to me that the heavy bomber offered the only conceivable means of breaching the Atlantic Wall, destroying the enemy’s interior lines of communications, and thus enabling the army to break out of its beachhead when it had gathered sufficient strength. Of these three problems, the most complicated was that  THE INVASION OF EUROPE 197  of disrupting the enemy’s communications; it would certainly take much longer than the other tasks, and would therefore have to be the first to be undertaken—the date for this elaborate campaign to begin was March, 1944. The plan of the campaign was worked out by the competent authorities in Shaef—Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. It was entirely the conception of Tedder, who certainly has one of the most brilliant minds in any of the services, and it was forced through against continuous opposition, some of which was based on the fear that it would turn the French against us. There was, of course, no reason to believe that the bombing would be as accurate as it proved to be, and I myself doubted ‘whether we could achieve the extraordinary precision needed if the project was to succeed. It was Tedder, and the men under him, who saved the British Army in the Middle East when Rommel was threatening Egypt, and then did so much to make El Alamein a victory. In the invasion of Italy, Eisenhower saw what a great commander he was. It was, of course, of th
