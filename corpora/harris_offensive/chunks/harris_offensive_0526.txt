cked crews; in all twelve targets were attacked, from February 8th-gth until the end of March, and only 350 sorties were needed to destroy or very severely damage all but one of them. In the course of these attacks a new technique of low-level marking, with a Master Bomber to check its accuracy, was carefully worked out and proved extremely successful. A single marker was laid by an expert crew about a quarter of a mile upwind of the target. The Master Bomber then estimated the distance and direction of the target from this indicator. The crews of other aircraft were then instructed to measure the strength and direction of the wind; they gave the results by radio-telephone to the Master Bomber and he then struck an average. After this the Master Bomber then calculated a “false wind,” as it was called, which meant that he altered the figures for the real wind strength and direction of the wind in such a way as to ensure that if the bomb-sights were set according to the altered figures, bombs aimed at the target indicator a quarter of a mile from the target would in fact hit the target itself. He then broadcast this “false wind” to the rest of the force, and the attack was made. The great advantage of this method was that every bomb-aimer was able to keep in his bomb- sight a target indicator quite clear of the target itself which could not be blown out by the explosion of the bombs or obscured by smoke.  By this, or by some similar method, there was obviously a good chance of making a whole series of successful attacks on the enemy’s railways, especially as 5 Group’s attacks on the French factories had often been carried out in bad weather. The weather was, for example, almost impossible when an attack was made on the needle-bearing works at St. Etienne-la-Ricamarie, a very small factory; it proved impossible to see the target except from immediately overhead; the clouds were at 6000 feet, and flares could not be used to light up the target. But the presence of  198
