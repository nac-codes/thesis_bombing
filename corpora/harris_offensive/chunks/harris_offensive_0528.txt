them so accurately that the enemy was forced to abandon the whole system which he had originally worked out for the launching of flying bombs. These “permanent” sites were called “Ski-sites,” because of the shape of their constructional works as seen from the air. They would have been able to launch a considerably greater number of flying bombs than those which were sub- sequently used, but they had the great disadvantage that they were easily detected from the air and vulnerable to air attack. By forcing the enemy to abandon this first method of launching flying bombs the Allied bombers gained about six months’ vital respite for Southern England, and, when the flying bombs were eventually launched, the enemy was compelled to use a much less efficient form of temporary site.  Nor were these the only precision attacks which could provide us with data for an attack on the railways of North-Western  citi ad oat ia  Ory  ted idt  ira tal luo  rio no yy wc hand Cth, hts  corm. al es fh ry clin ici a a  Ys  cra teat redan Dat a fect el \biridedasnt veh bt type  rset we a ta aly  rica ri eakeltal ert kn Hie  ett eas ‘itch  is ls  aiubnuya a tiled cigs wt  sec coal aulhan aaa id eta, aulotlacolfiodt  THE INVASION OF EUROPE 201  numbers of aircraft scarcely increased it became ever ative to get the most out of our force.  cational Research Section is indispensable to every n modern war.
