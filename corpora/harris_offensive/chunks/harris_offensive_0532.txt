a number of sorties several times over with instructions to use H2S, and as many with instructions not to do so; this would obviously be a risky and wasteful proceeding. But statistical analysis of pilotsâ€™ raid reports over a considerable period gave the answer with much more certainty, because so many more factors could be taken into account than in an arranged experiment, and with no added risk at all. Thereafter we were able to base our instructions to crews on a rational compromise, using H2S where it was necessary but not where it was merely convenient. In the past, of course, statistics have often been viewed with suspicion and were believed capable of proving anything, but nowadays statistical techniques are so much more refined than in the past that there is little possibility of making seriously fallacious deductions from them. It is, of course, essential for the intelligence sections to see to it that the operational research sections get plentiful data, which they certainly would not have done at the beginning of the war before the importance of statistical analysis of operations was fully realised; admittedly it is often difficult to get really accurate and detailed reports from the fighting man, who has other things to think about, but as time went on very great improvements were made in this respect.  When we had our estimates of the tonnage required for each target we had to take into account the uncertainties of weather  200 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  a Master Bomber meant that tactics could be flexible and the plan of attack was changed at the last minute. The leader of the force decided to mark the boundaries of the target with 3olb. incendiaries and ordered the rest of the force, 15 Lancasters, to bomb these incendiaries through clouds. Although the factory buildings only covered an area of 70 by go yards, they were destroyed.  Before any new tactics for pre-invasion bombing were decided on it was advisable to discover, if possible, just how large a force
