to get from the Operational Research Section a very fair estimate of the weight of attack that would be required for the destruction of any given target. Natur- ally the estimates became more and/more accurate as more operational data were accumulated, and as a result we were able to use our force with increasing economy of effort. Scarcely a month passed during these last two years when some new com- mittment was not given to my Command, and as our strength  THE INVASION OF EUROPE 201  in terms of numbers of airerft scarcely inreasd it became ever  more imperative to get the most out of our fre, An Operational Reseach Section is inispens  sable to every  Command in modem war, The main work of sucha section is stattcalanlyi a method which in some scenes has lngly  taken the place of aranged experiments; itis use  for example,  if tis deste, to find out what i the best ertlier for a given crop in given circumstances, In war its of enormous vue to  be able to substitute statistical probe for an  experimental  operation, and the work of the lange research section at my  Command saved thousands of lives and hundrels wil give an instance of the sort of inquiry that  of aircraft. 1 was made, In  144 we pected thatthe enemy night fighters were “homing”  con tothe HaS tr  ns of our bombers over Germany that  isto say, that they were using these transmisions just as they might ue any radar or radio transmission from an areata a guide tothe bombers whererbouts, An experimental method of  deciding whethe this aboutit, would have be  to dispatch a number o  ion was true, and, iF so, what to do  sorte several  times over with instructions to use HS, and as many with instructions not to do so; this would obviously bea risky and wrstflproceeting, But statistical ana of plots raid reports  over a considerable period gave the answer wil certainty, because so many more factors could acount than in an amined experiment, and wth atall, Thereafter we were abe to base our instruc  much
