e made without anything very new in tactics; markers were laid by the Pathfinder Force by Oboe-equipped Mosquitoes flying at a great height, exactly as in attacks on German cities, but the ¢rews were expressly forbidden to bomb if they could not clearly see the markers, a very necessary precaution in order to avoid casualties among French civilians. But before long a Master Bomber, with a deputy in case of accident or casualty, was dispatched in every attack; it was his business to check the position of the markers dropped by Oboe and to direct the main force to bomb the most accurately placed of these markers; the master bomber was also to mark the target himself after identifying it visually, Later still, markers were dropped by Oboe, some little time before the attack was due to begin, and these markers were intended only as a guide for a flare-dropping force which lit up the target for a number of experienced crews, “visual markers” to mark by sight. This technique closely resembled the standard H2S attack, as described in an earlier chapter, and at first we used the same method of dispatching a force of “ backers-up” to keep up the marking after the first target-indicators had been dropped. But it was then found that backers-up were really unnecessary, because these attacks lasted a very short time and the first target-indicators lasted long enough. For some targets, No. 5 Group used its special method of low-level marking, the bombs being aimed at a target- indicator placed about a quarter of a mile from the target b: st “false-wind” method. Some targets were also marked by No I Group, which developed a variant of the Pathfinder “Forces?  technique for precision bombing. It will be seen that at this stage  of the war we were Setting towards that state of affairs which I  THE INVASION OF EUROPE 203  had recommended when the formation of a Pathfinder Force was first under discussion, for we now had the benefit of several different techniques, developed by differ
