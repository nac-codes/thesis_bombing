hich I  THE INVASION OF EUROPE 203  had recommended when the formation of a Pathfinder Force was first under discussion, for we now had the benefit of several different techniques, developed by different Groups, which were suitable for a variety of targets or conditions of weather. But I do not mean in any way to suggest that the Pathfinder Force, as the force which was mainly responsible for identifying the target, had in any way been superseded or lost its commanding position; on the contrary, I continued to entrust the Pathfinder Force with the identification of the target in nearly all our principal attacks until the end of the war, and, under the leadership of Bennett, the force did brilliant work and continually improved its tactics.  Most of the railway centres in France were defended by few anti-aircraft guns, and as a result we were often able to bomb from much below the usual operational height, and sometimes from well below the cloud level. This, of course, made for increased accuracy of attack. Our attacks on the marshalling yards proved to be astonishingly accurate; never before had there been such concentrated bombing, with the bomb craters over- lapping each other in the target which was churned up into a landscape of fantastic desolation. In fact I may as well say out- right that Bomber Commandâ€™s night bombing, from this point onwards, proved to be rather more accurate, much heavier in weight, and more concentrated, than the American daylight attacks, a fact which was afterwards clearly recognised by Shaef when the time came for the bombing of German troop con- centrations within a mile or so of ourown troops. Some instances of the outstanding results of these attacks were the railway centres of Juvisy and La Chapelle near Paris; each was attacked once, and afterwards not only the primary objectives, the engine round-houses and repair depots, but also the permanent way of the whole marshalling yard and nearly all the rolling stock in it, had disappea
