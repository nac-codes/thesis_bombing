t Bourg Leopold and Mailly-le-Camp. Mailly-le-Camp was the more important of  204 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  though in some few instances attacks by lighter bombers were thought advisable to destroy some particular small building which was not so severely damaged, and might still be of some use to the enemy for repair work. Of the remainder of the 79 targets allotted to all other Commands 38 out of 42 were considered to have been as severely damaged as the 37 targets attacked by Bomber Command.  At the end of May the comparatively long-term campaign against railway repair facilities was so near completion that the Command was able to begin attacking railway targets which formed direct links with the proposed battlefield in Normandy; these attacks were, of course, designed to have the short term effect of isolating the battlefield for a period of days or weeks. This campaign against short-term railway objectives was natur- ally continued after the allies had landed. Up till the end of June, Bomber Command carried out 13,349 sorties against the railways of North-West Europe, dropping 52,347 tons of bombs, with a casualty rate of 2.6 per cent. This 2.6 per cent is the average for 4 months of operations: casualties were low at first, but steadily increased as the enemy began to appreciate what we were up to and what it would mean to him.  In March and early April our attacks on the French railways were seldom opposed by any considerable number of night- fighters, but it was not long before the enemy took measures to protect what he soon realised were vitally important objectives, He began to extend the network of beacons, which already covered most of Germany and served as an assembly point for night- fighters, into France and Belgium, often using airfield beacons for this purpose; the night-fighters themselves were also brought up in large numbers to bases in this area, until there was a large force which could be used against bomber forces making short- range attacks; this for
