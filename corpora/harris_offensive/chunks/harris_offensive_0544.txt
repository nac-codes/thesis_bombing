the night-fighters themselves were also brought up in large numbers to bases in this area, until there was a large force which could be used against bomber forces making short- range attacks; this force was for the most part locally controlled and did not operate far from its base. Before long our casualty rate began to rise; whatever happened, we had to go on attacking targets in the same comparatively small area, without much chance of confusing the night-fighter force by widely separated attacks, and in many instances the target indicators dropped by the Pathfinders must have been visible from the enemys airfields, It was also easier for the enemy to intercept the bombers, even when these were only attacking coastal targets, during the light summer nights. Moreover the enemy had begun to use some new airborne radar equipment, which was much more efficient than  THE INVASION OF EUROPE 205  anything he had had before, and about this we knew scarcely little, though we suspected much, at the time. It is no wonder that by June of 1944 our loss-rate had risen to the critical five per cent for inland targets in France and Belgium. For the moment the only effective counter-measure that could be devised was to make the attacks extremely short; a number of seperate forces, each usually consisting of a single bomber Group, were sent to attack different targets simultaneously.  After the long-term campaign against railway centres, Bomber Command, while simultaneously attacking a number of railway targets near the battlefield, had to concentrate on silencing the coastal fortifications. Here the main problem was how to give no indication to the enemy of where the actual landing was to be made. The only way of doing this was by the wildly ex- travagant method of bombing at least two coastal batteries or defences elsewhere for every one that was attacked on the invasion coast of Normandy. The guns were, of course, extremely small objectives, and the only chance of putting them o
