suggest the steady approach of a convoy at seven knots. This was done by the Lancasters circling with great accuracy in a long series of overlapping orbits for about five hours; in this way, as each orbit came a little closer to the enemy coast, the bundles of metallised paper seemed to be approaching equally slowly. To do this so accurately that the enemy did not suspect that aircraft and not ships were producing the reactions was, of course, a remarkable-feat of navigation.  At the same time Stirlings, reinforced by American Fortresses, carried jamming equipment to limit the range of the enemy’s early warning radar—but not, of course, to the detriment of the feint by the Window-dropping Lancasters. This was a method of jamming which Bomber Command had not been able to use before, but everything to do with the invasion had such high priority that we were at last able to get and use the equipment;  THE INVASION OF EUROPE 207  it proved to be very a valuable weapon against the enemy’s early warning system in the future.  A third force of Bomber Command aircraft, Lancasters of No. 1 Group, patrolled in the direction from which enemy fighters might be expected to approach if they disputed the invasion in Normandy; they carried equipment for jamming the night fighters’ radio-telephone communications with their ground control stations. Curiously enough, although this was only designed to protect the Window-dropping aircraft and the airborne forces landing in Normandy, the enemy was actually the more inclined to believe that the invasion was taking place in the Pas de Calais because they believed that airborne forces approach- ing that area were being protected by this Lancaster force. Finally Stirlings of No. 3 Group, dropping bundles of “ Window” to simulate a much larger force, dropped dummy parachutists, together with machines which made noises like rifle fire and other sounds of battle, in order to make a diversion and cover the real airborne landings in the Normandy
