the officer commanding this depot later came into our hands and it gives an impressive account of the attack. “The main concentration,” he wrote, “was accurately aimed at the most important buildings. ..- In that part of the camp which was destroyed, the concentra- tion of bombs was so great that not only did the splinter-proof trenches receive direct hits, but even the bombs which missed choked them up and made the sides cave in.” Five of the largest ammunition dumps used by the German army and air force were also blown up during May, and in April we destroyed a large explosive works at St. Medard-en-Jalles.  Just before the invasion we were required to put out of action three wireless stations and a radar station, which was successfully done. On the night of the invasion itself besides dispatching 1136 aircraft to attack coastal batteries, we sent over 100 aircraft to take part in a very elaborate radar deception which was designed to make the enemy believe that a large scale landing by sea and air was about to be made near Boulogne and Cap d’Antifer. Two squadrons of Lancasters, one of them 617 squadron, the squadron of outstanding airmen who had breached the Méhne and Eder dams, were to simulate the reactions which a large convoy would produce in the enemy’s coastal radar stations by dropping a special type of “Window” designed for this occasion. The bundles of “Window ” had to be dropped from exactly the right height to give the same reaction as a number of large ships would do, and, what was far more difficult to contri >, the “ Window” had to be dropped in such a way as to suggest the steady approach of a convoy at seven knots. This was done by the Lancasters circling with great accuracy in a long series of overlapping orbits for about five hours; in this way, as each orbit came a little closer to the enemy coast, the bundles of metallised paper seemed to be approaching equally slow To do this so accurately that the enemy did not suspect that aircraft and not
