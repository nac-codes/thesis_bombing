This remark- able bomb was a contradiction in terms; it could penetrate 12 feet of concrete or pierce any ship’s armour, but, whereas most armour-piercing bombs have so tnick a case that they contain little explosive, this one carried terrific power. It was ballistically perfect and had a very high terminal velocity; it could therefore be aimed with great accuracy. It was an entirely different weapon from the 12,000 Ib. high capacity and blast bomb which we had now been using for some months against special targets; this blast bomb was less effective than three 4000 Ib. blast bombs when used in attacks on large areas but was useful in precision attacks on single factories, where the object was to concentrate the destruction into a very small area, even
