of high explosives were dropped in just under 4o minutes. A full account of the effect of this attack on the German troops was afterwards got from the enemy. It appears that casualties were comparatively light, but the effect on morale was shattering; this was confirmed by the state of the prisoners that were taken then, and by what they said about the bombing. German officers on the staff of Runstedt, Com- mander-in-Chief in the West, afterwards described the “ terrifying immobility on the battlefield” which was produced by what they called our “carpet-bombing.” “The troops could not move... the communications system broke down; artillery and anti-tank pieces were knocked out; and tanks were immobilized in craters or beneath heaps of dirt and debris.” After one such attack it was reported that a whole division was without food or supplies for 24 hours. On this occasion, at Caen, it is clear that the enemy lost, for the time being, all power of offensive action but the army unfortunately did not exploit its opportunities, and our armour did not move forward until the morning of July 8th. The German comment afterwards was that it would have been very different if our troops had shown “sufficient initiative in following up the bombing.” As it was, when our armour did go forward, 24 hours later, the first objectives were taken with scarcely a struggle, the enemy in the front line being still in complete confusion. But after the initial success, the armour did not push on.  Shortly afterwards the view was expressed, among staff officers of the Allied Expeditionary Air Force, that as the army did not seem able to take advantage of our tactical bombing, or indeed of our attacks on the enemy’s railways, the heavy bombers might be doing more good by returning to the attack on German war industry and at the same time by bombing what bottlenecks could be found in the production or transport of flying bombs. We knew by now that air attack on the railways was having the most s
