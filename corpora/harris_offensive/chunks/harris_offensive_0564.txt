A  Panzer company which tanks had all but two o}  had gathered in an orchard with its its vehicles seriously damaged; there  was a possibility that two tanks could have moved under their own power, but if so, they could have got no distance but would inevitably have been bogged among the craters all round  them.  Between D-Day and tl  e middle of August Bomber Command  dropped 17,560 tons of bombs on German troop concentrations in the battlefield; eight separate attacks of this kind were made.  Tt was estimated that at  any moment Bomber Command’s 1000  aircraft could put down a barrage which, for the time being, was  equal in weight to the si  hells of 4000 guns. To bring up such a  mass of artillery to the required position in any reasonable time  would, of course, have bombers could strike wit a few hours’ notice.  been a physical impossibility, but the hout giving the enemy any warning at  It is now generally recognised that this “ carpet bombing” of enemy concentrations gave the army several opportunities, which for one reason or another were not taken, to break right through the enemy lines. On one occasion armoured formations were delayed by a traffic bottleneck at the bridges across the river at Caen; the enemy had time to set up a screen of guns behind the area which had been bombed. On another occasion the army did get right through the enemy positions, but could not move forward fast enough after this, In the end it was certainly this  THE INVASION OF EUROPE 213  carpet-bombing which prepared the way for the final break through the German lines, across the Periers-St. Lo highway, which decided the Battle of Normandy. It was concluded after the battle was over that on each occasion the joint air-army operation should have been planned so that the army moved forward the very moment the bombing was over, or even, at some risk from our bombs, that they should begin moving up to the bomb-line before all the bombs had been dropped.
