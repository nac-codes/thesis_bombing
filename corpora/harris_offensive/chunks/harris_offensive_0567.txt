of August Bomber Command dropped 17,560 tons of bombs on German troop concentrations in the battlefield; eight separate attacks of this kind were made. It was estimated that at any moment Bomber Command’s 1000 aircraft could put down a barrage which, for the time being, was equal in weight to the shells of 4000 guns. To bring up such a mass of artillery to the required position in any reasonable time would, of course, have been a physical impossibility, but the bombers could strike without giving the enemy any warning at a few hours’ notice.  It is now generally recognised that this “ carpet bombing” of enemy concentrations gave the army several opportunities, which for one reason or another were not taken, to break right through the enemy lines. On one occasion armoured formations were delayed by a traffic bottleneck at the bridges across the river at Caen; the enemy had time to set up a screen of guns behind the area which had been bombed. On another occasion the army did get right through the enemy positions, but could not move forward fast enough after this. In the end it was certainly this  THE INVASION OF EUROPE 213  carpet-bombing which prepared the way for the final break through the German lines, across the Periers-St. Lo highway, which decided the Battle of Normandy. It was concluded after the battle was over that on each occasion the joint air-army operation should have been planned so that the army moved forward the very moment the bombing was over, or even, at some risk from our bombs, that they should begin moving up to the bomb-line before all the bombs had been dropped.  When the use of heavy bombers in the battlefield, very close to our own troops, was first put forward I expressed doubts; it seemed to me that the army had-no idea of the risk that the troops would be running. In the event, by extremely careful plan- ning and the extraordinary skill of the crews, we brought down that risk to much less than the soldier ran in the last war when his ow
