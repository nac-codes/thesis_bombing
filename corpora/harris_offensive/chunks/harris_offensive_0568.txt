troops would be running. In the event, by extremely careful plan- ning and the extraordinary skill of the crews, we brought down that risk to much less than the soldier ran in the last war when his own guns put down a barrage. The main safeguard was the use of a double check, a carefully timed run by each bomber and a very careful assessment of the position of the target-indicators by a Master Bomber. In one out of the eight such operations there was, in point of fact, a small number of casualties among our own troops.
