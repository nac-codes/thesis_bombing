you very much.”  214 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  On an earlier occasion, Montgomery had said that “it was a most inspiring sight to see the might of Bomber Command arriving to join in the battle.”  When the enemy began his disastrous retreat from Normandy Bomber Command was able to demonstrate the dominance of air power even more conclusively than before. At this stage of the battle the German plan was to set up a whole series of Tobruks in the Channel ports, and for this he was prepared to sacrifice many divisions of excellent troops to the last man. The enemy hoped, of course, to deny us the use of all the main Channel ports and so present the allies with an insoluble problem of supply and communication as soon as they advanced far beyond Normandy. But the enemy was driven out of these strongholds with astonish- ing rapidity. Le Havre was held by more than 11,000 enemy troops; after seven attacks had been made by Bomber Command in one week and 9750 tons of bombs had been dropped, the port was captured, and for the loss of some 30,of our own troops, 11,000 enemy prisoners were taken. After one attack by 762 bombers, Boulogne surrendered within a week and 8000 prisoners were taken. Besides these, Brest, Calais, Cap Gris Nez, and the Ile de Cézembre, which was essential for the defence nt St Malo, were all occupied without troubie after attacks by Bomber Command. Brest was also attacked by American heavy bombers and here we also had the task of sinking several large ships before the Germans could tow them into the right position and sink them to serve as blockships. In past wars, without the heavy bombers, these ports could only have been captured after prolonged siege.  _ The comparatively brief period when the strategic bomber forces both of the R.A.F. and of the U.S.A.A.F. were placed under the control of Eisenhower for all operations related to the inva- sion of Europe and the defeat of the German air force was absolutely the only time during the whole of my command when
