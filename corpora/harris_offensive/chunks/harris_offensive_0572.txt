nd out what they wanted—and their requirements were given priority over any others—I could then get on with what had to be done elsewhere.  At the time of the invasion a large part of our effort was being diverted from support of the Allied armies and even more from the offensive against German industry, as a result of the launching of flying bombs against Southern England. The date of the first launching is given as the night of June r5th-16th, but one of these missiles did in fact reach London in the early hours of June 13th. Ten flying bombs in all were observed that day, but no more came over until the night of the rsth-16th, when a considerably larger number were launched. At once a long prepared plan was put into operation, and Bomber Command’s part in this was to attack what were known as the “modified launching sites” in the Pas de Calais. These were small, easily constructed, and extremely unrewarding targets for air attacks. ‘  The actual battle of the V-weapons had been won by the Allied bombers several months before. Though the victory was so obvious and conclusive, the fact remained that long-range weapons might still be used as a harassing weapon and prove a sore trial to the people of London and Southern England. The enemy had originally planned to launch the flying bombs at the rate of 6000 a day, which would have been perfectly feasible if he had had the use of the first series of 64 launching sites in Northern France with an efficient system of communications behind them. This, of course, would have made the flying bomb a weapon of vast strategic importance. One thousand heavies of Bomber Command could just about drop this weight of bombs on short range targets in 24 hours, but such a rate of attack could not have been carried our continuously and in absolutely all weathers; no weather could, of course, prevent the launching of flying bombs. The enemy intended to use this weapon as a counter- stroke against invasion, and it is difficult to see how
