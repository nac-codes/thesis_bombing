bsolutely all weathers; no weather could, of course, prevent the launching of flying bombs. The enemy intended to use this weapon as a counter- stroke against invasion, and it is difficult to see how an invasion could have been mounted with London inruins, Southern England laid waste, and every type of communication in disorder. But, as always, the Germans made an elementary mistake; they planned what might be described as the weapon of the next war with extreme efficiency, and showed remarkable powers of invention and organisation in doing so, but they completely overlooked the possible effect, though it had already been demonstrated through-  THE INVASION OF EUROPE 217  out Germany, of the dominant weapon of the war in which they were actually engaged. This was as bad a mistake as relying on the weapon of the last war, as the Germans did when they put so much of their effort into U-boats and overlooked the fact that aircraft could effectively attack them.  The first launching sites were, as I have already described, so effectively bombed by the American and R.A.F. bombers that the Germans soon abandoned them; they learned too late, in the beginning of 1944, that it was hopeless to rely on anything vulnerable to bombing, especially at so-short a distance from bases in England. But the bombing of the French railways also had a profound effect on the V-weapons campaign and made largely ineffective the new dispersed sites which sprang up all over the Pas de Calais. In fact the threat of the flying bomb seemed to have been sufficiently removed that it was judged safe to remove all targets connected with flying bombs from the list of objectives for the allied bombers in the weeks before D-Day; in any case, the bomber forces were wholly preoccupied with the preparations for invasion which in the agreed Allied strategy rightly came before anything else. When the bombs were eventu- ally launched the enemyâ€™s supply system was so thoroughly disorganised and the new sites wer
