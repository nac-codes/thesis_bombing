invasion which in the agreed Allied strategy rightly came before anything else. When the bombs were eventu- ally launched the enemy’s supply system was so thoroughly disorganised and the new sites were so ill-adapted to the rapid launching of bombs, that instead of an average of 6000 flying bombs, the enemy was only able to launch an average of 95 a day between the middle of June and the end of August. Of these only two-thirds made landfall and less than one-third reached Greater London after encountering the fighters and anti-aircraft defences of Southern England, but everyone knows how serious a trial these weapons were and can judge for himself what a bombardment more than sixty times as heavy would have been like, especially as the defences would inevitably have been saturated by such a weight of attack and fighters and anti-aircraft guns would have been unable to bring down anything like so large a proportion of all the flying bombs launched.  The flying bombs had only one effect on the progress of the invasion, and this was the diversion of effort from supporting the armies to the defence of England. If the German Air Force had been more combative, the diversion of most of the R.A. F.’s newest and fastest fighters, which alone could catch the flying bombs, would have been a serious matter, and the enormous bomber effort that had to be brought to bear on the launching sites was certainly one of the major contributory causes of the long respite  216 218 BOMBER OFFENSIVE THE INVASION OF EUROPE 219  by installing : which German industry had from air attack, During the second which had the code name of $.N.2, worked on a wavelength such  pocket at Sha half of June, Bomber Command dropped more than 16,000 tons that it could be jammed or confused by a type of Window already  myself.
