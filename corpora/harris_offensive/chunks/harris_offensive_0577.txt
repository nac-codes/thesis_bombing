During the second half of June, Bomber Command dropped more than 16,000 tons on bombs on targets connected with V-weapons, mostly on launching sites, and up to the beginning of September, until the allied armies occupied the Pas de Calais, a further 44,000 tons of bombs. This 60,000 tons of bombs was equivalent to one monthâ€™s bombing at a time when the bomber offensive was at its height. The launching sites were small and very well concealed, and more than half the operations against them were carried out when they were covered by low cloud; nevertheless, nearly all of them were knocked out. Unfortunately, as one went down another sprang up, for they were very cheap and quick to build. When this happened I was directed to attack the supply depots in which the flying bombs were stored before being distributed to the launch- ing sites. These depots were either caves or reinforced concrete structures, but we succeeded in doing a great deal of damage by dropping both ro00 and 12,000
