before being distributed to the launch- ing sites. These depots were either caves or reinforced concrete structures, but we succeeded in doing a great deal of damage by dropping both ro00 and 12,000 lb. bombs on them. The roofs of the caves were often smashed in and the stores of bombs buried under rock and earth.  Four enormous concrete structures in the Pas de Calais were suspected of being intended for the storage of firing of V2, the long range rocket. If we had had a large supply of 12,000 Ib. bombs no doubt we could have smashed these buildings and as it was we caused severe damage with these bombs. But at the same time, attacks with normal bombs made it impossible for the enemy to complete or repair these buildings. Large numbers of concrete mixing machines round about them were smashed to pieces and the ground was so cratered and torn that it became impossible to bring any repair and building materials up.  On 13th July, 1944, the enemy night fighter force suffered a serious reverse. As I said earlier in this chapter, we had begun to suspect that the enemy had greatly improved his methods of interception and the existence of new equipment was vaguely rumoured. It was, of course, extremely difficult to get informa- tion about the work of the German night fighters for the simple reason that they operated over Germany and neither aircraft nor prisoners of war were at all likely to fall into our hands, By an almost incredible, stroke of luck the pilot of a Junkers 88 mistook England for Germany in July 13th and landed with his aircraft quite undamaged on an airfield in England. It was a Junkers 88 of the latest type and it contained two wholly new instruments for detecting aircraft in the dark. The first of these instruments,  THE INVASION OF EUROPE 219  which had the code name of S.N.2, worked on a wavelength such that it could be jammed or confused by a type of Window already in use against the enemyâ€™s early warning system. We had in hand a small but sufficie
