The results of the campaign.  attacks against German synthetic oil plants, and a week after  D-Day Bomber Command was directed to take part in the same campaign by attacking the ten synthetic oil plants situated in the Ruhr. At the time, I was altogether opposed to this further diver- sion, which, as I saw it, would only prolong the respite which the German industrial cities had gained from the use of the bombers in a tactical role; I did not think that we had any right to give up a method of attack which was indisputably doing the enemy enormous harm for the sake of prosecuting a new scheme the success of which was far from assured. In the event, of course, the offensive against oil was a complete success, and it could not have been so without the co-operation of Bomber Command, but Istill do not think that it was reasonable, at that time, to expect that the campaign would succeed; what the Allied strategists did was to bet on an outsider, and it happened to win the race.  This was very far from being the first time that I had been pressed to attack the enemy’s synthetic oil plants. Ever since the beginning of the war these had been the favourite targets of the Ministry of Economic Warfare. They were, indeed, the most important and most persistently recommended of a whole class of objectives which at Bomber Command we always called “panacea” targets. These were targets which were supposed by the economic experts to be such a vital bottleneck in the German war industry that when they were destroyed the enemy would have to pack up. Apart from the single instance of the synthetic oil plants—and they only constituted a real bottleneck in the last year of the war—the arguments of the economic experts had invariably proved fallacious. A good example of this was a molybdenum mine at Knaben in Norway. We were told that this  produced so large a percentage of all the molybdenum required 220  I: THE SPRING of 1944 the Americans began a series of  THE OFFENSIVE AGAI
