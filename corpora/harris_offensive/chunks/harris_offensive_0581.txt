We were told that this  produced so large a percentage of all the molybdenum required 220  I: THE SPRING of 1944 the Americans began a series of  THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST OIL 221  by the Germans that its destruction would be a major disaster to the whole of their war effort. We destroyed the molybdenum mine—with a rather small force of Mosquitoes—and no sooner had it been repaired and was producing again, after an interval of a year or so, than the American Eighth Air Force destroyed it once more. But when we asked the economic experts to show us precisely where or when the predicted disaster was overtaking Germany, they confused the issue with a mass of verbiage. The answer, of course, is that molybdenum, though vital—it is used in special alloy steels required in a great many kinds of armament —is needed in such small quantities that no first-class power would be likely to find itself without enough molybdenum, raked up from here and there or smuggled in at a high price, to keep going for many years of war.  Over another panacea target, ball-bearings, the target experts went completely mad. The Germans had at that time the whole vast industrial capacity of the Continent at their disposal and even if we had by a miracle been able to destroy all worthwhile ball-bearing targets in Germany at a time when we were finding it difficult to identify and hit much larger targets, this would only have embarrassed, not stopped, the German war effort. The experts went so far in their special pleading, when they tried to persuade us to attack ball-bearing factories, that they said these could not be put underground because of damp, dust, and so forth. In fact this particular industry was one of the few industries vital to the German war effort that could have been adequately dispersed and hidden underground, and much of it was. And the enthusiasm of the experts was so great that I was actually told that I should be fully justified in accepting su
