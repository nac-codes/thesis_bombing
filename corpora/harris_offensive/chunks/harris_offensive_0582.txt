ould have been adequately dispersed and hidden underground, and much of it was. And the enthusiasm of the experts was so great that I was actually told that I should be fully justified in accepting such losses to achieve the destruction of Schweinfurt—one of the main centres of the ball-bearing industry—as would put the whole of the bomber force out of action for two months. They paid no attention to the fact that Schweinfurt was too small and distant a town for us to be able to find and hit in 1943.  I hope that some day the history of Sweden’s supply of steel, tools, and bearings to Germany will be written. At the time when we were paying Sweden enormous sums of money for not delivering such things to Germany, the Germans were paying enormous sums of money for orders originally given and then paying extra on top of that to have the finished products smuggled out to them. So you could get paid once or twice over for not producing things, and then get paid smuggler’s rates  Chapter Ten  THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST OIL  Panacea targets. A molybdenum mine.

At the time, I was altogether opposed to this further diver- sion, which, as I saw it, would only prolong the respite which the German industrial cities had gained from the use of the bombers in a tactical role; I did not think that we had any right to give up a method of attack which was indisputably doing the enemy enormous harm for the sake of prosecuting a new scheme the success of which was far from assured. In the event, of course, the offensive against oil was a complete success, and it could not have been so without the co-operation of
