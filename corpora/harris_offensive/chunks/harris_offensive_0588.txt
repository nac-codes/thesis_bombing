Had I paid attention to the panacea-mongers who were always cropping upand hawking their wares, Bomber Command would have flitted continually from one thing to another during the whole period of my Command; the continuity of the offensive as a whole would have been irretrievably lost. ! a  An instance of how costly it could be to listen to the advice of the enthusiasts for panacea targets is the American bombing of the oil refineries at Ploesti in Rumania. Many squadrons of American bombers had to be taken off the main offensive against German industry for long periods, sent to bases in the Mediter- ranean, and specially trained in order to make a spectacular, low level attack on the oil refineries, which could not be followed up— the refineries were not attacked again until April, 1944—and consequently had so little lasting effect that deliveries of Rumanian oil to Germany persistently increased until the spring of 1944.  222 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  for delivering them.

In Europe the weather is such that even if you were lucky enough to find and destroy two-thirds of any list of panacea targets your chances of finding suitab
