iding what could or could not be attacked. In Europe the weather is such that even if you were lucky enough to find and destroy two-thirds of any list of panacea targets your chances of finding suitable weather to attack the remaining third would be very small; at the beginning you would be able to choose any one of a long list of targets and there would be a good chance of finding one in some part of Germany where the weather was favourable for attack, but the chances of getting the right weather for the target would decrease as the number of remaining targets decreased. What is more, when you had reduced the number of possible targets to four or five it would become an urgent necessity to knock them out before the targets which you had already attacked had been repaired; otherwise you would have to go round the whole circle again. That being so you could only hope to get an opportunity of attacking the last few remaining targets by keeping the force in a perpetual state of readiness to attack them the instant that the weather appeared suitable. You would thus frequently have to keep a large part of the force, and possibly all of it, standing idle and missing numberless opportunities of doing worthwhile damage elsewhere in Germany.  When the list of possible targets had been reduced to four or five another difficulty would have inevitably faced us. The enemy would know exactly what we were going to do next and with only a very few targets to guard he could have surrounded these with the most formidable defences, Long before this, in fact after the first two or three attacks, the enemy would have known what we were trying to do and would have had ample time to disperse and hide the particular industry concerned, especially as there would have been no general attack on industrial towns as a whole to impede such work by slowing down the whole in- dustrial life and transport of the country.  With the weather went the factor of long and short nights. In June we could on
