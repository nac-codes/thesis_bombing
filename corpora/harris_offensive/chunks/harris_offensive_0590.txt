In June we could only attack within a circle, the circumference of  THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST OIL 223  which runs through Emden and Cologne, without getting caught in daylight either coming or going. If your bomber offensive was based on a panacea target system you might well find that after completing a large part of your programme you could not finish it before the nights were too short, and thus the enemy would get several monthsâ€™ respite. This could, of course, have been got over when the Americans had built up their strength and were making heavy daylight attacks, but Bomber Command was being pressed to attack panacea targets long before the Americans came in. Moreover, even when the Americans came to our help, so long as Bomber Command could not operate by day a campaign against panacea targets would have had to be maintained by only half the allied bomber forces during the summer, 4  An important factor, which the economic experts never grasped, was that it was only in the closing stages of the war that we had navigational aids such as would enable us to identify and hit isolated targets as small as the average large factory.  For these reasons I had consistently refused in the past to use our main striking force for any length of time against panacea targets. I was confirmed in my decision by the fact that whenever we or the Americans did successfully attack such targets, we were always told, just when the enemy ought by rights to have been surrendering unconditionally, that some other manifestation in that particular war industry had just been discovered, or, that there was some material or product which the enemy could use and was using as an alternative.
