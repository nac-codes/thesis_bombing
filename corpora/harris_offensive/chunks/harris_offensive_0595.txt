it would be of the greatest value to Bomber Command, because it could be used against small targets when these were covered by thick, unbroken cloud and  B.O. i?  224 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  The loss of these squadrons for many months materially reduced the American build-up for the main offensive against Germany itself. Even the extraordinarily successful attack against the Mohne and Eder dams did not have so great an effect on the German war economy as was predicted by the economic experts, and I had therefore learnt from bitter experience to regard their predictions with the greatest suspicion and largely to discount their claims in advance.  When Bomber Command was required to begin bombing the synthetic oil plants in conjunction with the Americans in June, 1944, some of these factors were still present, and others were not. But at least we had by then the means to find and hit the targets in reasonable weather. My main objection was that we were swapping horses in mid-stream. Though the bomber offensive had only begun in 1943 and had ended within a year when we Were put on to invasion targets, the vast damage that had been done in that short space of time showed that if the available bomber forces—ourselves and the Americans—went on and developed the weight of attack that was by then possible, Germany would then without a shadow of doubt be knocked right out in a few months—this view was completely confirmed when we entered Germany. I therefore strongly objected to stopping the offensive for which we had worked for five years, and which was succeeding hand over fist at the very moment when we at long last disposed of such weight of attack as to put all question of failure out of court. On the one side I saw certainty of success, and on the other side still many chances of failure. We had at that time, in June, 1944, no experience to show whether precision attacks on individual and isolated factories in Germany could be successfully carried out in darkness in any but
