s could not be seen. Previously it had been next to impossible to attack small targets such as individual factories in such conditions, except by a handful of Oboe Mosquitoes. H2S was not accurate enough to identify a target of this size; bombing on sky markers dropped by Oboe was too scattered to do effective damage to small targets; ground markers dropped by Oboe could not be seen, and the only possibility was to bomb directly on Oboe, which was not much use when Oboe aircraft could only be guided to the target at the rate of one every five minutes and even then could only drop the bomb-load of a Mosquito. But if we could use a hundred Lancasters to bomb with something like the accuracy of Oboe-equipped Mosquitoes through ten-tenths cloud then it became at least theoretically: possible for Bomber Command to maintain an offensive of some sort against the enemy’s synthetic oil plants through the winter months. Further- more, we might with such equipment be able to operate by day over Germany with much greater safety since we should then have the protection of thick cloud against anti-aircraft fire.  On the other hand I had no means of knowing, in June, 1944, whether GH was going to be as accurate as was claimed. Only the most incurable optimist would at this time of day, after all the experience and disappointments we had had with Gee, Oboe, and H2S, base a change of strategy on the theoretical accuracy of a new navigational aid before it had been used on a considerable scale and for a considerable time in the face of the enemy’s defences. What was known about GH was certainly enough to make it advisable for me to press for the manufacture and supply of the equipment, since it might well stop an important gap in our armoury. But that was a very different thing from basing all our plans for the future on the hypothesis that it would do all that was claimed for it. And, in any case, GH, like all naviga- tional aids dependent on ground stations, was limited in range, w
