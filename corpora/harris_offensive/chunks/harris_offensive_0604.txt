H2S was not accurate enough to identify a target of this size; bombing on sky markers dropped by Oboe was too scattered to do effective damage to small targets; ground markers dropped by Oboe could not be seen, and the only possibility was to bomb directly on Oboe, which was not much use when Oboe aircraft could only only be used by one aircraft at a time be guided to the target at the rate of one every five minutes and Like everything else GH was supplied to us'some time aft even then could only drop the bomb-load of a Mosquito.
