om experimental attacks, made with GH were against flying-bomb sites in July and August, when it was essential for the defence of London to continue bombing these without waiting for clear weather. Stirlings were used for these attacks—they were hopelessly out of date for any operation against a well-defended target but could be profitably used at such short range—and they operated in daylight using a new technique which was, in essentials, the same as that used in the much more important daylight attacks with GH which began later in the year. This tecnnique was developed to make up for the severe shortage of GH equipment; two aircraft equipped with GH led a formation of eight aircraft without GH. The eight aircraft followed in pairs in line astern, with a distance of 200 yards between each pair, and each pair was to bomb when the bombs of the preceding pair were seen to leave the bomb doors. As might have been expected, the bombing of most of the air- craft was indifferent; this was because the crews had as yet had very little practice in formation flying, arid as time went on, as the formation flying improved, so did the bombing.  In June of 1944 Germany still had the Rumanian oil fields; she lost them to Russia in August of that year and this, of course, contributed a great deal, as did the loss at about the same time of the refineries in Poland, towards the success of the offensive against the enemy’s oil. In fact, the loss of the Rumanian fields was, in my view, a pre-requisite for the success of any such offensive. For the time being it was to be hoped that American attacks on the Rumanian refineries, together with the mining of the river Danube, would diminish this important supply. Attacks on these refineries had been resumed in April, a month before the Americans began their major offensive against German oil plants.  When the oil plan was being discussed I described very forcibly my experience with the Ministry of Economic Warfare in the past and expressed
