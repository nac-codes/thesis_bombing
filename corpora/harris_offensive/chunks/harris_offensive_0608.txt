ns began their major offensive against German oil plants.  When the oil plan was being discussed I described very forcibly my experience with the Ministry of Economic Warfare in the past and expressed my view that if this was anything to go by we should certainly be basing our plans on incomplete informa- tion. I had no particular confidence that our economic experts knew how many plants the enemy had, where they all were, and what their building programme was. This criticism was met by the institution of a special committee on oil, and it was lucky indeed that this was done, because the committee very soon began to discover all sorts of alternative sources of oil.  The enemy had, for example, a great number of small benzol and tar distillation plants all over Germany, but especially in the  THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST OIL 229  Ruhr, and our information about these was very inadequate; the committee had at once to get up-to-date and as far as possible complete information about these. Moreover, early in the offensive against oil, Speer put a very competent organiser, Edmund Geilenburg, in charge of the repair, building, and dispersal of oil plants and gave him the highest possible priority for everything that he needed. A corps of 350,000 men worked day and night at this, and it was essential to get the fullest informa- tion about the Geilenburg plan, as it was called. The largest oil plants were restored to full production in a few weeks and were often able to produce a fair proportion of their former output in little more than a week after a highly successful attack. The dispersal of small oil plants above and, to some extent, below ground, taxed our intelligence services to the utmost, and it was not surprising to me, that, during the offensive we got news of additional oil sources almost every day. It was a race between the destruction we could do and the building of new small plants and the repair of the large old ones; good intelligence was absolutely vital in such
