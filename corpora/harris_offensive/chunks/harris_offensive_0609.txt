l sources almost every day. It was a race between the destruction we could do and the building of new small plants and the repair of the large old ones; good intelligence was absolutely vital in such a campaign.  Bomber Command made the first attack on the largest of the ten synthetic oi] plants in the Ruhr about a month after the Americans had begun the offensive against oil, and by the end of September had dropped 12,600 tons of bombs on all ten of these plants. Precision bombing on markers dropped by Oboe in average weather proved far more effective than we had any right to expect. It was one thing to bring this off in the face of such ground and air defences as the Germans could spare for tactical targets in France, and quite another to carry out such complicated tactics with success against all the defences of the Ruhr and necessarily at a much greater height. For at this period the air defence of Germany was still intact, though less efficient than in 1943, when such a campaign would have been wholly impractic- able. I regard the success of this campaign against the Ruhr oil plants as the highest possible tribute to the efforts, efficiency, and heroism of my crews.  In September, 1944, the air defence of Germany crumbled to pieces; the German army was driven out of France and the enemyâ€™s early warning system was lost; at the same time the ground stations for navigational aids could be moved on to the Continent and the range of Gee, GH, and Oboe greatly extended. Every advantage was taken of the desperate position of the enemy defences, and extremely complicated operations were planned  228  for th attack: and A contin Stirlin of date be pro daylig as that GH wl to mak equipp The ei; of 200 the bor As mi; craft v very li the for  InJ lost th contril of the against was, it offensi attacks the rive on thes Americ  Wh my ex] past an we sho tion. | knew h what tl the ins indeed to discc  The and tar  230 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  which made it next to impossible for the en
