of strength which we gained from the introduc tion of GH, and its successful application, may easily be appreciated. The accuracy of the attacks was far beyond all reasonable expectation, but, even so, it proved in practise that GH really more efficient in area bombing than against single factories, No. 3 Group was able to destroy a whole series of rather small towns, Houffalize, Bonn, Solingen, Witten, and Wesel among them, in single attacks by GH when we were called upon by the army to attack such places for tactical reasons. But it was found lat two attacks were often necessary to do really effective damage to a synthetic oil or benzol plant. The concentration of bombing was much greater than in an attack on sky-markers through ten- tenths cloud, but so much less than in an attack where ground markers could be seen that we had to expend a great many bombs to be sure of hitting a small target. In general, a single factory  Bp  BS  THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST OIL 231  can only be destroyed by a concentration of bombing three or four times as great as that required to devastate a town. As the size of the force was necessarily limited, this meant that No. 3 Group had often to put in a second attack as soon as possible after the first. By the beginning of 1945 No. 3 Group had so far improved in formation flying and in the use of the equipment—it will be remembered that with this device calculations had to be made in the aircraft which with Oboe were done on the ground—that bombing errors were greatly reduced. :  But even though these attacks were somewhat extravagant in effort and expenditure of bombs, they were enough to make Bomber Command largely independent of the weather and to destroy the enemy’s very reasonable hope of restoring the oil industry in the winter months. In September Speer, in his capacity as Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production, circulated a telegram to the relevant officials in which he pre- dicted that with the bad weather and fogs of autu
