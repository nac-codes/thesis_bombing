September Speer, in his capacity as Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production, circulated a telegram to the relevant officials in which he pre- dicted that with the bad weather and fogs of autumn and winter “the bombing of synthetic oil plants cannot be carried out with the same precision. In spite of the really considerable damage done, we can in a period of five to six weeks restore production to about two-thirds of the level before the attacks.” But the weather was not as bad as the enemy had hoped—in fact, for once it was almost in our favour—and, still more important, GH attacks could be carried out in all conditions so long as the cloud tops were not above 17,000 feet.  With the lengthening nights Bomber Command was able to prosecute the offensive against oil in a whole series of long-range attacks. With the collapse of the German defences, precision attacks could be made by H2S against targets as distant as Politz or Brux in Czechoslovakia; the new Mark III H2S, with more accurate definition of ground detail, proved of great assistance. In Speer’s opinion Bomber Command’s night attacks were often the decisive factor in putting out of action the largest and most important of the enemy’s synthetic oil plants. “Owing to their greater effectiveness,” he said, “night attacks caused considerably more damage than day raids,” and these night attacks by Bomber Command were, he considered, “more effective in their results than day attacks by reason of the fact that the superheavy bombs caused shattering damage to these plants.” Provided that the problem of getting the markers on to the target was solved it was always easier to get a tense concentration of attack on a small target by night than by day, except, perhaps, on the extremely  230 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  which made it next to impossible for the enemy to concentrate his air defences at any given target that we were attacking or on the route of any particular bomber stream.
