erfectly clear weather. The American system of bombing in formation, like our own formation bombing by GH, was always dependent on the accuracy with which the pilots kept formation and, of course, on the skill of the bomb-aimer in the leading aircraft. It is also true that Bomber Command used heavier bombs than the Americans, and here I am not referring to the 12,000 Ib. and 22,000 Ib. bombs for attacking special targets, but the normal bomb-load.  The United States Strategic Bombing Survey says that “in general repeated air attacks, rather than the severity of any single raid, caused the almost complete break-down of German oil production.” This is true in general of the American attacks, but not of the most successful of Bomber Command’s attacks, where the dense concentration of attack and the heavy bombs used, made the work of repair infinitely more difficult. Leuna, the largest hydrogenation synthetic oil plant in Germany, was attacked twenty times by the Eighth U.S.A.A.F., but when we took over the target in January and February, 1945, Bomber Command had to make only two attacks; it is true, of course, that the cumulative effect of earlier raids made the work of Tepair increasingly difficult, but there can be no doubt at all that our night attacks, where the bombing was concentrated on well- placed markers, were at once more accurate and far more destructive than any other precision attacks made by either of the Allied air forces in the war.  But I must once again insist that these long-range precision attacks of the winter months could not have been carried out with the required persistence if the German defence system had not crumbled; once this had happened the offensive against oil naturally brought about a vicious circle and for the lack of oil the enemy’s fighters were often unable to defend the oil plants. Feint attacks, on nights when there was to be no major attack, with all the apparatus of airborne jamming and aircraft dropping Window to simulate the
