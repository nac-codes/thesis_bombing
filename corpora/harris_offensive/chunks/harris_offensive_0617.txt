hters were often unable to defend the oil plants. Feint attacks, on nights when there was to be no major attack, with all the apparatus of airborne jamming and aircraft dropping Window to simulate the arrival of a far larger force, were some- times used to get the night fighters into the air and so waste more aviation petrol, which was in particularly short supply.  There is no need to describe the effect of the offensive against oil in detail; it is a familiar story. From May, 1944, onwards, when the offensive against oil began, the Luftwaffe’s consumption of aviation fuel exceeded production and it only kept going at  all On its reserves. In June, 1944, Speer was writing to Hitler deploring the “tragic developments” with tegard to the supply  THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST OIL 233  of aviation fuel, which had been cut to a tenth of its former level by June 22nd; “only through speedy recovery of damaged plants,” he wrote, “has it been possible to regain partly some of the terrible losses.” It was after this that the Geilenburg plan was adopted, and it undoubtedly made the task of keeping the synthetic oil plants out of action more difficult than before. But in August the Germans had to curtail the period taken to train pilots, to save fuel used in training flights; this had already been cut down once before. The German army, and especially the Panzer divisions, had so much difficulty in getting supplies up, because of the bombing of the French railway system, that this counted for much more than any shortage-of fuel at home, but by the end of the year the German army, as well as the air force, was desper- ately short of fuel. It is known that when the Ardennes counter- offensive was planned the enemy counted on being able to capture allied stores of petrol and so keep the armoured divisions going; when this hope was disappointed many tanks were stranded for lack of fuel. But even more important, in Speer’s opinion, was the destruction of German communications by bombing; it
