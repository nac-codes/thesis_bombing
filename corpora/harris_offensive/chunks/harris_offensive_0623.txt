No. 5 Group, using bombing tactics which they had worked out for themselves, destroyed quite a number of industrial cities, and so did No. 3 Group using GH. The devasta- tion caused by such small attacks by a single Group was as wide- spread as that brought about by a normally successful major attack by the whole Command the year before. At the same time the Command as a whole had on the average about 1100 heavy bombers available, as opposed to about 600 the year before.  But it was not until September, 1944, that I was able to use this overwhelming force against the enemy’s main industrial centres, which had been given an almost complete respite from bombing for a period of nearly six months, from April onwards. During this period I only carried out attacks on German cities when the weather was unfavourable for operations in France,or when there was no imperative call for tactical bombing in support of the army, or attacks on flying bomb sites, railways, U-boat bases, and oil plants.
