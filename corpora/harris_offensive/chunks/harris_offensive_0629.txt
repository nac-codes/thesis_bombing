In all. 85 per cent of the Command’s effort was used against targets other than German industrial cities between May and September.  We had seen enough during our offensive against industrial cities in 1943 to know how rapidly the enemy got a considerable proportion of a town’s industries working again after a major blitz. I was therefore seriously alarmed by the prospect of what the enemy might have been able to do during this six months’ respite; it was, moreover, a period of critical importance when the enemy was getting into production a whole range of new weapons from jet-propelled aircraft to submarines which could re-charge their batteries under water and were largely immune from air attacks when at sea. In point of fact the enemy did make heroic efforts to repair bombed factories and put up temporary dwellings for the many thousands of workers who had been made homeless by bombing. I feared that the enemy might have made so much headway with this that, we might have lost all the advantage from the damage we did to his industrial towns in 1943. But in any case the only thing to do was to begin again as soon as circumstances allowed. On 25th September Bomber Command ceased to be under the general direction of the Supreme Allied Commander and operational control passed once again into the hands of the Chief of the Air Staff; and it was round about this date that we resumed the offensive for which Bomber Com- mand’s striking force had been called into being. The last flying bomb had been launched from the ground on September 3rd, and a diversion of effort which amounted to 24,000 tons of bombs a month for a period of two and a half months was no longer necessary. And now that France had been cleared of the enemy the army’s demands for our services, though by no means few, were rather less frequent; for the moment Bomber Command was only asked to
