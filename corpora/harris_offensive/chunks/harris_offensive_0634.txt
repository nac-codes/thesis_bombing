not only brought about virtually complete disorganisation close behind the battle- front, but they finally destroyed the war industries of the Ruhr— I am not here referring to the synthetic oil and benzol plants— which had always hitherto been repaired, though with more and more trouble, after each of our attacks. After October, 1944, Krupps ceased production to all intents and purposes until the end of the war and after November the steelworks of Bochum, among the most important in Germany, were equally unpro- ductive.  These are only two examples among hundreds. With the actual, and, as it proved, the final destruction of so many industries in the Ruhr went a grand assault on the communications of the area. The attacks on the Ruhr cities were in themselves disastrous to the enormously intricate railway network of the district; it was not only that railways and railway facilities were themselves seriously damaged, but the whole system became clogged with the extra traffic required by the German army or needed to deal with the disastrous results of Bomber Command’s attacks. Perhaps the most effective of all was a succession of attacks on the Dortmund- Ems and Mittelland Canals, which drained them just as fast as the enemy could repair them; the Americans on one occasion took part in this work and successfully breached the Mittelland Canal towards the beginning of the period. These canals were absolutely indispensable to the enemy for the transport of coal, ore, and heavy warlikestores, toand from the Ruhr; theenormous and, as the Germans must soon have realised, quite useless efforts made to repair the canal embankments were in themselves enough to show that we had found an essential bottleneck in the enemy’s transport system. As a result of the draining of these two canals —the attacks were made at points where the canals passed between embankments over low-lying ground—and of Allied air attack on the German railways, the stocks of coal in the Ruhr rose from 415,0
