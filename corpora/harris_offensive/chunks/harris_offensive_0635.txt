In Essen and many other towns almost everything that could be burnt was already reduced to ashes, and we could therefore only attack with high-explosive bombs which in proportion to their bulk weigh far more than incendiaries.  I had some time ago foreseen that this might happen if the bombing offensive went on long enough, and if, as was very likely, the enemy still kept going after enormous areas of his main industrial cities had been destroyed by fire. I had therefore warned the appropriate authorities that the time might come when we should need an enormously larger supply of heavy case high- explosive bombs than before, when our main weapons had been the 4 Ib. incendiary and the 4ooo Ib. blast bomb—this latter was, of course, essentially a weapon for use agajnst intact buildings and was no great use against already ruined cities in which life was mostly going on in cellars and only the essential factory buildings had been partly restored. But in October, 1944, when we had to substitute heavy case high-explosive for incendiary and blast bombs in a large and continually increasing proportion of our attacks, and had already used vast numbers of heavy case bombs in tactical attacks, I found that my warning had been disregarded. For the last six months of the war we were therefore faced with a desperate shortage of high-explosive bombs and had to live all the time from hand to mouth, d
