nd that my warning had been disregarded. For the last six months of the war we were therefore faced with a desperate shortage of high-explosive bombs and had to live all the time from hand to mouth, doing our best with our own supply and with what the Americans could let us have in spite of their own similar shortage.  The use of ordinary high-explosive bombs, which was quite inevitable, was unfortunately less humane than the use of in- cendiaries and blast bombs, which only caused a large number of casualties when they raised a fire-typhoon, as at Hamburg. A particularly unhappy illustration of this was at Le Havre; when the Germans were still clinging to the port after the Allies had advanced much farther eastwards, on instructions from the army we attacked with heavy case bombs a point of concentration near the docks which we had been assured had been evacuated by the French and was only occupied by German headquarter staffs and troops. Most regrettably the French were still there, and this attack killed and wounded many of them.  THE FINAL PHASE 239  Effective additional damage could only be done to the already devastated cities of the Ruhr by an enormous expenditure of bombs, as muchas four to five thousand tons in a single attack and sometimes up to 10,000 tons of bombs in two attacks in close succession. It was also difficult to estimate from air photographs either the extent or the value of the damage done, since it was often a question of comparing one ruin with another that had previously stood on the same spot. But we learned in the end that these attacks were astonishingly successful; they not only brought about virtually complete disorganisation close behind the battle- front, but they finally destroyed the war industries of the Ruhr— I am not here referring to the synthetic oil and benzol plants— which had always hitherto been repaired, though with more and more trouble, after each of our attacks. After October, 1944, Krupps ceased production to all in
