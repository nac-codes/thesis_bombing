in the Ruhr rose from 415,000 tons in August, 1944, to 2,217,000 tons in February, 1945.  240 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  But during that period the production of coal in the Ruhr fell from 10,417,000 tons in August to 4,778,000 tons in February; the stocks had risen because it was physically impossible to move the coal to the innumerable factories which then stood idle for lack of it.  There could be no better illustration than the success of our attacks on these canals of the complete change in the whole situation of the bombing offensive that had come about between 1943 and 1944. We always knew that the canals were a first-class panacea target and the Dortmund-Ems Canal had, indeed, been attacked as such in 1940. But it was quite useless to attack the canals unless we could be certain of breaking down the embank- ments again just as often as the enemy repaired them, in winter as in summer, and within a very few days or even hours of the repairs nearing completion. The enemy could, after all, have rushed fleets of barges, each containing huge loads of coal, past the threatened section of the canal if we had only given him a few daysâ€™ respite, and Speer himself said in his interrogation that this plan was adopted. He suggests that it was successful and did maintain production in Central Germany, but as he also says that the coal situation became catastrophic in November, 1944, and thereafter caused the most serious dislocation of the whole of the armaments industry, he seems to contradict himself on this point. In any case we kept so close a watch on the canals by photographic reconnaissance and were always so prompt in undoing the work of repair that there can be no question of much coal gaving got through; a little had to be let through since we had to let the Germans get water back into the canals for a few hours on com- pletion of any repair because the water itself was a major factor in force and widening the breaches. If it had been suggested in 1943 that I should div
