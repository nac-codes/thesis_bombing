er back into the canals for a few hours on com- pletion of any repair because the water itself was a major factor in force and widening the breaches. If it had been suggested in 1943 that I should divert even the smallest part of the striking force to the task of blocking these canals I should have dismissed the idea as absurd; it was only towards the end of 1944 that we could hope to hit so small a target as the banks of a canal when- ever we wanted to, in any weather, and with the enemy knowing, as he must have done, just when and where the attack was due to be made.  It soon became obvious that I had no need to fear a great revival of German war industries during the six months’ respite which our preoccupation with the invasion of Europe had given them. In spite of the fact that there were no longer any large cities of the Ruhr to be burnt and that the law of diminishing  THE FINAL PHASE 241  returns compelled us to use a huge bomb-load to destroy what remained, the industries of the Ruhr collapsed quickly and finally; the second battle of the Ruhr, as it might be called, lasted a much shorter time than the first and was far more decisive in its results. I had to conclude that Bomber Command’s main offensive, from March, 1943 to March, 1944, had been more effective than I had judged and that the war industries which the enemy had improvised among the ruins of his towns were far more precarious than I had thought; the Germans could repair Krupps once, twice, or even three times, but the final blow, which was merely part of a shattering attack on the whole Ruhr area left them powerless to restore any of the plant’s productive capacity. All the information we have got from Germany since the war goes to show that it was in the autumn of 1944 that air attack on German war industry as a whole began to have a decisive effect. Here, for example, is a significant passage from Speer’s interrogation:  “Until the autumn of 1944, the diversion of man-power to A.R.P. construct
