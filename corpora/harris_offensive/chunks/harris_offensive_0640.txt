industry as a whole began to have a decisive effect. Here, for example, is a significant passage from Speer’s interrogation:  “Until the autumn of 1944, the diversion of man-power to A.R.P. construction work and the clearance of air raid damage had a disturbing effect on production, for up to that time there was a shortage of man-power in industry. From the autumn of 1944 onwards the effects of air attack were so considerable that a rapidly increasing surplus of man-power became avail- able. The total man-power engaged on work arising from air- raid damage can be estimated at between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 persons.”  What Speer means, of course, is that in the uutumn of 1944 so many workers were idle because the factories they worked in had been destroyed that they constituted a large reserve of men for the clearance and repair of air-raid damage; since this reserve was continually increasing this implies a situation which was manifestly a vicious circle.  From October ist until the end of the war, Bomber Command dropped 153,000 tons of high explosive or incendiary bombs on the industrial cities of Germany, many of them new targets, and many others targets that had often been attacked before. In 1944, the heaviest attacks were made in October, since in November we had to concentrate largely on synthetic oil and benzol plants, while in December and January we had to make heavy attacks on the communications which Runstedt was using for his counter- offensive in the Ardennes and on his troop concentrations. But  B.0. Q  242 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  by December of 1944 we had devastated or very seriously damaged 80 per cent of all the cities in Germany witha population—before the war—of more than 100,000; yet more cities, especially in the east of Germany, were devastated in 1945.  With the German army on the frontiers of Germany we quickly set up GH and Oboe ground stations close behind the front line and this ensured the success of attacks on many distant objectives when t
