ght on the next two days. I know that the destruction of so large and splendid a city at this late stage of the war was considered unnecessary even by a good many people who admit that our earlier attacks were as fully justified as any other operation of war. Here I will only say that the attack on Dresden was at the time considered a military necessity by much more important people than myself, and that if their judgment was right the same arguments must apply that I have set out in an earlier chapter in which I said what I think about the ethics of bombing as a whole.  THE FINAL PHASE 243  In this winter of 1944-1945 we did not, as in all previous winters, use the long nights mainly for deep penetration of Germany; we attacked in the East and West with equal weight. Other important industrial centres in the East, such as Dessau and Chemnitz, were successfully attacked for the first time, and in the West we found new targets in many of the smaller in- dustrial towns, such as Solingen and Pforzheim. Such targets were often attacked as much for tactical as for strategic reasons, because they were not only of industrial importance but had become centres of communication for the Western front or were occupied by troop concentrations or ‘headquarters staffs and organisations. .  The application of methods developed for precision bombing to area bombing greatly increased the average area of devastation in the average successful attack. I have already referred to the use of GH, originally intended for attacks on single factories, for the bombing of towns, and quite different methods were also worked out by No. 5 Group; these were developments of “offset marking,” whereby the bombs were aimed at a marker some distance from the aiming point and therefore clear of smoke from the target, the bomb-sights being set in such a way as to ensure that the bombs did not actually hit the marker or fall near it but overshot and offset it by the right amount to hit the real aiming point
