target, the bomb-sights being set in such a way as to ensure that the bombs did not actually hit the marker or fall near it but overshot and offset it by the right amount to hit the real aiming point. When this technique was first used against tactical targets the Master Bomber made calculations which he broadcast to the main force to ensure that the bomb-sights were corrected, but this, together with the placing of the marker and the Master Bomber’s check of its position, took some time; even against tactical targets in France the inevitable delay caused rather heavy casualties and it was obvious that no force could afford to orbit the target for ten or more minutes in Germany, with fighters coming up all the time and many anti-aircraft guns in the target area continually firing. A modification of this technique was therefore adopted for use against well defended targets in Germany, and at the same time the technique was adapted in a quite simple fashion to ensure that the bombs were distributed over a much larger area than that of a single factory. The actual target was first illuminated and marked, without being visually identified, by means of H2S. In the light of the flares so dropped the crews of a small force of aircraft, between five and nine in number, identified a previously chosen marking point which might be anything between a 1000 and 2000 yards away from the  BOMBER OFFENSIVE  242 by December of 1944 we had devastated or very seriously damaged 80 per cent of all the cities in Germany witha population—before the war—of more than 100,000; yet more cities, especially in the east of Germany, were devastated in 1945.  With the German army on the frontiers of Germany we quickly set up GH and Oboe ground stations close behind the front line and this ensured the success of attacks on many distant objectives when the weather would otherwise have prevented us from finding the target. At the same time the bombers could fly with comparative safety even to targets
