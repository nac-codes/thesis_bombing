This marking point was marked with r1ooo lb. target indicators, and the Master Bomber checked their position, dropping target indicators of a different colour to cancel any that might be wide of the mark. The main force were then instructed to approach the marking point on a definite track and release their bombs just so many seconds after the markers on the marking point were in the bomb- sights as to ensure that the bombs would overshoot into the area to be attacked. This saved a great deal of time but it also had the enormous advantage, for area bombing, that the main force could distribute their bombs far more evenly over the area to be attacked than by any previous method. By the method used throughout 1943 the bombs were distributed roughly over a circular area, but most densely in the centre of it; in a successful attack the centre of this circle corresponded with the aiming point. This meant that if we wished to do as much damage towards the circumference of the circle as towards the centre, we had to use an excessive number of bombs, since far more bombs normally fell near the centre than towards the edge of the area to be attacked.
