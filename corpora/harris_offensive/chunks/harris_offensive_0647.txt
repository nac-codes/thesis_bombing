ircumference of the circle as towards the centre, we had to use an excessive number of bombs, since far more bombs normally fell near the centre than towards the edge of the area to be attacked. Further- more, if that area should be long and narrow, as some objectives were, a great many bombs would have to be wasted to ensure hitting both ends of the area. To overcome this difficulty 5 Group divided the attacking force into a number of sections and instructed each of them to approach the marking point by different lines of approach and to bomb a different number of seconds after the marking point, with the markers burning on it, had appeared in the bomb sights. In an attack on Bremerhaven, for example, a very straggling and difficult target, on the night of 18th-19th September, 1944, the force was divided into five sections, each with separate instructions, which in fact meant | that the force bombed five separate aiming points to which they were guided by only one marking point; it would, of course, have taken a long time and have been excessively dangerous for low-flying aircraft to place actual target indicators accurately on all five aiming points. The reason for using this procedure against Bremerhaven in particular was that it is a long and narrow town and if the bombs had been aimed at a single aiming point in the centre of this elongated area a great number would have had to be wasted to ensure the destruction of the place.  This attack was a comparatively primitive example of 5 Groupâ€™s methods of area bombing. A further development, on use against targets which were not elongated in shape, was to  THE FINAL PHASE 245  distribute the bombs, by exactly the same methods but by a further sub-division of the force, not merely between several aiming points lying on a single line, but between several aiming points lying on several lines; these lines fanned outwards, as it were from the marking point and crossed the target in various directions.
