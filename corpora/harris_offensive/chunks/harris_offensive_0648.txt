single line, but between several aiming points lying on several lines; these lines fanned outwards, as it were from the marking point and crossed the target in various directions. In an attack on Munich on the night of November 26th-27th, 1944, the aircraft dropped their bombs along five such lines, and in a later attack on the same town on December 17th- 18th along five such lines; both attacks were highly successful.  Finally each aircraft in the force could be given a separate heading on which to approach the target area from the marking point and a different interval of tirne at which to bomb after the marking point was in the bomb-sight. This meant, in effect, that the bombs from each single aircraft in the whole force were aimed at a separate aiming point, which ensured that the bombs were yet more evenly distributed over the whole area. In this way Brunswick was most successfully attacked on the night of October 4th-sth, 1944, and Heilbronn on the night of December 4th-sth, 1944.  All this sounds complicated enough and it did require con- siderable mathematical ability and the issue of very detailed instructions when planning the attack. But for the individual airman it was no more complicated to follow the separate instruc- tions issued to each crew than when all the crews followed the same instructions, while however elaborate might be the planned distribution of the bombs the Master Bomber and the marking crews had only to make sure of one marking point outside the target area. .  Apart from Mosquito attacks, which became increasingly heavy, Bomber Command carried out no further operations against Berlin, though in the late summer of 1944, when the German army was in headlong retreat from France and it seemed conceivable that the war might end at any moment, there was a plan to carry out a vast Anglo-American air attack on Berlin in daylight; the idea was that this might cause the German Govern- ment to panic at a critical moment.
