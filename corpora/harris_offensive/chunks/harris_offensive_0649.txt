there was a plan to carry out a vast Anglo-American air attack on Berlin in daylight; the idea was that this might cause the German Govern- ment to panic at a critical moment. General Doolittle came up to Bomber Command on the afternoon before the projected attack and he and I and our staffs examined the final plan together in the Operations Room. The routes were decided and the whole  operation pretty well cut and dried when I discovered that the Americans, whose long-range fighters were required to protect Bomber Command’s striking force as well as their own Fortresses,  Yn  244 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  centre of the area which was to be attacked. This marking "wi was marked with 1ooo Ib. target indicators, and the ) Bomber checked their position, dropping target indicator different colour to cancel any that might be wide of the The main force were then instructed to approach the ma tll point on a definite track and release their bombs just so seconds after the markers on the marking point were in the } "alti sights as to ensure that the bombs would overshoot into th | hiorie to be attacked. This saved a great deal of time but it also hi enormous advantage, for area bombing, that the main force 4 distribute their bombs far more evenly over the area to be att Hinlnti than by any previous method. By the method used throu 1943 the bombs were distributed roughly over a circular are ih i most densely in the centre of it; in a successful attack the : "!0tiatiaip of this circle corresponded with the aiming point. This 1 that if we wished to do as much damage towards the circumfi of the circle as towards the centre, we had to use an exc number of bombs, since far more bombs normally fell ne |" centre than towards the edge of the area to be attacked. Fu Ill more, if that area should be long and narrow, as some obje lt were, a great many bombs would have to be wasted to ¢ ltt hitting both ends of the area. To overcome this difi 5 Group divided the attacking force into a number of
