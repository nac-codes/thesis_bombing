and, as soon as they were within range of the early warning stations dropped bundles of Window which, on the enemy’s radar, simulated the approach of large bomber forces; these two small Mosquito forces made for Duisburg and Mainz with the object of attracting the fighters based in the Ruhr and North-East  246 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  were unable to raise enough fighters to give what I considered adequate cover for our aircraft during such a deep penetration of Germany. The greater part of our striking force was unable to fly in formation and in an operation involving the whole or most of the force the bomber stream was inevitably very long, stretching to sixty miles or more, so that a large fighter force had always to be assembled when we attacked a German target in daylight. There had been some misunderstanding about this in the earlier stages of planning the operation, since it was only on the day before the operation was to take place that I discovered that an American long-range fighter force sufficient to cover both our own and the American bombers all the way to Berlin was not available. Although Jimmy Doolittle did his utmost, as always, to meet our requirements I had to refuse to subject my force to arisk far greater than usual—I had particularly in mind our obsolete .303 calibre defensive armament—The whole operation was therefore cancelled.  If I were asked what were the relations between Bomber Command and the American bomber force I should say that we had no relations. The word is inapplicable to what actually happened; we and they were one force. The Americans gave us the best they had, and they gave us everything we needed as and when the need arose. I hope, indeed, I know, that we did every- thing possible for them in turn.

I was, and am, privileged to count all three of them as the closes
