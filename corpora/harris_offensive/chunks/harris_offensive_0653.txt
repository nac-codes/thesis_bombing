in arms than Ira Eaker, Fred Anderson and Jimmy Doolittle, and the Americans could have had no better com- manders than these three. I was, and am, privileged to count all three of them as the closest of friends. As for the American bomber crews, they were the bravest of the brave, and I know that I am speaking for my own bomber crews when I pay this tribute.  When once the Allied armies were near the frontier of Germany and we had reorganised our tactics to take advantage of this fact, the enemy was almost always unable to put up any serious resist- ance against our night attacks but this, of course, was only because of our increased power of manceuvre, and not because of any reduction of the still formidable night fighter force. The most serious blow to the enemy was the loss of his early warning stations on the Channel coast; the only stations he now had were on the German frontier, or on the coast of Holland, and these latter could always be avoided by sending the bombers over France on a route which was out of range of radar stations in  THE FINAL PHASE 247  Holland. The bombers could therefore approach to within 4o miles of the German frontier before the enemy knew of their approach, and usually the enemy had less than an hour’s warning. The enemy’s night fighters were now based on new airfields and had lost all the elaborate communication and control centres in France and Belgium. It was estimated that they needed at least forty minutes warning of the approach of our bombers if their opposi- tion was to be effective. The fighters therefore had scarcely enough time as it was, and we decided to deny them even this by jamming the early warning stations with airborne apparatus carried in Stirlings which flew at a distance of about 60 miles from the German frontier. This jamming was very effective, and it only remained for us to take every possible advantage of it when planning our attacks so that the enemy not only had too little time in which to get his night f
