This force flew on a route which passed to the south of Mannheim but in advance of it there flew a small force of Mosquitoes dropping Window, and as soon as these broke from the screen put up by our airborne jamming these diverged from the route assigned to the heavy bombers and flew in the direction of Mainz and Frankfurt. There were then three feint attacks in this second phase of the night’s operations; eight Mosquitoes attacked Frankfurt, 11 attacked Nuremburg, and 14 Dessau, which is about 75 miles north-west of Chemnitz.  As many night fighters as the enemy had previously sent to the beacon near Cologne were sent up in this second phase of operations, and nearly half of them had been airborne three hours before. But the Window-dropping Mosquitoes effectively pre- vented the fighters from intercepting the bombers near the German frontier, and when the fighters were eventually directed towards the main bomber stream very few of them reached it, partly because we were using effective measures to jam the apparatus they carried for detecting aircraft in the dark and partly because there was cloud over part of the route.  In all, the total losses that night were only 1.3 per cent of all sorties, including the aircraft used to carry apparatus for j
