in the dark and partly because there was cloud over part of the route.  In all, the total losses that night were only 1.3 per cent of all sorties, including the aircraft used to carry apparatus for jam- ming the early warning stations, Mosquito fighters sent against the enemy’s night fighters, and the diversionary sweep.  It was, of course, essential for the success of such tactics that the enemy should have no warning of the approach of bombers except from his own radar stations, and such warning might have been given him by any transmission, including the transmission from our own H2S equipment, from the bombers themselves. But crews now had the use of Gee right up to the front line, since the Germans could no longer jam it over France, and they had little need of H2S on the earlier stages of any flight. I therefore ordered a complete “signals silence,” with no use of H2S or any other equipment making a transmission which the enemy could pick up, until the aircraft were within 50 miles of enemy-held territory and therefore had broken through the jamming screen. When the weather allowed, the main force was often instructed to fly at a low level on the way to the German frontier in order to make it still more difficult for the early warning stations to detect its approach.  During this period, from September, 1944 till the end of the  Lv  248 BOMBER OFFE  Germany. At this stage, the enemy controllers were therefore aware of two main threats, the one somewhere up in the North and towards the East, the other in the general direction of the Ruhr. And at this moment in the enemy’s confused affairs the two main heavy bomber forces broke cover from behind the screen of jammers and flew on the same course in the direction of Coblenz. Just north of Coblenz, the two main forces diverged, one flying to the North-West and the other to the South-East, out after an interval they converged again and both made for Saxony.  The enemy’s first reaction was to decide that we were thr
