diverged, one flying to the North-West and the other to the South-East, out after an interval they converged again and both made for Saxony.  The enemy’s first reaction was to decide that we were threaten- ing the Ruhr and to send fighters there; the controllers had been deceived by the 24 Mosquitoes which were the first to break out from the jamming screen. The deception did not last for long, and fighters which had been sent to the Ruhr were hurriedly sent urther South to orbit a beacon near Cologne. By this time, when the two main forces had reached Coblenz, the enemy had accur- ately plotted this very large number of heavy bombers, and when the two forces diverged near Coblenz, both of them continued to be plotted and the fighters followed both forces until they came together again, which was at a point about 40 miles west of Chemnitz. After this, the fighters only followed the force which was to attack Chemnitz. But all this was too late. A large number of fighters had eventually collected at the beacon near Cologne, but when they were sent after the main bomber streams not one of them was able to catch up with them. Meanwhile the mine- laying aircraft flying over Denmark had engaged the attention of some fighters based there and the enemy, after plotting the diversionary sweep across the North Sea and deciding that some 350 aircraft were approaching—the real number was 95—sent some fighters to a beacon near Hamburg to be ready for this threat; these fighters were not used again. From stations near Berlin the enemy did send a number of fighters to Chemnitz, but these were scarcely more effective than the fighters sent from the Cologne beacon; they arrived so late that only a very few combats took place. When the bombers were on their way back from Saxony, other fighters came up from the south, but these also failed to catch up with the two bomber streams.  We had naturally stopped jamming the enemy’s early warning stations as soon as this was no longer necessa
