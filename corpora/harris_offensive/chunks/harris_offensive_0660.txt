tations, Mosquito fighters sent against the enemy’s night fighters, and the diversionary sweep.  It was, of course, essential for the success of such tactics that the enemy should have no warning of the approach of bombers except from his own radar stations, and such warning might have been given him by any transmission, including the transmission from our own H2S equipment, from the bombers themselves. But crews now had the use of Gee right up to the front line, since the Germans could no longer jam it over France, and they had little need of H2S on the earlier stages of any flight. I therefore ordered a complete “signals silence,” with no use of H2S or any other equipment making a transmission which the enemy could pick up, until the aircraft were within 50 miles of enemy-held territory and therefore had broken through the jamming screen. When the weather allowed, the main force was often instructed to fly at a low level on the way to the German frontier in order to make it still more difficult for the early warning stations to detect its approach.  During this period, from September, 1944 till the end of the  PON  2  250 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  war, the enemy discovered no new defensive measure, in spite of the fact that absolutely every form of radar or system of signals which was of any real value to the defence was being jammed or interfered with in some other way by us. Consequently there was no need for us to bring in anything new; we needed only to keep the enemy controllers guessing by similar means as those used in the attack on Chemnitz and Rositz on the night of February 14th-15th, and to see to it that we never became systematic or regularly repetitive in our planning of operations. It is pro- bable that if the war had continued the enemy would have devised something new, possibly in the use of short-wave radar, or possibly in the use of infra-red rays, but as it was there was nothing to worry us and in the last few months of the war the night fighter force,
