thing new, possibly in the use of short-wave radar, or possibly in the use of infra-red rays, but as it was there was nothing to worry us and in the last few months of the war the night fighter force, in addition to all its other troubles, began to be starved of petrol. I have already described how we used feint attacks, on nights when there were no major operations in order to get the enemy to use up still more petrol by dispatching fighters to meet an imaginary threat and to wear down the morale of his night- fighter forces,  The only defence the enemy could offer was purely passive; it was an attempt to disperse or bury underground the most important of his war industries. One of the most elaborately organised of such industries was the manufacture of pre-fabricated U-boats, which we first detected when air photographs showed that a U-boat had left the stocks in a U-boat building yard in an unprecedently short time, about a quarter of the usual time. which meant that the parts of the submarine must have been manufactured elsewhere and quickly assembled in the building yard. U-boat building yards had always in the past proved a rather hopeless target for air attack, as I continually but in- effectively pointed out to the Admiralty when continually pressed to attack them, while in the present there were too many other urgent calls upon us; with the new method of manufacturing all the parts of U-boats in a great number of workshops scattered all over Germany it looked as though the enemy had made things still more difficult for us. As the new U-boats did not come to the surface, where they could be detected by radar, to re-charge their batteries, but breathed in air through a tube running up to the surface of the sea, there was some reason for fearing that a new and very serious threat to our shipping might develop. The threat never came to anything for two reasons. The change of plan and design in the middle of a war caused endless delays, and  THE FINAL PHASE 251
