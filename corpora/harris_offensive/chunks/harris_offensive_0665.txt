e fortified  THE FINAL PHASE 253  towns on the River Roer, Diiren, Jiilich, and Heinsburg, which covered the approach to the Cologne plain. On the 16th Nov- ember, in daylight, we dropped 5689 tons of bombs on these towns, and though we had expected to make a second attack, for the army wanted complete destruction, we were told that nothing more was needed. When the Ninth Army reached the River Roer a new obstacle appeared. The enemy still held two dams, at Urft and Schwammenauel, which controlled the flooding of the Roer valley, and if the Americans had crossed the Roer waters the enemy could have trapped them by releasing the flood waters behind them. We were therefore asked, at short notice, to break the dams down. The structure of the dams was very similar to that of the Sorpe dam which had been accurately attacked in 1943 when we breached the Méhne and Eder dams but had not been broken down because the retaining wall of earth proved invulnerable to any weapon then in our possession. As with the Sorpe dam, there was just a chance that an explosion or series of explosions on the Urft and Schwammenauel dams would cause seepage and eventually lead to the complete disintegration of the structure, but I did not think much of this chance and, moreover, the enemy was in a position to adjust the water level so as to avoid erosion of the dam. I therefore told General Eisenhower that there was no hope that the operation would be successful, but that we should make the attempt; the dams were bombed five times between December 3rd and December 11th and were repeatedly hit, but nothing happened. The only alternative was for the army to capture the dams and this they were about to do when Runstedt’s counter-offensive began on December 16th.  It was the essential condition of this counter-offensive that it should be carried out in such bad weather that the German army would be largely immune to air attack and for a considerable time there was fog and low cloud over very large
