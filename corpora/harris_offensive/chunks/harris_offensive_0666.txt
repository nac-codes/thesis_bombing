counter-offensive that it should be carried out in such bad weather that the German army would be largely immune to air attack and for a considerable time there was fog and low cloud over very large areas. But even in the first week after December 16th, when the weather was appal- ling, Bomber Command, and Bomber Command alone, was able to operate against communications used for the counter-offensive on four nights and two days; all were large-scale operations. Attacks on communications were maintained until the enemy was withdrawing as rapidly as possible, and the extremely heavy damage that was done in railway centres behind the German lines, as, for example, in the Nippes marshalling yard at Cologne, undoubtedly had a profound effect on the whole situation. The enemy’s roads were blocked by an overwhelming attack on St.  252 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  should be needed. We already had Wallis’s 12,000 lb, medium capacity bomb, which was capable of breaking through the roof of a railway tunnel or a very thick concrete roof, and when the success of this bomb was proved Wallis designed a yet more powerful weapon, the 22,000 lb. bomb, the most destructive missile in the history of warfare until the invention of the atom bomb. This 22,000 Ib. bomb did not reach us before the spring of 1945, when we used it with great effect against viaducts or rail- ways leading to the Ruhr and also against several U-boat shelters. If it had been necessary, it would have been used against under- ground factories, and preparations for attacking some of these were already well advanced when the war ended. Even where a factory was too deeply buried for the bomb to go right through the earth or rock overhead, these large bombs would certainly have brought down the rock ceilings, as happened when we attacked with ordinary 1000 Ib. bombs the caves in which the Germans hid their flying bombs in France, on the machinery below. But in general a great deal of nonsense was talked about underground factori
