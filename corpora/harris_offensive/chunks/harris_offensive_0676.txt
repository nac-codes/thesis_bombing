Even more important an exercise of sea-air power was Bomber Command’s prolonged minelaying campaign which, on a very conservative estimate, sank or damaged over 1000 enemy and enemy-employed ships be- tween February, 1942 and May, 1945. This has a great effect on the course of the war as a whole, and was of vital consequence at such critical stages of the war as the invasion of North Africa and the invasion of Normandy. Mines laid off the West coast of France in November, 1942, largely prevented the large force of U-boats held in the bases on that coast from operating against our convoys on the way to Gibraltar, and immediately after the invasion of Normandy Bomber Command was once again called upon to blockade the same bases on the Atlantic coast of France; the result of this and the magnificent work of Coastal Command was that the enemy was unable to use his U-boats with any effect against our cross-Channel convoys and, when these bases were threatened from land, found great difficulty in evacuating to Norway what serviceable U-boats remained in the French ports. Just before the invasion we laid mines in certain areas in the English Channel and off the Belgian and Dutch coast to prevent light surface craft from getting out to attack our con- voys, and just after D-Day we anticipated that the enemy would withdraw troops from his army of occupation in Norway for use in Normandy and laid mines in the Kattegat and elsewhere south of Norway; it is known that these measures were par- ticularly successful.  But the greater part of our minelaying was directed against the German merchant navy and supply shipping. The mines were laid over a very wide area, and the campaign was designed to obstruct all Germany’s sea communications, but there were also two particular objectives. When the Ruhr was being mos
