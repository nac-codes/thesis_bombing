pping. The mines were laid over a very wide area, and the campaign was designed to obstruct all Germany’s sea communications, but there were also two particular objectives. When the Ruhr was being most heavily bombed we made every effort to obstruct the supply of iron ore to that area from Sweden, by way of Rotterdam, and from Spain, by way of Bilbao and Bayonne. The route from Sweden eventually became so dangerous that the Swedes decided to withdraw their ships, at a moment when the enemy could ill afford the loss. A second objective was the sea communications in the Baltic by which supplies and reinforcements reached the German army in Russia.  As might have been expected, it was just about the time when the bomber offensive began to have a really decisive effect, in the last year of the war, that the minelaying campaign also proved the most serious drain on the German resources, and this in spite  B.O.

We had very good reason to believe that the ship could never be made fit for operations before the probable end of the war and was therefore quite useless to the enemy; this was confirmed by German reports that came into our hands after the war. As this solitary dinosaur had been equally useless as a warlike weapon for a long time before this new development did not seem to cut much ice with the Admiralty; I was therefore pressed to attack the Tirpitz again. The Yirpitz was then moved at slow speed in her damaged condition, she was only capable of doing 8-10 knots—to Tromso, which was just within range of Lancasters based in England but which was still so far North that during winter the darkness would be almost continuous and a daylight attack would therefore be impossible; unless we were to wait for the spring we should have to act quickly. A second attack was made, also by No. 617 and No. 9 Squadrons, but this time there was unexpected bad weather and complete cloud cover over the ship. In a third attack the ship
