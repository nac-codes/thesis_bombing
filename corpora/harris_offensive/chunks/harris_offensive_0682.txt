With far less promptitude, a dozen or so observers—all that we at Bomber Command could then gather up or were permitted to send—did their best to get some information with which to assess the result of the R.A.F.’s bombing offensive; three months after the surrender of Germany I was still pointing out that for lack of any scientific and properly organised inquiry it was daily growing more difficult to judge the effect of our campaign as a whole and that it would soon become impossible to do so.  The American survey was naturally concerned before anything else with the results of American attacks and some bias in favour of their own methods of bombing single factories and railway targets, even though the method was abandoned when the Americans began to bomb Japan in strength, was only to be expected. For example, the American conclusion about area attacks is that the losses inflicted by them “fell mostly on in- dustries relatively inessential to the war effort,” which is demon- strably inaccurate. Naturally the most important factories, and only these, were chosen as targets for individual attack, and some of the most recently constructed of these were well away from the centres of the towns. But the main bulk of German war industry was exactly where one would expect to find it, and where it is in every country in the world, in the great industrial cities; one has only to look at the list of factories destroyed after any one  259  A THE Allied armies entered Germany they were closely  258 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  of the fact that throughout this period our op curtailed because of a shortage of mines.
