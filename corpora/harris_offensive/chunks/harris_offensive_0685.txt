s in Essenâ€”was Essen, Rheinmetall- Borsig in Dusseldorf, the Bochumer Verein steel works in Bochum, and so on. At the same time it did not always happen that a successful attack on the main factory for the production of a particular weapon had as much effect on reducing production as an area attack on a district in which there were a number of apparently less important factories. After an attack by the U.S.A.A.F. on the large factory at Fallersleben which was then producing the flying bombs, most of the work was transferred to other factories, and a much greater loss of production resulted from our subsequent attacks on the Ruhr. The production of flying bombs was cut by between 20 and 30 per cent of what was intended because of shortage of sheet metal manufactured in the Ruhr and the disorganisation of the railway system.  The main work of the American survey was to consider the effect of bombing on each industry one by one, and though an attempt was made to estimate the effects of attacks on cities as a whole, this was admittedly very incomplete and great difficulties were experienced in getting at the truth. For the general survey of the separate war industries many German records were con- sulted and many German war-leaders, generals, and industrialists were examined. In considering such evidence a difficulty at once arises; the Germans were not always in a position to judge whether at attack was really aimed at a single factory or at a town. On the one side American attacks on single factories quite often destroyed a large number of buildings in the neighbourhood of the actual target, or elsewhere, and on the other hand our attacks on industrial towns often destroyed factories of such size and importance that it might well have appeared to the German authorities that our attacks were in fact aimed particularly at these factories. On the night of 15th-16th March, for example, the accumulator factory at Hagen was destroyed together with most of the town, and this
