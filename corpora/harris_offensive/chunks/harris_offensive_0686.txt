at our attacks were in fact aimed particularly at these factories. On the night of 15th-16th March, for example, the accumulator factory at Hagen was destroyed together with most of the town, and this is how Speer referred to the matter—he was discussing the result of our attacks on targets connected with the production of U-boats: “The factories at Hagen and Vienna manufacturing accumulator batteries were destroyed and Posen was lost to us, but the largest accumulator factory (Acfa) at Hanover remained intact. If the last-named factory had been destroyed, the construction of U-boats would have had to be abandoned four weeks later.” Speer was, in fact, assessing the results of attacks which were partly directed against industrial  SUMMING UP 261  cities and partly against specific factories as though this had been a campaign against a single class of industrial objectives; it was, in fact, nothing of the kind, and our economic experts had not even put the last remaining factory at Hanover, on which the whole U-boat industry-then depended, on the list of factories which the Anglo-American bomber forces were required to attack.  There is often a marked discrepancy between the observations of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey and the assessment made by members of the Operational Research Section of Bomber Command when they examined our targets on the spot, and this discrepancy even extends to the simple question of what per- centage of houses in a town were destroyed; possibly the word “destruction” was defined in two different ways, or possibly outlying districts were considered part of the town in one survey and not in the other. Thus the United States survey says that we destroyed 31 per cent of the houses in Hamburg, and 22 per cent of the houses in Dusseldorf, but our Operational Research Section worked it out as 61 per cent in Hamburg and 50 per cent in Dusseldorf. gi  The representatives of our Operational Research Section in Germany were able to revise
