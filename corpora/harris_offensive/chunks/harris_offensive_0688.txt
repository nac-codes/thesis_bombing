, production was reduced by bombing by about 30 per cent over the whole period from March, 1943 till the end of the war, but the-loss of production was most unevenly distributed over this period; in the last seven months of the war production was reduced by 60 per cent, and in March, 1945, was set down as nil. It was the same at Bochum, where the loss of production was even more severe; over the whole period from May, 1943 till the end of the war production was cut by 45 per cent, but in the last five months of the war it was cut by 86 per cent.  Some attempt was also made by the Americans to assess the loss of production in Germany as a whole which resulted from our attacks on cities, but this assessment admittedly left so many factors out of account that it can only give a'very vague indication of the situation. The figures arrived at do not, for example, show “to what extent Germany’s capacity to continue producing, working, and fighting may have been undermined in the process of meeting these attacks and making good, or trying to make good, the losses incurred.” Since between a million and fifteen hundred thousand people were engaged solely in work arising from air-raid damage, and since the attempt to restore the great industrial towns to some semblance of life must have cost Germany a vast expenditure of other labour and material, this is a considerable omission from the assessment. Nor does the American survey take into account the cumulative effect on Ger- man production as more and more cities were ruined. But in spite of all these omissions the American figures once again bear out the general conclusion that in the last months of the war the loss of production resulting from the destruction of cities became really disastrous,  The R.A.F. was not ina position, as it most emphatically ought to have been, to judge the result of its main offensive in the light of a sufficient body of indisputable evidence, gathered by people who knew what to look for and befor
