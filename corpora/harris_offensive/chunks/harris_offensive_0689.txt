as it most emphatically ought to have been, to judge the result of its main offensive in the light of a sufficient body of indisputable evidence, gathered by people who knew what to look for and before such evidence had dis- appeared, But no one who surveys the evidence that has been collected, contradictory and confusing though it often is, can fail to be struck by two main points. In the first place, the towns  SUMMING UP 263  which were devastated in 1943 proved surprisingly resilient. In the second place, even though the Germans had had five months respite in which to rebuild factories and rehouse the workers, the resumed offensive in the autumn of 1944 had an immediate effect on production several times as great as the effect of the offensive of 1943. The reason for this is obvious enough; it was not until 1944 that our strength and equipment was anything like equal to our task, though even then we only had a force of between a third and a quarter of what had been originally estimated as necessary for the bombing offensive against Germany.  In the last three months of 1944 a-greater weight of bombs was dropped than in the whole of 1943. Moreover it was only in the last few months of 1944, just when production in Germany began to fall most rapidly, that we were allowed to use any considerable part of our force against German industrial cities. Over the entire period of the war only 45 per cent of the Com- mand’s whole effort was against German cities, so that in fact we were using for the main offensive a force which was not only less than one-quarter of the strength originally planned, but nearer one-eighth. é  It is an obvious and most certain conclusion that if we had had the force we used in 1944 a year earlier, and if we had then been allowed to use it together with the whole American bomber force, and without interruption, Germany would have been defeated outright by bombing as Japan was; the two atom bombs only added three per cent to the already existing
