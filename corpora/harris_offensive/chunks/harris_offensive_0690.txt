with the whole American bomber force, and without interruption, Germany would have been defeated outright by bombing as Japan was; the two atom bombs only added three per cent to the already existing devastation, and their use against two cities merely gave the Japanese, as all American authorities agree, a pretext for immediate surrender when they had already been defeated by area bombing of the same kind as that used against Germany. To have had the force we built up in 1944 a year earlier would have been perfectly feasible, and this is not an absurd speculation like wondering what aircraft could have done in the Battle of Waterloo. We were only prevented from having that force by the fact that the Allied war leaders did not have enough faith in strategic bombing. As a result, the two older services were able to employ a large part of the nation’s war effort and industrial capacity in the production and use of their older weapons, and were also able, when the older weapons failed, to get what amounted to more than half our existing bomber force used for their own purposes.  All this was sufficiently obvious, in the closing stages of the war against Germany, to bring about a revolutionary change of  262 BOMBER OFFEN  The information obtained confirmed wh the statements of German generals anc only on the last year of the war, in spit the burning of Hamburg and the ruin that our bombing really began to affect machine. In Dortmund, for example, pr bombing by about 30 per cent over the w 1943 till the end of the war, but the-loss unevenly distributed over this period; i of the war production was reduced by 6c 1945, was set down as nil. It was the san loss of production was even more severe from May, 1943 till the end of the war 45 per cent, but in the last five months « 86 per cent.  Some attempt was also made by the loss of production in Germany as a wh: our attacks on cities, but this assessment factors out of account that it can only giv of the situation. The figur
