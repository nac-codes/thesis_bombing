Germany dispersal greatly added to the enemy’s difficulties as soon as his communication system began to break down, but in Japan much work was farmed out, as a protection against air attack, and carried on in the flimsy and highly in- flammable houses of the Japanese people instead of in concrete factories which would have been far more difficult to destroy. Nor had the Japanese the great organising ability of the Germans. For these and many other reasons it is probable that it would have taken longer to reduce Germany than Japan by bombing alone; it is also possible that some sort of landing on the Continent would have been necessary before the enémy’s final surrender. But I am certain that if we had had an adequate bomber force to attack Germany a year earlier, that is, in 1943, or if we had not had the pre-invasion bombing and the bombing of the V-weapon sites to divert us in 1944, we should never have had to mount an invasion on anything like the scale that proved necessary. Once again let me point out that in the last three months of 1944 Bomber Command had dropped as great a weight of bombs as in the whole of 1943; there was no reason at all why we should not have been as ready for the offensive in 1943 as in 1944 except that we did not get the men, aircraft, and equipment when we asked for them, and we were always being diverted from the main offensive by the demands of other services. As the Americans also suffered continuously from similar diversions without these diversions the result would have been the inevitable and total collapse of Germany and there would have been no need for the invasion.  The greater part of this book has been occupied with our actual achievements, not with what we might have done if we had had the means. But it may be as well to summarise those achieve- ments here. In 1940 Bomber Command’s attacks on the invasion ports on the coast of France convinced the Germans that no attempt to invade England could be made without complete ai
