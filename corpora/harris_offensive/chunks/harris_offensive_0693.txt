arise those achieve- ments here. In 1940 Bomber Command’s attacks on the invasion ports on the coast of France convinced the Germans that no attempt to invade England could be made without complete air superiority over the Channel, and this, because of Fighter Com- mand, was demonstrably unattainable. Later the Command, by successful attacks on French factories working for the enemy, did much to prevent the Germans from converting all Western Europe into an arsenal, and while doing so supplied Coastal Command and our Air Force in the Middle and Far East with many squadrons and additional aircrew. The main attack of 1943, before its interruption by the invasion, compelled the enemy to use more and more of his air force for the defence of Germany, thereby  264 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  plan in the conduct of the Japanese war. The Americans were so much impressed by the achievements of strategic bombing in Europe that they decided to put a far larger share of the national resources into air power than had been previously intended. And although they had rigidly adhered to the theory, if not always to the practice, of precision bombing of factories in Europe, they used against Japan exactly the same method of devastating large industrial cities by incendiary bombs as was used in Europe by Bomber Command. Admittedly one reason for the rejection of precision bombing was that it was even more difficult to get information about Japanese than about German industry, but in my opinion, as I have emphasised in an earlier chapter, we never had sufficient information about German industry to offer any certainty of success in a campaign against key factories. In any event it was not until the last year of the war that we had the technical equipment for such attacks.  But, as Major A. P. de Seversky has pointed out in his published report to the United States Secretary of War, the Americans were far from exploiting air power to the full evén in the Pacific War. A great many lives were lost
