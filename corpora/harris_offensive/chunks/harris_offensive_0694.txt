ersky has pointed out in his published report to the United States Secretary of War, the Americans were far from exploiting air power to the full evén in the Pacific War. A great many lives were lost in capturing air bases by combined operations, and this “island-hopping” could have been done by air if the right islands had been chosen, or, as Major de Seversky says, aircraft with the range of the B-36 could have been produced earlier and Japan could if necessary have been bombed from India, Australia, or Alaska. There was just as intense a struggle in America as in England between those in the air force who were anxious to develop a stragetic bombing force, and the army and navy who made every effort to restrict the development and use of the new weapon.  The best of our own four-engined bombers, the Lancaster, had all the range that was wanted for the strategic bombing of Germany, which was the purpose for which it had been built, but until the nearest bases to Japan had been captured the ordinary Lancaster could have played no part in the bombing of Japan, and when those bases were captured they were so restricted in size that it is doubtful whether it would have been profitable to operate more aircraft from them than the Americans themselves proposed to use. But we had our plans, long before the end of the Japanese war, for increasing the range of the Lancaster.  Japan did not have the industrial strength of Germany and its war production was more easily reduced by bombing. Dispersal of industry was even more disastrous an expedient there than in  SUMMING UP 265  Germany; in Germany dispersal greatly added to the enemy’s difficulties as soon as his communication system began to break down, but in Japan much work was farmed out, as a protection against air attack, and carried on in the flimsy and highly in- flammable houses of the Japanese people instead of in concrete factories which would have been far more difficult to destroy. Nor had the Japanese the great o
