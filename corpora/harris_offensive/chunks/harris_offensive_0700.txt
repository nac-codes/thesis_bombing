s attacks in the three months before D-Day were so effective, and the new means and tactics of precision bombing were so rapidly mastered (I myself did not anticipate that we should be able to bomb the French railways with anything like the precision that was achieved) that the invasion proved an infinitely easier task than had been expected; not even the most hopeful of the Allied war leaders had thought that the casualties would be so light or the setbacks so few. When the beachhead was established, the bombing of railways continued and a method of using heavy bombers in the battlefield was rapidly and successfully improvised; by this means the most strongly defended positions were taken by the army with incredibly slight losses. In this way the Channel ports, which it had been an essential part of the enemy’s defensive strategy to retain, were captured with extra- ordinary speed and scarcely any casualties after preliminary bombing; the island of Walcheren fell in a few hours after the enemy’s defences had been attacked by our bombers, and the port of Antwerp was opened to the Allies. The crossing of the Rhine at Wesel, which had been expected to prove a difficult and ex- pensive operation, cost us only 36 casualties after the reduction of Wesel by air attack. When the bombers returned to the assault on German cities the Ruhr was rapidly made completely unpro- ductive and, in a campaign in which Bomber Command joined with the U.S.A.A.F., had nearly all its communications cut. In the Allied victory over Runstedt’s counter-offensive our heavy bombers not only played a most important tactical role, but the results of our strategic bombing were immediately apparent in the enemy’s shortage of weapons and fuel. In the last phase of the war Bomber Command, in conjunction with the USAAF,  SUMMING UP 267  carried out a campaign against the enemy’s oil supplies which in the spring of 1945 left all the German armed forces without fuel. In the war at sea our minelaying campa
