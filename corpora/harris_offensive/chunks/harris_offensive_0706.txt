like to work in the open, rain, blow, or snow, in daylight and through darkness, hour after hour, twenty feet up in the air on the aircraft engines and airframes, at all the intricate and multifarious tasks which have to be undeztaken to keep a bomber serviceable. And this was on wartime aerodromes, where such accommodation as could be provided offered every kind of discomfort and where, at any rate during the first years of the war, it was often impossible even to get dry clothes to change into between shifts. We never had more than 250,000 men and women at any one time in Bomber Command, so that the total of some 60,000 casualties among air-crew and ground staff should give some idea of what the Command had to face in maintaining an offensive for which the great majority were awarded the “Defence” Medal. I know that among the people concerned the award was, and is, the subject of much bitter comment, with which I was and am in entire agreement. Every clerk, butcher or baker in the rear of the armies overseas had a “campaign” medal.  Every commander must be prepared to ask himself, after every campaign, whether the results were worth the casualties. The only answer that can usually be given is to point to the contribution which that campaign made to final victory, and it is often possible to argue, as with most battles of the war of 1914-1919, that victory might have been more cheaply gained by some other means. But without exception our bomber operations were designed to reduce the casualties of all the services or of the civilian population (as in  SUMMING UP 269  attacks on V-weapon industries and sites) and in almost every instance our operations demonstrably had that effect. Without the intervention of Bomber Command the invasion of Europe would certainly have gone down as the bloodiest campaign in history unless, indeed, it had failed outright—as it would un- doubtedly have done. Without the preliminary bombing, the assault on the German prepared positions a
