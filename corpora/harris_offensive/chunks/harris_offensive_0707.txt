ne down as the bloodiest campaign in history unless, indeed, it had failed outright—as it would un- doubtedly have done. Without the preliminary bombing, the assault on the German prepared positions at Caen would have cost the army as many lives as an offensive in the 1914-1918 war, and the capture of the Channel ports, the landing at Walcheren, and the crossing of the Rhine were all operations that could only have been undertaken at a vast sacrifice if it had not been for the intervention of air power; as it was, these enormously strong positions were taken with astonishing ease, and at Le Havre, for example, which was captured after a week’s bombing, 11,000 prisoners were taken for a loss of some 50 Allied soldiers. Sea battles between modern battleships, which are apt not to sink until after they have become red hot furnaces, are often indescrib- ably horrible; a few bombs on the German navy in its bases largely put an end to such warfare. As to our main bomber offensive, the extent to which it saved the lives of the armed forces on every front by depriving the enemy of weapons is less easily calculable. But no one can doubt that it was enormous; the incidental effect that the German air force was kept out of the battlefields as well as prevented from bombing England in the later stages of the war, must by itself have saved innumerable lives. It cannot therefore be doubted that everyone of the 60,000 of Bomber Command who died saved many of his fellows by his death; over and above this is to be added the contribution of all our multifarious operations to the final victory of the Allies.  In the war of 1939-1945 England could just, though only just, afford to neglect to the extent that she did the weapon which at the time should have dominated all her strategy. The fact that both her enemies neglected this weapon to a markedly greater extent, and also that their folly gave England two great allies, made it possible for us to win the war even though the greater par
