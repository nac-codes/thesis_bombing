ct that both her enemies neglected this weapon to a markedly greater extent, and also that their folly gave England two great allies, made it possible for us to win the war even though the greater part of our national resources went into the production of less powerful and sometimes wholly obsolete weapons.  In both Germany and Japan the older services maintained a rigid control of the design, production, and use of aircraft and took every possible step to prevent independent strategic action by either force, with the result that when such independent action had to be attempted as in the Battle of Britain or in the Japanese  270 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  air attacks on Okinawa, there were no aircraft suitable for the purpose. The Germans had, of course, allowed their soldiers to dictate the whole policy of the Luftwaffe, which was designed expressly to assist the army in its rapid offensives; the appropriate outcome of the decision was that before long the German army had to be deprived of all air cover and air support on every front in order to provide some defences for Germany against inde- pendent strategic action in the air. Much too late in the day the Germans saw the advantage of a strategic bombing force, but their attempts to produce four-engined bombers, which continued even in 1945, only served to impede the production of fighter aircraft urgently needed for defence. The attempt to bring about the results of strategic bombing by other weapons, the V1 and V2, was sound strategy, but clearly the enemy did not have time or the opportunity to work out the supply or the tactical employ- ment of such weapons in the face of a bomber force which at that time dominated the situation; it is as if someone had attempted the experimental development and production of the rifle in the very middle of the Battle of Agincourt.  In Japan things were even worse; there both the admirals and the generals had control of the air force, so that it was split into two and misused by two co
