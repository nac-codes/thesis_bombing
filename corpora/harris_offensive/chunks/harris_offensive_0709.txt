the very middle of the Battle of Agincourt.  In Japan things were even worse; there both the admirals and the generals had control of the air force, so that it was split into two and misused by two contending parties. As with the German air force, its only successes were against totally unprepared opponents. The faults of design extended from the aircraft themselves to the bombs. The Japanese navy’s biggest bomb was a characteristic product of the naval mind; it was quite heavy and weighed about 1800 pounds, but the navy did everything it could to make it resemble a naval shell, and filled it with the small quantity of high explosive that naval shells contain. The Japanese army’s biggest bomb only weighed 1100 pounds. Both services designed and used their aircraft wholly for tactical support of their own operations. As with the Germans, the Japanese decided late in the day to produce aircraft capable of independent stragetic bombing, with the range and bomb load required; they were even more behind the times than the Germans and built only three four-engined bombers which were still making test flights when the war ended.  Such obliquity of vision was not the prerogative of our enemies. In Great Britain, as I have tried to show, it was a desperate struggle to maintain any kind of strategic bombing force and still more, when we had such a force, to use it for the purpose for which it was built. In the years of peace between  SUMMING UP 271  the wars of 1914 and 1939 the Royal Air Force repeatedly escaped destruction at the hands of the other two services only by the skin of its teeth. In America, which has no air force dependent of the other two services, the struggle to operate independently was still more intense and the right to do so was achieved still later in the day. Before the war the American navy had exacted the concession that no aircraft of the U.S.A.A.F. should fly beyond a limit of 300 miles from the nearest coast, and they tried to forbid any aircraft
