nerals against him, but the air marshals as well. Already there has been a far too easy accept- ance of the idea that the atomic explosive is necessarily an atomic bomb, a weapon to be carried in aircraft, from which it is argued that the bomber is what is now required for modern warfare. I myself regard the bomber as having had its day in the last war, when it was undoubtedly the predominant weapon, just as the U-boat was the predominant weapon of the 1914 war and was  270 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  air attacks on Okinawa, there were no aircraft suitable for the purpose. The Germans had, of course, allowed their soldiers to dictate the whole policy of the Luftwaffe, which was designed expressly to assist the army in its rapid offensives; the appropriate outcome of the decision was that before long the German army had to be deprived of all air cover and air support on every front in order to provide some defences for Germany against inde- pendent strategic action in the air. Much too late in the day the Germans saw the advantage of a strategic bombing force, but their attempts to produce four-engined bombers, which continued even in 1945, only served to impede the production of fighter aircraft urgently needed for defence. The attempt to bring about the results of strategic bombing by other weapons, the V1 and V2, was sound strategy, but clearly the enemy did not have time or the opportunity to work out the supply or the tactical employ- ment of such weapons in the face of a bomber force which at that time dominated the situation; it is as if someone had attempted the experimental development and production of the rifle in the very middle of the Battle of Agincourt.  In Japan things were even worse; there both the admirals and the generals had control of the air force, so that it was split into two and misused by two contending parties. As with the German air force, its only successes were against totally unprepared opponents. The faults of design extended from the aircraft
