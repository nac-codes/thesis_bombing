t was split into two and misused by two contending parties. As with the German air force, its only successes were against totally unprepared opponents. The faults of design extended from the aircraft themselves to the bombs. The Japanese navy’s biggest bomb was a characteristic product of the naval mind; it was quite heavy and weighed about 1800 pounds, but the navy did everything it could to make it resemble a naval shell, and filled it with the small quantity of high explosive that naval shells contain. The Japanese army’s biggest bomb only weighed 1100 pounds. Both services designed and used their aircraft wholly for tactical support of their own operations. As with the Germans, the Japanese decided late in the day to produce aircraft capable of independent stragetic bombing, with the range and bomb load required; they were even more behind the times than the Germans and built only three four-engined bombers which were still making test flights when the war ended.  Such obliquity of vision was not the prerogative of our enemies. In Great Britain, as I have tried to show, it was a desperate struggle to maintain any kind of strategic bombing force and still more, when we had such a force, to use it for the purpose for which it was built.
