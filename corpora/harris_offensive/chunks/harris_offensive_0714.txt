But once it had acquired this prestige, itself, the Navy—and not only our Navy, ned in America and in other countries— ce which should be independent of the asive requirements of the country; the services have either been inclined or the same thing, more or less in self-  2d in the days when the evolution of s  272 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  only prevented from winning it by the stupidity of the old German admirals and generals who would not give it a chance.

But I have not the slightest doubt that the Air Force will go the way of the other services and tend to cling to the antiquated weapons with which it will conceive its interests to be bound up; an obvious line of defence for the bomber will be to insist on its use for the dropping of atomic bombs.  It is true that the atomic explosive has to be carried by some- thing, and perhaps a few very fast, very long-range aircraft would provide a convenient means of carrying it. But it is much more efficient if put into a missile which has no crew and is directed by radar and mechanical means. It does not necessarily have to be carried by anything resembling a missile within the meaning of theact. There is no doubt that it is becoming, and will continue to become, easier and simpler to produce, and to disguise the production of, atomic explosives; my own opinion is that an ordinary embassy official, or, for that matter a commercial traveller or tourist, will eventually prove just as good, and potentially more secretive, a conveyer of atomic explosives as any aircraft, rocket, or other machine.
