onveyer of atomic explosives as any aircraft, rocket, or other machine.  There is no reason why the parts of an atomic bomb, or rather  , Jet us not call it an atomic bomb but an atomic exploder, should not be brought in bit by bit by seemingly innocent people and assembled anywhere where cover can be found, in an Embassy, attic, lodging, or in a ship in harbour. The threat of its presence could then be used to back an ultimatum, or it could be used to destroy outright the area in which it was placed. So let us not imagine-that wars—once an affair of small professional armies and just lately the concern of entire nations—are necessarily to remain within the province of what are called the “armed forces.” Most probably wars will be mainly taken over by the scientists, the diplomats, and the “cloak and dagger men.” With weapons potentially so lethal as atomic explosives there is no need to em- broil millions in production and in battle for many years when decisions can be brought about in a few seconds by the exercise of a little chicanery on the part of a very few persons.  There has already been a significant attempt to scout the idea of the employment of agents for carrying atomic explosives, Major de Seversky makes a far-fetched comparison between the agent with the atomic explosive and the Japanese piloting a suicide aircraft; the Japanese suicide pilots failed, and Major de  SUMMING UP 273  Seversky concludes that the agent, who stands a good chance of blowing himself up, will also fail. He rests the argument on the point that it is more difficult to produce good pilots than aircraft, so that the Japanese made a mistake when they threw away their pilots, but this does not apply if the explosive is so enormously powerful that by throwing away one pilot one can produce as much effect as an attack by a thousand bombers. If the Japanese suicide aircraft had contained atomic explosives their use would have obviously been worthwhile and decisive—after all, the loss of
