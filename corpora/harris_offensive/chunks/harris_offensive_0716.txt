e as much effect as an attack by a thousand bombers. If the Japanese suicide aircraft had contained atomic explosives their use would have obviously been worthwhile and decisive—after all, the loss of one man in an attack which did as much damage as a full scale attack by a force of four-engined bombers would not be considered excessive. The argument is, in fact, so weak that it sounds suspiciously like special pleading for the retention of aircraft with which to drop atomic bombs. eed  There is only one answer to this otherwise inevitable tendency in each of the services to get tied to a particular and invariably obsolete weapon, and all weapons are obsolete as soon as they are in use. There must be only one service; the survival of three of them at this stage in the development of armaments is wholly idiotic, and there never was any reason or need for them at any time. There was at one time only one service, in those long past days when generals commanded sea battles and the scum of the seaports, described as “sailors,” were forced by the roughest and readiest discipline to work the ships under the real fighting men, the soldiers, who fought and directed the battle. But during and after the Napoleonic wars the sailors, who have never been backward in propaganda, built up their reputation to such a degree that they even had the effrontery to nominate themselves the “senior” service, though what that means, and why they should have awarded themselves that title, no one knows. The armies of the world fought and conquered or lost long before human beings learned to launch a ship or even to float on an inflated bladder, and the armies of England were levied long before there was any navy. But once it had acquired this prestige, or rather, had taken it to itself, the Navy—and not only our Navy, for the same thing happened in America and in other countries— set itself apart as a service which should be independent of the other offensive and defensive requirements of the
