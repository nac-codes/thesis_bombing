after another to destroy the Royal Air Force. Time after time they were within a hairbreadth of success; time after time Trenchard, and Trenchard alone, saved us. If they had succeeded they would have abolished our air power as they succeeded in abolishing our tank power, while retaining the Camberley drag hunt, and, as the pinnacle of our sea power, those scarcely more useful battleships whose bones now lie where air power so easily con- signed them, littering the floors of the ocean or obstructing the harbours of the world. And had they succeeded in suppressing the Air Force, we should have entered the war with one fighter as we entered it with one tank, we should have lost the Battle of Britain, and the Nazis would have ruled Europe—if not the world—for centuries.  After the last war, with the results of the Battle of Britain and the bomber offensive still fresh in everyone’s mind, the army and navy realise that there is not the smallest hope of abolishing the  276 BOMBER OFFENSIVE  go halfway round the world it can get at anything on the earth’s surface by going either one way or the other, and in point of fact a radius of three to four thousand miles is all that is generally necessary.  The real answer to all these disputes is that sea power is of course vital, but that it is not necessarily exercised by ships. It can be, and indeed nowadays it mostly is, exercised to a far greater extent by aircraft—here I need only point to the record of Bomber Command against the German navy and the German merchant fleet, or to the record of Coastal Command in their battle against the U-boats. It will in future be exercised by directed atomic missiles.  The navy with its battleships—the most expensive and the most utterly useless weapons employed in the whole of the last war—provide the outstanding example of that parochial spirit which springs from the existence of separate services. I do not for one moment suggest that the army has'not shown the same proclivities, and, as
