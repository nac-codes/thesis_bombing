ovide the outstanding example of that parochial spirit which springs from the existence of separate services. I do not for one moment suggest that the army has'not shown the same proclivities, and, as I have said, the same thing will certainly happen with the Air Force now that bombers, as we know them, have, as far as one can see, become obsolete. As to the army, heaven knows that we have suffered enough from what is known in the services and outside them as the “cavalry mind.” For the past century and more, even up to the outbreak of war in 1939, nobody had much chance of promotion to high command in the army unless he was a cavalry soldier, and it is perfectly well known that, in order to get cavalry soldiers as far as high command, it was often necessary to excuse them from the more difficult qualifications in the intervening stages of their career. Un- fortunately they were too apt to develop the mentality of the animals they were so enthusiastic about. If some such provision had not been made, the working infantry, sappers, and gunners would generally have reached the higher posts first, but, as it is, how many of the high commanders of the last 150 years, up till 1939, were not cavalry officers? Because of the cavalry influence, and consequently, of this system of making appointments, the idea of using cavalry inevitably persisted for a quarter of a century after the presence of a horse on a battlefield could only be considered a symptom of certifiable lunacy.
