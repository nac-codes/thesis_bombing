The orthodox opinion, in every inquest on the campaigns of the last war, is that none of them could have been won without the co-ordinated use of all weapons, a theory which makes for the preservation of all sorts of useless articles. Personally, I quite agree with the principle of co-operation, but only on the lines of abolishing all three services and having only one defence force; it would probably have to be called the Defence Force, though I do not like the term “ defence 4 “Defence” is a gesture not of war but of inferiority. : Such a service must obviously become more and more de- pendent on science, and must make it its main business, as the only condition of winning the next war, to exploit the best contemporary weapons that science has to offer, with no more regret when it relinquishes an older weapon than a scientist shows when a hypothesis is exploded, or when he finds a quick and easy method to replace one that was inefficient and laborious This does not mean that the scientists should have complete control of the single service. Obviously its commanders. under the government, must make the final decisions, but they Pree be intelligent enough and sufficiently free from that prejudice which has always been a disease of the professional fighting man to make the best use of every invention. And as science flits from one overwhelming weapon to another the slightest prejudice in favour of an obsolete weapon will be fatal to the country whose commanders allow themselves to act on it. t With modern science what it is, it is clear that there must be fundamental revolutions in tactics at frequent intervals, but I have no reason to believe that the strategy, as opposed to
