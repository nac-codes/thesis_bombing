act on it. t With modern science what it is, it is clear that there must be fundamental revolutions in tactics at frequent intervals, but I have no reason to believe that the strategy, as opposed to the weapon on which Bomber Command’s main offensive was based should be abandoned; on the contrary, any new weapon which science is likely to put into our hands ‘should make this strate yet easier of application and yet more certain and swift in i effect, as the atom bomb itself has most certainly done. This strategy entirely reverses the old principle that wars are to be won only by seeking out and overcoming the enemy’s armed forces where these are strongest; at sea, the commonest illustra- tion of this principle is that commerce raiding is unprofitable if the enemy’s main fleet is not engaged. But what we had proposed to do with our projected, but never attained, 4000 heavy bsaiiens first line was to ignore alike the German army and the German  SUMMING UP 279  navy, except in so far as it was necessary to defend England and secure our bases and sea communications, while striking con- tinuously at the enemy’s industrial potential; the old principle only applied in that it was necessary either to overcome, or better still to evade, the enemy’s air defence. Aircraft were the first weapons to make such a strategy possible, though sea power was often less directly applied in the past to much the same ends by means of blockade and the cutting of sea communications. The weapons of the future threaten the destruction of a country’s industries in a matter of hours rather than years, and if we attempt any other application of them we shall probably find that our enemies have been before us and destroyed all those resources on which the mere existence of armed force depends.  For the moment we have to maintain such forces as we have, or a reasonable proportion of them, with such weapons as they possess. But there is no doubt that to-day the atom bomb momentarily holds the field
