I myself began my service career as a soldier; I have never been accused of any undue partiality for the army, much as I like soldiers. My part in the next war will be to be destroyed by it; Icannot doubt that if there is a war within the next quarter of a century it will certainly destroy a very great part of the civilised world and disrupt it entirely. Perhaps, after all, that may be the best solution. Any part of the human race that imagines that its survival is either necessary or outstandingly desirable must indeed, in the light of history, be thought to have an extraordinary conceit of itself. The only alternative to such otherwise inevitable destruction is world federation, a government of the world . powerful enough to determine the policy of every country. Such world federation might well develop from a first and partial federation of a few of the most powerful states. That seems as yet too good to be true, but it is the only alternative. Meanwhile, and at last, I am back in Africa, which I left unwillingly, though as a volunteer, in 1914, and to which I have always longed to return. Like most of us, I was dragged into war by accident —an accident made in Germany—and by accident I stayed - longer than most in the business of war.
