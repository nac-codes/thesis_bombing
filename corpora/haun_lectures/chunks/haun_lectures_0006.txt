Combined, these lectures lay out the logic and assumptions for a uniquely American theory of strategic bombing theory based on high-altitude daylight precision bombing.  Second, preference has been given to later lectures as these present the most mature thinking on American strategic bombing theory in the years just prior to and in the first two years before the US entry into World War II. The one exception is Kenneth Walker's 1930 Coast Artillery Journal article “Driving Home the Bombardment Attack.” This article was chosen as a suc- cinct summary of the 1931 bombardment textbook that Walker wrote for the ACTS Bombardment Section.  ‘Third, these lectures were the ones presented to the largest number of ACTS students, those who attended from 1938 to 1940, and they became the officers who would soon be tasked with turning strategic bombing theory into practice over Germany and Japan.
