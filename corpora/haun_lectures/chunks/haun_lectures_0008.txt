forecasters predicted good visibility and high ceilings en route and over the target area. Throughout the winter and spring of 1943, the weather had limited high-altitude daylight operations over Germany to only four days per month, so Eighth Air Force was especially keen to take full advantage of this most rare of sunny days.”  Over the North Sea, the bombers circled to form up into two combat wings, each consisted of three 18-aircraft groups, then proceeded east on their seven-hour journey to Germany and back. Unfortunately, a Luftwaffe reconnaissance plane spotted the aerial armada well out over the North Sea and notified the entire coastal defense force, providing an even earlier warn- ing than the detection time expected by ground-based early-warning radars.  As the unescorted B-17s approached the Frisian Islands just off the northwest German coastline, they encountered light flak but no fighters. The large formation went “feet dry” as it crossed the coast and tracked just west  ra LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  of Oldenburg toward the final turn point: the old Zeppelin airfield at Ahl- horn. Then, banking hard left, the planes turned toward Wildeshausen, the initial point (IP) for the bomb run. By the IP the two wings had separated by five miles and, as the lead wing began its bomb run, 150 German fighters swarmed the formation. The enemy defenders consisted mostly of single- engine Messerschmitt Me-109s and Focke-Wulf Fw-190s, but intermixed were two-engine Messerschmitt Me-110 night fighters. Though the IP was covered in haze, the B-17s pressed on as the skies cleared over Bremen, ex- cept for the small dark clouds formed by the explosion of German 88- and 105-millimeter shells, the most intensive flak barrage Eighth Air Force had yet encountered. As the lead bombardiers squinted through their Norden bombsights during the crucial seconds prior to bomb release, the Luftwaffe fighters ignored the flak and attacked in waves to disrupt the accuracy
