ntage shifted back and forth, with adversaries seeking technological ad- vantages in airframe and engine design and improvements in the lethality of air-to-air weapons.  In addition to air superiority, aircraft at the front were employed for observation, reconnaissance, attack, and interdiction missions. While these missions supported the ground war, efforts were also under way to bomb the enemyâ€™s heartland. It was the German Navy that first had the capability to strike deep inside enemy territory. Zeppelin dirigibles, designed for naval reconnaissance, could travel extended distances and carry heavy bomb loads. Nighttime raids on Britain commenced in January 1915. Initially directed against coastal targets, they soon ventured inland to attack London. Though the physical damage from the raids was minor, the reaction of the British population was anything but, with cries for improved air defenses and de- mands for retaliatory air strikes. Zeppelins continued to threaten England until January 1916, by which time the British had developed an acceptable air defense warning network combined with pursuit aircraft capable of inter-  Introduction 7  cepting and strafing the slow-moving and flammable airships. Subsequent Zeppelin attacks were sporadic and ended in December 1916 following a series of losses."  Respite for Britain was short-lived, however, as the Germans introduced their large two-engine Gotha Bombers and commenced daytime raids on London in June 1917. These air raids prompted a renewed outcry for further enhancement in air defenses and retaliatory attacks. Prime Minister David Lloyd George appointed General Jan Christian Smuts to assess the situation, and the Smuts Committee recommended improvement in air defenses and the founding of an independent strategic bombing force. Continued fears that Germany would escalate its strategic bombing campaign convinced the British government to create the independent Royal Air Force on April 1, 1918."  British airmen had
