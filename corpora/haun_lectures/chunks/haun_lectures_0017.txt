the ineptness of the Italian Army. Incarcerated for a year, he was vindicated and reinstated in 1917 after the Italian defeat at the Battle of Caporetto. By 1918, he was directing the Italian Central Aero- nautic Bureau, where he worked closely with the Italian aircraft manufac- turer Giovanni Caproni. In 1921, Douhet was promoted to general officer and in the same year published his treatise on strategic bombing: Command of the Air.'*  Douhet proposed the employment of air power in two stages. First, a na- tion had to invest in an independent air force in peacetime in order to be in the position to seize command of the air in wartime. He viewed air power as an inherently offensive weapon and believed that the air force that attacked first would have the advantage of surprise, initiative, and flexibility to allow it to concentrate and attack where it chose. By contrast, a reactive air force had to defend everywhere, compelling it to disperse its forces, thus tendering the advantage to the attacker. Douhet dismissed pursuit aviation as a defensive tactic ineffective against a massed strike package of well-armed and armored battleplanes flying a tight, mutually supportive formation. By going on the offense, an independent bomber force could gain and maintain command of the air by immobilizing the enemy’s nascent air force in its factories, ef- fectively “destroying eggs and the nests.”””  After gaining command of the air, the next phase to winning the war was to crush the enemy’s resistance. To Douhet, a successful air strategy de- pended on target selection. In the next war, which he anticipated would be total, entire nations would be mobilized. He argued that, under such con- ditions, there would be no moral or legal distinction between the military  10 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  and civilians. Air power, unlike surface forces, could avoid the adversary’s defenses and directly attack the enemy's vulnerable civilian population. At- tacking the popula
