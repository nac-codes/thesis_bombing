AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  and civilians. Air power, unlike surface forces, could avoid the adversary’s defenses and directly attack the enemy's vulnerable civilian population. At- tacking the population would weaken the structure of society and shatter its morale. Having lost the will to fight, the people would then demand their government put an end to war. Douhet also argued that by directly bombing civilians, the war would end more quickly and thus result in less bloodshed than long, drawn-out attritional warfare.”  Three criticisms of Douhet'’s theory are of note. First, his faith in the offensive nature of air power, central to his strategic bombing theory, later proved misplaced. In World War II, the advent of radar and technological advances in communications and the improvements in the performance of pursuit aircraft would reduce or negate the advantage he predicted for an attacking force. Effective air warning systems developed by Britain and Germany meant that defenses could concentrate fighters against incoming bombers. Though the bomber force still got through to the target, without gaining air superiority first, the attrition suffered would prove too high for sustained operations. Second, Douhet overestimated the fragility of civilian morale and underestimated the degree of control such powerful govern- ments as those of Great Britain, Germany, and Japan would exert over their population. Finally, Douhet did not foresee how air power might be used as a deterrent to war. If adversaries, each having independent air forces, lacked the means to defend against devastating air strikes, as with the nuclear stand- off between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then an incentive for restraint would arise on both sides, rather than the pre- emptive use of force his theory anticipated.”  In defense of Douhet, there was no way he could have anticipated how radar would shift the advantage in air power from the offense to the defense.
