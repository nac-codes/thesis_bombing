emptive use of force his theory anticipated.”  In defense of Douhet, there was no way he could have anticipated how radar would shift the advantage in air power from the offense to the defense. Moreover, despite the advantage of radar, pursuit aircraft could only attrit and curb, but not prevent, a determined bomber force from reaching its target. In the strategic calculations of the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union both counted on the offensive superiority of their bombers and interconti- nental ballistic missiles to make the threat of nuclear strike credible. Second, though Douhet may have misunderstood the control the German, Japanese, and British governments could exercise over civilians, he fully grasped the tenuous relationship between Mussolini and the Italian population as evi- denced by Mussolini's ouster, albeit temporarily, after the American bombing of Rome in July 1943.”    12 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  cusses the necessity for striking the vital war industries of the enemy even if this meant civilian collateral damage:  Among military objectives must be included the factories in which war material (including aircraft) is made, the depots in which it is stored, the railway termini and docks at which it is loaded or troops entrain or embark, and in general the means of communication and transportation of military personnel and material. Such objectives may be situated in centres of population in which their destruction from the air will result in casualties also to the neighbouring civilian population, in the same way as the long-range bombardment of a defended coastal town by a naval force results also in the incidental destruction of civilian life and property. The fact that air attack may have that result is no reason for regarding the bombing as illegiti- mate provided all reasonable care is taken to confine the scope of the bombing to the military objective. Otherwise a belligerent would be able to secure complete immuni
