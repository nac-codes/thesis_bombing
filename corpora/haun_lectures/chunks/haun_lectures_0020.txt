rding the bombing as illegiti- mate provided all reasonable care is taken to confine the scope of the bombing to the military objective. Otherwise a belligerent would be able to secure complete immunity for his war manufactures and de- pots merely by locating them in a large city, which would, in effect, become neutral territory—a position which the opposing belliger- ent would never accept. What is illegitimate, as being contrary to the dictates of humanity, is the indiscriminate bombing of a city for the sole purpose of terrorizing the civilian population. It is an entirely different matter to terrorise munition workers (men and women) into absenting themselves from work or stevedores into abandoning the loading of a ship with munitions through fear of air attack upon the factory or dock concerned. Moral effect is created by the bomb- ing in such circumstances but it is the inevitable result of a lawful operation of war—the bombing of a military objective.**  For Trenchard, strategic air strikes did not have to physically destroy the en- emy’s wartime economy to be effective. He claimed that “the morale effect of bombing stands undoubtedly to the material effect in a proportion of 20 to 1% Bombing factories, or even the threat of bombing, would drive out work- ers and halt production. Even near misses would have an impact as, presum- ably, local housing included those of the workers. Trenchard concluded that sustained strikes on the enemy’s war industry would break the morale of the workers and cause the collapse of the economy and the will of the people to  Introduction 13  continue the war, as he believed had happened in Germany, helping to bring about an end to World War I.  ‘The RAF’s emphasis on the offensive nature of air power and the morale effect of strategic bombing would later contribute to tragic consequences in the lead-up to World War II. Air power advocates in the interwar period had succeeded in convincing the British and French populations and the
