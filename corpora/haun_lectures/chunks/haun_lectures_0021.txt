bombing would later contribute to tragic consequences in the lead-up to World War II. Air power advocates in the interwar period had succeeded in convincing the British and French populations and their politi- cians of the destructive force of strategic bombing. In 1932, the future prime minister Stanley Baldwin infamously declared in the House of Commons that “the bomber would always get through.” Later, the fear of the Luftwaffe and the threat of air strikes on London and Paris factored into the British and French decisions to appease Hitler at Munich in 1938.”  Trenchard’s focus on attacking morale and the de-emphasis on mate- rial damage relieved the RAF of the most pressing operational and tactical challenges for long-range bombing: navigation, target identification, and bombing accuracy. When war came, the RAF again had difficulty in locating targets and in hitting those it did identify, as documented in the infamous August 1941 Butt Report, which showed that less than a third of aircrews were able to drop bombs within five miles of their intended targets.”  In Trenchard’s defense, focus on the morale effect of strategic bombing had several advantages for his fledgling service. First, unlike material dam- age, it was much more difficult to quantify the morale effect of bombing. This made it difficult for critics to refute RAF claims as to the effectiveness of strategic bombing. Also, at the operational level, if placing the bomb close to a factory was considered to be just as good as destroying a factory, then some of the thornier technical challenges of navigation, target identification, and precision bombing could be ignored. Second, Trenchard’s top priority was keeping his newly formed air force “in being,” Strategic bombing offered an argument for an air force capable of achieving independent political out- comes. Beyond the impact of his leadership upon the RAF, Trenchard’s ideas also influenced American airmen, the most prominent of whom was Briga- dier
