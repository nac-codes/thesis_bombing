ion, however, for both defensive and escort roles. While he publicly argued for the development of air power for coastal defense, within the Air Service he developed and shared his ideas on offen- sive air operations. Unlike Douhet, who advocated the direct attack of civil- ians, or Trenchard, who targeted worker morale, Mitchell’s theory was aimed at the material destruction of the enemy’s forces, from military factories to fielded forces. The chapter entitled “Attack of Land Establishments” listed the potential objectives for air attack: “The Bombardment Group Commander will receive his mission from the next higher Air Force Commander. His ob- jective may be enemy airdromes, concentration centers, training camps, per- sonnel pools, transportation centers, whether rail, road, sea, river or canal, ammunition and supply dumps, headquarters of staff commands, forts and  Introduction 17  heavily fortified positions, trains, convoys, columns of troops, bridges, dams, locks, power plants, tunnels, telephone and telegraph centers, manufacturing areas, water supply and growing grain.”** Mitchell thus provided a list of po- tential military and civilian targets for strategic bombing, though he did not provide a theoretical framework for determining the priority in which these targets should be struck or how these attacks would lead to victory.  With regard to attacking civilians, Mitchell indicated that “it may be nec- essary to intimidate the civilian population in a certain area to force them to discontinue something which is having a direct bearing on the outcome of the conflict. In rare instances Bombardment aviation will be required to act as an arm of reprisal.”  To justify civilian casualties in manufacturing areas, Mitchell, unlike Trenchard, focused on the material impact such attacks would have in short- ening war.  ‘The ethics of attack on manufacturing areas in the rear is one which is engaging the attention of an International Tribunal convened at the Hague.
