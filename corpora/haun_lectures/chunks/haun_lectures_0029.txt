xpansion of the Air Corps in 1927 did class size begin to increase, going from 15 graduates to 39 by 1931. Likewise, Langley Field could not physically accommodate both ACTS and the new flying squadrons that were being formed. A new location for the school was identified near Montgomery, Alabama, and ACTS moved to its new home at Maxwell Field in July 1931.  In 1928, the ACTS curriculum expanded to include the Air Force Course as a capstone event for the year. By 1935, the development of this course had become the chief concern of the Air Tactics and Strategy Department, the most important department at ACTS. The faculty produced foundational lectures that articulated the American strategic bombing theory based on HADPB. To make the dream of HADPB a reality, however, would require a long-range bomber capable of accurately dropping its bomb loads from high  Introduction 21  altitude, a quest met only by the development of the Norden bombsight and the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.“*  DEVELOPMENT OF THE NORDEN BOMBSIGHT AND THE BOEING B-17  During the 1920s and early 1930s, while the Air Corps Tactical School lec- tured on how long-range bombers would win wars by conducting indepen- dent strategic bombing campaigns, the reality was that the Air Corps flew the Martin MB-2, a primitive twin-engine biplane with a top speed of 100 knots and service ceilings of no more than 13,000 feet. In 1928, the selection of the Curtiss B-2 modestly improved performance with a speed of 115 knots, service ceiling of 17,000 feet, a bomb load of 4,000 pounds, and a combat range of 400 miles. A significant improvement would not take place until 1930 with the development of the all-metal, twin-engine monoplanes in the form of the Boeing Y1B-9 and the Martin B-10 bombers. The Martin B-10 had a top speed of 185 knots, a service ceiling of 21,000 feet, and a nautical mile combat range of 500 miles.’”  US Army Air Service Martin MB-2 bomber, circa 1922.
