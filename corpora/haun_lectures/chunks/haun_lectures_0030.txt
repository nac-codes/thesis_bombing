As these aircraft gradually expanded the flight envelope for bombers in terms of speed, range, and altitude, the Air Corps was simultaneously work- ing to acquire the bombsights required for accurate, high-altitude weapons delivery. Interestingly, it would be the navy that succeeded in procuring such a bombsight. In 1920, the Bureau of Ordnance discussed the possibility of a gyro-stabilized bombsight with Mr. Carl L. Norden. Norden, a former engi- neer with the Sperry Gyroscope Company, had previously worked on vari- ous projects for the navy. The navy was interested in a bombsight capable of hitting a moving ship and the Bureau of Ordnance requested that Norden develop a general utility bombsight. For nine years Norden designed and refined his bombsights; by 1929, he had the initial design for a new bomb- sight, a synchronized device that promised to be accurate for high-altitude bombing. By 1931, Norden had delivered to the navy its first such device, and the following year, the bombsight proved itself superior in testing as the only sight capable of accurate bombing up to 18,000 feet.  In 1933, the US Air Corps received its first Norden bombsight for testing and soon awarded contracts for production. Norden used the testing data obtained from the navy and Air Corps and, by 1935, adjustments had been incorporated into the basic design that would later be used in World War II. ‘The following year, the Air Corps procured 100 bombsights to be mount-    Boeing Y1B-9A bomber and a P-26 pursuit, circa 1933.
