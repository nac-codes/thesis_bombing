It would eventually be in the B-17, however, that the Norden bombsight fulfilled American airmen’s dreams of a high-altitude daylight precision bomber.”  ‘The Air Corps’ dream for a long-range strategic bomber resulted in the development of the game-changing four-engine Boeing B-17, which arrived in 1935. The US Army, however, forced the Air Corps to buy the Douglas B-18 Bolo instead, a twin-engine bomber deemed more suitable for support- ing ground forces. Despite the setback, the Air Corps succeeded in procuring thirteen YB-17s designated as “test” aircraft. These aircraft formed a single squadron, which would remain the only B-17 squadron until production ramped up in 1939. By war's end, 12,700 B-17’s would be built.”  ‘The early B-17s had a crew of six although by World War II, the number of crew had expanded to 10. It had a top speed of 256 mph at 14,000 feet and a service ceiling of 30,000 feet. Its combat load was 4,000 pounds for long missions but could be adapted for shorter missions and larger loads by car- rying less fuel. For defense, the B-17 was initially armed with five 30-caliber machine guns, with 50-caliber guns added later.*!  By 1938, the Air Corps calculated that the B-17 mounted with the Norden bombsight had a mean error of 241 feet from 15,000 feet. This meant that half of the bombs could be expected to hit within a 241-foot radius of the target (combat experience would show these calculations to be overly optimistic).

To compensate for this dispersion, the Air Corps tactic was to drop a larger number of small bombs, the 500-pound bomb being the preferred size.*  ‘The arrival of the B-17 and Norden bombsight had finally
