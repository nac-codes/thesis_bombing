he Air Tactics and Strategy Department from 1937 until the school closed in 1940.*  With the move to Maxwell Field back in 1931, the number of students attending ACTS had more than quadrupled, for a total of 870 officers graduat- ing from 1931 to 1940. Nearly half attended a truncated twelve-week course from 1939 to 1940 when HADPB dominated the curriculum. ACTS graduates would go on to contribute significantly in World War II. Two-thirds of the gen-  Introduction 29  eral officers in the US Army Air Forces (USAAF) were alumni, including elev- en of its thirteen three-star generals and three of its four four-star generals.*  HiGuH-ALTITUDE DAYLIGHT PRECISION BOMBING THEORY  By the mid-1930s, the Department of Air Tactics and Strategy at ACTS had begun to offer courses on the air force, pursuit, bombardment, attack, obser- vation, and naval operations. As a result of the Great Depression, however, the Air Corps’ limited acquisition budget had compelled it to favor invest- ment in the bomber at the expense of the fighter. This decision, along with the investment in civilian aviation for long-range transport aircraft, had, in turn, produced a technology gap further favoring the bomber’s offensive ca- pabilities over fighter defenses. It proved difficult for fighter pilots like Chen- nault to convince Air Corps leaders of the viability of high-performance interceptor aircraft that did not yet exist when airmen were already flying the remarkable B-17 at previously unfathomable speeds and altitudes, and dropping bombs with their new Norden bombsights with amazing accuracy. Upon the departure of Chennault, the Bomber Mafia monopolized the school’s thinking on the operational employment of air forces, placing ever- increasing emphasis on unescorted strategic bombers. It was in the Air Force Course, the capstone event at ACTS, that the faculty presented its theory of HADPB.* Harold George commenced the Air Force Course with “An In- quiry into the Subject “War” (chapter 1).
