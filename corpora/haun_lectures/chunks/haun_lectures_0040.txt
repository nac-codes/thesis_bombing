ned in fighting the past war;—that was done 18 years ago. We are concerned, however, in determining how air power should be employed in the next war and what constitutes the principles governing its employment, not by journeying into the hinterlands of wild imaginings but by traveling the highway of common sense and logic.  In pursuing this purpose, we realize that air power has not proven itself under the actual test of war. We must also realize that neither land power nor sea power has proven itself in the face of modern air power.  ‘The question for you to consider from today onward, to have constantly before you as you continue your military careers, is substantially this: “Has the advent of air power brought into existence a method of prosecution of war which has revolutionized that art and given to air forces a strategical objective of their own, independent of either land or naval forces, the at- tainment of which might, in itself, accomplish the purpose of war; or has air power merely added another weapon to the waging of war which makes it in fact only an auxiliary of the traditional military forces?” The correct answer to that question will color and influence the entire art of war. It is not merely a minor problem, it is of major importance; it is basic; it is fun- damental because it is concerned with the strongest of man’s instincts: that of self-preservation.  Now such a question can be answered intelligently only after we have inquired into the very depths of the philosophy of war. We must determine:  What is war?  Why does war occur?

Is it to the advantage of civilization to change the method of waging war if such a change is possible?  36 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  Has modern civilization reduced or increased the vulnerability of nations? Have science and invention provided a new method of waging war?  After we have analyzed and
