To continue a war which is hopeless is worse than an undesirable peace, because the latter comes soon or late anyway; but to continue a modern war without machinery is impossible.  ‘That nations today are more vulnerable than was the case a century ago, I believe, is obvious.

Have science and invention provided a new method of waging war?  ‘That is a question which you will have to decide for yourselves as this course progresses. We know that modern airplanes can carry bombs capable of tremendous destruction. We know that airplanes are being constructed with a range of thousands of miles. We know that one by one the limitations of aircraft are being removed; that blind flying and blind landing are now possibilities; that the danger of icing during flight has been eliminated; that navigation in the air is as exact a science as is navigation on the ocean.
