mptions would be challenged in World War II. As it turned out, air forces were no different than surface forces in that the neutralization or defeat of the enemy forces remained a critical aspect of warfare. Further, modern in- dustrial economies proved more resilient and required far more destruction than anticipated. Even when economic paralysis did occur, this did not bring about the immediate surrender of the enemy, a reality encountered with both Germany and Japan.  ‘The three lectures that follow in chapter 2 build upon George's theoretical framework by considering further the offensive nature of air power, its ability to avoid conventional attritional battle, and its potential to achieve victory by targeting the center of gravity of the enemy—that is, the civilian population and its will to resist—by disrupting economic infrastructure.  The Objective of Air Warfare  This chapter presents three lectures that expand upon the ACTS thesis pro- vided in “An Inquiry into the Subject ‘War” in chapter 1, asserting that the independent employment of air power had ushered in a new means to wage war. Foregoing the need to first defeat the enemy’s military forces, air power could directly attack the enemy’s will to resist by targeting the vital and vul- nerable elements of its economic infrastructure.  AIR POWER AND AIR WARFARE  Major Muir Fairchild introduced the Air Force Course in 1939 with a lecture on the purpose of air power. In “Air Power and Air Warfare,” he emphasized the importance of having an air force in being, capable of achieving indepen- dent outcomes during times of both war and peace. He argued that it is the body of ideas and concepts developed during peacetime that determined the air force available at the outbreak of war.  Air Power and Air Warfare Major Muir S. Fairchild, A.C.
