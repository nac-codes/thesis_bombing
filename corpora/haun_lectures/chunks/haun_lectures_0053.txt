Muir S. Fairchild, A.C. March 27, 1939  Gentlemen, this morning we begin the main part of the Air Force Course.” You may perhaps remember that I outlined this part of the course in the ori- entation talk at the start of the short course on Basic Tactical Functions at the beginning of the school year. As was stated at that time, this main part of the Air Force Course will be divided into three general sections: Air Warfare, Air Forces of the Army, and the Employment of Combat Aviation.

In the following sections of the course we will try and develop the status of the air forces of our army and consider their employment in various situations that might confront us.  In the short course on Basic Tactical Functions we tried to give you the coordinating principles governing the tactical functioning of Combat Aviation, as they have been developed by the School. Thereafter, the School, through the other sections of the Department of Air Tactics and Strategy, has laid before you the best and most up-to-date thought available on how the components of an air force operate to do their assigned jobs.  So far, however, little or nothing has been said about what we are going to use the air force for—how we are going to employ it—what the assigned jobs of its components should be. We propose now to set about remedying that omission. We will be concerned from now on with what we want to ac- complish rather than how the different classes of Combat Aviation go about doing the jobs that are assigned to them.  ‘The questions, then, that we want to try and find answers for, are: first, the big question as to what the mission—the purpose—of the air force is to be, and then, the subsidiary questions as to what the specific objectives are to be, that will best and most efficiently accomplish
