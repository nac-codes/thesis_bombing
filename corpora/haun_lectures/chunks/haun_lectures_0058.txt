g the course of the World War, Great Britain alone produced a total of some 57,000 air- planes, and that at the end of war, she had some 22,000 in commission. While these were small light airplanes, not to be compared with modern aircraft in size or complexity, it is apparent that the Air Power ofa first-class nation may be very great indeed compared to what we have been accustomed to thinking of during the past few years as a sizable Air Force.  I have here a chart showing a summarization of the strength of the Ger- man Air Force as of last June. These figures are from a confidential G-2 bul- letin and should be treated as confidential.  It is important to note that all of these airplanes have been produced since 1935 and that they constitute a completely modern up-to-date air force with performance comparable to those of equipment we are buying this year.  Please note the production figures on the chart. In the case of Bombard- ment, for example, this will have resulted by the first of this month in adding some 2,900 additional new bombardment airplanes to the 3,350 shown. This gives a total of at least 250 active bombardment squadrons plus a reserve of about 50% of the 6,200 bombardment airplanes on hand.

It is necessary for any one who still may be thinking of Air Power in terms of a few observation squadrons, protected by some local pursuit and backed up by a scattering of bombardment and attack airplanes to radically alter his conceptions in the face of th
