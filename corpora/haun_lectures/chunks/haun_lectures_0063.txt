of the force employed; the relatively few attacks that were made; the relatively small tonnage of bombs that was dropped; the inaccuracy of the bombing, and, hence, the inconsiderable material damage caused to vital objectives. Contrast these means with the strategic results obtained: The lowered indus- trial output; the disorganization and confusion; and above all, the breaking down of the moral resistance of the nation attacked.  Ask yourselves, in the light of these conclusions, what must be the re- sult of Air Warfare waged with such Air Power as Germany has today es- tablished—over 6,000 bombers equipped to operate in all ordinary weather; equipped and trained to navigate to any objective within a radius many times that available in the World War; equipped to carry, on a single mission, many times the tonnage of bombs employed in four years of Air Warfare; and fi- nally, equipped and trained to drop these bombs with scientific accuracy on the selected objective!  It is apparent that properly employed, the results must be almost incal- culable. It is also apparent that proper employment is not automatic and in- evitable. It is to be arrived at only through a full understanding of all aspects of the capabilities and limitations of Air Power, and a thoroughgoing air esti- mate of the national situation.  Since the World War there have been two examples of the influence of Air Power in being on the course of international relations so outstanding that they must be considered. The first example is to be found in the Mediter- ranean situation of 1935. Lest you feel that the importance of this incident    ‘The Objective of Air Warfare 55  is over-rated, I will give you an evaluation from a strictly impartial source. I quote from a publication of the United States Naval War College entitled, The Employment of Aviation in Naval Warfare: “Therefore, aircraft based on shore, as compared with ship-based aircraft, must be considered as having a strength much greater than w
