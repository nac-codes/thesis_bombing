ar College entitled, The Employment of Aviation in Naval Warfare: “Therefore, aircraft based on shore, as compared with ship-based aircraft, must be considered as having a strength much greater than would be indicated by an evaluation of numbers and types alone.”*  ‘Thus we may expect that a nation with strong air power can create zones along its coasts and around its outlying fortified positions within which its shore-based aircraft are likely to have practically continuous freedom of ac- tion, and in which their activities in the fields of information, security and attack will exert an important influence upon nearby naval operations. Be- fore undertaking operations near hostile coasts, a naval commander must therefore seriously consider this aircraft influence, and decide whether or not he can afford the losses that are certain to ensue. To continue for extended periods to operate, or even to base, within the reach of strong hostile aviation it would seem to be necessary either to render the enemy air bases untenable, or to establish a deep and very superior defense around the fleet, neither of which is very easy of accomplishment.  ‘The growth of the influence of defensive air power upon hostile naval operations close to shore has been strikingly demonstrated in the recent his- tory of the Mediterranean. Great Britain is distant a thousand miles from the western entrance to the sea, but for two hundred years has completely domi- nated it through her navy alone. Her positions at Gibraltar, Malta and Egypt, although far from home, have been satisfactory for the maintenance of her fleet. In continuation of this policy of naval domination, and apparently without an adequate appreciation of present conditions, last year she moved the major portion of her fleet to the Mediterranean in order to halt the Ital- ian conquest of Ethiopia. Italy estimated the situation accurately and defied Britain. Two significant events at once occurred: first, the British moved their nav
