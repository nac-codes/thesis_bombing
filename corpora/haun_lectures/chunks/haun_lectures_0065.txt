iterranean in order to halt the Ital- ian conquest of Ethiopia. Italy estimated the situation accurately and defied Britain. Two significant events at once occurred: first, the British moved their naval forces to Gibraltar and Suez; and second, they then called upon France to assist them if they were attacked by Italy. Even though Italy was weakened through having to send her expeditionary forces through the Suez Canal di- rectly past a large part of the British navy, this much superior naval force was constrained to abdicate control of the Central Mediterranean. Without doubt, Italian submarines and motor torpedo craft menaced the British Fleet, but in the World War the German submarines were an even greater menace. There was one element of opposing strength, however, which the British ap-  56 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  parently had under-estimated until the arrival of the crisis, and that was the Italian air power.  To be able to nullify this power, England required at least an equal air power in positions which she could defend and supply, and so located as to be within flying range of objectives whose destruction would seriously injure Italy. England had no such positions. Her air- craft carriers were too vulnerable, and had to be moved away with the rest of the fleet. Neither the harbors nor the terrain of Gibraltar and Malta are suitable for maintaining large numbers of aircraft. Air bases at Cyprus or Alexandria would have been cut off from direct supply via Gibraltar, and are out of easy reach of vulnerable Italian positions. Hence Britain's call for help to France, which has a well- based air establishment even stronger than the Italian. Great Britain did not need the French navy, but she sorely needed the French air force and its bases.*  Here, then, we have perhaps the first outstanding example of Air Power in being accomplishing the purpose for which it was created. Note also that this result was achieved through the ability of Air Power
