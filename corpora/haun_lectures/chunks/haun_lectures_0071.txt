We therefore turn our attention first to an analysis of these methods of past warfare which have been passed down to us under the familiar heading—“The Principles of War.”  “The Principles of War are immutable,’ our Training Regulations stated in 1921, after listing at that time our nine principles of war: The Objective; The Offensive; Mass; Economy of Force; Movement; Surprise; Simplicity; Se- curity; and Cooperation.  How does a principle become immutable and just exactly how can a prin- ciple be determined in an art in which controlled experimentation is impos- sible? In the case of the principles of war, some evidence is available.  Major General J. FE. C. Fuller, of the British Army, relates that in 1911 he became convinced that war might break out at any moment and so started to prepare himself for the inevitable struggle. He turned to British Field Service Regulations and found the statement: “The principles of war are neither very numerous nor in themselves very abstruse, but the application of them is dif- ficult, and cannot be made subject to rules.”"”  ‘The Objective of Air Warfare 61  Familiarity with the methods of “writing” regulations should cause us no surprise in finding that this statement seems to have been derived from Marshal Marmont's dictum that “general principles for the conduct of armies are not very numerous, but their application gives rise to a great variety of combinations, which it is impossible to foresee and to lay down as rules.”"  Strangely enough, the simple principles mentioned were not to be found listed or discussed in the British regulations. So General Fuller turned to the correspondence of Napoleon and from his study deduced six. Napoleon, in- cidentally, always refused to make a statement of his principles. “If I were to write the principles of war,’ he said, “their simplicity would be astonishing”  When a new edition of British Field Service Regulations was published in 1920, General Fuller’s principles appeared therein,
