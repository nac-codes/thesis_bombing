the principles of war,’ he said, “their simplicity would be astonishing”  When a new edition of British Field Service Regulations was published in 1920, General Fuller’s principles appeared therein, with a slight modifi- cation. The same principles, with one additional, were copied into United States Army Training Regulations in 1921, and it was at this time that this particular set of principles became immutable. He has continued his studies and re-stated his principles.  But the immutable principles disappeared from our regulations in 1928. However, they still are to be found, now six in number, with corollaries, in current British Field Service Regulations. They also appear, seven in num- ber, in an American official text on strategy, published in 1936, and strangely enough, this set was copied from British regulations of 1924.  Not the least of the peculiarities of the principles of war is that other armies have discovered entirely different sets. French regulations, for exam- ple, list but three: Impose your will on the enemy; conserve your liberty of action; and economy of force.  Foch wrote a book entitled The Principles of War. He listed four such principles: economy of forces; freedom of action; free disposal of forces; and security.  ‘This analysis shows that our American military thinkers have been con- tent to accept their principles second- or third-hand from foreign military writers.  ‘This also brings to our attention that the term Principle was always used by the elder military writers to mean a guide or rule of conduct.  This term—Principle—is defined in half a dozen ways, but in military writing it has not been used in a scientific sense as meaning a fundamental or basic truth, until our own Training Regulations called our present principles of war immutable or perhaps in simpler terms “unchangeable.”  62 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  Based on our own regulations and concepts, we must first make sure that we understand a “principle” t
