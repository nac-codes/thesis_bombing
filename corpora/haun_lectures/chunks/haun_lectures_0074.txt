However, the leaders of that day are not so much to blame, as would be those future leaders who might repeat the same mistake now that they have a weapon which can reach that “home front”  As a result of our analysis we must decide that the real objective in war is not the destruction of the enemy’s armed forces by battle but is simply the defeat of the enemy nation to that degree necessary to force the enemy to  ‘The Objective of Air Warfare 63  sue for peace on terms favorable to our national policy.
