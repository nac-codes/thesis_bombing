rces which are expected to bring about a major decision. It does not follow automatically that all of the command nor all of the types of forces available must be used on the offensive. Moreover, in most cases it is essential to assume the defensive with a large proportion of the total effort in order to release the power needed for the offensive. This has been accepted, even by the French now, as reasonable employment for ground forces—it is yet to be applied to the several types of forces available on the national scale. This is evidenced by the fact that all types of national military forces, land, sea, and air forces, make the offensive their goal with little regard to their peculiar characteristics in this role.  We do claim that offensive action should be predominant with air force, but this is not because of blind adherence to a so-called “principle of the of- fensive.” It is simply because we believe that offensive air action is decidedly stronger in producing the national end desired. We believe that the offensive capability of an air force is its most outstanding characteristic. We believe that intelligent employment must exploit those known characteristics.  The Principles of Mass—Economy of Force—Movement  Let us now consider mass, economy of force, and movement. Like the Offen- sive, each has its special application according to the type of force and the  64 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  echelon of command under consideration. For example, the effect of mass ac- tion by an air force can be produced without physical grouping of the forces as is required in the mass of land and sea forces. Here again the characteristics of the force must be thoroughly appreciated and the application of these methods should be in accord with those characteristics and the end desired, rather than the blind following of a method originally devised for some other set of condi- tions. Even today you will find those who would employ the different charac- teristics
