ty years to contemplate the adoption of the longbow, they marched 50,000 mounted knights and humble foot-sol- diers into the withering fire of a mere handful of Englishmen whose principal weapon was the longbow (year 1415, near Calais)."? Nearly half the French force was lost—but, had they not maintained their traditional weapons and methods? Apparently the French were saved from ever learning the lesson of the longbow because an even more revolutionary change in the form of gunpowder came into use.  ‘These examples are dimmed by the obscurity of history—they appear to have little bearing on present-day activities. But we should reflect that these people and their soldiers, who clung steadfastly to their traditions and or-  68 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  thodox methods were seriously fighting to defend something they wanted to keep. To them, these incidents which we stamp as colossal blunders, were no more evident then as are the errors in more modern times.  Contrary to the popular belief, our modern times are not entirely illumi- nated with military brilliance.  For example, let’s look at the French again. For at least forty years after their defeat by Germany in 1870, they had thoroughly schooled themselves in the belief that war consisted of no other method than the offensive. As we pointed out, that method had taken on a sort of religious fervor. When that war began in 1914 they plunged headlong into the offensive only to be repulsed with such losses as to permanently weaken their chance of success. Now certainly war was a serious matter with France, but still here was the whole thing based on a wrong concept—a failure to evaluate properly the factors—a blind following of a will-o-wisp misnamed a Principle of War.  But France was not the only offender. Germany was prepared for a few months’ war and was unable to adjust herself to a contest which dragged into four years. England, with her habitual confidence in her fleet, failed to esti- mate the
