he had to maintain the arteries through which that energizing flow of men and supplies reached him, from his own people. Any attempt to avoid the defending armed force and strike at the heart of the enemy nation, left exposed those vital arteries of supply. Hence, the ground commander was forced to accept an intermediate objective; he was left no choice; he must defeat the enemy’s armed force preliminary to final military pressure through occupation. This concept was so widely recognized as to  80 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  become confused in the minds of many with the ultimate aim. Many leaders came to accept the enemy’s armed forces as the true military objective—as in truth it might have been since it was an unavoidable preliminary. Even Von Clausewitz himself inclined toward this error when he defined strategy as the art of the employment of battles as a means to gain the object of the war.  So, too, in naval warfare, the trial and error method of actual opera- tions has dictated the selection of the hostile armed forces as the primary objective. Naval forces found that they could neither safeguard friendly lines of communication nor deny hostile lines of communication so long as the hostile armed forces were in existence and free to act. Surface forces found it necessary to defeat other surface forces before they could secure their ulti- mate aims: the will to resist.
