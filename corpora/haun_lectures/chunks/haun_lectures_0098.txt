r victory finds expression in the minds of those commanders. Even the private soldier is fighting essentially a battle of wills. The machine gun on the hill stops the progress of a hundred men. Why? None of them has been hurt. They are not shackled or chained to the ground. The terrain in front of them is not impassable. They are physically free.

None of the props which bolster the soldier's morale
