ance of political domain over the people of that territory; as an example, the need for raw materials and the internal pressure of over population caused Japan to take Manchuria and Italy to conquer Ethiopia; it may force Germany to expand in the valley to the Danube and conquer a new colonial empire.  Again, national need may require political acquiescence. It may require one nation’s accepting the policies of another—without any thought of per- manent acquisition of territory or political right. For example, American participation in the last war. Our participation in that war was prompted largely by the desire to force the Central Powers to accept American policies. We had no need for additional territory—but we might need extension of existing policies, particularly commercial policies.  ‘The third national need is for maintenance of existing policies, and con- tinuance of political control over existing dominion. In other words, the need to fight to maintain what we already have in the face of a covetous and aggressive foe. This seems to be the principal need for the maintenance of American armed forces at this stage of our national development.  To accomplish these needs three instruments are available today: ground forces, sea forces, and air forces. Each has peculiar powers. They should be apportioned relative to each other in light of their peculiar powers toward accomplishing the national need.  For the acquisition of territory, Armies furnish the final evidence of suc- cess. Air forces may assist by direct action against the national will, or by destroying or emasculating the means to fight. Navies may assist by safe- guarding the transportation of men and supplies against enemy sea forces. But the final consolidation of victory and establishment of civil government may require physical occupation, and devolves upon the Army.  In the other two types of national need, occupation is incidental to the breaking of the hostile will. It is temporary. It may or
