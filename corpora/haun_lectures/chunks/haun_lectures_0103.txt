ernment may require physical occupation, and devolves upon the Army.  In the other two types of national need, occupation is incidental to the breaking of the hostile will. It is temporary. It may or may not be necessary, depending upon whether sufficient pressure may be brought to bear in other ways. Certainly where frontiers are contiguous, armies will play an important role in defending against other armies.  Where frontiers are not contiguous, armies must be transported to the theatre of war in order to exert influence. If air forces are within range to per- mit of strategic offense, they may be the decisive factor. Whether or not both air forces are in position to take the strategic offense, air forces will always be in position to affect the transportation of surface forces to exposed frontiers.  84 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  In the latter two categories of national need: the need to force acquies- cence and the need to maintain defense, the principal reliance may devolve upon the air force.

Those powers and limitations govern the application of the means to the end. Land forces and sea forces express their powers through occupation. The ultimate objective of land forces is the occupation and control of vital enemy territory. The ultimate objective of sea forces is the occupation and control of vital sea
