ssly from the old and known to the new and untried. Let us not claim that the airplane has out- moded all other machines of war. Rather, let us be content with an evident truth: The air force has introduced a new and different means of waging war.  Alexander Pope left us a couplet. The first line has been quoted to us many times: “Be not the first by whom the new is tried” Very well. But let us not forget the rest of that sage advice. “Be not the first by whom the new is tried, Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.”  CoMMENTS ON “THE AIM IN WAR”  ‘The first two-thirds of the lecture expand on the lectures of George, Fairchild, and Wilson by discussing specific economic and racial causes for war and explaining why wars have been fought as they have in the past with the only forces available, that is, armies and navies. In the final third of the lecture, Hansell introduces the reason why the ACTS believes air power to be inher- ently offensive in nature by suggesting that the vastness of the air domain makes defense against aerial attack infeasible. In 1936 he cannot anticipate how radar will invalidate this key assumption for strategic bombing in just a few short years.  Nonetheless, Hansell does articulate here a theory of victory that is dis- tinct from that requiring battlefield defeat and occupation. While armies may be the appropriate means to achieve the brute force objective of annexing ter- ritory, air forces may be capable of victory by coercing political concessions or deterring enemy aggression. These important concepts of coercion and deterrence remain relevant today as air power strategists continue to evaluate how air power may be utilized independently to achieve limited aims.  Together, these three lectures and Harold George's lecture in chapter 1 pro- vided the intellectual foundation for the Air Corps Tactical School’s theory of strategic bombing. Fairchild emphasized how peacetime thinking led to the creation of air power. Wilson stressed how the
