A combat zone of 20 to 30 miles in depth may be crossed in from 10 to 15 minutes. Unless the enemy pursuit succeeds in engaging the bombardment formation without being prevented by the friendly pursuit the bombardment should be able to traverse the combat zone in dispersed formation and thus limit the effect of antiaircraft opposition. If, however, the hostile pursuit is present in force and is not prevented from attacking the bombardment formation, the latter will assume a defensive formation. It is unlikely that hostile antiaircraft will  96 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  fire when its own pursuit is present and engaged in attacking the bombard- ment formation. A coordinated attack by pursuit and antiaircraft would be difficult of accomplishment without considerable danger to the pursuit. The antiaircraft doctrine, which in effect is that when friendly pursuit is present in force, the antiaircraft artillery withholds its fire, is logical and will doubt- less be applied.  Upon passing through the combat zone, the bombardment route will avoid the antiaircraft batteries grouped around vital points in the system of rail communications, important supply establishments, etc. Should hostile pursuit be absent or prevented by friendly pursuit from attacking the bom- bardment formation when the bombardment formation crosses the hostile front, it is expected that hostile pursuit units in the air and on the alert at airdromes will be notified of the presence of the bombardment formation. These pursuit units will endeavor to intercept the bombardment formation as quickly as possible. The time
