and on the alert at airdromes will be notified of the presence of the bombardment formation. These pursuit units will endeavor to intercept the bombardment formation as quickly as possible. The time required for interception will be that neces- sary for transmission of information to the pursuit units; the time required to issue orders, clear the airdrome and climb to the altitude at which the bom- bardment formation is flying, if the pursuit unit be on the ground; the dif- ference in speeds between the bombardment formation and friendly pursuit; and the accuracy with which the hostile pursuit units carry out the intercep- tion. Should interception by hostile pursuit be effected before the objective is reached, the bombardment unit will assume a defensive formation and en- gage in a running fight until the objective is reached. If the pursuit force fails in preventing the bombardment formation from reaching its objective, but continues attacking the latter when it arrives within range of the antiaircraft artillery, the bombardment unit will assume a dispersed formation, release its bombs therefrom, and be prepared to close up to a defensive formation upon clearing the range of the antiaircraft batteries. The time required for a bom- bardment formation to open or close, to assume one formation or another, is measured in seconds, rather than minutes. It may appear wise in theory for the antiaircraft to refrain from firing when a dispersed formation is assumed, on the proposition that pursuit will then dive in to engage the bombardment airplanes, or for pursuit to refrain from attacking a defensive formation on the assumption that antiaircraft artillery will then open fire. However, it is submitted that the extreme nicety or coordination of such tactics will cause delays which, measured in time, will be such to allow the bombardment for-  The Bomber Always Gets Through 97  mation to proceed a great deal of time without being subjected either to the fire of pursuit or
