ategic considerations.  We will attempt to be perfectly reasonable. We have been investigating this morning the characteristics of an air force with a view to exploiting its  100 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  particular powers. In considering the air offensive and the antiaircraft de- fense we will, however, try to retain a perfectly unbiased point of view. Let us emphasize that we are investigating a question that is being debated by the foremost military writers among the leading air powers of the world.  If we consider just the air combat phase, there are those who relegate the defensive pursuit airplane to second place, contending that this type of airplane has little chance of success in attacking a striking force airplane safeguarded by all around fire; that striking force airplanes which can con- centrate their mutually supporting fire when flying in close formation are practically invulnerable to pursuit attack. There are those who contend that the speed of the larger airplane has approached that of the pursuit airplane, making interception difficult and evasion easy, and, that while it is true that a striking force airplane presents a larger target, yet it can be exposed to a larger number of hits before being put out of action.  On the other hand, we have those who claim that the modern pursuit airplane armed with cannon is fatal to bombardment airplanes flying in close formation; that the efficiency of the weapons carried by the striking force airplane will be considerably limited at altitude and by the high angular ve- locity in the brief moment available when firing at a modern diving pursuit airplane; that the pursuit airplane approaches and passes at the tremendous speed in angular velocity of 187 degree per second which is entirely too fast for the flexible guns of the defensive formation to fire with any degree of accuracy.  We are sure that neither of these views is correct.  We are not sure of how best to establish any basis of compar
