You may remember that towards the latter part of the war, a British bombing force was used against objectives in the Saar and Rhine basins. It was used to wage an air offensive against the German industrial structure. All of the elements of the antiaircraft defensive were present on the German side. The British bombing squadrons were trying to penetrate this artificial resistance. The German antiaircraft artillery and barrage balloons defended the objectives that were selected for British air attack. We have here all of the basic elements upon which to base a rather fair discussion of the tactical offense and the tactical defense.  Let us review then the general situation in order that we may give these air operations the tactical consideration that is quite necessary. The British Independent Force consisted initially of the 41st Wing of three squadrons— the 55th Day Squadron and the 16th and 100th Night Squadrons. Later, upon expansion into the VIII Brigade and, subsequently, into the Independent Force, three additional squadrons were added—the 99th, 104th and 110th Day Squadrons. The wing was based initially at Ochey but was moved later to Tantonville. We find the Night Bombardment squadrons encountered little opposition from pursuit and antiaircraft artillery. The German records indi- cate that only a single night bomber ran afoul of the German balloon apron defense. The greatest difficulties were encountered in the night navigation to the objective in the wretched weather of that theater of operations.  It is, therefore, in the employment of the Day Squadrons that we may ex- pect to find the greatest result in our research.  All of the Day Squadrons wer
