andings in friendly and in enemy territory due to navigation or engine trouble—only one airplane is reported shot down by antiaircraft artillery fire. We note from British reports that these defensive formations that lost 91 bombers in ac- tion, shot down 43 German pursuit airplanes and drove 86 others down out of control—a total of 129. The greatest losses in bombers occurred when the German pursuit was built to a ratio of about five to one during the summer months of 1918. It is rare that we find these British pilots abandoning their missions except in bad weather. There is sufficient evidence that poor tactical judgment often resulted in casualties so high as to render complete squadrons impotent. There is not a bit of evidence that the British did not dare to return as soon as given new equipment and a new levy of inexperienced pilots.  At the time of the Repeal of the 18th Amendment, there was an emi- nent statistician who calculated that if the annual national output of beer was poured into a ditch four feet deep and twenty feet wide dug from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico that it most certainly would ruin the beer. We are about in the same position as this statistician. We may take this figure of nu- merical superiority of 1.5 to 1 simply as a general figure upon which to base further discussion. We know such a numerical superiority led to about 10% bombardment losses during the World War in the situation which we have  The Bomber Always Gets Through 107  Table 3.1 DAY MISSIONS British Independent Force RAF (No Counter-Air-Force Operations) Squadrons No. 55, 99, 100, 104, 110 OCT. 17, 1917-NOV. 10, 1918  ACTUAL AIR COMBAT  No. of missions 191 No. of bomber airplanes  exposed to air fighting in 1,641 formation  Bombers shot down 91  RATIO = Bombers exposed  91/1,641 = 5.5%  German Pursuit Losses  Driven down out of 86 control Shot down 43 (From British Reports)  German Pursuit Losses  129  ACTUAL INTERCEPTIONS  No. of German Pursuit 67 Interceptions  Pe
