However, to attempt to reduce the factors of air combat to figures by use of a slide rule is rather absurd. It ignores the courage and valor of the Guynemers, Boelckes and Richthofens and their equally courageous bombing opponents.  We divided pursuit employment into two parts for the sake of analysis; first, the air combat phase, and second, the bringing of the two forces into combat. Let us examine this second phase. We should investigate the factors involved in Pursuit Interception.  â€˜There is some very interesting data indicating the number of intercep- tions made by German Pursuit of British bombers in 1918. In 191 day mis- sions, German Pursuit forced air combat on British bombing formations sixty-seven times, or about 35% of the total. This is roughly a third and indi- cates one interception in three. Bear in mind the tremendous pursuit in this area but also a probably inefficient warning service. On an average of two out of three missions the British suffered no losses at all. In sixty-seven missions the British lost 91 airplanes or an average of 1.4 airplanes per mission. Since the formations averaged about 8.6 airplanes per mission this would indicate a loss of about 16% per mission when pursuit aviation was able to force combat on the penetrating formation. Certainly these are very serious losses.  Is there any reasoning then that we can use to arrive at any conclusions as to the percentage of the missions that will completely evade pursuit and suffer no losses at all? Any answer to this question will depend
