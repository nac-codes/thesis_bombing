efensive secure a favorable ultimate decision.  The Bomber Always Gets Through 115  It seems very improbable at this time that we can guarantee 100% on a broad scale an effective denial of enemy air attack by means of either pursuit defenses or other active agencies.  We must not conclude that it is not feasible to establish adequate pursuit defenses of a single small locality or area. We must not conclude that pursuit defenses are not desirable or that pursuit airplanes will not shoot down and destroy bombardment airplanes or that pursuit defenses are not essential. Not one of these latter conclusions is justified.  But we are forced now—in time of peace—in this discussion of the char- acteristics of air forces, to make a decision. Our decision can only be that of the defensive limited aim—to interpose that pursuit force—and only that force, the threat of which, requires for the enemy—the adoption of a maxi- mum in security measures.  Later in the course we will be required to defend a large vital area against a striking enemy. Your conclusion will be that the best defense that can be pro- vided is a bitter air offensive against those attacking forces which threaten us.  For those of you whom we have not convinced here this morning we simply ask you to hold your judgment in abeyance until you are called upon to solve that problem.  Are there any questions or comments?  CoMMENTs ON “TACTICAL OFFENSE AND TACTICAL DEFENSE”  Hopkins’ inductive, evidence-based approach to offensive bomber opera- tions was both logical and conducive to several useful insights. His finding that a 10% attrition rate was the maximum allowable for sustained offensive air operations was validated in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. Hopkins also highlighted a key problem for defenders: the ability to obtain a favorable ratio of fighters to bombers when the bombers had the initiative.  Unfortunately, neither Hopkins nor his fellow ACTS faculty appear to have been aware of the implications the
