and bombers to assign in order to destroy a target with a reasonable degree of certainty.  PRACTICAL BOMBING PROBABILITIES  The lecture by Captain Laurence Kuter, “Practical Bombing Probabilities, given at the conclusion of the Bombardment course, examines the lessons learned from the bombing probability problems assigned during class.' The key factors that determine the likelihood of hitting the target are the number of aircraft flown/bombs dropped, the altitude of weapons delivery, and the accuracy of the bombsight. Kuter argues that improvement in bombsight ac- curacy is where the greatest gains could be achieved.”  Practical Bombing Probabilities Captain Laurence Kuter February 13, 1939  118 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  Laurence Kuter, 1935.  This discussion concludes the portion of this course devoted to that phase of bombing accuracy entitled “Practical Bombing Probabilities.”’ In the pre- ceding three periods and in our two Practical Bombing Probabilities Prob- lems, we have not only found the potential power of Bombardment Aviation tremendously restricted by bombing accuracy (better called bombing inac- curacy in this case), but we have also uncovered some valuable suggestions as to means of remedying this very severe limitation. In this period we will briefly examine the results of those problems. Those answers themselves teach us certain important facts; those answers also show us various meth- ods of correcting these severe limitations. We will examine those methods and determine which is the most practicable method of reducing this severe limitation. We find that method to be increasing the accuracy of bombing. We will discuss various possibilities of increasing bombing accuracy, outline the steps that have been taken, present the results that have been obtained and emphasize the action that must be taken in the next year.  We will first examine the results obtained in these problems and discuss the tremendous reduction in the potential po
