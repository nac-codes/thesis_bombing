have been obtained and emphasize the action that must be taken in the next year.  We will first examine the results obtained in these problems and discuss the tremendous reduction in the potential power of Bombardment Aviation imposed by bombing inaccuracy.  High-Altitude Daylight Precision Bombardment 119  In the first requirement of Practical Bombing Probabilities Problem No. 2, we were concerned with the attack of five canal locks. Each of these objec- tives could be destroyed by one 300-1b. bomb. Five 300-Ib. bombs could have accomplished this mission. Five 300-lb. bombs are % of the maximum bomb load of one B-17 or B-18 airplane. Five 300-lb. bombs would be an easy load for a Keystone, or for an old wooden Martin, and yet the solution to this requirement indicates the use of 88 B-10 type airplanes or ten bombardment squadrons to accomplish the mission which is within the potential possibility of one Keystone airplane. There is an almost overwhelming limitation. This limitation is based upon the mean probable error obtained in Table 4.1. These targets are small. Their dimensions are about 60 x 150 feet. These targets are smaller than almost any naval objective Bombardment might be required to attack. However, these targets are larger than many bridge piers which might very possibly be bombardment objectives. If they were placed in the center of a bombing range, these areas—60 x 150 ft.—would be big areas, and yet the mean probable errors in Table 4.1 demand that we use ten bombardment squadrons. Ten bombardment squadrons are more than the GHQ Air Force could put in the air at one time today. Only ten squadrons would not ap- pear unreasonably large to Mussolini, to Hitler, or to Stalin. This particular objective may be vital to the ability of the United States to prepare for, wage, or sustain war. In time of national stress this force, even to us, might not ap- pear unreasonably large. It is, today, a big force. Such a mission is beyond the capability of all of
