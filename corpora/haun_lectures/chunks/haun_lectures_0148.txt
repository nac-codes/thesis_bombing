f bombs required to 600, or 36%. With a 95% chance of success, there would still remain five chances, in a hundred, of failure. It is conceivable that some individuals might not tolerate even so small a chance of failure. Had we demanded a 98% chance, we would have been required to drop 800 bombs. Here an 8% increase in chance of success demands an increase of 82% of the force employed. We encounter here the    122 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  Table 4.1.

Arbitrarily reducing those errors would be a neat but not effective method of talking ourselves out of the hole this table has placed us in. This table is the Air Corpsâ€™ story and we are stuck with it.  This School, and eventually the Bombardment Section, is asked almost weekly how accurate the Mark I bomb sight is, how many bombs it takes to hit a battleship, and other very short and simple questions. The source of these very clear, very direct, and very embarrass
