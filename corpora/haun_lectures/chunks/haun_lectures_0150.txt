%, our force requirement would have been cut to %. This, then, is the most effective method of reducing the strength requirement or of increasing the effectiveness of our available bombardment force. This method is a material improvement in bombing accuracy and here, fortunately, is one method that is practicable. Let us investigate the possibility of materially reducing the er- rors listed in Table 4.1, investigate the steps that have been taken to do so, the results that have been obtained in those steps, and the steps still to be accomplished.  ‘This severe limitation, which demands that we use eighty-eight airplanes to obtain five hits, which are within the potential power of one airplane, is di- rectly responsible to the mean probable errors listed in Table 4.1. Our interest lies in a reduction of those errors.  Many of us feel that we may take advantage of our accumulated expe- rience and arbitrarily reduce the errors listed in that table. All recent Air Corps tests, of which any records have been kept, have shown considerably smaller errors than those listed in Table 4.1.‘ In the bombing of the ships off the Virginia Capes in 1921 and 1923; in the bombing for the McNair Board  122 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  Table 4.1.
