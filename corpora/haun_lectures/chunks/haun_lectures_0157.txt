s. It is apparent that we will have truly valuable data after a great number of bombs have been dropped. A most important point which has not been overlooked by this Training Regulation and GHQ Air Force Directive is that data on this bombing must be accurately prepared and must be received, compiled, studied and interpreted at one central point.  ‘The situation which results in these statements in Training Regulations and in Training Directives has been developing over the past four or five years. During this time, for lack of a better “central point,” the Air Corps Tac- tical School has been designated as the point to which all bombing records would be sent for analysis and study.  In these past two or three years some of you have been involved with the preparation of bombing records and have forwarded them to this School. Others of you may have been involved in the preparation of these records but have not bothered to forward them to this School. That neglect has not made much difference. Those scores have not been properly analyzed at the Air Corps Tactical School. They have been referred to the Bombardment Section  High-Altitude Daylight Precision Bombardment 127  where we have made a few simple incomplete analyses. We have made one effort toward analyzing the effect of speed on bombing accuracy.  ‘This first, feeble investigation discloses a tremendous increase in range probable error as the air speed of bombing increases from 100 to 200 miles per hour. This Section made two or three other simple similar analyses, prob- ably the most important of which is represented by Table 4.1 in the text.  ‘These studies fell far short of properly studying bombing records. We could not, or, at any rate, we did not do that job properly.  However, we did not conceal these shortcomings from the Chief of the Air Corps. There were a series of official communications and numerous personal visits apprising the Chief’s Office of the fact that very little of the potential value of
