other agen- cies concerned with the employment of bombardment aviation will be intimately affected by the findings of this section of the Board, through the practical tactical use of the bombing probable errors accurately determined.  4, RECOMMENDATIONS.  a. That the Air Corps Board be charged with the continuing re- sponsibility of evaluating bombing records and preparing probabil- ity tables and graphs.  b. That immediate action be taken to provide the Air Corps Board with one physicist and two clerical assistants, whose duties will be evaluation of bombing results and analysis of bombing accuracy, for the dual purpose of providing information as to current bombing accuracy and analyzing the causes of error with the view to their elimination or reduction. (In this connection, it should be pointed out that until the services of a physicist are made available to the Air Corps Board, little or no evaluation of bombing results can be accomplished.)  5. The above study is the result of deliberations between several of- ficers on the faculty of the Air Corps Tactical School and the mem- bers of the Air Corps Board, and to which considerable thought has been given over a long period of time with information investiga- tions and consideration to the ideas of officers in tactical units, the  High-Altitude Daylight Precision Bombardment 131  Materiel Division, and the Ordnance Department. The members of the Air Corps Board and of the faculty of the school are in unani- mous accord with regard to the recommendations made herein. CONFIDENTIAL  ‘This paper did have the desired effect. Money was made available in the next budget and early this Fall Doctor Heinecke and his assistant arrived. The Research Section of the Air Corps Board has been set up and operating for about six months. Their office is in the basement of this building, just off the Reproduction Section’s rooms and I am sure if you will find the office, Doctor Heinecke at any time will interrupt his work and expl
