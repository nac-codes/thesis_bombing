is a fifty- fifty chance that that bomb will strike 150 feet “over” the target. Assume that that bomb was our sighting shot and we correct our sights by that amount for the next bomb. We would, in effect, correct them by aiming at a point 150 feet short of the target. Our second bomb likewise has a fifty-fifty chance of falling 150 short over the point to which it was aimed. Hence this second and “corrected” bomb would strike 300 feet short and we would be much worse off than we were having no sighting shot whatsoever.  If two sighting shots had been dropped the probability is not remote that both of them might have been 150 feet over. Obviously, in order to use sight- ing shots effectively a considerable number must be dropped—that number has not yet been determined. It is understood that the antiaircraft artillery adjusts for ballistic wind effect after firing four sighting rounds, maybe four is our number, maybe we have to go to a much greater number.  Hence this sighting shot argument cannot be dismissed without careful consideration. We do feel, however, that our basic and fundamental concep- tion of bombing accuracy must be based on a situation wherein Bombard-  High-Altitude Daylight Precision Bombardment 133  ment approaches an objective, probably under fire, takes one quick sight on the target, drops its bombs and leaves. We feel we must base our computa- tions on that initial round and not on an adjustment of fire.  With respect to the ballistic wind we hope the time will come when that factor will demand our serious attention. Such is not yet the case, however, inasmuch as the contribution to the mean probable error made by variations in the ballistic wind is still the smallest single error that can be isolated.  We cannot intelligently conclude this discussion of bombing accuracy without reference to Spain and China.
