ion of bombing accuracy without reference to Spain and China.  CONFIDENTIAL  THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  Maxwell Field, Alabama  MEMORANDUM: Bombing Accuracy in Spain and in China.  The Air Corps Tactical School has for some time believed that the “mis-use” and general ineffectiveness of bombardment aviation in Spain and in China has been due not so much to the poor judg- ment of the higher commanders as to the poor marksmanship of their bombardiers. In Spain, in China, as to a large extent in the latter phases of the World War, bombardment is used extensively to supplement the artillery barrage, to indiscriminately drop bombs over large areas of important cities and, in general, to operate at con- siderable variance with our concept of efficient employment.  We have believed that the Japanese and all contestants in Spain have found that their bombardment units have been unable to “cut sensitive points in rail lines of communication” for the same reason that the 1st Day Bombardment Group failed to cut the important Mezieres-Metz rail line; namely, bombing accuracy is so poor that an unreasonably large number of bombs must be dropped to obtain an effective hit.  We know that the Germans had practically uninterrupted service over the Mezieres-Metz tracks during the three months and three days when the 96th Day Bombardment Squadron operated exclu- sively against that line. There have been statements in the press to the effect that the Canton-Hankow railroad declared a $4,000,000.00 profit during the past year while the Japanese were continually bombing it.  134  LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  To support our belief that the Japanese and the contestants in Spain were demonstrating an extremely low order of bombing ac- curacy as we know it, we have previously had only the opinions of various observers. There have been published statements from ob- servers in Spain which have related that about 2,000 bombs had to be dropped in order to put a bridge out of co
