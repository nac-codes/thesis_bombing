ad only the opinions of various observers. There have been published statements from ob- servers in Spain which have related that about 2,000 bombs had to be dropped in order to put a bridge out of commission.  Even in the days of the D-4 bomb sight in the Keystone, under target range conditions, if one hundred 1,100-pound bombs were dropped from 12,000 feet altitude we believed that one was practi- cally certain to hit within fifteen feet of a ten-foot pier of a heavy bridge and cause one or more spans to collapse. We believed that 2,000 bombs were needed in Spain (and a similar number in China) not so much because of the presence of active antiaircraft defense agencies, not so much because bombs too small in size may have been used; but chiefly because the bombardiers have been unable to put their bombs on relatively very small targets presented by sensi- tive points in rail lines of communications.  The attached chart [unavailable in the archives] is the first au- thentic statement that has reached this school from which a precise determination of Japanese bombing accuracy can be deduced. Lt. J. D. Shaw, U.S.N., who submits this chart and described the condi- tions under which these bombs were dropped as “personal observa- tion,” is listed as Executive and Navigation Officer on the gunboat Mindanao on the South China Patrol. He is probably not a bombar- dier, but the pains he has taken to prepare a sketch of the objective with all points of impact drawn to scale is certainly prima facie evi- dence that these data are reliable.  From this chart, the Mean Circular Error of this bombing is 678 feet. Under similar conditions, at 8,000 feet altitude in the annual bombing matches, with D-4 bomb sights and Keystones, the Mean Circular Error was 254 feet. The Japanese error is nearly three times as great as the D-4 error—hence, the Japanese bombing might be called nine times poorer. What M-1, B-18 errors are today is un- known, but we are sure, under similar conditions,
