hour wind with a true air speed of 150 miles per hour. They dropped eight bombs, the mean probable error of which is 38.5 feet. Of their eight, the fourth, fifth and sixth were all considerably short because of unknown conditions. If those three bombs were eliminated the mean probable error for the remaining five bombs was 21.1 ft.  Please do not infer that these two scoring records prove that the er- rors tabulated in your text and employed in Practical Bombing Probabilities Problem No. 2 can arbitrarily be reduced to about % their present magnitude. ‘These two particular records were selected to prove that it is possible to re- duce the errors we have employed to about ¥% their present magnitude.  ‘These records do prove that it can be done. Such bombing increases the ef- fective strength or the actual power of the 7th Bombardment Group six times.  It is possible—but it can be accomplished only by enthusiastic, interested control and guidance in training.  Most of us have had contact with cases where bombardment command- ers have worked units on showy formation flying—almost to the exclusion  High-Altitude Daylight Precision Bombardment 137  of other types of training. Many of us know situations where bombardment training has been concentrated upon the ability of bombardment squadrons to pitch up tents in long straight lines—with a wail when higher headquarters interrupted such “training” with unreasonable demands that the bombard- ment outfit go some place and bomb.  More than one Air Corps officer has been in command of bombardment units or charged with bombardment training who felt that bombing was a disagreeable interruption in the proper training of his bombardment orga- nization. When a Field Artilleryman refers to a good battery, he is speaking of an organization which, among other things, goes into action rapidly and delivers fast accurate fire. When the average Air Corps officer refers to a good Bombardment Squadron, he too frequently refers to an organi
