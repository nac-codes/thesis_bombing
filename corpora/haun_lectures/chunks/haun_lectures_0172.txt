If the commander has that information—if he is confident that that data is accurate—then he has the best scientific aid to determine “how large a force, under what conditions, from what altitudes, will produce a reasonable chance of success.”  COMMENTS ON “PRACTICAL BOMBING PROBABILITIES”  This remarkable lecture acknowledged that the Air Corps had severe defi- ciencies in its ability to determine the bomber force required to destroy any given target. The ACTS set about solving this problem by training airmen how to calculate mean probable errors. This new science would provide the foundation for air force tactics and operational planning for the next six decades.”  As fundamental as this work proved to be for determining the feasibility of high-altitude daylight precision bombing, it largely ignored the equally important consideration of how to locate and identify the assigned target. Flying at high altitude increased the likelihood of encountering weather that would obstruct the line of sight from the bomber to the target. While inflight visibility might not be as significant an issue when flying over the dry desert terrain of Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, or Libya, it would prove much more challenging in the humid climates of Germany, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Bos- nia, and Kosovo.  ACTS largely ignored these questions of target identification. Armed with the B-17, its Norden bombsight, and with planners skilled in calculating the bombing probabilities, the next critical question was to determine what tar- gets should be attacked. The next chapter addresses this issue by specifying the vital and vulnerable infrastruc
