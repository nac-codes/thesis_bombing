Regrettably, only rough outlines of Wilson's original 1936 lectures re- main. His successor, Muir Fairchild, however, expanded on Wilson's work with two superb lectures that have been preserved, except for the support-  140 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  ing charts and maps, which were so large (to enable the entire class to see them) that they could not be placed in the archive files. The tables, however, have been preserved because they were typed into the text. Together, these lectures provide the key for identifying the vital and vulnerable nodes of an industrial nationâ€™s infrastructure which, when attacked, would result in the economic paralysis that the ACTS believed would be decisive.

It becomes apparent, then, that the first and basic choice in how air forces are to be employed is whether we are going to choose to do this, or whether we are going to confine ourselves to the attack of the hostile armed forces.  Before we can intelligently take up this question it is necessary for us to establish what we mean by the direct attack of the enemy national structure.
