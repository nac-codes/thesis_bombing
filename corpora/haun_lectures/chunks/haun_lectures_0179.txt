ese reasons the School advocates an entirely different method of attack. This method is the attack of the Na- tional Economic Structure.  ‘The School believes that this method of attack is more in keeping with our humanitarian ideals, and more acceptable to those neutral states that might otherwise be influenced against us. Fundamentally, however, this method of attack has the great virtue of reducing the capacity for war of the hostile nation, and of applying pressure to the population both at the same time and with equal efficiency and effectiveness. The results that are achieved by attack of the national economic structure are also cumulative and lasting. They build up from day to day and from week to week so that the pressure that formerly has been imposed by military action over long periods of time may, by this method, be concentrated into a short period, and still produce that intense suffering upon the civil populace that has been essential for the collapse of the national morale and the national will to continue with the war.  Now since this seems to be the best and most effective method by which air forces may apply pressure directly against the enemy nation, let us exam- ine this National Economic Structure and see what we may hope to achieve by attacking it, and how, in general, we are to set about it.  Modern war, as you all know, is dependent—in fact, is absolutely depen- dent, upon the capacity of the warring nation to turn out the great amount of munitions, supplies and equipment of all kinds required to equip and sustain the armed forces. The World War from start to finish was an economic strug- gle. The main battlefields were in the industrial areas, and the main weapon was the blockade, in one form or another, which prevented these areas being supplied. You are all familiar with the naval blockade of Germany and the measures that were adopted by the Allies to choke off imports from neutral continental countries. The ultimate effect is well known.
