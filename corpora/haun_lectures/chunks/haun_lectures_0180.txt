d. You are all familiar with the naval blockade of Germany and the measures that were adopted by the Allies to choke off imports from neutral continental countries. The ultimate effect is well known. The collapse of the  144 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  Central Powers was internal and was not caused by defeat on the Western Front but by defeat on the Home Front.  Some idea of the growth in consumption of munitions in modern war is given by the following figures quoted by General Fuller: “For the preliminary bombardments of the Battle of Hooge we fired 18,000 shells; for those at the Battle of the Somme 2,000,000 shells; and for those at Ypres the same year, 4,300,000 shells. At the last mentioned battle the tonnage of shells fired dur- ing the preliminary bombardment alone, amounted to 107,000 tons, the cost of which has been estimated at 22,000,000 British pounds (approximately $110,000,000) a figure very nearly equal to the total yearly cost of the pre-war British Home Army.”  Confronted with such figures which relate to the consumption of only one item of munitions, as a preliminary to one battle, it is easy to understand that the production of the munitions required to sustain modern military forces strains the industrial capacity of any nation to the utmost. Tremendous sources of raw materials—all raw materials—must be available; enormous facilities for production—for fabrication and processing, must be adapted to the manufacture of weapons, airplanes, ammunition, and the astronomical quantities of all the other munitions of war that are consumed unceasingly by the military forces.  Thus, the nation that mobilizes her manpower must be able to equip it —must be able to provide the modern implements of war required in such enormous quantities—and must be able to maintain the constant flow of sup- plies and replacements, if that force is to be able to act. It is plain that a nation must possess a highly organized and smoothly functioning economic sys
