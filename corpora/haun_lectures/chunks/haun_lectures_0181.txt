The capacity to wage modern war is defi- nitely fixed by the capacity of the national economic structure to provide the raw materials and convert these materials into the sinews of war.  â€˜This basic fact was thoroughly impressed upon all belligerent nations in the World War. As a result of the disastrous lessons that we learned from our own industrial effort in that struggle, our War Department places the great- est stress upon the fundamental importance of the economic effort for future war. To that end we have established a complete planning agency in the Of- fice of the Assistant Secretary of War which is constantly engaged in the full time job of planning our industrial war effort, to the end that our whole eco- nomic and industrial system can be thrown into high gear and placed under the most extreme pressure, immediately upon the outbreak of hostilities.
