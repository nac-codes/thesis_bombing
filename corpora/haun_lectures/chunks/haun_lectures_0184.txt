e picture is to be quite the contrary, I think.  Complete information concerning the targets that comprise this objec- tive is available and should be gathered during peace. Only by a careful anal- ysis—by a painstaking investigation, will it be possible to select the line of action that will most efficiently and effectively accomplish our purpose, and provide the correct employment of the air force during war. It is a study for the economist—the statistician—the technical expert—rather than for the soldier.  War plans for ground forces cover in great detail the successive steps of mobilization and concentration of the forces to be involved. They may indicate in general the plan of campaign and the initial objectives of those forces. On the other hand, a war plan covering the employment of air forces where fixed objectives are involved, as in the attack of the national economic structure, should be a detailed plan of attack—a plan of actual operations.  Such war plans may well have been prepared for the operation of some of Europe's great air forces. There, definite and well recognized enemies, with highly organized economic structures, lie completely within the tactical ra-  146 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  This system is highly sensitive in peace. A strike in a small obscure fac- tory producing door latches for automobiles stopped production in many automobile factories all over the United States. A spring flood in Pittsburgh stopped the production of airplanes in California as well as in other sections of the country. If this is true of our industrial machine in peace, when it is under minimum load, if it is this sensitive then, how sensitive will it be dur- ing war when it is under maximum pressure?  ‘The application of the additional pressure necessary to cause a break- down—a collapse—of this industrial machine by the destruction of some vital link or links in the chain that ties it together, constitutes one of the pri- mary, basic objectives of
