y to cause a break- down—a collapse—of this industrial machine by the destruction of some vital link or links in the chain that ties it together, constitutes one of the pri- mary, basic objectives of an air force—in fact, it is the opinion of the School that this is the maximum contribution of which an air force is capable to- wards the attainment of the ultimate aim in war.  If there is any one point that the study of air attack on the National Eco- nomic Structure impresses upon us, outstandingly, it is that the objectives to be attacked in this type of an air offensive are not to be selected on the morn- ing of the attack. The future general of our air forces will not, I hope, be faced with the decision that must select either bridges or refineries for the next air mission. Let us hope that war does not find him bent over a map in his tent, trying to pick out the vulnerable points to be hit by his attacking force. The picture is to be quite the contrary, I think.  Complete information concerning the targets that comprise this objec- tive is available and should be gathered during peace. Only by a careful anal- ysis—by a painstaking investigation, will it be possible to select the line of action that will most efficiently and effectively accomplish our purpose, and provide the correct employment of the air force during war. It is a study for the economist—the statistician—the technical expert—rather than for the soldier.  War plans for ground forces cover in great detail the successive steps of mobilization and concentration of the forces to be involved. They may indicate in general the plan of campaign and the initial objectives of those forces. On the other hand, a war plan covering the employment of air forces where fixed objectives are involved, as in the attack of the national economic structure, should be a detailed plan of attack—a plan of actual operations.  Such war plans may well have been prepared for the operation of some of Europe's great air forces.
