mber of important raw materials, which she and her immediate neighbors suffer, definitely limits the size and self-sufficiency of her industry. In any major conflict she must resort to western industrial powers to provide a considerable number of war commodities.  By way of contrast, the geographic situation of the United States is such that none of these disabilities of the other powers apply, to anything like the same extent. Our direct access to the two oceans of world trade releases us from the same dangers of the bottleneck. So much for a comparison of the geographic aspects of the great powers.  Let us consider now their relative self-sufficiency in raw materials as compared to the United States.  [Here and throughout this section, the speaker refers to the chart of stra- tegic materials, which is not included in the archive.]  ‘This chart is designed to indicate the strategic situation of the great pow- ers in terms of relative self-sufficiency in foodstuffs, essential industrial prod- ucts and raw materials. It also indicates the comparative normal peacetime consumption of the several great powers in each of these items.  ‘The chart has two scales—a vertical scale and a horizontal scale. The sol- id black portion of the vertical scale indicates the percentage of the apparent national annual consumption of each particular item which is derived from domestic production. The hatched portion of the vertical scale indicates the percentage of the apparent national annual consumption of the particular item which is obtained by imports from abroad.  For example, we see that in the case of tungsten, the United States pro- duces about one-quarter of the amount we consume (as indicated by the solid black portion of the vertical scale). The remaining three-quarters of our annual consumption we import from abroad (as indicated by the hatched portion of the vertical scale). The round dots at the top of the vertical scales indicate that domestic production of that item is
