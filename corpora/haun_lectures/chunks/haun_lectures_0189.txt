nnual consumption we import from abroad (as indicated by the hatched portion of the vertical scale). The round dots at the top of the vertical scales indicate that domestic production of that item is not only sufficient to meet all home consumption, but is sufficient to provide a considerable surplus for export.  Vital and Vulnerable 149  â€˜The horizontal scale indicates the apparent national annual consump- tion of the particular item expressed as a percentage of the annual consump- tion of the nation consuming the greatest amount annually of that particular product.  For example, the United States consumes the most food and hence on the horizontal scale it rates as 100% covering the whole of the horizontal space. In comparison, Germany and Great Britain consume only 25% as much food and hence are shown on the horizontal scale as covering only one-quarter of the horizontal space.  You will note from this chart that a comparison of the normal peacetime situations of the seven great industrial powers reveals some striking con- trasts. One of the most striking facts illustrated by the chart is, of course, the great degree of dependence of the other powers upon imports of raw materi- als. It will be observed that the degree of self-sufficiency of the United States in the great essentials is very superior, Russia alone being able to approach our advantage in this respect.  In respect to consumption, it will be noted that the impressive position of the United States becomes at once apparent, for with the exception of ni- trates, potash and wool the demands of our industry are not only larger than those of any other nation but for the most part are equivalent to the total demands of the other powers combined. Viewed from this angle the apparent self-sufficiency of a nation like Japan in coal, chromite or tungsten, or Russia in coal and iron, is not particularly impressive if applied to the normal con- sumption capacity of American industry.
