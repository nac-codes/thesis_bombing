derivatives.  Now it is apparent from this brief analysis, that even with by far the most favorable situation economically, among all the great powers, we could still be seriously embarrassed by the denial of certain strategic imports.  As was brought out by our analysis of our geographic situation, however, we are very favorably situated. We have access to the two oceans of world trade. All of our strategic materials come from at least two, and in most cases from many, sources at widely scattered places on the earthâ€™s surface. In our case they do not have to pass through the narrow bottlenecks which we noted existed in the case of Great Britain and France. They may be unloaded at any one of our many widely scattered seaports.  We are forced to the conclusion that our prospective attacker could hardly hope to gain any decisive results by employing his air power against this external element of our national economic structure. It is simply too great a task. Too many specific objectives are involved and they are too wide- ly dispersed. The task would almost certainly be beyond the capacity of his available force.  152 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  However, let us recall the geographic situations of the other great powers and note their degree of dependence upon imports of essential materials as shown by this chart. Note that Great Britain is dependent upon imports for over half of her food supplies. Those vital imports of food must be brought through the narrow bottleneck of her territorial waters to only a few ports, all fairly concentrated geographically. Again, Germany and Italy are among the pauper nations insofar as raw materials are concerned. Japan is but little better off.  Considering these facts we must conclude that a careful detailed analysis of the economic structure of some of the other great powers would probably give a far different answer in this respect than in the case of the United States. Such an analysis might very possibly come out
