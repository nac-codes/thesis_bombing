ination, upon motor truck operation. Such a breakdown would impose tremendous pressure upon the civil population, especially in the great cities.  Vital and Vulnerable 153  ‘The United States leads the world in the production of petroleum and its refined products with 60% of the total. It also leads the world in its consump- tion. We produce more than one billion barrels a year from our fields. The petroleum industry is a vital industry to the United States and it is worth the while of the potential attacker to study it and decide if he has the capacity to destroy it.  [In this section the lecturer refers to a map of oil fields, no longer available.]  Note the wide distribution of the oil fields themselves. Note the pipe lines that lace the country. There are a total of 58,000 miles of main crude oil lines; 54,000 miles of feeder lines; 50,000 miles of gas lines; and 4,000 miles of gasoline lines. Note the location of oil fields near the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and the ready availability of water transport for both the crude and its products. In addition, an excellent rail net interlaces all of these fields. ‘The facilities for movement by rail are enormous: more than one-half of all refined products moving by rail and between 6 and 7% of the crude. Exist- ing pipe lines have a capacity sufficient to move a high percentage of the crude, though their routes are, of course, fixed. 25% of the total tonnage in American registry are tankers. One-third of all Atlantic coastwise shipping is petroleum or its products; two-thirds at the Gulf ports, and one-half at Pacific ports. Note the concentration of refinery facilities, represented by the black dots. The northeast vital area consumes 55% of all gasoline produced in the United States and produces 36% of the total, or 70% of its own supply. It has 113 refineries but 50 of these produce 91% of the total, and 33 refineries produce 80%, all of these being concentrated under the black dots.  Now there are not a great number
