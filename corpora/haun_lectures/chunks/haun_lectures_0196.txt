its own supply. It has 113 refineries but 50 of these produce 91% of the total, and 33 refineries produce 80%, all of these being concentrated under the black dots.  Now there are not a great number of these black dots, and refineries being as vulnerable to air attack as they are, it should be possible to destroy these 33 concentrated refineries. This would certainly be a most serious blow to our vital area—the source of over half of its gasoline supply would be wiped out. This would certainly apply a great deal of pressure and it would cause all sorts of dislocations in industry and the normal life of the people. But would it be conclusive?  We have noted that petroleum and its products are very easy to move and that ample means of transportation exist. So long as the distribution sys- tem remains intact and since the capacity of the remaining refineries of the country is sufficient to meet the worst of the shortage we can still move in the bulk of the requirements of the northeast.  154 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  From this very brief and sketchy analysis of this great industry we are forced to the conclusion that, as potential attackers, we had better look fur- ther for a more vulnerable section of the economic structure if we are to ap- ply conclusive pressure against the United States.  However, perhaps we should not leave this industry, as students, without reminding ourselves that the United States is unique among the nations of all the world in respect to petroleum. Surely a comprehensive similar analysis of most of the other great powers, which produce either no petroleum at all, or but a minor portion of their requirements; who have no such pipe lines or other distribution systems and whose storage facilities are concentrated rather than dispersed—would tell a very different story.  Having failed to find that the great national petroleum industry consti- tutes a very vulnerable link in the national economic structure of the United States, l
