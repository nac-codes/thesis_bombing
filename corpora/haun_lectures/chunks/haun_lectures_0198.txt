eneral dislocation would, however, be very serious and  Vital and Vulnerable 155  would certainly cut our production of steel products down materially and would be a source of grave disturbance to our economic effort.  It would, of course, be possible to attack the railroads in this connection, but from our very brief and hasty survey it seems more logical to conclude that the real effect would be gained by operations against the concentrated steel mills themselves. Note their very considerable degree of concentration. Remember the historical summary of the effect of the trifling zeppelin raids upon Great Britain's steel production, where the bombs did no damage to steel mills and yet production dropped off one-sixth. Remember what the distracted representative of Messers. Palmer had to say about the effects of the raids and the probable damage that would result to the steel mills if the raids were continued—and that did not include damage to be expected from bombs.*  I don't want to draw any definite conclusions here about the vulnerability of the United States steel industry to air attack. It would require a much more detailed analysis to justify definite conclusions. Nevertheless I think it is safe to conclude that it is sufficiently concentrated so that certainly very consider- able pressure could be applied in this manner. That is the only point I would like to make—that, and the fact, which I hope is apparent to you, that all the necessary information to make the required analysis is available in time of peace—available to all the world. Proper analysis of that information will give us a very definite answer as to the degree of vulnerability and the effect to be anticipated from various degrees of destruction.  Let us now take a quick look at this vital industrial area of ours which has been mentioned several times.  [The “vital industrial area” described is the area between Boston, Mas- sachusetts, Baltimore, Maryland, and Buffalo, New York. The speaker also
