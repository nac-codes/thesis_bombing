The speaker also refers to maps illustrating the population, concentration of industry, and dis- tribution of war load in the area, which are lost.]  Although this vital industrial area of ours includes only 13% of the to- tal area of the United States, it contains only slightly less than one-half of the entire population, and a little more than one-half of all those gainfully employed.  ‘The relative concentration of population in the country is well portrayed by the grouping of the black dots on the map.
