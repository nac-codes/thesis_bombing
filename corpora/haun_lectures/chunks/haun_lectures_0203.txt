pre-depression industrial activity, as- suming maintenance of normal reserve capacity. The critical short- age of existing generating capacity most seriously affects the great industrial districts of the East and the Middle West. It would, there- fore, be disastrous in case the United States should become involved in war. The situation might be even more acute than that which ex-  Vital and Vulnerable 159  isted during the World War, when in many districts electric service had to be denied to domestic and commercial consumers and non- essential industries to meet war needs for power.  â€˜These findings were again confirmed, in the fullest degree, by a government survey of last summer.  [The map showing potential power shortages is not available in the archive.]  This potential shortage is vividly portrayed on this map of the Federal Power Commission. Note particularly the black areas which indicate a po- tential deficit of over 10%. Please note that this deficit is predicated upon normal peacetime industrial demands. It does not include the additional de- mands that would be imposed by the war load on industry in a major emer- gency. Of course, it has no reference at all to any interruption in service, or destruction of facilities, that might be effected by enemy action. It is apparent then that there exists no margin of reserve which it would be necessary to remove by destruction of existing facilities before the effects would be felt by industry. The destruction of even one power plant would be immediately felt as a shortage of power for essential industry in its area.  But perhaps it would be possible to utilize power from other areas to equalize this load. However, the transmission of electric power is always accompanied by line losses which vary directly with the voltage and the distance.  Most large modern plants generate alternating current at a voltage varying from 6,600 to 13,200 volts at the generator, but as alternating cur- rent can be easily stepped up o
