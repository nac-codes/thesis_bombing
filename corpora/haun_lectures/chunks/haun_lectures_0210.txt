could put a finger on any weakness in the economic system of this greatest of all in- dustrial nations. This survey has barely scratched the surface because of time limitations. However, we have demonstrated that ample material is available to anyone who wishes to undertake a real and comprehensive survey. We also have demonstrated, I think, that there are very definite weaknesses in our industrial set-up, and that a properly directed air offensive against our  164 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  economic structure offers a good chance of complete success in applying ex- treme pressure against our civilian population—while, at the same time, pre- venting us from building up, or even maintaining, our capacity to wage war. Now this discussion would have been much more interesting to all of us, if we had been examining the economic structure of some potential enemy. Perhaps at some time in the future we will have available complete staff stud- ies to form the basis of such an examination. I hope that the discussion this morning has shown their necessity—the necessity of a complete thorough- going analysis of this type—if we are ever to consider offensive action against any nation in the future. While the analysis that has been given has only scratched the surface and has been a very amateurish effort, at best, I hope it has demonstrated that a complete analysis by competent personnel is quite possible from commercial sources of information. Thorough analysis in any industrial nation will reveal such vulnerability to air attack, as to fully war- rant the conclusion that it is in this employment that an air force can offer its maximum contribution toward the achievement of the ultimate aim in war.
