ditions more intolerable to them than the acceptance of our terms of peace. Second, but not less important, by destroying their capacity to make war, which, of course, not only aids in achieving the first result we desire, but protects our own nation, and may well be an essential element in a sound foundation for our victorious peace.  Now the sketchy analysis that we made yesterday of our own econom- ic structure would not apply to any other country. However, it did perhaps indicate a method to pursue in making such an analysisâ€”the factors that we should consider. We should remember, however, that we noted that the United States and Russia are the only two industrialized powers that are built on continental proportions. In most countries the areas are much smaller, and the great city of the country is of much greater importance than is the case with us. Consider the importance to their countries of London, Paris, Berlin, and Tokyo.  London, for example, is the chief port of the British Empire. Further- more, it is the largest manufacturing city in the empire. Many of the key in- dustries of the empire are located within its metropolitan area, and facilities for the production of their essential products do not exist elsewhere. Over a million persons are engaged in manufacturing pursuits in London alone, out of its population of some eight million. In addition, London is the greatest commercial and financial center of the empire, besides being the directing brain for all of its scattered territories and possessions. Without a detailed analysis we cannot arrive at a definite conclusion as to just what the loss of London would mean to Great Britain, but we do know that it would be very serious indeed. Many British military writers have assumed that it would be decisive. The same is true to a great extent of Paris, which is the heart of France.  It might well be, then, that the great city would turn out to be the most important and vulnerable element in the country of
