ence of this great city, let us examine into it, trace its historical devel- opment and see what its influence really is.  A hundred years ago, New York was a city of some 200,000 people. The open fields started at 14th Street. There were no railroads, no street cars, no telephones, telegraphs, or ocean cables. The first steamship had made a cross- ing of the Atlantic only twelve years previously. The harbor was crowded with shipping. Steamboats were plentiful, some 86 plying the harbor of New York alone. Water transportation was coming ahead fast. Travel by water had be- come so firmly entrenched in the minds of the people, that few had any idea that it would ever be possible to travel by land, as fast and conveniently, as by water.  One hundred years ago, all of the food supply was grown within a fifty- mile radius of New York. The New Jersey farmer loaded his produce on a cart and hauled it down to the river bank opposite Manhattan, where he sold it to a broker, who after accumulating sufficient purchases, hired a boat to take it over to the other side.  Water transportation made the port of New York, thus the dawn of the railroad era found a thriving metropolis at the mouth of the Hudson. The first rail lines were of course very short, built for competition with the pas- senger and mail traffic, that had been monopolized by the stage coaches up to that time. By successive steps, the railroads established terminals on the Jersey shore directly opposite Manhattan, either by extending their lines, or by buying smaller rail lines. The New York Central established its all-rail line down the west side of the island. The next step was the inauguration of the lighterage service to relieve the ferry boats of the growing burden of freight traffic; then came the introduction of the car floatage in 1866 as a substitute for lighterage.  New York, therefore, is different from almost any other port, in that the  168 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  great majority of
