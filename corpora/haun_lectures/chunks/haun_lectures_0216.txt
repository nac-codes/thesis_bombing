f the car floatage in 1866 as a substitute for lighterage.  New York, therefore, is different from almost any other port, in that the  168 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  great majority of its industries and steamship piers are on the opposite side ofa mighty river from most of its rail terminals, and it is only within the last three decades that it has been possible to cross the Hudson River by any other means than a boat.  Legend has it that the first passenger line of transport was instituted in 1746, and ran from the Battery up Broadway to Houston St., using oxen for tractive power. Stage coaches were in use at the time of the revolution. Om- nibus lines appeared in 1801. Horse-cars became a factor of importance in 1852.  ‘The Evening Post of March 20, 1867 said: “The means of going from one part of the city to the other are so badly contrived that a considerable part of the working population spend one-sixth of their working day on the street cars and omnibuses, and the upper part of the island (Manhattan) is made almost useless to persons engaged in daily business in the city.”  ‘The solution to this problem was transportation.  Elevated railroads operated by steam appeared in 1871.  Cable car lines in 1886.  Electric surface cars in 1898.  Subways in 1904.  ‘The electrification of the steam railroads and the Pennsylvania Tunnel in 1908.  In 1929 nearly one-half of the people that boarded railroad trains in the United States did so in the Metropolitan District. This does not include the rapid transit riders, whose number, of course, exceeds those of all the steam rail lines in the country combined.  Rapid Transit facilities provided 500 rides per capita in 1929 and about 8,100,000 people used these systems on the average daily in 1934.  It has been estimated that there are as many as 400,000 people under- ground at one time either being transported or waiting for transportation.  I would like you to bear in mind this picture of transportation within
