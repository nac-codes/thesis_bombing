shortages in various items would be- come apparent almost immediately. If the interruption could be maintained for a period of even a week or so, the area would become untenable and the population would have to be evacuated, if any way could be found to ac- complish this in the absence of the continued functioning of the rail system.  [The lecturer refers to a chart of New York's rail system.]  Let us glance briefly at the rail system of New York and see what it looks like. We find that only one all-rail freight line serves Manhattan. The Long Island Railroad is confined to Long Island. The New York, New Haven and Hartford has a terminal in the Bronx and connects with the Long Island Rail- road via Hell Gate Bridge. Altogether there are twelve railroads entering the district, but note that nine out of the twelve terminate their rail lines west of the Hudson River. If you will remember the length of that daily train of food—some 17% miles—you will at once appreciate the vital importance of these terminals to the food situation of New York City. Any cut that will deny the use of these terminals will practically eliminate the railroads as a factor in the movement of freight into the metropolitan area. The terminals are essen- tial to operate the car float and pier system by which freight cars are brought across the river on the floats and unloaded directly onto the piers. If rail lines were cut so as to deny the use of the terminals, it would be necessary to un- load the cars at sidings on the other side of the break and transport by truck  Vital and Vulnerable 173  into the city itself. Aside from the traffic congestion and general difficulty of doing this, I think we may conclude that the problem could hardly be solved in this manner, since outside of the terminals there would not be sufficient suitable sidings at which the 17% miles of cars could be unloaded. It is not too much to say that the entire marketing, transportation and food storage systems in New York Ci
