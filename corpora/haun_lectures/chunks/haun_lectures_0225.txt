e to the saving in duplication of facilities which this system makes possible. We find, therefore, that the generating stations themselves are essential for the use of this outside power.  Now what about the vulnerability of electric power in the metropolitan area? Certainly, I think, we are all prepared to admit that a direct hit from one bomb of the proper size will destroy one of these steam generating plants. We have seen from our previous investigation that from 9 to 18 months would be required for its replacement.  ‘The figure entitled “The Aerial Bomb vs Public Service Electric Power in the New York City Area” shows a graphic picture of what such hits, by a limited number of bombs, would mean to the industrial and public service power of the metropolitan area. With this limited number of bombs, accu- rately placed, less than 10% of the public service power is left available and this is at Staten Island, Amboy, and Raritan.  ‘The figure entitled “The Aerial Bomb vs Traction Electric Power in the New York City Area” shows the effect of a strictly limited number of bombs accurately placed on the sources of traction power of the metropolitan area. ‘The only power remaining is a small amount in one plant for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, and one small plant for the Brooklyn- Manhattan Transit Corporation. We see then that seventeen bombs, if  Ute f Ua fi  “The Aerial Bomb vs. Public Service Electric Power in the New York City Area” il- lustrates the impact of a limited number of accurately placed bombs and the resultant reduction in the overall available public service electric power for the New York City metropolitan area: three bombs reducing power by 50 percent, four more bombs reducing power to 25 percent, and four more bombs reducing power to 10 percent.
