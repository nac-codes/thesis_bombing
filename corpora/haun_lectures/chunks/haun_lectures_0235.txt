e is complete freedom of choice. In their case all the elements, not only of all the armed forces but of the respective nations themselves, lie well within their  What to Target 183  radius of operations from existing air bases. It very likely will not actually be the condition in our own case, having regard for the world situation today. ‘The interdependence between nations and the alignments which are every- where apparent, would seem to make it unlikely that we will be involved in any major war without the participation of other nations, not only on the enemy side, but as allies in our own effort.  If allies are present, they may be able to furnish us with the strategic bases that we require. Hence we should not definitely conclude that this free- dom of choice, as regards the primary strategic objective of our air forces, is not liable to be open to us. It seems quite possible, therefore, that if we are involved in a major war, within the predictable future, we may be faced with some choice between the armed force objective and the enemy national structure objective.  This choice between these two great categories, as the primary air force objective, is the most fundamental decision involved in air warfare and it will doubtless be correspondingly difficult to make. Were there no factors to consider, other than the effectiveness of an air offensive in achieving its final purpose—the collapse of the enemy will to resist—there would be little difficulty in making the choice. Obviously and certainly we would choose to attack the enemy national structure as our primary objective.  However, there are, of course, other factors to consider. While we plan destruction for the enemy, we must not forget that he, in all probability, is planning very much the same sort of fate for us. This decision, then, whether we will choose the enemy national structure or the attack of the hostile armed forces as our primary strategic objective, is a matter of very considerable mo- ment.
