e case where opposing nations each select the en- emy national structure as the primary objective of their respective air forces. If each air force continues to pound away at the hostile national structure, without regard to the hostile air force, and each of the air forces is able to  What to Target 185  conduct operations with the same degree of efficiency, it is obvious that the nation which is most vulnerable to air attack will be the first to collapse in such a duel. Of course this situation is too simple, for it is unreasonable to suppose that the air forces of any two nations will be of precisely the same strength and efficiency, or will be placed with equal advantage for the con- duct of air operations. However, here we seem to have the underlying factor in making this decision. The nation which is the least vulnerable to the at- tacks of its enemy,—the nation which feels that it is in a position to carry an air offensive to the enemy nation with prospects of early and decisive success before the enemy can effectively counter the attack,—will select the enemy national structure as its primary objective. On the other hand, the nation that feels itself to be at a disadvantage in such a duel will in all probability select the hostile air force as its primary objective.  We may expect that, under normal circumstances, where it is possible to do so, the initial attacks of any aggressor nation will be delivered against the hostile national structure. This decision will be due to the resulting shock effect, the vital importance of certain installations to a nation in arms, the de- gree of facility with which these installations may be destroyed, and to avoid the preliminary air reconnaissance which would otherwise by necessary and which would disclose the intentions of the aggressor nation. Complete infor- mation of the vital nonmilitary installations within a nation will usually be available during peace, while the detailed information necessary for counter- air f
