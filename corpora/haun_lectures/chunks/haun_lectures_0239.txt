the aggressor nation. Complete infor- mation of the vital nonmilitary installations within a nation will usually be available during peace, while the detailed information necessary for counter- air force action will normally have to be obtained by reconnaissance after the outbreak of war. Of course, we may expect that operations would be directed against the enemy air force at any time during the progress of the war should it present a concentrated, vulnerable objective which could be destroyed or seriously damaged in one, or a few, quick operations. Furthermore, the su- Pperior air force might well commit to counter-air force actions only that part of the force required to obtain the necessary degree of neutralization, while the remainder, or “marginal force,’ is employed in a direct offensive against the enemy nation itself. While such action might seem to be a violation of the Principle of the Objective, we must remember that we are also concerned with the Principle of Security. Such a decision, therefore, may be fully in ac- cordance with the Principles of War, however much it may appear at first glance to be a violation of them.  So far we have not discussed the possibility that hostile surface forces might constitute our primary objective. Now it must be recognized that when  186 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  a nation is on the strategic defensive, a hostile surface force might, at any par- ticular time, offer the greatest threat to its security. This, of course, would be particularly true in the case of nations with contiguous borders. We can eas- ily see that in such a case, if our own surface forces should be overwhelmed, a powerful offensive by a rapidly moving land force might constitute a decisive threat. It might well threaten to defeat our nation quickly, and before any action that the friendly air force could take against the enemy nation, would become effective. In such a case there is no doubt that the hostile land force becomes the pr
