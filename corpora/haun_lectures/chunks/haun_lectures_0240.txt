tion quickly, and before any action that the friendly air force could take against the enemy nation, would become effective. In such a case there is no doubt that the hostile land force becomes the primary strategic objective of the friendly air force, since this employment would constitute its maximum contribution to the national aim at that time.  As an example of such a situation, consider the German break-through on the Western Front in March of 1918. This break-through was practically complete. For a time the road to Paris lay pretty well open before the Ger- man troops. Had Paris fallen and the British forces been split off from the French it is very probable that it would have meant the end of the war for France. The situation was desperate for the Allies. Everything that could be constituted as a reserve was thrown in to close the gap—incidentally, includ- ing all the aircraft that could be brought to bear. Under such circumstances, had there been an independent air force operating against Germany directly, and expecting to achieve victory by its operations within a short time, should it not also have been thrown into the gap? I think the answer is obvious. Certainly it should have been so employed, for here was a decisive threat that might well mean complete disaster. By employing it against that decisive threat until the threat was removed or countered, it would undoubtedly have been making its maximum contribution toward the Allied aim in the war at that time.  ‘There is the reverse of this case, also, in which primary reliance for vic- tory must be placed on the friendly land force, and where the maximum contribution of the friendly air force can best be made by directly assisting the operations of the friendly land force. In such a case we find that the de- feat of the enemy land force might well become the primary objective of the friendly air force.  We find an excellent example of such a situation in the operations inci- dent to the Italian conquest
