feat of the enemy land force might well become the primary objective of the friendly air force.  We find an excellent example of such a situation in the operations inci- dent to the Italian conquest of Ethiopia. Reliance for the seizing and pacifica- tion of Ethiopian territory, preliminary to its incorporation into the Italian Empire, obviously had to be placed upon the Italian ground forces. Fur-  What to Target 187  thermore, there was no integrated national structure or Ethiopian air force against which the Italian air force could have been employed. Under such cir- cumstances we conclude that the employment of the Italian air force directly to assist the Italian ground forces, to defeat the Ethiopian ground forces, was the proper and logical employment since this constituted its maximum pos- sible contribution to the Italian war aim.  When a nation is on the strategic defensive, it might be that its air force would have no objectives within range from its available air bases, other than those hostile naval forces that placed themselves within effective radius of action. In such a case, obviously the hostile naval force becomes by necessity the primary strategic objective. Such a case is illustrated by our own situa- tion, if we should be on the strategic defensive without allies, and hostile air forces should not be present.  A situation might arise where initial reliance would have to be placed on our naval forces, in the strategic offensive, to conduct operations leading to the securing of bases for the future operations of our land or air forces. In such a situation the initial objective of our air forces would be the same as that of our friendly naval forcesâ€”the defeat or containing of the hostile naval forces. Of course, should those hostile naval forces be supported by hostile air forces, the maximum contribution of our air forces would be made by employment against the hostile air force as an intermediate objective, since such action would be beyond the
