arent that the only basis upon which this decision can logically be made, is upon a thorough national estimate of the situation. In such an estimate we must consider in great detail the relative vulnerability to air attack of the nations involved, and the rela- tive ability of the two nations to conduct the required air operations. Fur- thermore, the relative vulnerability of the two air forces must be carefully weighted, since this factor, also, will seldom be the same for both belligerents.  ‘The process of making such estimates of the relative vulnerability of na- tions has already been indicated. Obviously it is a task requiring some time and a properly trained and balanced staff, if a satisfactory job is to be done. There seems to be no short cut unless the situation itself is clear and simple.  ‘There are many factors that must be evaluated. This course has attempted to point out what those factors are and to indicate how they may be expected to influence the decision.  We will try and sum up the general effect of those factors and arrive at as concise a statement as possible of a doctrine for the employment of air forces.  War, throughout the ages, has become more and more a question of machines. It is not to belittle the human element, or to disparage the quali- ties of courage or leadership, to recognize that in war today machinery is paramount. War without machines is impossible. The significance of this de- velopment, in its bearing upon the employment of air forces, has not been sufficiently appreciated.  ‘The armed forces all require machines of war, whether the vast intricate battleship machine or the simple basic infantry rifle machine. Each of these war machines is the product of other and prior machines. Machines make machines, and the machines which make are even more elaborate and com- plicated than the machines which are made. A multitude of patterns, jigs, gauges, forgings, castings, and stampings,—a long process of turning, mill- ing, cutting,
