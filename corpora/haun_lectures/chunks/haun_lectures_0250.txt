om- ic structure, which Fairchild proclaimed to be the ultimate objective of an  What to Target 193  air force. Enemy military forces were only an intermediate objective to “the ultimate aim . . . the breaking the hostile will to resist”  Enemy forces should be avoided except under certain conditions. The first caveat allowed for striking an enemy likely to quickly win the war with its forces in being. Fairchild argued that this was unlikely as nations could not afford the war reserve required for the attritional land battle needed for a modern industrial nation to invade another. A second caveat must be ac- corded when a nation’s own economy was more vulnerable to air attack than that of its opponent. This was fortunately not likely to be the case for the United States, given its dispersed production and extreme distance from po- tential opponents. The third, and most likely, exception to targeting a nation’s economic structure was if the air force could not reach the enemy’s indus- trial heartland. This, Fairchild pointed out, was likely to be the case with the United States against Japan. Unless allies could be found in the region, the occupation of foreign territory would be required for US air forces to reach the Japanese homeland. The final caveat was if the enemy had no industrial capacity to target, as with the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. It would later prove tragic in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars when US airmen did not heed this advice.  The most significant criticism of this lecture has to do with errors of omission. Fairchild does not consider how war aims might affect a nation’s willingness to endure the collapse of its economy and the suffering of its peo- ple. As World War II would demonstrate, a state may prefer to resist even when faced with economic collapse and imminent military defeat if the al- ternative is unconditional surrender and the demise of the state. Fairchild also does not consider how a powerful government, such as Nazi Germany,
