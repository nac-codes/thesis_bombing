This chapter examines the role American strategic bombing played during World War, beginning by sketch- ing out the early air war in Europe leading up to the entry of the United States into the conflict. The development of US air war plans are considered next, followed by an assessment of the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO), evaluating how well the underlying assumptions of HADPB withstood the harsh reality of war. Air power is then examined in its overall contribution to the Allied victory in Europe. Finally, the chapter concludes with USAAF experience with HADPB against Japan.

Fearful of retaliatory attacks and equipped with a limited number of twin-engine bombers, Bomber Command restricted operations to coastal raids and leaflet drops over German cities during the “Phoney War.‘ But even these tasks proved too arduous given the difficulties encountered with poor flying weather, the inability to conduct long-range navigation, and the daylight threat from enemy fighters and anti-aircraft fire.’ Forced to priori- tize aircraft survival over lethality, Bomber Command chose to fly at night. Though night tactics neutralized German fighters and anti-aircraft fire, these advantages came with even greater challenges to navigation, target identifica- tion, and bombing accuracy.  The German invasion of the Low Countries in May 1940 brought an end to the Phoney War, and the Luftwaffe’s carpet bombing of Rotterdam  198 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  provided a foretaste of the devastation that would be wrought throughout Europe by aerial attack. Then, after the fall of France, the Luftwaffe turned its attention to the British Isles. Here, however, the Germans were met with a determined resistance from the RAE Its
