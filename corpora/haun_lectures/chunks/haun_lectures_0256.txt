Here, however, the Germans were met with a determined resistance from the RAE Its new integrated air defense system was equipped with early-warning radar and quick-reaction fighter intercep- tors capable of concentrating against the incoming bombers. When Ger- man bombs inadvertently struck east London in late August, Prime Minister Churchill ordered Bomber Command to respond in kind against Berlin. Hitler retaliated with strikes on London. The Luftwaffe lost the Battle of Brit- ain as it abandoned efforts to achieve air superiority and instead focused on nighttime raids on British cities.®  Though the Luftwaffe failed to bomb the British into submission, the RAF’s Bomber Command remained committed to the strategic bombing of Germany. The RAF believed that the failure of German strategic bombing lay in two factors: first, in the inferiority of German twin-engine bombers (as compared to the new four-engine Lancaster bombers under construc- tion by the British) and second, in the resilience of the British population (as compared to the fragile nature of the Germans, evidenced by the collapse of German morale at the end of World War 1).”  Bomber Command initially prioritized the targeting of German oil pro- duction but poor weather, continued troubles with navigation, and the in- ability to hit point targets led to calls within the RAF to turn to area bombing. In May 1941, retired air marshal Sir Hugh Trenchard entered the debate by calling for the dispersed area bombing of industrial cities to undermine the morale and productivity of the German workers. By late summer, however, the infamous Butt Report assessed Bomber Command as incapable of even locating and hitting targets the size of cities.*  Despite the fact that heavy air-to-air losses had compelled both the Ger- mans and the British to switch to night bombing, the American airmen who observed th
