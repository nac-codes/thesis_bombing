inst Germany, August 1941. The stra- tegic objective of the offensive was the defeat of Germany, with the Army Air Force tasked with destroying the German industrial war making capacity, restricting Axis air operations, and permit- ting and supporting a final invasion of Germany. Specifically, the goal was the destruction of 154 targets with the intent to “disrupt electric power,’ “disrupt transportation,’ “destroy 80% synthetic petroleum,” “destroy airplane assembly plants,’ “destroy 90% alu-  THIS PAGE DECLASSIFIED IAW E012958  THIS PAGE DECLASSIFIED IAW EO12958  minum,’ and “destroy magnesium.” Requirements for the offensive included 6,834 bombers and a six-month period with favorable weather conditions over Germany. Due to the unavailability of a 4,000-mile radius bomber, an interim expedient force consisting of 3,842 bombers and 2,080 pursuit aircraft would be based in the United Kingdom, with a monthly replacement of 1,288 bombers and 335 pursuit.  202 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  Hansell was responsible for this task. Since 1940, he had been assigned to the Air Staff’s Strategic Air Intelligence Office, where he studied the Ger- man economy and, with the assistance of civilian specialists, had prepared target lists of German petroleum and electrical power plants. In early 1941 Hansell traveled to London to share intelligence with RAF planners who, in turn, provided valuable information on German aircraft production, trans- portation networks, and the Luftwaffe organization. From these studies, Hansell identified 154 primary targets under the categories of electric power, transportation, synthetic petroleum, airplane assembly plants, and the major sources of aluminum and magnesium (see AWPD-1 in appendix 2)."°  With the target set identified, it was up to Laurence Kuter, who had taught Bombing Probabilities at ACTS, to calculate the number of bombs required to destroy the target list. Informed by Bomber Command’s combat experience, the bomb total
