The inclusion of submarine facili- ties in the target list pointed to the urgency of the Battle of the Atlantic at the time and acknowledged that the air campaign depended on keeping Britain in the war so that American bombers could launch from English bases.  THE COMBINED BOMBER OFFENSIVE  In February 1942, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris assumed command of Bomber Command and prioritized the nighttime targeting of German in- dustrial cities. By the end of May, Bomber Command had launched its first thousand-bomber raid against Cologne, with more large-scale night raids against industrial cities in western Germany to follow.”  US forces assigned to Eighth Air Force began arriving in England in the summer of 1942. The American airmen were unwilling to join the British in the nighttime area bombing of German cities, instead insisting on daylight raids against specific targets. The numbers of aircraft available to Eighth Air Force remained insufficient to conduct large air raids that year, however, as US bomber production lagged behind requirements and many of the aircraft that did roll off assembly lines were diverted to North Africa and the Pacific.'*  At Casablanca in January 1943, the American and British Combined Chiefs of Staff settled on a Combined Bomber Offensive against Germany (see appendix 4), which did little more than codify the divergent strategic bombing campaigns already being waged by the two allies. The stated objec- tive was “the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German mili- tary, industrial and economic system, and the undermining of the mo
