The collapse of the economy did not, in fact, bring about an end to the war as ACTS theorists had expected, nor did it obviate the necessity to invade.  In addition to Nazi domination over its population, one reason the Ger- mans were unwilling to agree to a peace deal arose from Roosevelt's deci- sion, announced at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, to demand unconditional surrender.” There was little incentive for the Nazis to concede to such a dire ultimatum while they still had a hope of victory, or at least be- lieved military resistance might modify Allied demands.  Wuat HIGH-ALTITUDE DAYLIGHT PRECISION BOMBING ACHIEVED  ‘The previous section considered the reasons why high-altitude daylight pre- cision bombing failed to win the war independently.

Although the USAAF did not achieve the decisive victory in the manner that ACTS theorists had anticipated, HADPB still made four sig- nificant contributions to the Allied victory: it provided the prewar rationale for an offensive bomber force, played a critical role in obtaining Allied air superiority in Europe, seriously reduced German synthetic fuel production, which was indispensable to the German military, and helped interdict the German lines of communication in France.  HADPB as Prewar Rationale for Long-Range Bomber Force  First, HADPB provided the prewar argument for an independent, offensive- minded air force. The US air planners requested thousands of long-range, heavy bombers in order to destroy the vital and vulnerable economic targets identified in AWPD-1. The acceptance of AWPD-1 by President Roosevelt in late 1941 initiated the production of the B-17s and B-24s that ar
