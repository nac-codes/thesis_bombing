reserve. In the spring of 1944 the Germans anticipated the Allied invasion, but its army leadership was split over how best to defend France. The view held by the commander in chief of the west, General Karl von Rundstedt, was to keep panzer tank units as a strategic reserve to be able to quickly reinforce the German lines wherever the Allies should strike. He thus chose not to dis- perse all of his forces along the coast, where a concentrated Allied offensive could overpower the Germans at any given point.”  Rundstedt'’s strategy made sense, however, only if the Americans had not had air superiority and Allied aircraft had not been capable of delaying his reserves. General Erwin Rommel disagreed with Rundstedt and lobbied Hit- ler for the forward defense of France. Rommel had learned from the North African campaign that the Germans would not be able to maneuver their armored units under the threat of Allied air power. He unsuccessfully argued that the best chance for the Germans was to use all ground forces available to fortify the coast.  When the invasion came, German reserves were seriously delayed by the disruptions in railways and roads and being forced to move at night or under cloud cover to avoid attack by US fighters.

After the war, strategic bombing advocates argued that HADPB had affected the outcome of the war in additional ways: keeping the Soviet Union in the war, disrupting the German war economy, divert- ing equipment and personnel from the Eastern Front, and compelling the Germans to prioritize the production of fighter aircraft, anti-aircraft artillery, and revenge weapons.” These ex
