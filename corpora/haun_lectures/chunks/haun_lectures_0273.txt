Stalin, in fact, was never satisfied with the CBO as a substitute for a second front, which remained the Soviet’s top priority for the Grand Alliance. But besides  214 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  voicing his contempt for the continual delay in the western invasion, Stalin had little choice but to maintain the alliance. So long as Germany remained on the offensive in the east, which it did through the Battle of Stalingrad that ended in February of 1943, Stalin’s only options were to keep fighting or sur- render. After the German defeat at Stalingrad in February until the Battle of Kursk in July, however, the shift in the balance of power did offer a window of opportunity for a peace deal, had both sides been so inclined.*  In 1942 and 1943, the Soviets made peace overtures through informal diplomatic channels in Sweden, but Germany continually rebuffed any rap- prochement.* In May 1943, Stalin abandoned these clandestine efforts and publicly demanded unconditional surrender. In June, however, Roosevelt and Churchill informed him that the invasion of France would be again delayed until 1944, a setback that caused Stalin to reverse course and reat- tempt to open diplomatic channels with the Germans at Stockholm. The CBO did not dissuade the Soviets from reaching out to the Germans despite the fact that, by June 1943, Bomber Command had finally made a significant impact on the German economy with its ongoing Battle of the Ruhr. If ever the CBO could have convinced Stalin of its efficacy, it was then. Based on the available evidence, however, it was more likely Hitler's intransigence rather than the CBO that kept Stalin in the war.
