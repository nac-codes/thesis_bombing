and in- creased the lethality of its air strikes. The Lancaster had a much larger bomb load than earlier bombers, and by the spring of 1943 over one hundred were rolling off assembly lines each month.‚Äù  By contrast, in the spring of 1943 USAAF did not yet have the forces available to mount serious raids on Germany. It would not be until late sum- mer that Eighth Air Force had sufficient bombers and crews for large-scale attacks, but by then the Pointblank Directive (appendix 5) had prioritized the obtainment of air superiority over the destruction of the German economy. Asa result Eighth Air Force focused on attacking German fighter aircraft and ball bearing production and not on intermediary industrial goods.*  It would not be until a year later, in late September 1944, that Eighth Air Force again prioritized the German economy by targeting its transportation network. However, by this time clouds covered much of Germany, prevent- ing visual bombing with the Norden bombsight for 90 percent of the time. Eighth Air Force was again compelled to use its H2X air-to-ground radar to area-bomb villages and towns along the major rail lines. The targeting of German transportation finally caused the collapse of the German economy over the winter of 1944 and 1945. Rather than the result of HADPB, it was brought about by a combination of area bombing of the marshalling yards and the destruction of bridges and rolling stock wrought by fighter and me- dium bombers with low-altitude attacks.  Diverting German War Resources  A third argument for the contribution of HADPB to the Allied war effort is that Eighth Air Force operations compelled Germany to divert fighter air- craft, anti-aircraft artillery (AAA, or flak guns), and personnel away from the Eastern Front. Eighth Air Force daylight bombing raids were, in fact,  216 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  responsible for the German decision to rotate fighters home to defend the Fatherland. Unfortunately, the impact proved
