ght bombing raids were, in fact,  216 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  responsible for the German decision to rotate fighters home to defend the Fatherland. Unfortunately, the impact proved too little and too late to relieve the Soviets when they needed it the most, from the German invasion in June 1941 through the termination of the German offensive following Stalingrad in February 1943. The Luftwaffe did not begin to divert a significant num- ber of fighters for homeland defense until after the Battle of Kursk in July. Whereas there were twice the fighters on foreign soil as in Germany in June, by October the ratio was one-to-one. At this point, however, the Soviets had withstood the full brunt of the German invasion and were transitioning from defense to offense. Though additional Luftwaffe fighters would have been useful against the Soviet offensive, given the growing advantage in So- viet power, the most German air power could have been expected to achieve was to slow the Red Army advance.”  As for the German decision to divert flak guns, it was Bomber Com- mand, not Eighth Air Force, that was responsible. The Germans reinforced their defenses from 800 heavy flak batteries in 1940 to over 2,100 by 1943. By this time flak guns made up a quarter of all German weapons production and consumed 17 percent of German ammunition.* The 36,000 heavy and light AAA pieces defending the homeland were double the surface-to-air weapons deployed in other theaters.® By early 1943 Bomber Command had expanded to be able to conduct 1,000 bomber raids while Eighth Air Force was still struggling to get 100 aircraft airborne.” The Soviets indeed faced fewer guns on the Eastern Front than they otherwise would have, but this was thanks to Bomber Command's nighttime raids and not Eighth Air Force's high-altitude daylight precision bombing.  In addition to the diversion of fighters and flak guns, nearly a million personnel were required to operate the German air defense system.
