ighth Air Force's high-altitude daylight precision bombing.  In addition to the diversion of fighters and flak guns, nearly a million personnel were required to operate the German air defense system. This large manpower reserve could, in theory, have been made available for duty on the Eastern Front. In practice, however, the Germans diverted factory workers, many deemed unsuitable for soldier duties, to operate the air defense sys- tem. Those workers capable of military service manned the anti-aircraft guns which, as just argued, were primarily intended to defend against Bomber Command."  Reprioritization of German Aircraft Production and Revenge Weapons  A final argument for the positive effect of HADPB was that it caused Germa- ny to shift emphasis toward defensive fighter aircraft production and divert  High-Altitude Daylight Precision Bombing in World War II 217  scarce resources for the research and production of the V-1 and V-2 mis- sile systems. In terms of the reprioritization of German aircraft production, through 1942 the Nazis had focused more on offensive operations, produc- ing one and a quarter bombers for every fighter. In 1943, however, the ratio was inverted, with one and a third fighters being built for every bomber, and by 1944 fighters were built exclusively. This shift in production had less to do with the threat from HADPB, however, and reflects more the overall shift by Germany to a defensive strategy. In early 1943, the Luftwaffe had largely abandoned air support for its armies, a decision made after its poor showing in the Battle of Stalingrad.  With regard to the German vengeance weapons, the decision to produce the V-1 cruise missile and V-2 ballistic missile was unaffected by the USAAF air campaign. The German Army had been investing heavily in the V-2 since its Peenemunde missile facility opened in 1937. Priority for the development of a ballistic rocket remained high thereafter. The Luftwaffe began to develop the V-1 cruise missile in
