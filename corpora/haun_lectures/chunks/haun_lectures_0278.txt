in the V-2 since its Peenemunde missile facility opened in 1937. Priority for the development of a ballistic rocket remained high thereafter. The Luftwaffe began to develop the V-1 cruise missile in the spring of 1942 as a response to British attacks on German cities. By the winter of 1942, with Germany's strategic position deteriorating, Hitler looked to the V-1 and V-2 as a retaliatory response to Bomber Command’ nighttime raids. Due to the significant technological challenges in designing a cruise missile, and even more so a ballistic missile, the V-1 was not operational until June of 1944 and the V-2 not until Sep- tember. These programs drained significant resources from other German weapons programs and netted little for the German war effort, but Hitler's decision to produce these weapons had nothing to do with the American strategic bombing effort.”  HiGH-ALTITUDE DAYLIGHT PRECISION BOMBING AGAINST JAPAN  Unlike in Europe, where B-17s and B-24s had the range to reach most tar- gets, the extreme distances of the Pacific required the USAAF to employ its newest long-range bomber, the B-29. In 1939, the Air Corps initiated plans to develop a bomber with the ability to fly from coast to coast. Due to a series of technological challenges, however, the first prototype would not fly until 1942. Delays associated with the complexity of the aircraft design and endur- ing problems with its high-performance engines plagued the bomber’s devel- opment and production schedule.“ When the B-29 did at last come online,    218 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  Boeing B-29 Superfortress, circa 1945.  however, it’s pressurized cockpit allowed flight above 30,000 feet and, with a top speed of 350 miles per hour, the B-29 proved difficult for Japanese fight- ers to intercept. Further, the B-29’s combat range of 1,600 miles doubled that of the B-17, with triple the bomb load, to boot.® The leap in service ceiling, speed, range, and bomb load came at a high price, however,
