rovide an argument for an in- dependent air force, though not as a result of HADPB. Aside from the em- ployment challenges previously discussed (poor weather, high winds, and extreme slant ranges), there were three other reasons why HADPB failed. Foremost was target selection. The decision to prioritize aircraft factories made little sense by the end of 1944. The Japanese had already lost the fight for air superiority with their defeat in late October at Leyte Gulf. The at- tritional naval air battles with the US Navy from 1942 to 1944 had already given command of the air in the Pacific to American airmen. Further attacks on aircraft factories may have slowed production, but it was an insufficient number of experienced pilots, rather than a lack of aircraft, that plagued the Japanese war effort.  Second, HADPB was not necessary by late 1944 as the Japanese economy was already in tatters as a result of the US naval blockade. Surgical attacks against Japanese steel factories, even if they had been successful, would not have made much of an impact on an economy that was already underpro- ducing by 35 percent.‚Äù  Third, the emphasis of HADPB on surgical attack against industrial production blinded Hansell to another potential means of paralyzing the  High-Altitude Daylight Precision Bombing in World War II 223  Japanese economy by interdicting its transportation system. Being an island chain, Japan relied upon sea transportation for the movement of intermedi- ate goods. Whereas Germany relied on railways, Japan depended on local shipping. One means by which B-29s could have contributed to the interdic- tion of Japanese production was through the aerial mining of choke points in Japanese waters, a strategy that did not require good weather or precise- high altitude weapons delivery. Yet despite the centrality of shipping to the Japanese economy, Hansell resisted. It would take LeMay to implement the aerial mining campaign, in part because it took relatively little effort
