object of all three Services is the same, to defeat the enemy nation, not merely its army, navy or air force.  For any army to do this, it is almost always necessary as a preliminary step to defeat the enemy’s army, which imposes itself as a barrier that must first be broken down.  It is not, however, necessary for an air force, in order to defeat the enemy nation, to defeat its armed forces first. Air power can dispense with that in- termediate step, can pass over the enemy navies and armies, and penetrate the air defences and attack direct the centres of production, transportation and communication from which the enemy war effort is maintained.  This does not mean that air fighting will not take place. On the contrary, intense air fighting will be inevitable, but it will not take the form of a series of battles between the opposing air forces to gain supremacy as a first step before the victor proceeds to the attack of other objectives. Nor does it mean that attacks on air bases will not take place. It will from time to time certainly be found advantageous to turn to the attack of an enemy air base, but such attacks will not be the main operation.  For his main operation each belligerent will set out to attack direct those  Trenchard Memo 227  objectives which he considers most vital to the enemy. Each will penetrate the defences of the other to a certain degree.  ‘The stronger side, by developing the more powerful offensive, will pro- voke in his weaker enemy increasingly insistent calls for the protective em- ployment of aircraft. In this way he will throw the enemy on to the defensive and it will be in this manner that air superiority will be obtained, and not by direct destruction of air forces.  ‘The gaining of air superiority will be incidental to this main direct of- fensive upon the enemy’s vital centres and simultaneous with it.  ‘There is no new principle involved in this attacking direct the enemy nation and its means and power to continue fighting.
