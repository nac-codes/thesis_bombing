It is simply that a new method is now available for attaining the old object, the defeat of the enemy nation, and no principle of war is violated by it.  Is AN AIR OFFENSIVE OF THIS KIND CONTRARY TO INTERNATIONAL LAW OR TO THE DICTATES OF HUMANITY?  As regards the question of legality, no authority would contend that it is un- lawful to bomb military objectives, wherever situated. There is no written international law as yet upon this subject, but the legality of such operations was admitted by the Commission of Jurists who drew up a code of rules for air warfare at The Hague in 1922-23. Although the code then drawn up has not been officially adopted it is likely to represent the practice which will be regarded as lawful in any future war. Among military objectives must be included the factories in which war material (including aircraft) is made, the depots in which it is stored, the railway termini and docks at which it is load- ed or troops entrain or embark, and in general the means of communication and transportation of military personnel and material. Such objectives may be situated in centres of population in which their destruction from the Air will result in casualties also to the neighbouring civilian population, in the same way as the long-range bombardment of a defended coastal town by a naval force results also in the incidental destruction of civilian life and prop- erty. The fact that air attack may have that result is no reason for regarding the bombing as illegitimate provided all reasonable care is taken to confine the scope of the bombing to the military objective. Otherwise a belligerent would be able to secure complete immunity for his war manufactures and depots merely by locating them in a large city, which would, in effect, become    228 Appendix 1
