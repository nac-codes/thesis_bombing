d against any objec- tives which will contribute effectively towards the destruction of the enemy’s means of resistance and the lowering of his determination to fight.  These objectives will be military objectives. Among these will be com- prised the enemy’s great centres of production of every kind of war material, from battleships to boots, his essential munitions factories, the centres of all his systems of communications and transportation, his docks and shipyards, railway workshops, wireless stations, and postal and telegraph systems.  ‘There is no need to attack the enemy’s organised air forces as a prelimi- nary to this direct assault. It will be just as necessary in the future, as it has been in the past, for the Army, assisted by aircraft, to seek out and attack the enemy's Army, but the weight of the air forces will be more effectively de- livered against the targets mentioned above rather than against the enemy’s  Trenchard Memo 229  armed forces. These objectives are more vulnerable to the attack and gener- ally exact a smaller toll from the attacker.  It will be harder to affect the morale of an Army in the field by air attack than to affect the morale of the Nation by air attacks on its centres of supply and communications as a whole; but to attack—let alone do serious dam- age—an Air Force in the field is even more difficult. Air bases can be well camouflaged; they can be prepared so that the personnel and material are well protected against bomb attack and their lay-out can be so arranged and spaced as to present a difficult target. An attacker can be induced to waste his strength by deception, such as by dummy aerodromes. Air units can be widely dispersed over the country-side so that it will be difficult to find them and do them extensive damage.  To attack the armed forces is thus to attack the enemy at his strongest point. On the other hand, by attacking the sources from which these armed forces are maintained infinitely more effect is obtained.
