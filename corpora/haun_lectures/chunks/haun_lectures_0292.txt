ttack the armed forces is thus to attack the enemy at his strongest point. On the other hand, by attacking the sources from which these armed forces are maintained infinitely more effect is obtained. In the course of a day’s attack upon the aerodromes of the enemy perhaps 50 aeroplanes could be destroyed; whereas a modern industrial state will produce 100 in a day— and production will far more than replace any destruction we can hope to do in the forward zone. On the other hand, by attacking the enemy's factories, then output is reduced by a much greater proportion.  In the same way, instead of attacking the rifle and the machine gun in the trench where they can exact the highest price from us for the smallest gain we shall attack direct the factory where these are made.  We shall attack the vital centres of transportation and seriously impede these arms and munitions reaching the battlefield and, therefore, more suc- cessfully assist the Army in its direct attack on the enemy's Army. We shall attack the communications without which the national effort cannot be co- ordinated and directed.  ‘These are the points at which the enemy is weakest. The rifleman or the sailor is protected, armed and disciplined, and will stand under fire. The great centres of manufacture, transport and communications cannot be wholly protected. The personnel, again, who man them are not armed and cannot shoot back. They are not disciplined and it cannot be expected of them that they will stick stolidly to their lathes and benches under the recurring threat of air bombardment.  The moral effect of such attacks is very great. Even in the last war ten years ago, before any of the heavier bombers or bombs had really been em-  230 Appendix 1  ployed to any extent, the moral effect of such sporadic raids as were then practicable was considerable. With the greater numbers of aircraft, the larger carrying capacity and range, and the heavier bombs available today, the effect would seriously impede
