H THE TASK IN OPERATIONS  AGAINST GERMANY.  (BASISâ€”Onur ability to hit the selected targets will fall off in the same pro-  portion when we move from our peacetime range to actual operations as  the RAF Bomber Command experiences when moving from bomb range to actual objectives, day and night, good and bad weather, and opposed by anti-aircraft and pursuit.)  1. To destroy the 154 selected targets during six month operating period 6,834 operating bombardment airplanes are required in accordance with current organization and operating rates. 6,834 operating bombardment airplanes resolve themselves into 98 Groups, 392 Operating Squadrons, 98 Operational Training Squadrons and require 1,708 additional airplanes for Depot Reserve and a monthly replacement of 1,245 airplanes.  2. To protect the air bases occupied by our own striking force (maintaining the same ratio between bombardment and pursuit airplanes that the RAF includes in its ultimate force, 2 Bombers to 1 Pursuit), about 3,400 Pursuit airplanes would be required.  INSUFFICIENCY OF AIR BASES FOR FORCE REQUIRED TO OPERATE AGAINST GERMANY.  1. After the RAF has reached its ultimate strength, there will remain air bases available to units of the Army Air Forces as follows:  Table A2.1.
