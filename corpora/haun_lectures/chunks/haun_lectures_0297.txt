Since we cannot base in the United Kingdom and the Near East 44 of the total required number of bombardment groups, these 2,992 airplanes re- quired for operations against Germany but for which bases are not avail- able, should be airplanes with a 4,000 mile tactical operating radius of action. Such airplanes are under development, could be employed against Germany from many British or United States controlled points on the Globe converging on Germany from all directions. This force in the field of air warfare would reverse the situation wherein Germany is a continent fighting an island and place Germany in the position of an island in air power under attack from all corners of the earth.  3. The 2,992 required 4,000 mile radius of action airplanes, although under development, cannot be available in necessary quantity earlier than 1945.  EXPEDIENT FORCED BY LACK OF AIR BASE FACILITIES.  1. To initiate an air offensive in 1943 or 1944 (without waiting for the re- quired 4,000 mile radius of action airplanes) double combat crews must be employed. The disadvantages of the use of double combat crews are material but this expediency is unavoidable. As a result, for initial offen- sive air operations against Germany is required:  Table A2.2.

Longer range, greated load, car- rying airplanes would be far more economical. These airplanes to be replaced by longer range airplanes at the earliest possible date.  2. The “Interim Expedient” Air Force tabulated above would be more than twice as powerful if all bombardment airpl
