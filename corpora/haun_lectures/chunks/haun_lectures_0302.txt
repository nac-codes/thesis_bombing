cessary to add 2 Heavy Bombardment Groups (136 total airplanes less reserve) and 1 Pur- suit Group (130 airplanes less reserve) to the air garrison of the Philippine Department to attack or to threaten Japanese sea communications in the China Seas and Japanese source of military and civil strength.  FORCES REQUIRED TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK OF AIR SUPPORT TO THE ARMY.  1. Basis: An invasion by the United States Army of Germany or German con- trolled areas will not be attempted until the air offensive against Germany has been successful and we can control the air over the area of invasion to a very large measure. By that time, a large proportion of the force set up for the air offensive against Germany will be available to support invad- ing surface forces. Hence, the force set up below is the bare minimum to permit the training of the invading forces and to provide limited support in violent ground actions such as the suppression of disturbances in the Hemisphere or the ejecting of small hostile forces from the Hemisphere or our possessions.  2. The Air Support Force appropriate to a ground Army of the size set up in this paper is as follows:  Table A2.7. Air Support Force Location L/B D/B Trans. Obsn.
