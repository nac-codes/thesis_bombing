FORCE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE AIR SUPPORT FOR THE AIR FORCES.  In order to maintain the services required by the air forces set up in the foregoing using the minimum amount of air transports estimated as essen- tial, there are required 13 Transport Groups (1,040 transports, including De- pot Reserve to consist of 160 4-engine long range and 880 2-engine medium range transports, all with approximately 30-man capacity).  TRAINING REQUIREMENTS TO BUILD AND TO MAINTAIN THE ARMY AIR FORCES.  1. The critical element insofar as training of personnel is concerned, consists of the training of pilots requiring to form and to maintain the Air Forces set up above. While the Interim Expedient Air Force is operating, it is estimated that attrition will require the graduation of 85,236 pilots per year. In order to expand our pilot training establishment from the pres-  242 Appendix 2  ent objective (30,000 graduates per year) to an 85,236 rate, 57 new flying schools will be required.  2. When the ultimate Air Force is organized and the necessity for operations by double combat crews no longer exists, the annual replacement require- ments are estimated as 108,528. This rate will require 72 additional flying schools beyond those set up to graduate 30,000 a year.  3. Flying schools to graduate 85,236 per year would be set up immediately upon the approval of this program. These schools would be expanded to the 108,528 rate approximately one year before the ultimate Air Force could be established. It will be noted that this date is indefinite but consid- erably earlier than the ultimate Air Force would set up under that head
