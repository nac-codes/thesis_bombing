oximately one year before the ultimate Air Force could be established. It will be noted that this date is indefinite but consid- erably earlier than the ultimate Air Force would set up under that heading in war as far as the procurement of airplanes is concerned.  REQUIREMENTS IN TRAINING AIRPLANES  Training airplanes by number and type will be required to produce the num- bers of graduated pilots annually, in accordance with the table below:  Table A2.8. Operating Training Type Airplanes 85,236 Graduated Pilots | 108,528 Graduated Pilots per Year for Interim Expe- | per Year for Ultimate Air Type dient Air Force Force Primary Trainer 8,520 11,115 Basic Trainer 8,804 11,486 Adv.

As a general statement, pilots can be trained prior to the dates that the com- bat airplanes which the pilots are to operate can be manufactured.  For example, if the necessary numbers of additional Primary Training type airplanes (4,195) can be added to those expected to be on hand (4,325  AWPD-1 243  plus 4,195 equals 8520) on February 15, 1942, it would be possible to start the expanded pilot training schools in operation on May 15, 1942. It would then be possible to man and to meet war time attrition on the Interim Expe- dient Air Force by November 1, 1943, without interfering with the 54 Group Program. November 1, 1943, however, is far ahead of the date on which it is possible to manufacture all of the combat airplanes included in the Interim Expedient Air Force.  PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS.  To man and to operate Army Air Forces of the size and composition set forth in the foregoing, to operate all training, maintenance and overhead installa- tions necessary therewith, there will be required personnel approximately as follows:  Table A2.9.
