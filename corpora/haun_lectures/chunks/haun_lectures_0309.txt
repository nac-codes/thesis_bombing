the task  FORCE REQUIRED TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK  ‘The exact number of airplanes required to assure the complete destruction of these 154 selected targets has been determined by a detailed study of bomb- ing accuracy in wartime operations including pursuit and antiaircraft op- position. This approach and analysis has established the requirement that 6,834 operating bombardment airplanes are required to accomplish the task during the six month period that weather conditions favor operations over Germany.  However, absence of necessary bases and time required to design and manufacture necessary number of 4,000 mi. radius of action bombers com- bine to force use of double combat crews. These conditions are met by an Interim Expedient Force consisting of the following:  AWPD-1 249  Table A2.14.

Longer range, greater load car- rying airplanes would be far more economical. These airplanes to be replaced by longer range airplanes at the earliest possible date.  November 18, 1941 MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF  Subject: Notes on the Preparation of AWPD/1  1. The latter part of July, Colonel Bissell of the WPDS brought into General Arnold a copy of a letter from the President addressed to the Secretary of War, requesting the preparation of the Over-All Production requirements required to defeat our potential enemies. Colonel Bissell suggested that the air part of the problem could be approached in one of the following ways: by the War Plan and Air War Plans Division making independent
