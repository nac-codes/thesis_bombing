A, with par- tial opening of the Mediterranean and a base of operations against Italy.  c. AIR SUPPORT OF OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, to hold the Middle East and drive the Axis forces out of Africa.  d. AIR OPERATIONS IN THE JAPANESE THEATER. Support of a land offensive to reopen the Burma road and gain operating bases in China.  Support of an amphibious offensive to regain the Philippines. Support of land forces holding Siberia, if possible.  e. AIR OPERATIONS IN HEMISPHERE DEFENSE. Primarily the defense of the American Republics against carrier attacks, and the defense of shipping by air operations against submarines.  f. AIR OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF A COMBINED OFFENSIVE AGAINST GERMANY. This involves the provision of additional fighters, light and dive bombers, observation, and transports for the close support of a land invasion of Europe from the British Isles.

Those will not be available in quantity until late in 1944. The following table indicates the system of targets selected and the effect of de-  260 Appendix 3 struction of each. The total force required for this offensive is 51,480 bomber sorties. Table A3.4.
