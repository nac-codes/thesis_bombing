hird accomplished in 1943, thus requiring four months of operations in 1944. This operation should be complete by May 1944, and the Combined Offensive should fol- low immediately thereafter.  336 Groups, to carry out operations 1 to 7 incl., Program B.  7. Recapitulation of Combat Aircraft Required.  To carry out operations 1 to 5 incl. (Program “A’), the U.S. Army Air Forces will require 63,068 tactical aircraft in 1943.  To carry out operations 1 to 7 incl., (Program “B”), the U.S. Army Air Forces will require 74,944 tactical type aircraft in 1943.  8. Air Bases.  ‘There will be ample air bases in the United Kingdom to accommo- date the air forces set up for the European Theater.  In the Japanese Theater there are at present insufficient air bases to accommodate the land based air forces which are deployed in this study. It will be necessary to construct:  24 new bases in the Central Pacific. 20 new bases in the South Pacific.  It is believed that the deployment shown in this study represents virtual saturation of the Japanese Theater, and that larger air forces can- not be accommodated without an extensive air-base building program.  262 Appendix 3  9.

Spare parts for the maintenance of these aircraft are not included in  the total listed above, and adequate provision must be added to these requirements. 10. To
