A further small point: throughout the text, reference to some night action say 'on 17 May' means 'during the night of 17/18 May'. The various published accounts of war events are not always free from discrepancies. While much care has gone into checking to minimize errors and omissions for this present work, given the scope of the book it would be overly optimistic to expect there to be none. Nevertheless, it is hoped that the errors (transcribed or home grown) and omissions remaining are few and relatively small.
