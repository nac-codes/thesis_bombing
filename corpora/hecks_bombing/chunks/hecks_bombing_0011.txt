ain, whether against troops and tanks, or factories, towns and cities, bombing remained largely an untried quantity. Mostly its effectiveness was overestimated by the general public (fearing huge casualties), by governments (anticipating a severe decline in civilian morale) and by air forces (predicting air power to be the decisive element in future military action); but it was often underestimated by armies (tending to regard air power as peripheral). Bombing Categories Pre-war theories of air attacks against land targets envisaged three main categories, two tactical and one strategic: 21  22 PRE-WORLD WAR TWO BOMBING CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES (1) Close support to ground forces at the front line, attacking local concentrations of enemy troops and supplies, vehicles, strong points, etc., using mainly light bombers or purpose-built ground attack aircraft. (2) Interdiction at longer range to isolate the enemy on the battlefield from reinforcement and supply, by attacking his airfields, storage dumps, convoys and communications (railways, bridges, road junctions) beyond the front line, using mainly medium bombers. (3) Strategic, long-range heavy bombing of the enemy's heartland, against the main sources of his military power _ factories, shipyards, steelworks, power stations, rail centres. docks, etc. - and his civilian population centres, to destroy morale (it was imagined) and hence the will to wage war. Horizontal Bombing and Dive-bombing For bombing at speed in horizontal flight, the bomb had to be released well short of the target, using appropriate bomb- sight settings for aircraft speed and altitude, the ballistic characteristics of the bomb, and local wind. Bombing from medium/high altitude to avoid AA fire, small targets were difficult to hit, a factor which made conventional bombing questionable for close support, while also favouring the 'area bombing' of towns as against 'precision bombing' of key strategic targets. But while the British briefly contemplated
