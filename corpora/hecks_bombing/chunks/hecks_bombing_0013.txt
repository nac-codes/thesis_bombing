ord- ination to army control. On the army side, even progressive tacticians, advocating highly mobile armoured warfare, saw little need for close air support. Thus Liddel Hart's writings made little mention of it; and de Gaulle saw air support only as a means of laying a smokescreen to cover troop/tank movements. [Messenger, 1976:90] Effective close support required: firstly, an air force commitment to provide it; secondly, aircraft able to perform accurate attacks in an intense AA environment; and thirdly, the necessary liaison and communications between ground troops and the air units. But at the outbreak of the European War, only the Germans had all three; no other forces had the communications. The Italians and Japanese had only the commitment; the Soviets had the commitment and were developing a new aircraft; the RAF had an aircraft but not the commitment to use it; the USAAC had no recent aircraft, and a declining commitment. Yet close ground attack had shown its value in Spain, first to the Italians and especially the Soviets, who used Ro37 and R-Z biplanes respectively. Then, despite official opposition [Murray, 1985:37], Lt .- Col. W. von Richthofen, using He51s as fighter-bombers then Hs123 and Ju87 dive- bombers, began developing the revolutionary close-support system that would be used with devastating effect in the German blitzkrieg offensives early in the Second World War. Other nations took little interest in these developments.  PRE-WORLD WAR TWO 24 BOMBING CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES The German, Soviet and British Positions on Close Air Support By 1939, the Germans had adopted close air support to aid the Army in its Blitzkrieg offensives, via pinpoint attacks on the enemy positions by Ju87 Stuka dive-bombers. To ensure rapid response, liaison and communications were estab lished between the Army units in the field and the Luftwaffe's Ju87 units. To minimize the risk from fighters and AA, the intended use would be in surprise strikes with heavy fighter
