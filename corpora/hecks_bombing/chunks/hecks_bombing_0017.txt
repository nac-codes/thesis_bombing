for area bombing as a deterrent, the USAAC saw precision bombing of oil and power plants, etc. as an economical approach to war; a relatively small force could quickly disrupt the enemy's war capacity. But generally in 1939, the strategic bombing capability that had been achieved was less than it appeared, and most of it resided with the Germans. More- over, there was little unanimity with regard to the question of daylight versus night bombing. Daylight Strategic Bombing Despite opinions that 'the bomber will always get through (British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin's phrase, in 1932). there were indications that in daylight the bomber was becoming increasingly vulnerable, particularly to fighters 'Getting through' might only be achieved with a loss rate which could not be sustained. This had been true even in the First World War, when the Germans had changed to night 27 bombing against Britain in order to conserve aircraft and crews. Now, the vulnerability of even modern bombers in unescorted daylight raids was shown in August 1937 when in three raids over China, the Japanese lost 54 of their newest Navy bomber, the Mitsubishi G3M. Meanwhile, in Europe and the USA especially, new radiolocation devices were being developed which would enable detection of bombers 70 or more miles away, giving ample time for fighters to be scrambled to climb to meet them. Also it was evident that the new monoplane fighters were well armed and outperforming even the very latest bombers. Under these circumstances, there were three main approaches to achieving deep penetration in daylight. Some authorities, notably in the USA with the B-17, advocated heavily armed and armoured high-flying bombers in self-defending formations. Others, e.g. in Germany and France, expected to provide bomber defence via long-range heavy escort fighters if necessary. Finally, there were a very few advocates for high speed bombers in which everything, including armament and armour, was sacrificed to give th
