defence via long-range heavy escort fighters if necessary. Finally, there were a very few advocates for high speed bombers in which everything, including armament and armour, was sacrificed to give the bomber the performance needed to evade and outstrip enemy fighters. None of these approaches held universal favour in 1939. To most perhaps, the escort fighter looked the most promising, even though there was scepticism that typical heavy twin-engined long-range fighters would be able to counter the small and manoeuvrable interceptors sent aloft by the defence; only in Japan, with the A6M Zero-sen, was a long-range single-engine fighter considered a serious possibility. Night Strategic Bombing Deep penetration raids made under the cloak of darkness were likely to be much safer than by daylight, and the bombers could fly both at lower altitude and with less defensive armament, and hence with a greater bomb load. But accurate navigation, and especially finding a specific target at night was much more difficult. Visual night navigation over areas in wartime 'blackout' conditions needed a clear moonlit night, and an absence of searchlight dazzle, although flak and searchlight concentrations could themselves indicate the location of towns. Conventional  PRE-WORLD WAR TWO 28 BOMBING CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES night navigation was by radio DF (direction finding) from available beacons, and 'dead reckoning' updated by astronavigation using a bubble sextant sighted on the stars. But the absence of blackout conditions made realistic wartime night navigation difficult to practise in peacetime, and limited studies on the likely accuracy achievable at night by these methods gave little cause for optimism. The advantage of moonlight in enabling landmarks to be identified led to interest in the dropping of flares as an alternative means of obtaining a visual fix. In Britain this interest increased after a report that the Germans were using flares in Spain; limited tests with towed and
