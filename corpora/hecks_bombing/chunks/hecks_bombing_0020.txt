in locating the target in darkness. The US, German and British Positions on Strategic Bombing Three air forces were to engage in strategic bombing on any scale during the War, those of Germany, Britain and the USA, but their positions at the start of the war were very different. The USAAC was committed to precision daylight bombing of key targets, using high-flying heavily armed and armoured B-17 bombers, although as yet it had very few of them and they did not yet have powered gun turrets. Turbosupercharged engines would achieve the high altitudes to place the bombers above the flak, and make them difficult for fighters to reach. To counter fighters that did manage to reach them, the bombers would fly in precise, tight groups, enabling their combined fire power to provide mutual defence. In addition, the US was developing a long-range fighter, the Lockheed P-38. High altitude flight, plus the weight of armour, armament and gunners, implied a small bomb load as well as greater difficulty in hitting the target because of the height. But to offset this, US bombers would have the most advanced bomb-sight in the World, the Norden sight. In Germany, although GÃ¶ring retained an inactive plan for a force of 2,000 heavy bombers by 1944 [Overy, 1981:85], following the death of Gen. W. Wever in 1936 the Luftwaffe had lessened its emphasis on strategic bombing. Future prospects were also being compromised by pursuing dive-bombing as the preferred mode of attack. Nevertheless, the Luftwaffe's large force of twin-engined medium bombers, usable for tactical support to the Army, also had a significant strategic bombing capability. The bombers had inadequate armament but were relatively fast, and for long-range daylight operations the Bf110 heavy fighter was already available and was expected to be adequate for escort duty if needed. For night operations, three secret blind bombing radio aids were well advanced. In Britain, although the RAF had definite aims towards strategic bomb
