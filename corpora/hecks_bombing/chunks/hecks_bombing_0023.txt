although it was also in train for the B-17; and only German bombers had the vitally important self-sealing fuel tanks, having a layer of unvulcanized rubber to swell up and seal bullet holes. Few bombers had much specialization for either day or night operations, although for night bombing the changes required were largely limited to a dark paint scheme,  PRE-WORLD WAR TWO 32 BOMBER TYPES blackout curtains for the navigator's compartment, subdued cockpit/instrument lighting, flash eliminators on the guns, and flame dampers on the engine exhausts to make them less visible both to enemy night fighters and to the crew who were trying to see the ground to navigate. Survival on overwater missions had been little thought of; the war was to force much more attention to ditching behaviour and the provision of sea survival equipment. But Italian and British bombers were operating in the desert, and 'tropicalization' measures (desert camouflage, engine sand filters, cockpit sunblinds, water containers and survival kits) were in use. Many new types of bomber were to be designed and flown during the war, but few of these were put into production and fewer saw service in substantial numbers. The cost and delays in re-tooling and in pre-operational training were such that once an initial requirement was satisfied the emphasis was usually one of improving existing designs instead of introducing new ones. Light Single-engined Bombers Despite their limited potential compared with larger and faster twin-engined machines, in 1939 there were a number of single engine monoplane light bombers in service. Typically they featured a crew of two or three in tandem, a small internal bombload, minimal defensive armament (one or two light machine guns), and no armour even though some were expected to be used for ground attack. Examples include: the PZL P-23 Karas (Poland, 1934); Vickers Wellesley and Fairey Battle (Britain, 1935 and 1936. respectively); and the Mitsubishi Ki-30 and Kawasaki Ki-
