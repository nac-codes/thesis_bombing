opments had included: the 8-gun Polikarpov R-2 armoured biplane; large-calibre recoilless cannon, (76mm DRP-76, and 102mm APK-100); the Archangelskii/TsAGI ANT-29 ground-attack aircraft of 1935 with two APK-100s; the Polikarpov TsKB-48/VIT-2 anti-tank aircraft of 1938, with four 37mm cannon; and several experimental Shturmovik ground-attack aircraft with armour-plate protection for crew, engines and fuel. The BSh-1 1937 armoured version of the US Vultee V-11GB light bomber reached limited service, but by 1939 development was well advanced on what would become one of the most successful ground-attack aircraft of the war, the Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmovik. The Soviets had also introduced the RS-82 rocket projectile, primarily as an air-to-air weapon but it had potential for ground attack. From 1936 onwards the Germans had been developing large-calibre recoilless aircraft weapons, usable against ground targets. This Rheinmettal Borsig work on the DÃ¼sen Kanone guns of 37, 75, and finally 88mm calibre, was cancelled in September 1939 due to other priorities. Meanwhile, a 1937 requirement for a small, heavily armoured twin-engined Schlachtflugzeug ground-attack aircraft resulted in the Hs129 which flew in the Spring of  34 PRE-WORLD WAR TWO BOMBER TYPES 1939, and the Fw189C variant. But the Germans also had the Ju87 Stuka dive-bomber. Elsewhere, the Japanese Mitsubishi Ki-51 attack aircraft flew in 1939. The British had paid little attention to ground-attack developments, reflecting the Air Staff's view that close support represented 'a gross misuse of air forces' [Terraine, 1985:64]. Dive-bombers While many bombers could release bombs in a shallow dive, a true dive-bomber was a specialized aircraft, with: dive brakes or even reversible-pitch propellers to reduce speed build-up; a dive-bombing sight for accurate bomb release at angles less than vertical; an extra-strong airframe to withstand the pull-out; and on single-engine aircraft, a bomb crutch which swung downwards and f
