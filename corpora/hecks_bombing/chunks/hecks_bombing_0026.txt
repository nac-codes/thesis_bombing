dive-bombing sight for accurate bomb release at angles less than vertical; an extra-strong airframe to withstand the pull-out; and on single-engine aircraft, a bomb crutch which swung downwards and forwards so that a fuselage-mounted bomb cleared the propeller. Most dive-bombers were manually controlled; but the Germans had devised an automatic bomb release and pull-out system. with the BZA-1 dive-bombing sight integrated with the aircraft flight controls. At the required point in the dive, the system operated elevator tabs to effect pull-out, releasing the bombs a little way into the pull-out. The first dedicated land-based dive-bomber, the German two-seat single-engined Junkers Ju87 Sturzkampfflugzeug or Stuka was in service in numbers. Tried out in Spain. including against ships and dock installations, the Ju87 with its fixed spatted u/c was already obsolescent, but able to perform impressively under an air umbrella. The larger. twin-engined Ju88 was just entering service. Outside Germany, there was limited interest in land-based dive-bombers. Those in production - not all of them able to dive vertically - included the Loire-Nieuport LN-411 (France, 1938), the Savoia SM85 and 86 (Italy, 1938 and 1939 respectively), the multi-role Fokker G.I (Netherlands 1937), and the Archangelskii SB-RK (later Ar-2) version of the SB-2 bomber (USSR, 1939). In Sweden, the Flygvapnet used the Hawker Hart as a dive-bomber, and was developing the SAAB 17 dive-bomber. In Britain, the Hawker Henley dive-bomber of 1937 had been relegated to target towing. The USAAC would be able to adapt Navy dive-bombers. 35 Twin-engined Bombers The twin-engined light/medium bomber was one of the major military aircraft categories of the period, but types varied considerably in size, crew, load, performance and armament. The German Luftwaffe's medium bombers included the diesel-powered Junkers Ju86 of 1934, which had not performed well in Spain; and a fleet of more advanced bombers that would play ma
