nce and armament. The German Luftwaffe's medium bombers included the diesel-powered Junkers Ju86 of 1934, which had not performed well in Spain; and a fleet of more advanced bombers that would play major rôles in the coming war. Of these, the robust dual-role Heinkel He111 of 1935 had appeared first as a ten-passenger transport for DLH, with separate cabins fore and aft of the wings, and the bomb-bay serving as a four-passenger 'smoking compartment'. The slim Dornier Do17 of 1934 had been designed originally as a high-speed light transport, again with two tiny cabins. The Do217 of 1938 was a scaled-up Do17. The Junkers Ju88 of 1936 was still having development problems, but was to become one of the most formidable and versatile aircraft of the War. More than anywhere else, design emphasis on the German bombers was on suitability for mass production and adaptability to different rôles, and different engines and armaments. A particular feature was the close grouping of crew members for mutual assistance and morale. Aside from the Blenheim light bomber of 1936, Britain's major twin-engined bombers in service were: the utilitarian Armstrong Whitworth Whitley of 1936, the RAF's first bomber with a retractable u/c and turret armament (in 1937); the faster Handley Page Hampden of 1936, with its slim fuselage, tail boom and slotted wings and flaps; and the portly Vickers Armstrong's Wellington of 1937, which featured Barnes Wallis's geodetic construction, employing a fabric covering over a convex latticework of diagonal light alloy stringers. Entering service in 1939, the relatively large Wellington (regarded, in fact, as a heavy bomber) was the RAF's most important bomber at the start of the war, with six squadrons in service. The principal Soviet VVS medium bombers in 1939 were: the Tupolev SB-2 of 1934, which had been used in Spain, and which the Japanese had found difficult to intercept over China in 1937; and the Ilyushin DB-3 of 1936 (later Il-4), which had made sever
