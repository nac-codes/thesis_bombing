re: the Tupolev SB-2 of 1934, which had been used in Spain, and which the Japanese had found difficult to intercept over China in 1937; and the Ilyushin DB-3 of 1936 (later Il-4), which had made several record-breaking long distance  PRE-WORLD WAR TWO 36 BOMBER TYPES flights, and was the only Soviet medium bomber with the range for much strategic bombing. The most important Soviet bomber of the war, the Petlyakov Pe-2 had just flown as the VI-100 (May 1939). In Italy, twin-engined bombers in service with the Regia Aeronautica included the Caproni Ca309 and variants, mostly already relegated to transport duties; and the Fiat BR20 Cicogna of 1936, used in Ethiopia and Spain, and by the Japanese in China. The French Armée de l'Air had a variety of twin-engined bombers, mostly in small numbers: the obsolescent Amiot 143 and Bloch 210, the Breguet 693 and Potez 63 light bombers; the fast Bloch 174 light bomber of 1938, and the fast but still troubled SNCASE Lioré et Olivier 451 of 1937, were both about to enter service. The Polish Ain Force (Polskie Lotnictwo Wojskowe) had a number of ungainly and unsuccessful LWS6ZUBR bombers, plus around 40 of the PZL P-37 Los of 1936, one of the more impressive bombers of the day. The Netherlands Luchtvaar tafdeling had a few Fokker Type T. V and twin-boom Type G.IA twin-engined bombers. The Czech Army Air Force had some Aero A304 light bombers. The principal USAAC medium bombers in 1939 were the Martin B-10 of 1934; and the Douglas B-18 Bolo of 1935 derived from the DC-3 airliner. Newer aircraft available included: the Douglas A-20, flown as the Model 7B in 1938 the Martin 167 Maryland (March 1939), in production for France; the 1938 Lockheed Hudson derivative of the Model 14 airliner, in production for Britain; the North American NA-40 forerunner of the B-25 (January 1939); and the Douglas B-23 Dragon derivative of the B-18 (July 1939). The main Japanese Army and land-based Navy medium bombers in 1939 were the Mitsubishi G3M of 1935
