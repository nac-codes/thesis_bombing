forerunner of the B-25 (January 1939); and the Douglas B-23 Dragon derivative of the B-18 (July 1939). The main Japanese Army and land-based Navy medium bombers in 1939 were the Mitsubishi G3M of 1935 and Ki-21 of 1936. Both were in use in the war against China. Newer bombers included the Kawasaki Ki-48 (July 1939), inspired by the Soviet SB-2; and the Nakajima Ki-49 (August 1939) The Mitsubishi G4M was under development. Japanese bomber design emphasized lightness for long range, and the vulnerability of the bombers was to become a major problem. Tri-motor Bombers In Italy especially, a lack of high-powered aero-engines led designers to adopt a nose-mounted third engine for 37 increased installed power without an increase in frontal area. For a bomber, the penalty paid was the loss of a nose gun and/or bomb-aiming position. Italy's tri-motor bombers and bomber-transports included the Caproni Ca133 and Savoia-Marchetti SM81 Pipistrella of 1935, the reliable and successful Savoia-Marchetti SM79 Sparviero of 1936, and the Cant Z. 1007 Alcione of 1937. Elsewhere, the German tri-motor Junkers Ju52/3m bomber-transport was already obsolete as a bomber. The High-speed Unarmed Bomber Conventional thinking in the 1930s was that a bomber fast enough to need little or no defensive armament would have to be very small, with short range and a tiny bomb load. But a few designers disagreed. In Germany, the Heinkel He119 of 1937 twin-engined unarmed light bomber achieved very high performance with coupled engines driving a single large nose propeller, and wing surface steam/evaporation cooling. But the RLM insisted on the introduction of dorsal and ventral gun positions which degraded its performance, and it was not adopted. In the USSR, the twin-engined Yakovlev Ya-22 flew in 1939 as an unarmed high-speed bomber, but eventually entered service as the Yak-2 and -4, with armament and degraded performance.
