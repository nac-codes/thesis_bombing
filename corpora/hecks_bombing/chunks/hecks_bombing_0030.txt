an unarmed high-speed bomber, but eventually entered service as the Yak-2 and -4, with armament and degraded performance. In Britain in 1938, a De Havilland proposal to adapt the DH91 Albatross airliner as a bomber gave way to a projected small but powerful high-speed unarmed bomber. The resulting twin-engined DH98 Mosquito was conventional if exceptionally clean, and acceptability was enhanced by the use of non-strategic materials for its construction. However, few people foresaw the success the Mosquito would have. High-altitude Bombers A stratospheric bomber offered reduced vulnerability to flak and fighters. But it needed major developments in superchargers, pressurization systems, lubrication and de-icing. In Germany, the experimental twin-engined Junkers EF61 of 1936, the first bomber with a pressure cabin, was abandoned after both prototypes crashed. In the USA where turbosupercharger development was most advanced, one twin-engined high-altitude bomber (Martin XB-27) was cancelled in 1939, another (Martin XB-33) was  PRE-WORLD WAR TWO 38 BOMBER TYPES to be cancelled in 1940. In the USSR, an experimental pressure cabin was incorporated into an ANT-25 airframe, c.1937. Also in 1937 the Tupolev/Petlyakov ANT-42 (TB-7) bomber was fitted with a fifth engine, mounted in the fuselage to supply compressed air to the four main engines. but this concept was not pursued. The VI-100 experimental high-altitude bomber appeared in 1939, but it gave many technical problems and was stripped of its turbochargers and pressurization to become the conventional but successful Petlyakov Pe-2. Heavy Bombers During the 1930s there was some work on very large intercontinental strategic bombers. In the USA, a BLR (Bomber, Long Range) requirement led to prototypes of the Boeing XBLR-1 and Douglas XBLR-2, flying as the XB-15 and XB-19 respectively in 1937 and 1941, but neither was adopted. In the USSR, the 1930s saw several projects for very large bombers. The last was the 70-ton, 12-eng
