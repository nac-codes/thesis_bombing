ouglas XBLR-2, flying as the XB-15 and XB-19 respectively in 1937 and 1941, but neither was adopted. In the USSR, the 1930s saw several projects for very large bombers. The last was the 70-ton, 12-engined Tupolev ANT-26, cancelled under a 1936 decision to discontinue all work on superheavy aircraft. 39 Most interest in strategic bombers concentrated on At various times in the 1930s, approaches envisaged for countering defence interceptors for bomber formations on deep penetration daylight raids included the use of other aircraft in support: four-engined types of more modest dimensions. In Germany, the Langstrecken-Grossbomber or 'Ural bomber four-engined Dornier Do19 and Junkers Ju89, were cancelled in 1937; Germany's aim was the rapid expansion of the Luftwaffe, with medium/dive-bombers which were quicker and cheaper to build. Elsewhere, heavy bomber programmes continued, but with no great urgency. At the start of the war in Europe, only the USSR, France and the USA had any four-engined heavy bombers in service. The Soviets had built over 800 Tupolev TB-3s, but with open cockpit, fixed u/c and low speed, they were now obsolete and being relegated to a transport r√¥le. The French had few of the Farman 222 series bombers of 1935, with engines paired in push-pull strut-mounted nacelles. Only the US had modern all-metal heavy bombers, with just 23 early model Boeing B-17 Fortresses of 1935. But prototypes of other modern four-engined bombers were already flying, notably the ANT-42 (TB-7) of 1936 which would become the Petlyakov Pe-8 (USSR), and the Short Stirling (Britain) and Piaggio P.108 (Italy), both of 1939. The Avro Manchester (Britain) of 1939 with its Rolls Royce Vulture coupled engines could also be regarded as four-engined. In addition, other heavy bombers were under development, including the Handley Page Halifax (Britain), the CAO 700 (France), the Heinkel He177 (Germany), the Consolidated B-24 (USA), and the Nakajima G5N-1 (Japan). So, although the way it w
