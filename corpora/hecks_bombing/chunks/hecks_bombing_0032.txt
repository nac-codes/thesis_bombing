der development, including the Handley Page Halifax (Britain), the CAO 700 (France), the Heinkel He177 (Germany), the Consolidated B-24 (USA), and the Nakajima G5N-1 (Japan). So, although the way it would be used was not well established, the four-engined heavy bomber was already a reality. The Boeing B-17 was the first heavy bomber to be evolved for a specialist day bomber rôle, and was to become the war's archetypal day bomber, with its turbo-supercharged engines and progressively increasing armour plate protec- tion and defensive fire power. The Short Stirling was the RAF's first monoplane four-engined bomber, with large- chord Gouge flaps for take-off and landing, but with cruise speed and altitude performance compromised by short span wings to fit hangar dimensions. Escort Fighters and Bomber-support Aircraft The 'battlecruiser': considered by the British as a large, heavily armed aircraft (Vickers Type 163 four-engined bomber with three 37mm COW guns) flying ahead of the bombers to clear the airspace of fighters; it was rejected as unrealistic - the fighters would go around it. The 'destroyer' or 'strategic fighter': e.g. the German Kampfzerstörer or Soviet Krejser (cruiser); a heavy twin- engined multi-seat and multi-rôle fighter, often with a bomb bay and defensive as well as fixed guns; to be sent in waves ahead of the bombers to fight a path through; various types were in service, notably the Messerschmitt Bf110, but not proven in this role or as an escort. The single-seat, single-engine escort fighter: scarcely thought credible in 1939 because of the long range required; but the key to long range, the jettisonable auxiliary fuel tank had been suggested in the US in 1929, and had received some development in the USSR, Germany and Japan; the  Cano PRE-WORLD WAR TWO 40 BOMBER ARMAMENT Mitsubishi A6M Zero-sen already offered long range even on internal fuel. The single-seat twin-engine escort fighter: half way to a 'destroyer', such a fighter offered longer r
