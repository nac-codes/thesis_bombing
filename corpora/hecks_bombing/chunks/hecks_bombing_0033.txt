TWO 40 BOMBER ARMAMENT Mitsubishi A6M Zero-sen already offered long range even on internal fuel. The single-seat twin-engine escort fighter: half way to a 'destroyer', such a fighter offered longer range but less manoeuvrability than a 'single'; examples included the radical Lockheed P-38 Lightning, the first fighter to use exhaust turbosuperchargers for high performance at altitude; and, potentially, the four-cannon Westland Whirlwind. The parasite fighter: almost uniquely, the Soviets had been experimenting with having a TB-3 bomber carry two or more small fighters which could be released in flight to provide protection to the bomber formation when necessary; this Zveno programme, under V.S. Vakhmistrov. was still under way, but a projected purpose-built parasite aircraft combination had already been cancelled. The 'wing-tip convoy escort': newly advocated in Japan with a version of the Mitsubishi G4M twin-engine medium bomber; a heavily armed and armoured escort aircraft which, instead of breaking off to dog-fight with attackers, would maintain formation and use its flexibly-mounted guns to shoot down the attackers. Bomber Armament Defensive Guns; Gun Positions Although a few light and medium bombers carried a fixed. forward-firing gun (e.g. LeO 451, Battle), bomber armament was mostly defensive. It ranged from fixed rearward and/or downward pointing installations (e.g. Bloch 174) to light, hand-operated machine guns on flexible mounts through to heavier or multiple guns in powered turrets. Rifle calibre guns were common, if barely adequate despite a high rate of fire. Examples included: the 0.303in Browning (USA, adopted as standard by the British); 7.5mm MAC 1934 (France); 7.62mm ShKAS (USSR); 7.7mm Breda-SAFAT (Italy); 7.7mm KM Wz.37 (Poland); 41 7.7mm Type 89 (Japan); and 7.92mm MG15 (Germany). Some air forces were introducing heavier calibre machine guns offering greater bullet energy and range, e.g. the 12.7mm BS (USSR) and 12.7mm Breda-SAFAT (Italy), whil
