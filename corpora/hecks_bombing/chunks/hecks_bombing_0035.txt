rom windblast, and to help overcome the strong and turbulent air loads on the protruding guns. By the mid-1930s most new bombers had enclosed gun positions (albeit with gun/viewing apertures) but retained manual gun handling. The mid-upper gun on the CANT Z.1007bis was given an aerodynamic balance, an opposed aluminium tube geared to  Cano PRE-WORLD WAR TWO 42 BOMB EQUIPMENT AND BOMBSIGHTS the gun and elevated with it to counter the air load on the gun itself. The dorsal turret on the Mitsubishi Ki-21 had manual rotation by the gunner, via bicycle pedals and a chain drive. Meanwhile the development of powered turrets was being pursued. In Britain, the Boulton Paul Overstrand nose turret had introduced (compressed air) power drive for azimuth only. In Germany, the DL131 turret for the Dornier Do217 introduced (electric) power drive for coarse positioning in elevation as well as azimuth. By the outbreak of war, fully powered turrets with electric, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic drives included examples from SAMM in France, Frazer Nash and Boulton Paul in Britain, and Bendix and Sperry in the USA. Most replaced hand- changed magazines with belt-fed ammunition, and they incorporated cam-operated cut-outs to suppress firing when the guns' line of fire traversed some part of the aircraft itself The least favoured turrets were retractable ventral 'dustbins', since these gave high drag in use, just when the bomber needed its maximum performance to escape. But despite the widespread development on power turrets, in September 1939 Britain was the only country with its front line aircraft equipped with them, notably the Whitley and Wellington (nose and tail) and Blenheim (mid-upper); all used a fighter-type reflector gunsight for aiming. The French had power turrets on the LeO451 and Farman 223 Elsewhere, even in the USA for the B-17, reliance was still mainly on hand-swivelled guns with ring and bead sights.
