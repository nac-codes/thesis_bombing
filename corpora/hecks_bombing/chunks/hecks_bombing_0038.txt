led cluster' with beams, end-plates, nose and tail, all held together by circumferential straps which came apart; and a 'nose ejection cluster', a cylinder having a burster charge behind a rear pressure plate to push the nose cap off (with rods) and the contents forward and out. Bombsights Horizontal flight bomb aiming in 1939 normally used a vector-type optical bombsight. The bomb-aimer or bom- bardier viewed the ground track through a reflector or sighting plate, the angle of which was adjusted to allow for the aircraft's speed and altitude, wind speed and direction and the terminal velocity of the type of bomb used. The bomb aimer gave course instructions to the pilot, and triggered release of the bombs when the cross-hairs on the sighting plate appeared aligned with the target. Such bombsights included the British Mk.IX CSBS (Course Setting Bomb Sight), French Bronzavia, German GÃ¶rz- Visier 219, and Italian Jozza G.3. The accuracy of these sights was compromised by aircraft angular movements when making course corrections, and by errors in estimated aircraft speed and drift. The former could be obviated by gyro-stabilizing the sight, to decouple it from aircraft movements. The latter could be overcome with the more 45 complex tachymetric form of bombsight in which ground speed and drift were obtained by maintaining a telescope aligned with the target, to enable measurement of apparent target movement relative to the aircraft. A tachymetric sight gave electric signals as output, usable for automatic bomb release at the correct point. It was more accurate than a vector sight, but needed continuous target visibility during the bombing run. In 1939, the British had a part-stabilized (roll only) vector sight, the Mk.XI; and a tachymetric sight, the unstabilized Automatic Bombsight Mk.I, in service on Hampdens. The USA had the Sperry and Norden stabilized tachymetric sights. Aside from automatic bomb release, the intention was to be able to couple the Norden sight to
