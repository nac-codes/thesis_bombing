Bombsight Mk.I, in service on Hampdens. The USA had the Sperry and Norden stabilized tachymetric sights. Aside from automatic bomb release, the intention was to be able to couple the Norden sight to the aircraft's autopilot, so that during the bombing run, movements of the sight to maintain correct alignment with the target caused appropriate movement of the aircraft's controls. The US regarded the Norden sight as super secret, and refused details to the British until June 1940. But in October 1937, German espionage in the Norden plant provided drawings of the sight, which was later copied as the Luftwaffenzielger√§t EZ42. [Farago, 1972:39] Meanwhile the Germans were developing the comparable Zeiss Lotfe sight. Dive-bombing for angles less than vertical required a special type of bombsight, e.g. the Swedish AGA and German BZA-1 sights already in service; the improved BZA-2 was under development at high priority. Aircraft Bombs High-explosive Bombs Large bombs had been developed in World War One, including a 3,300lb British bomb for the Handley Page V/1000. But, during the inter-war years, air forces mostly favoured the use of smaller bombs in 'stick bombing', releasing a salvo in a slightly staggered sequence so as to straddle the target. Given the difficulties of bomb aiming, a spread of small bombs would be more likely to cause  Cano PRE-WORLD WAR TWO 46 AIRCRAFT BOMBS damage to most targets than one large bomb. High- explosive (HE) bombs had altered little in design, having: a steel case filled with the burster charge; fins or a ring tail for stability; mounting points; a fuse; and an arming device. Bombs of slim, streamlined form gave improved dropping accuracy and greater penetration; short stubby bombs offered a higher charge-weight ratio (CWR) and easier stowage. Whereas the tails of German bombs were permanently fixed on, those of British (and US) bombs were attached prior to use, and were to give a much higher failure rate, the bombs striking flat, or rear
