Whereas the tails of German bombs were permanently fixed on, those of British (and US) bombs were attached prior to use, and were to give a much higher failure rate, the bombs striking flat, or rear first, due to the tail coming off. The bomb's explosive was usually either: TNT (trinitrotoluene); a mix of TNT and ammonium nitrate (e.g. â€˜amatol'); TNT and aluminium powder (e.g. 'tritonal' - US); or TNT, ammonium nitrate and aluminium powder (e.g. 'minol' - British). The fuse was of simple impact type, e.g. a mechanical pistol; or a time fuse for penetration or delayed-action in a low-level drop to enable the aircraft to get clear. Time fuses were mechanical or pyrotechnic type, or (for German bombs only) an electrically-operated device using a condenser charged from the aircraft's electrical supply. Most of the HE bombs in use were 'general-purpose' (GP) or 'demolition' bombs. The other principal types were thick-walled fragmentation bombs, for use against vehicles and personnel; and slim, armour-piercing (AP) or semi armour-piercing (SAP) bombs, relying on a strong case and kinetic energy (high impact speed, from a high altitude drop) for penetration, primarily for anti-shipping use. The US had introduced small parachute fragmentation bombs for use in ground attack. The war was to see considerable use of thin-walled 'high capacity' bombs having a high CWR for maximum blast effect. In 1937, the British updated their range of bombs, while the Germans at that time were so short of bombs that Hitler apparently advocated the filling of compressed gas cylinders with explosive as a stopgap measure. [Faber, 1979:104] In 1939, the RAF's main and largest HE bombs were GPs of 250 and 500lb respectively. although a 2,000lb AP bomb was available, and 1,000lb and 2,000lb GP bombs were under development. For their part, the Germans were mainly equipped with 50 and 250kg GP 47 bombs, but had a 500kg bomb as well, plus AP bombs in all three sizes. During the war, the British especi
