avigation, Blind-bombing Systems and Radar Radio Systems for Navigation; Blind Landing; IFF In the 1930s, aircraft crews still relied mostly on visual navigation plus dead reckoning and/or astronavigation in darkness or overcast conditions, or when over the sea. But radio aids included Direction Finding (D/F) services; and ground radio beacons at known locations, from two of which (or from a single beacon twice) the aircraft's crew could themselves obtain a triangulation position fix, using a rotatable D/F loop aerial on the aircraft. By 1939, the Germans had deployed a network of such beacons. In 1938, R.V. Jones in Britain proposed a long-range radio navigation aid using pulses from three transmitters - in essence the future 'Gee'. In 1939, the Telefunken company in Germany worked on a similar system, stopping because of other priorities. More radical still, the first exploration of airborne radar for aircraft navigation (the future 'H2S') was begun in Britain early in 1939. Ground-imaging radar using short enough wavelengths would show major differences in the terrain below (built-up areas, lakes, etc.) which would allow navigation at night or in overcast conditions, at any range. For landing in poor visibility, the German Lorenz AG blind approach radio aid enabled an aircraft's crew to home in on an airfield and approach in line with the runway, by keeping to the centre of a composite (dots and dashes) audio radio beam. It was in use by civil aircraft and airports, and by the Luftwaffe and RAF. In Britain, a derivative, the STC Standard Beam Approach (SBA) system, was under development. In the coming air war, fought at high speed and with increasing reliance on electronic aids, the need for controllers to be able to differentiate quickly between friendly and hostile aircraft would be vital.
