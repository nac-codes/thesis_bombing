aircraft would be vital. IFF Mk.I, the first operational 'Identification, Friend or Foe' system, NAVIGATION, BLIND-BOMBING SYSTEMS AND RADAR 53 giving an amplified coded response to pulses from a CH radar, entered RAF service in 1939. IFF Mk.II, usable on all CH frequencies, followed. German Blind-bombing Radio Aids Under wartime 'blackout' lighting conditions, targets would be difficult to find and identify at night, while in northern Europe especially, even in daylight, they were frequently obscured by overcast cloud. But it seems that only in Germany was there much interest in blind bombing radio aids to enable attacks in such conditions. The first, begun under Dr H.Plendl in 1933, was X-Verfahren, the airborne equipment being known as X-Ger√§t. It used directional radio beams intersecting over the target. Flight tests began in 1936, using Ju52/3m bombers. The developed system used five Lorenz-type composite radio beams transmitted from aerials mounted on steerable platforms; two were the 'Director' beams that the aircraft flew along (one being a reserve); and three were separate cross beams on the approach to the target. The 'Advance' cross beam provided a warning for the 'Fore' and 'Main' cross beams by which the crew started and stopped a mechanical clock device which computed the timing for automatic release of the bombs. In 1938, Luftnachrichten-Abteilung 100, the first specialist blind bombing unit was set up to develop use of the system. While X-Verfahren was being perfected, work was advancing on Germany's second and third blind bombing aids. Knickebein, was simpler than X-Verfahren, using just two Lorenz-type radio beams intersecting over the target. The bomber was to fly along the centre of the 'flight' beam and release its bombs when crossing the centre of the 'cross' or 'marker' beam. Y-Verfahren differed in using only a single but complex radio beam aligned with the target, plus a ranging signal. The aircraft was to fly directly along the beam while
