the 'cross' or 'marker' beam. Y-Verfahren differed in using only a single but complex radio beam aligned with the target, plus a ranging signal. The aircraft was to fly directly along the beam while a transponder on board the aircraft received, amplified and retransmitted the ranging signal. The ground station continually measured the time taken for the ranging signal to travel to the aircraft and back again, and at the correct range sent a bomb release instruction to the aircraft's crew.  Canos NAVIGATION, BLIND-BOMBING SYSTEMS AND RADAR 55 PRE-WORLD WAR TWO 54 'Radiolocation' and Countermeasures Detection and range-finding by 'radiolocation' (later termed radar) - by transmitting radio pulses and picking up any echoes - offered defence forces early warning of the incursion of hostile aircraft at night or through cloud, and at long range. Since the first successful detection of aircraft by radar in the USA in 1930, radar sets had also been developed in Germany, Britain, France, USSR, Italy and Japan. But radar had been pursued most intensively in Britain and Germany, under code names RDF (Radio Direction Finding) and DT-Ger√§t (Dezimeter Telegraphie) respec- tively. By September 1939, Germany had eight FuMG80 Freya sets operational, and Britain had its CH (Chain. Home) system of 19 'AMES Type 1' RDF stations on the East and Southern coasts of Britain, plus three similar CO (Chain, Overseas) stations at Malta, Aden and Alexandria. Whereas the British CH radars were mounted on tall masts. and looked only out to sea via fixed 'floodlight' beams, the Freya used shorter wavelength, allowing a smaller, steerable antenna. But the more defence-minded British had incorporated their radars into an integrated air defence system, declared operational in August 1939. That same month also, the RAF took delivery of the first six Blenheims equipped with the primitive AI Mk.I radar; at this time no other country was developing radar night fighters, the real answer to the night bomb
