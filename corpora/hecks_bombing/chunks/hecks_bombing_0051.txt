New Bombers The new bombers of 1940 were twin engined, including: the Arado Ar240 multi-r√¥le bomber (Germany, 10 May), with advanced features including gun barbettes; the Yermolaev Yer-2 long range night bomber (USSR, June). some versions of which were to have ACh-30V diesel engines; the North American B-25 Mitchell medium bomber (USA, 19 August), which was ordered 'off the drawing board', and was to become a very adaptable and successful bomber; the Martin B-26 Marauder medium bomber (USA, 25 November), also ordered 'off the drawing board', with a relatively high performance via a clean design and an exceptionally high wing loading; and the De Havilland DH98 Mosquito high-speed unarmed light bomber (Britain, 25 November).
