ican B-25. But with any new bomber, technical problems and training requirements meant that there could be many months between first deliveries into service and the first operational use. Among technology developments, the first remotely operated gun barbettes appeared in 1939-40: first, barbettes on the outer engine nacelles of the Italian P.108B; then the German Arado/DVL FA13 hydraulically-operated system on the Ar240, using a periscope sight. New bombsights also appeared: in Germany, in April 1940 the Zeiss Jena Lotfe 7C bombsight showed impressive accuracy; and in Italy, in August the new Borletti-Colnaghi bombsight was tested on a Fiat BR20. With some bombers too cramped to enable crew members to change places, the problem of the pilot being killed or injured by enemy action was treated on the Martin 167 Maryland and Douglas DB-7 Boston by providing a second simplified set of flying controls in another crew position. In Britain, the discovery of self-sealing linings in the fuel tanks of an He111H-2 bomber shot down on 28 October 1939 led to the rapid development and introduction of similar linings on RAF bombers. In 1940, a Manchester bomber was successfully launched from the RAE 'Fric- tionless Take-off' catapult, before the catapult programme was halted. Heavy Bombers: Heinkel He177, Consolidated B-24 Powered by four P&W Twin Wasp radials, the B-24 was the first production heavy bomber with a tricycle u/c. Other features included the low-drag, high aspect ratio 'Davis Wing', conferring exceptional range and endurance which  Ca 1939-40 58 59 BOMBER DEVELOPMENTS made the B-24 the war's most widely used four-engined aircraft; and 'roller-shutter' bomb doors which retracted upwards inside the fuselage, giving less drag than downward-opening hinged doors. But a longitudinal keel and catwalk allowed only relatively small bombs stowed either side. The He177 was the most innovative heavy bomber of the time. Features included: a structure stressed for dive- bombing,
