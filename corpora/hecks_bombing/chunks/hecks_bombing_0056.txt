filled with flash-producing pellets and hand thrown from the bomber; and an inert weight tied to a small paper parachute, hand thrown in clusters into the path of the fighter. Other ploys tried by bomber crews included firing Very cartridges, dumping shredded paper from the flare chute, and using an Aldis lamp to try to simulate gun flashes. But such attempts rarely had much effect. Weapon Developments German Bomb 'Screamer Tubes', Retarder Rings and Nose Spikes; 'Land Mines' In 1940, German bombs especially were acquiring new features, e.g. various fuses with delayed action and anti-tamper devices making an unexploded bomb a booby trap. On 21 June, bombs with 'screamer tubes' attached to the tail fins were first dropped over Britain. The metal or cardboard tubes had holes or cuts to generate a shrill whistle as the bomb descended through the air, to help unnerve the civilians being bombed. With delay-fused bombs released at low altitude tending to bounce beyond the target, some SC-series bombs were given a tail retarder ring (Kopfring) to increase drag and so increase the trajectory angle at impact. Others (Stachelbomben) were built with a large steel nose spike to dig in and reduce bouncing. The Royal Navy's sweeping of German magnetic sea mines proved so effective that stocks of 500kg LM-A and 1,000kg LM-B mines were re-assigned as blast bombs for raids on Britain, with a first use on 16 September. They were variously fitted with time delay or impact fuzes, sometimes a long pistol probe for above-ground detonation, or a cluster of 36 1kg incendiaries to be scattered by the explosion to start fires. The 'land mines' were dropped on their normal parachutes, drifting with the wind as they descended; aiming being impractical, they were normally used against built-up urban areas. The parachute helped the defence: some caught in trees etc. in which case the mines did not explode; also, the slowly-dropping mines proved suitable targets for any nearby Bofors AA guns. Th
