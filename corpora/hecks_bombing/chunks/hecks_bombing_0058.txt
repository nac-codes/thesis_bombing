m C250C and 500kg C500, some versions of which were fused to ignite prior to impact, to help spread the contents. In Italy, the penetration problem resulted in a 20kg incendiary with an SAP nose; some were dropped on Britain by the Regia Aeronautica on 21 December. At the RAE in Britain in 1940, there were various attempts at new incendiary bombs, largely intended to cause fires in the Black Forest to undermine morale and damage secret installations there. [Turnill and Reed, 1980:58] The 'eggshell bomb' was a four-inch diameter ball of phospho- rus, with a coating of varnish intended to burst on impact to ignite the phosphorus. In practice, the coating was damaged when the bomb was ejected down the flare chute, and the bomb fell - it was said - 'like a flaming meteor'. The parachute-dropped 'sausage bomb' was intended to catch in 63 trees to start forest fires. It consisted of three sacks (later, rigid tubes) tied together and containing wood shavings, wax and igniters. It proved difficult to eject, the slipstream holding it against the aircraft, and ineffective. The British also improvised a 250lb petrol bomb (containing petrol- soaked rags), and experimented with butane as a bomb filling. 'Incendiary Leaves' developed under Project 'Razzle', were to be dropped in large numbers to destroy German crops and forests. 'Deckers' were superseded by 'Wafers', consisting of a phosphorus-impregnated pad between squares of celluloid. Phosphorus being inert in water but igniting in air, the leaves were to be carried and dropped in wet condition, to dry out later. But they proved unable to ignite even dry wheat sprayed with paraffin. Operational drops from Wellington and Whitley bombers in September were a failure, some leaves blowing back up into the aircraft where they caused fires, even though the crews carried water and syringes for such an eventuality. A proposal to edible-wrap the wafers in the hope that rats might drag them into basements and start fires was not tried.
