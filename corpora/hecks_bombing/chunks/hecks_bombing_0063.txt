U-boat pens at Lorient: the British had other priorities when they were incomplete, and the Americans were the first to attack them when they had their 4-m thick concrete roofs in place and were no longer vulnerable. Here the flat-roofed shelters are partly visible through the tail of one of a pair of 2,000-1b M34 GP bombs. The lack of prior craters confirms this as the start of the first 8th AF raid on Lorient, on 21 October 1942. US Navy contribution: Lockheed PV-1 Ventura land-based bombers of the US Navy at a wet and windy base in the Aleutian islands, preparing for raids on Japanese bases at Paramushiru and Shimushu in the Kurile Islands, 1943. The four-man Ventura was faster than its portly figure might suggest, and served also with RAF, Commonwealth and USAAF (B-34) units.  NAVIGATION, BLIND BOMBING AND RADAR The Dams Raid: one of the most famous aerial photographs of the War: the MÃ¶hne dam as seen by a recce Mosquito on the morning after the 617 Squadron 'Dambusters' raid on 16 May 1943. The print, signed by participating crewmen (Gibson across the breach), shows the twin towers used for sighting on the attack run, and the 200-ft-wide breach exactly half-way between. Low-level night raid: the RAF's unarmed two-seat Mosquito flew low- and high- level missions, day and night, without escort. This striking view shows a precision attack by Mosquitos on the railway workshops at Namur in France, on the night of 3 April 1943. Taken from one aircraft. the photo shows a second lit by bombs bursting on rail lines in between workshop buildings. Operation 'Robinson', Target 'Creusot': a rare daylight raid by RAF heavy bombers in 1942. The Lancasters are over Chatillon-sur-Loire in France. en route for a low-level attack on the Schneider works at Le Creusot, 17 October. Routing via the Bay of Biscay and shallow penetration at below radar height achieved surprise, and birdstrikes became a greater hazard than enemy fighters. + 65 The Potential of the Atomic Bomb; German N
