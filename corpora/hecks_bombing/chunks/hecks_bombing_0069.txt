ce was noticeably degraded. German use of X-Verfahren and Y-Verfahren; Counter- measures With Knickebein jammed, the Germans reintroduced X-Verfahren, with a first raid by KGr100 He111s on the night of 13 August 1940; eleven bombs hit the Nuffield Spitfire factory near Birmingham. Subsequent raids were less accurate. In nine raids on the Westland, Gloster and Rolls Royce factories, only two got within five miles of the target. The British detected the 70MHz X-Verfahren beams in September. By November, Ultra/Enigma decoding of German signals sometimes made known the target, and the time, height and line of approach for that night's raid. But Britain's night defences were too weak to gain much advantage from this information [R.V. Jones, 1978:192], while the early 'Bromide' jammers proved ineffective. On 6 November, the crew of a KGr100 He111 got so lost due to 'Meaconing' that they landed on the beach near Bridport. Examination of its equipment (albeit immersed by the tide) enabled the Bromide jammers to be improved, although too late to counter the Coventry raid on 14 November. By October, three transmitters for the third German blind bombing aid, Y-Verfahren, were operational in Northern France, and its use against Britain was begun by He111s of III/KG26. The British had learned of a new beam system in June, and in October noted that two aircraft bombed the Bovington army depot with high accuracy in range, but not in direction. The British picked up Y-Verfahren signals in November, and began development of a countermeasure. British Attempts to Bomb the German Beam Transmitters When KGr100 used X-Verfahren for their own small scale raids (instead of pathfinding in major attacks), the British  70 1939-40 BOMBER SUPPORT noted a characteristic bomb pattern - the craters falling on lines which could be extrapolated back to a point at Cherbourg, evidently the transmitter. This led to the first British attempts at blind bombing, using the German radio beams as a means of
