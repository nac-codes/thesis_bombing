wn escort fighter, was tried by the 71 Messerschmitt company in mid-1940, with a Bf110C towing a Bf109E via a towline attaching to the fighter's airscrew spinner. The fighter would be powered for take-off, restarting when disengaging to attack enemy fighters. The concept was not adopted. In Japan, in 1940, 30 Mitsubishi G6M1 Navy Type 1 'Wing-tip Convoy Fighters' were the first bombers to be converted as wing-tip escorts for bombers, with extra armament, ammunition, armour and gunners in place of the bomb load. They were to remain in formation, defending the G3M2 bomber force using their four flexibly-mounted 20mm cannon. Although the Navy soon withdrew them as being too heavy and too slow, the Japanese Army returned to the concept repeatedly, with the experimental Nakajima Ki-58 (1940), Ki-69 (1942) and Ki-112 (1943). Support Aircraft: Balloon Destroyers; Dedicated Raid Damage PR Aircraft To counter British barrage balloons for low-level raids, the Germans devised Ju88A-6 and He111H-8 'balloon des- troyer' conversions. Each had a full-span fender forward of the propellers, strut-supported from the aircraft nose and wings, with a cutter at each wing tip. The fender was swept back so that any cable encountered in flight would slide outboard to the cutter. A formation of balloon destroyers, carrying reduced bomb load, was to cut a path through the balloons for the main force following. But operational attempts in autumn 1940 brought little success, and showed the aircraft themselves to be vulnerable to fighters. Most were reconverted to conventional bombers. Strafing of the balloons by fighters was used as a simpler alternative, but not systematically. In the USSR, similar balloon destroyer conversions included Pe-2 and Tu-2 Paravan variants. In view of doubts as to the accuracy of the British night bombing, in November 1940 RAF Bomber Command was given the first PR (Photo-Reconnaissance) unit, 3PRU, to be dedicated to raid damage assessment.
