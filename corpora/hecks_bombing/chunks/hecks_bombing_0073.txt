aircraft sank. The bombers also carried 'Mae West life-jackets, and a pair of carrier pigeons which, in the event of radio failure when ditching, could be released with a note giving the location. Ground-attack Operations Blitzkrieg: the German Invasion of Poland The first air offensive of the war began with Operation Ostmarkflug, the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, with a 5 to 1 advantage in numbers of aircraft. Three Ju87s of III/StG1 made the first attack, using 73 precision bombing to destroy detonation points for two vital bridges at Dirschau on the Vistula. Thereafter, support for the invading armies was provided by Luftwaffe units (mainly with Bf109 and Bf110 fighters, and He111, Do17, and Ju87 bombers) systematically bombing and strafing, in close support at the front and against key targets beyond, especially airfields. The bombing was largely short range, in daylight, with extensive fighter support, against relatively weak opposition. Variations included low-level cannon attacks by Bf110s against Polish transport, especially railway locomotives. As the land offensive continued apace, spearheaded by the Panzers, dive-bombing by the Ju87s proved extremely effective in support, exploiting the lack of air opposition. Luftwaffe liaison officers in radio vans called up close air strikes as necessary when resistance was encountered. While diving, the Ju87s could shift target, and even 'corkscrew' with the ailerons to deceive AA gunners. The psychological effect of such steep and fast diving attacks on the defending ground troops and their horses was marked, as apparently was the excruciating engine noise generated by the Henschel Hs123 biplane close support aircraft. Despite first-hand accounts from Poland, the British and French learned little of the new German method of warfare, and remained unprepared for it, in its much more developed form in May 1940.
