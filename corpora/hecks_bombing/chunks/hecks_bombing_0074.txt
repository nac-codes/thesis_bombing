new German method of warfare, and remained unprepared for it, in its much more developed form in May 1940. The Polish Air Force Response Most aircraft of the small Polskie Lotnictwo Wojskowe survived the initial German onslaught by prior dispersal to camouflaged airfields, but many of these were secondary sites without communications and this hampered any co-ordinated response. The P-23 Karas light bombers carried out their first raids on 2 September, including the first and only one on German territory, a single P-23 dropping eight 50kg bombs on rail installations at Neidenburg. Apparently as a result of Allied pressure to approve bombing attacks, it was not until 4 September that the P-37 medium bombers flew their first raids, 27 of them attacking Panzer columns. The Poles failed to co-ordinate operations such that fighters provided air cover for the bombers; and fighters as well as bombers were soon diverted to a ground-attack rôle  74 1939-40 GROUND-ATTACK OPERATIONS to try to halt the advancing German armies. Many were lost to AA fire as they attempted low-level attacks on the well-protected enemy armoured columns. With heavy losses of reconnaissance aircraft also, it became necessary to use surviving fighters and bombers for reconnaissance. As communications and supplies deteriorated, some of these missions were to look for fuel tankers which could be commandeered to provide the fuel for further missions. Air Operations in the German Invasion of Norway On 9 April 1940, the Germans began Operation Weserü- bung, the invasion of Denmark and Norway, the Danes capitulating immediately. The simultaneous sea and air invasion of Norway included attacks on the main Norwegian air bases at Sola (Stavanger) and Fornebu (Oslo) before their capture by parachute- and air-landed troops. By the 10th, bomber and fighter units had flown into these bases to support the German landings, aided by a shuttle service of Ju52/3ms flying in supplies. The 330 bombers quickly began flyin
