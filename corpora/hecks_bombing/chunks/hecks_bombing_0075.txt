troops. By the 10th, bomber and fighter units had flown into these bases to support the German landings, aided by a shuttle service of Ju52/3ms flying in supplies. The 330 bombers quickly began flying bombing sorties against Norwegian forces and Allied warships, and later against the short-lived Allied landings intended to counter the German invasion. The bombing virtually destroyed the small ports of Namsos and Molde With Norway too distant for fighter escort, the RAF response was limited. On the night of 11 April, six Wellingtons made the first British bombing attack on German-occupied inland territory, bombing Sola airfield. Further small attacks followed. With the Norwegian airfields in German hands, attempts were made to use frozen lakes. by variously using skis (Norwegian aircraft at Lake Vangsmj√∂sa), trampling the snow (using 3,000 reindeer at Vaernes), or clearing it (using civilians, Lake Lesjaskog). RAF Gladiators flew onto Lesjaskog on 19 April, but German Ju88s and He111s quickly strafed them and made the ice unusable by bombing. Air Operations in the German Western Offensive; Ju87 Close Air Support Following the Polish campaign, the Germans refined the techniques of blitzkrieg, revolutionizing the role of airpower to support the ground forces. The Sichelschnitt plan for the 75 invasion of the Low Countries and France included the biggest and most complex air support operations yet seen. On 10 May 1940, as the panzer divisions poured into Luxembourg and Holland, and waves of Ju52s carrying troops and paratroops crossed the Dutch frontier, all available German bombers were airborne. The Stuka dive-bombers supported the ground forces, the medium bombers headed to attack airfields in Holland, Belgium and France, and to hamper any Allied response by laying mines in the Channel and bombing road and rail targets deep in France. That day, much of the small Dutch and Belgian air forces were destroyed. Over the next several weeks, the Germans - well trained, wel
