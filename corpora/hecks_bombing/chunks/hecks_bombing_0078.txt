three days. But on 27 May, German bombers dropped 2,000 tons of bombs on Dunkirk itself, destroying harbour installations and much of the town, and killing over 1,000 civilians. Many other raids were hampered by cloud, mist, haze - and the RAF. Although British troops being attacked by Ju87s and Bf109s bemoaned the apparent absence of the RAF, Blenheims (by day) and 77 Wellingtons (by night) bombed German positions, while RAF fighters intercepted German raids far from the beaches. Many raids got through, taking a toll of the ships evacuating the troops under Operation 'Dynamo' and forcing a change to night operations. But even by day the smaller boats proved difficult to hit, while bombs hitting the beaches dug deep into the sand which muffled the blast. By 4 June the fleet of boats had taken 338,000 troops off the beaches. Although huge amounts of matériel - including 75,000 vehicles - were left behind, this was the first real setback for the German bomber force. Ground-attack Developments The Rise of the Dive-bomber; British Idiosyncrasies The evident German successes with the Stuka, brought increased appreciation of the value of ground attack, and especially of dive bombing. The Italian Regia Aeronautica received its first dive-bombers, the twin-engined Savoia SM85 in March 1940, followed by standard and tropicalized Ju87B Stuka dive-bombers supplied by Germany. Mean- while the French had ordered US (Brewster Bermuda) dive-bombers, and in July, the USAAC ordered the A-24, a denavalized version of the SBD Dauntless carrier dive- bomber. In Germany, the new Arado Ar240 twin-engined Kampfzerstörer had a dive-bombing capability. In Britain, the German May offensive brought demands from the British Army to have the same kind of close dive-bombing support that worked with such phenomenal success for the Germans. But the Air Ministry and RAF remained strongly opposed to dedicated dive-bombing and resisted the procurement of dive-bombers. The existing 200 Henley dive-bo
