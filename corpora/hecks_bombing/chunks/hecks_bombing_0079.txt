such phenomenal success for the Germans. But the Air Ministry and RAF remained strongly opposed to dedicated dive-bombing and resisted the procurement of dive-bombers. The existing 200 Henley dive-bombers remained assigned to target towing. With the fall of France, the British government took over the French order for US dive-bombers, and ordered further ones (Vultee Vengeance); but an unwilling Air Ministry maintained that it would not supply or train pilots for these  78 1939-40 GROUND-ATTACK DEVELOPMENTS aircraft when they arrived. [Smith, 1981:91] But while remaining opposed to dedicated dive-bombers, the RAF had instead resorted to small scale use of a variety of obsolete and unsuitable aircraft (Battle; naval Swordfish; Lysander and Hector liaison aircraft) as improvised dive-bombers in France. Then in October, the RAF began dive-bombing experiments with Wellington and Hampden medium bombers, the bombs being released from a shallow angle and too high an altitude (3,000 - 8,000ft) for accuracy without a special dive-bombing sight. In December, the RAF decided to pursue dive-bombing with yet another unsuitable aircraft, the Fairey Albacore biplane. The Germans Introduce the Fighter-bomber With the dive-bomber at its peak, the Germans were looking at its successor, the fighter-bomber. A fighter with external weapon racks and release systems, and ideally additional armour-plate protection and heavy-calibre cannon, could be used for strafing and releasing bombs from a shallow pass. Its high speed and small size would make it less vulnerable to AA, so offering a very practical ground attack weapon. During the Battle of France, Erprobungsgruppe 210 began evaluating such a fighter-bomber (Jagdbomber or 'Jabo') using the Bf109E (carrying one bomb of up to 250kg below the fuselage) and the Bf110C (two 250kg bombs below the fuselage). The Jabos began operations against shipping in July, and in small low-level raids on Britain on 5 September. The small and fast Bf109 was
