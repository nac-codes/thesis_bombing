e had been a failure. However, a useful concept had emerged, the use of a safety 'Bomb Line', ideally an easily identifiable feature (e.g. a road or river) which troops would approach at risk, and beyond which aircraft could attack at will. Since under- or overshoot were the commonest bombing errors, it was preferable to attack parallel to the bomb line, to minimize the risk to friendly troops. British improvised adaptations of aircraft for ground attack in 1940 included a Westland Lysander tested with a dummy four-gun tail turret, another given belly-mounted twin 20mm cannon; and Tiger Moth biplane trainers given underwing racks for 20lb bombs, all to help repel the expected German invasion. They would have stood little chance against the German light AA. In August 1940, the British began experiments with close support, Col. J.D. Woodall devising a system for co-ordinating troops and aircraft, using a signals network with 'tentacles' - ACC (Army Cooperation Command) officers with the troops, radioing requirements for support to an Army/Air Force control centre. Woodall's system was to become one of the successes of the war, evolving into ASSUs (Air Support Signals Units) and FCPs (Forward Control Posts), with army ALOs (Air Liaison Officers) with the squadrons. Meanwhile  80 1939-40 DAYLIGHT BOMBING OPERATIONS in North Africa, loss of airfields as the British Army retreated led the RAF to provide maximum co-operation to help prevent further such occurrences. On the night of 8 December, obsolete Bombay bomber/transports were flown back and forth over the front line to drown the noise of British tanks positioning for Wavell's offensive. Gauntlet biplanes were tried unsuccessfully as dive-bombers, while inadvertent attacks by Hurricanes and Blenheims on British troops led to experiments with ground marker panels and Very pistols to aid recognition. This improvised Army/RAF co-operation in the desert helped Lt. Gen. R. O'Connor to one of Britain's biggest victories of
