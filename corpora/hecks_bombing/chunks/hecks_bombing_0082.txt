to experiments with ground marker panels and Very pistols to aid recognition. This improvised Army/RAF co-operation in the desert helped Lt. Gen. R. O'Connor to one of Britain's biggest victories of the war, against Italian forces - a success which brought the Germans into North Africa. Daylight Bombing Operations The German Bombing of Warsaw; Soviet Bombing The German Blitzkrieg in Poland succeeded by augmenting surprise and speed with Schrecklichkeit (frightfulness). When it became clear that civilians fleeing to the rear severely hampered the Polish forces, bombing of towns and villages at the Front to increase panic and confusion became an integral part of the German policy.

In Britain, Bomber Command's front line strength shrank abruptly as 17 squadrons were assigned as advanced training units, beginning the build-up for a long war. With the British and the French agreeing not to bomb German territory, the Br
