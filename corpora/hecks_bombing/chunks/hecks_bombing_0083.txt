strength shrank abruptly as 17 squadrons were assigned as advanced training units, beginning the build-up for a long war. With the British and the French agreeing not to bomb German territory, the British began occasional attacks on German shipping instead. These were made in daylight, at relatively long range and therefore without fighter escort. In effect they were a try-out for future British strategic bombing. They reflected Bomber Command's belief, albeit unverified in war exercises, that unescorted bombers could penetrate fighter defences in daylight. Later, aware that the USSR was supplying much of Germany's oil needs, the Allies planned a bombing campaign against the USSR's 122 Caucasus oil refineries, mostly around Baku. The rather optimistic plan, using six French and three British bomber squadrons flying from Turkey and Iraq, was being considered when the Germans struck in Scandinavia, and never materialized. British Attempts with Unescorted Daylight Bombing The RAF attacks on German shipping off Brunsb√ºttel and Wilhelmshaven in 1939 were the first attempts at unescorted daylight bombing against an adversary equipped both with modern fighters and EW radar. The initial tactic was to fly at low altitude, below cloud. On 4 September, 7 of the 29 Blenheims and Wellingtons were lost; on 29 September, 5 out of 11 Hampdens; and on 14 December, 5 out of 12 Wellingtons. Bomber Command assumed most of the losses were due to light AA, but many were not. In the last action, German reports credited all five kills to fighters. Reacting to the losses sustained at low altitude, the RAF ordered bomber crews to fly at above 10,000ft to reduce the risk from AA, and to maintain close formation to provide mutual protection against fighters. The inadequacy of this quickly became apparent. On 18 December 1939, German  82 1939-40 DAYLIGHT BOMBING OPERATIONS radar-directed fighters intercepted an RAF raid heading for German shipping off Wilhelmshaven. Caught in clear skies by Bf
