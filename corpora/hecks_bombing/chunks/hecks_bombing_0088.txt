put out of action for 11 days. Adlerangriff, the all-out effort against Britain on 13 August, was disrupted by poor weather. The really big attack came on the 15th, with over 2,000 sorties and for the first and only time, daylight attacks on northern Britain from across the North Sea. But the latter, without Bf109 escorts because of the range, proved too costly, and the campaign thereafter continued against south-east England only. The daily air battles gave serious losses to both sides, the Luftwaffe's bombers receiving a mauling despite the escorts. But after 15 August, the Germans believed that four more days of heavy air raids would finish the RAF's ability to fight. In reality, British fighter production and repair had increased sharply and the RAF's main problem, shortage of fighter pilots rather than fighters, was not yet acute. The war of attrition in the skies over Britain continued. The climax came on 15 September when Dowding, primed by 'Ultra' intercepts, judged that now was the right moment to use the RAF's fighters to the full. With Fighter Command allegedly a spent force, the effect on the German crews of encountering so many fighters was profound. Luftwaffe air superiority seemed as far away as ever. Within days the British had indications that the invasion was being postponed, although preparations continued until well into October. In belated retaliation for the British bombing of Italy, the Corpo Aereo Italiano, with 40 Fiat BR20 bombers plus Fiat CR42 biplane escort fighters, moved to Belgium to aid the German air offensive against Britain, with a first (night)  86 1939-40 DAYLIGHT BOMBING OPERATIONS attack on Harwich on 25 October. Limited Italian raids against British east coast towns continued into January 1941, dropping 100kg HE bombs and incendiaries. But during October, major German daylight raids petered out, and the British came to accept 31 October as the effective end of the daylight Battle of Britain. It had already been superseded by
