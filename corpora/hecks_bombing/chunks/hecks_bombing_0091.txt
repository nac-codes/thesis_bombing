night raids. But although the RA's supply route was easier, its maintenance and repair organization was inferior to that of the RAF, and Italian raid effectiveness reduced as aircraft serviceability declined. The RA itself made little effort to knock out the RAF's repair depot at Aboukir. British attacks on Italian targets in Libya were made by Blenheims by day, and by Bombays and (later) Wellingtons by night. Wellesleys from Aden bombed the Italian air base at Addis Ababa. Blenheim reconnaiss- ance aircraft carried two 250lb bombs, dropped 'at the pilot's own initiative'. On 24 and 25 September, Vichy French LeO45 and Martin 167 bombers from Algeria and Morocco made escorted daylight raids on the British base at Gibraltar. The  88 1939-40 DAYLIGHT BOMBING TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES second, by 83 bombers, was larger than any raid mounted by the Arm√©e de l'Air against a German target. On 28 October, Italy invaded Greece, bombing with escorted SM79s and BR20s. The Royal Hellenic Air Force responded with its handful of Blenheims, Battles and Potez 63s, using them mostly in close support. RAF Blenheims were sent to aid the Greeks, attacking ports and airfields, while Wellingtons began long-range night raids on Italy from Egypt and Malta. Daylight Bombing Tactics and Techniques German Attacks on Aircraft on the Ground Although in a long campaign, an enemy could replace aircraft more easily than trained crews, in the short term the destruction of the aircraft alone could be decisive. During 1940, the Germans showed repeatedly that enemy aircraft could be destroyed efficiently by catching them on the ground; stationary targets were easier to hit. On 9 April, Bf110 heavy fighters used surprise strafing attacks to destroy the small Norwegian Haerens Flyvapen at its main bases at Fornebu and Sola. Then, during the German Western offensive, many more attacks were made on airfields. Normally, these used an approach at low level for surprise, the raids being led by strafing Bf110s.
