nebu and Sola. Then, during the German Western offensive, many more attacks were made on airfields. Normally, these used an approach at low level for surprise, the raids being led by strafing Bf110s. The following bombers released time-delay bombs enabling all aircraft to get clear. On 11 May, Do17s destroyed a squadron of Blenheims lined up at Conde-Vraux. On 19 May, 12 He111 bombers wrecked 40 of the 50 LeO451 bombers at Persan-Beaumont. Successes during the Battle of Britain included: on 13 August at Detling, 22 aircraft destroyed by Ju87s; on 15 August at Driffield, 10 Whitleys destroyed by Ju88s; on 16 August at Brize Norton, 46 aircraft destroyed by just two Ju88s. Such results, and Britain's need to stave off imminent invasion, make the RAF's policy of attacking targets in the Ruhr, rather than the German aircraft massed on the airfields of Northern France, a surprising one. 89 The Vulnerability of Bombers in Daylight; the Ju87 Stuka The air battles of 1940 confirmed that in daylight, most bombers were vulnerable even with an escort. Allied light bombers suffered crippling losses in France, and even the modern medium bombers of the Luftwaffe, flown by practised crews and mostly with strong fighter cover, experienced major losses. In the Battle of Britain, on 15 August, 7 of 50 Ju88s of KG30 making the long North Sea crossing in daylight without escort were shot down by RAF fighters; the Luftwaffe flew no more such raids. On the British side, despite all Bomber Command's previous experience, Blenheims were sent on unescorted daylight bombing attacks on German-held airfields, e.g. 9 July (Stavanger in Norway, 7 out of 12 shot down) and 13 August (Aalborg in Denmark, all 11 shot down); neither airfield was playing a major role in the Battle of Britain. Seemingly, these German and British experiences with unescorted daylight bombing had little effect on USAAC planning. For the Ju87 dive-bomber especially, prior local air superiority was proving essential. On 12 M
