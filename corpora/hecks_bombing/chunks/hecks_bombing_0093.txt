ese German and British experiences with unescorted daylight bombing had little effect on USAAC planning. For the Ju87 dive-bomber especially, prior local air superiority was proving essential. On 12 May, French Curtiss Hawk fighters shot down all 12 Ju87s in one unescorted group and several in another. Even with escorts, the Ju87s still had to peel from formation for a strike, and could be pounced on while unprotected, climbing to reassemble; with no dive-brakes, the escort fighters were unable to stay with them during the dive. With major losses over Britain, after 18 August the Ju87s were withdrawn, the intention being to reintroduce them for close support in the invasion itself. Meanwhile, in May, French land-based naval Vought V-156 dive-bombers had also suffered heavy losses. German Bomber Formations During the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe mounted many raids by large groups of bombers. Normally they flew in a tight formation in Vee's of three aircraft, taking off as a Vee in the case of a grass field, otherwise taking off singly and forming up once airborne. A tight formation enabled mutual defence against fighters, and reduced the number of rounds that could be fired at the bombers by any given AA site. But it took time and fuel to build up, and as the USAAF was to  90 1939-40 91 DAYLIGHT BOMBING TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES find later, it had its own risks: inadvertent bomb hits from aircraft above, if the formation got distorted; inadvertent gun hits from adjacent bombers when under attack; and collisions from other bombers, especially if one was hit and out of control. Typically, the German bombers took off in pre-set sequence, then would rendezvous and circle at low altitude, gradually assembling into the required formation, and then climb on course for the target. The short-range fighters took off last, from the airfields closest to the coast, and climbed to join the bombers as they crossed the French coast at the chosen raid altitude. Over the target, the
