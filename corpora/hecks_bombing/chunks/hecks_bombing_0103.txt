e German raids resulted in widespread damage, casualties, lost sleep, and much disruption, with unexploded bombs (UXBs, malfunc- tioning or delay fu fused) adding considerably to the difficulties of civil defence. The introduction of 'land mines', especially, signalled that the Germans had adopted 'area bombing' against civilians, and this increased calls for retaliation in kind, with the development of similar weapons in Britain. German Bombing versus British Defences By mid-1940, the Luftwaffe was exploiting Britain's inadequate searchlight coverage. Many raids were routed up a central unlit corridor which ensured their concealment; searchlights and AA defences themselves denoted important targets; their locations became known, the searchlights  98 1939-40 NIGHT BOMBING acting as 'landmarks' for the German crews, helping them to steer around the AA defences and towards the required target. Meanwhile, in June, German night raiders began attacking the searchlights, flying down the beams and firing their machine guns before pulling out. Realizing that their AA defences were aiding the enemy aircraft while being ineffective at shooting them down, the British implemented new measures: at times keeping the ground defences inactive; firing AA guns by GL radar alone, the searchlights remaining switched off; operating searchlights in certain areas of the country only, varying these from night to night; and finally, keeping searchlights switched off, except when trying to pick up and track specific aircraft overhead. These measures gave the Luftwaffe increased difficulty. On the night of 22 July, a Do17 of II/KG3 fell to an FIU Blenheim equipped with AI Mk.III radar; this was the first occasion when a bomber was shot down by a radar night fighter, but further instances were to remain rare for some time. The Germans had themselves introduced decoy lighting to help lead British bombers astray, now the British also introduced decoy factories (including night ones: QL-type with
