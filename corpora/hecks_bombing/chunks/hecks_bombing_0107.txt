[Piekalkiewicz, 1985:100] III 1941 Bomber Developments New Bombers New bombers making their first flights in 1941 included: the four-engined Avro 683 Lancaster heavy bomber (Britain, 9 January); the twin-engined Junkers Ju288 (Germany, January), a bulbous-nosed further development of the Ju88, with an armament using remotely controlled barbettes; the twin-engined Samolet-103/KB-103/ANT-58 precursor of the very successful Tupolev Tu-2 medium and dive-bomber (USSR, 29 January); the twin-engined Martin Baltimore (USA, 14 June), designed to British requirements as a replacement for the Maryland; the massive, four-engined Douglas XB-19 (USA, 27 June); the twin-engined Lockheed Ventura (USA, 31 July), a militarized version of the civil Lockheed Model 18, to British requirements for the RAF; the Breda 201 single-seat single-engine dive-bomber (Italy); and the DAR-10F two-seat single-engine dive-bomber (Bulgaria), inspired by the Polish PZL P-23. The largest bomber of its day, but built in prototype form only, the 212ft span XB-19 carried a combat crew of 16, two additional flight mechanics and a relief crew of six; it had a galley for hot meals, and a relief crew compartment with eight seats and six bunks. Powered by four Merlin engines, the Lancaster was developed from the coupled-engined Manchester. Although similar to the Stirling and Halifax, it had better performance and achieved a lower loss rate. It became the RAF's principal heavy bomber, rated by Harris as 'without exception the finest bomber of the war'. New bombers reaching service in 1941 included: the Consolidated B-24 (initially for transport and maritime use); Mitsubishi G4M ('Betty'); Mitsubishi Ki-46 ('Dinah'); Nakajima Ki-49 Donryu ('Helen'); Avro Lancaster; Martin 101  Can 1941 102 WEAPON DEVELOPMENTS B-26 Marauder; Dornier Do217; and Sukhoi Su-2. Diesel-type aero engines promised improved fuel con- sumption with a less flammable fuel, but were
