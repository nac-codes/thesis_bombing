the very large six-engined BV238 flying boat, to be usable as a long range strategic bomber or transport aircraft; because of the high wing, the undercar- riage included tall wing outriggers as well as fuselage bogies. In Britain in 1941, the Airspeed Horsa Mk.I transport glider was adapted as a single-seat glider-bomber, the cargo hold being modified as a bomb bay to carry up to 8,250lb of bombs. This bomb-carrying glider was to be towed behind a 103 bomber as a means of augmenting the total bomb load, the glider pilot releasing his bombs on command from the bomber. The glider carried 200lb of armour for the pilot, and a dinghy. The Horsa bomber was selected in preference to a design from Miles-Hooper, and reportedly, a prototype was built before development was curtailed. Clearly, the performance of the bomber, and its ability for evasive action, would have been severely compromised by having a glider in tow. In 1941, the Soviets were the first to use a radio-controlled explosive-filled bomber as an improvised large cruise missile. The crew of one or two baled out after setting it on course and arming the warload. Thereafter the 'drone' was controlled from an accompanying 'mother' plane, and dived to impact on the target. This Soviet use of a TB-3 bomber as a missile was followed by similar use of an SM79 (Italy, 1942), and B-17s and B-24s (USAAF 'Aphrodite' and Navy 'Anvil' programmes, 1944). The German Beethoven/Mistel programme of 1944 used an unmanned Ju88 bomber as the missile, controlled by a Bf109 or Fw190 fighter mounted pick-a-back atop the fuselage and separating during the dive to the target. Weapon Developments GP, Blast and AP Bombs Aware that their GP (General Purpose) bombs were deficient compared with German equivalents (which had a higher Charge-Weight Ratio - 50 per cent compared with 27 per cent), in 1941 the British began two new series of HE bombs, the MC/HE (Medium Capacity) and the larger HC/HE (High Capacity), with CWRs of over 40 per cent
