t Ratio - 50 per cent compared with 27 per cent), in 1941 the British began two new series of HE bombs, the MC/HE (Medium Capacity) and the larger HC/HE (High Capacity), with CWRs of over 40 per cent and around 80 per cent respectively. The 1,000lb MC later became one of the RAF's most used bombs. The HC bombs were intended for maximum blast effect, and since the thin, light cases ruptured on impact, delayed action fuses were impractical for such bombs. But the first, the 2,000lb HC  1941 104 WEAPON DEVELOPMENTS was dropped on a parachute like the German 'land mine' on which it was based. A German 1,700kg SD1700 heavy fragmentation bomb, carried externally by an He111, was dropped on Cambridge on 7 January, at which time it was the heaviest bomb in operational use. The slightly larger British 4,000lb HC/HE 'Cookie' blast bomb, first dropped by a Wellington on the night of 30 March, was of much simpler design - a cylindrical canister with no nose fairing or tail unit, and (initially) dropped on a parachute. Early in the Pacific War, Japanese and US forces used armour-piercing (AP) bombs improvised from existing large AP shells, adding mounting points and a tail. Examples included the Japanese 800kg Type 99 bomb used at Pearl Harbor, and the US 1,000lb M52. They were unsatisfactory, due to having too low an explosive content (down to 5 per cent), the case having been designed to withstand the shock of gun firing. The first US purpose-built AP bomb, the Navy's 1,600lb AP Mark 1 appeared in May 1942. Anti-personnel and Fragmentation Bombs As the war progressed, the combatant forces made increasing use of a variety of anti-personnel and fragmen- tation bombs, of individual and small clustered type, for use against 'soft' targets, breaking at detonation to produce flying pieces of shrapnel. Variations included: Concrete bombs: The German 50kg and 250kg SBe50 and 250, and the small Italian 2kg and 3kg Mitroglia had walls of concrete with embedded steel fragments to increas
