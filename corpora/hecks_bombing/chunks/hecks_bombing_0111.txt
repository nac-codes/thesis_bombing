es of shrapnel. Variations included: Concrete bombs: The German 50kg and 250kg SBe50 and 250, and the small Italian 2kg and 3kg Mitroglia had walls of concrete with embedded steel fragments to increase lethality. Wire-wound bombs: The Italian 2kg and 12kg Type 'F bombs and various US fragmentation bombs (e.g. 231b M40. 260lb M81) were encased in separate rings or wound coils of thick square-section steel, to break and form shrapnel; some had V-cuts to aid breaking. Butterfly bombs: The German 2kg SD-2 Splitterbombe anti-personnel bombs were dropped in containers and released during the descent. To aid scatter, each bomb's cylindrical casing opened out to form two 'wings' which caused it to drift downwards spinning like a sycamore seed. Some were dropped over Ipswich on 27 October 1940. Casual- ties were promoted by a variety of delayed action and 105 anti-tamper fuses, and each use required a major ground search. The SD-2 was copied in the USA as the 41b M83. Parafrag bombs: Some fragmentation bomb types, e.g. the British 201b 'F' (Parachute) bomb, were given parachutes which deployed automatically to retard them rapidly after release in low-level drops, to prevent bouncing and to enable the aircraft to get well clear before detonation. The later US 120lb M86 Parafrag also incorporated a short time fuse to give detonation in mid-air. Rodded bombs: in 1941, the Germans improvised rodded 50kg bombs (later manufactured as Dinortst√§be) for Ju87 attacks on Crete's airfields. The nose rod, with an 8cm diameter disc on the tip to prevent the rod embedding itself, caused the bomb to detonate some 30cm above ground level, the extra height improving the dispersal of the shrapnel. Later, on 5 September 1942, RAF Halifaxes raiding the airfield at Heraklion, Crete, dropped 250lb rodded bombs. Hand Grenades: These were at times dropped by hand in improvised small attacks; release had to be at very low altitude to be effective. Chemical Warfare Developments; Plague/ Flea Bombs and
