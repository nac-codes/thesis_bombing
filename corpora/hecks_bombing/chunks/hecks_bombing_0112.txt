ded bombs. Hand Grenades: These were at times dropped by hand in improvised small attacks; release had to be at very low altitude to be effective. Chemical Warfare Developments; Plague/ Flea Bombs and Sprays In 1941, the Canadian NRC set up a major new experimental CW station at Suffield, Alberta; for the British it replaced the French station in Algeria, lost after the fall of France. Other major CBW establishments followed in the USA, in 1942 (Pine Bluff and Dugway) and 1943 (Fort Detrick). The principal Allied CW development of 1941 was the discovery of DFP (di-isopropyl phosphorofluoridate), but it did not offer a great advance in toxicity. In the USSR, hydrogen cyanide was successfully compounded into a form for airborne spraying. After Barbarossa, the Germans were able to build up their CW capability by fitting their aircraft with copies of captured Soviet airborne chemical tanks and spraying equipment. German chemical bombs now available included the KC10, KC50 and KC250. The Germans also developed Gasbrisanzbomben, HE bombs incorporating a poison gas charge to incapacitate fire/rescue workers. Meanwhile, the Japanese were still using chemical weapons operationally, and reportedly had done so on a total of 876  1941 106 Ca. NAVIGATION, BLIND BOMBING AND RADAR occasions in the war against China up to June 1941. [Harris and Paxman, 1982:117] Among BW developments in 1941, the Japanese carried out trials with plague-infested live fleas, dropping them in small aircraft bombs having a frangible case made of por- celain. Later, such fleas were successfully dispensed in mid-air by spraying from high-altitude aircraft. [Harris and Paxman, 1982:78] Elsewhere, August 1941 saw the US entry into the field of BW, the Edgwood Arsenal beginning BW development in co-operation with Britain. Nuclear Weapon Developments: Plutonium In July 1941, the Maud Committee in Britain made the first official recommendation to develop an atomic bomb, in a report to the British Government.
