The first IFF-type set on the Axis side, the FuG25a Erstling entered Luftwaffe service in August 1941, used with WÃ¼rzburg ground radars. FuG25 remained the German standard, the replacement FuG226 Neuling only entering production late in the war. As the war progressed, both the British and the Germans were usually able to learn the others' 'colours of the day' recognition signals. Crews on both sides carried Very pistols, and in an emergency at low level at night, could fire a signal which would often silence the enemy's AA fire.  1941 110 Support Aircraft: Command Bomber; Twin-engined Cal GROUND-ATTACK DEVELOPMENTS In Japan, the Army explored the use of a heavily armed and armoured bomber conversion, to carry a bomber formation commander in relative security during a bombing raid. One such conversion, of the twin-engined Nakajima Ki-49, was made under the designation Ki-80 in October 1941, but only two were built. Later, the idea was to be revived with the Kawasaki Ki-81 conversion of the Ki-48 bomber, but the prototype did not reach completion. Escort Fighters With twin-engined fighters now largely discredited as long range escorts for bombers (the turbocharged US P-38 being potentially the main exception, thanks to its high altitude performance), the Soviets nevertheless re-evaluated them. Those tested in 1941 included Pe-3 fighter conversions of Pe-2 bombers, and the experimental two-seat Polikarpov TIS(A) and single-seat MiG-5 (DIS). Further experiments were to come in 1944 (Pe-21) and 1945 (ANT-63P or Tu-1 version of the Tu-2 bomber). Bombing Casualty Survey in Britain In Britain in autumn 1940, the decision had been made to record every enemy bomb dropped on the country, and the damage and casualties caused. In 1941, a team led by Dr S.Zuckerman carried out the first detailed casualty survey, classifying the types of injury sustained, and relating them to the cause (blast, fire, shrapnel, debris) and to proximity to the explosion; whereas blast bombs mostly l
