and the new Hurricane fighter-bombers. Initially, the ground-attack operations worked well. But as the Germans counter-attacked, the RAF and SAAF at times either failed to attack or attacked Allied forces. In the mobile land war, the general difficulty of determining 'whether any particular cloud of dust was friend or foe' [Richards and Saunders, Vol.2, 1975:176] was compounded by an insufficiency of identification flags and by German use of captured British vehicles. In December, superior Allied airpower was held unused for three days because of the identification problem. Desert Conditions; Airfields It was often difficult to hide from air attack in the open terrain of North Africa, but air operations were themselves affected by the local conditions: searing heat by day, reducing take-off performance, distorting perspex and making airframe repairs difficult due to expansion; cold at night; sandstorms; sometimes a quagmire of mud. For the crews, the problems included the lack of water, and at times dysentery and malaria. For equipment serviceability, the major problem was sand and dust, blown by vehicles, propellers and the wind; its abrasion of perspex transpar- encies, and damage to engines, u/c and propeller mechanisms could exceed the attrition rate from enemy action. Maintenance and repair became a major activity, and included mobile units able to salvage aircraft crash-landed in remote areas, sometimes towing them back. New desert airfields were set up close to the front by marking out a large flat area beside a road, clearing areas of stones, erecting a windsock, and introducing tents, caravans, stores and aircraft in dispersed positions and with camouflage nets to reduce vulnerability to air attack. Dummy airfields were similarly marked out and tented, and given unserviceable and dummy aircraft, and dummy guns. Dummy airfields were bombed at times, and had 'friendly' aircraft land on  1941 114 GROUND-ATTACK DEVELOPMENTS them by mistake. To enable operation
