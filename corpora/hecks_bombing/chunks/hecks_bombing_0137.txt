r wind drift, if parachuted down); vulnerability to jamming; and the detection resolution needed for accurate bombing. A special pyrotechnic marker had the advantage over a simple incendiary in that distinctive colours could be used. But it proved difficult as well; one falling fast enough for accurate marking would bury itself in the ground unless it could be made to burst and ignite in mid-air prior to impact. Bomber Developments New Bombers New bombers making their first flights in 1942 included: the twin-engined Douglas XA-26 Invader (USA, 10 January), a more powerful successor to the A-20; the twin-engined North American XB-28 (USA, April), an experimental pressurized high-altitude derivative of the B-25, with turbosupercharged engines and remotely-operated dorsal and ventral gun barbettes (the Martin XB-27, a similar high-altitude derivative of the B-26, was cancelled); the twin-engined Junkers Ju188 (Germany, spring), a develop- ment of the Ju88; the twin-engined SAAB-18 (Sweden, 19 June), a light bomber and dive-bomber for the Flygvapnet; the twin-engined Arado Ar440 (Germany, summer), an experimental heavy fighter-bomber; the four-engined Consolidated XB-32 heavy bomber (USA, 7 September), ordered as the back-up to the B-29, but in much smaller numbers; the four-engined Boeing XB-29 (USA, 21 September); the single-engined Curtiss A-25 dive-bomber (USA, 29 September), a land-based version of the SB2C Helldiver; the twin-engined Messerschmitt Me410 (Ger- many, autumn), a developed version of the unsuccessful Me210, to replace the Bf110; the Mitsubishi Ki-67 Hiryu (Japan, 27 December), designed for performance and ease of production, and Japan's most important bomber in the latter part of the war; the four-engined Messerschmitt Me264A (Germany, December), the Amerika-Bomber, flown in prototype form only; the twin-engined Focke Wulf Fw191 Bomber-B (Germany), with innovations which included all-electrical systems, engine nacelle gun barbettes, and novel Multhopp
