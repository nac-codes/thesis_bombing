ika-Bomber, flown in prototype form only; the twin-engined Focke Wulf Fw191 Bomber-B (Germany), with innovations which included all-electrical systems, engine nacelle gun barbettes, and novel Multhopp-Klappe combined wing trailing edge flaps and dive brakes; the single-engine Kocherigin OPB 127  Can 1942 128 (USSR), a single-seat dive-bomber. Bombers newly entering service in 1942 included the US Martin Baltimore and Lockheed Ventura, both with the RAF; the bomber version of the De Havilland Mosquito; in Germany, the He177A heavy bomber, although it was to suffer continuing structural and engine fire problems; in Italy, the Piaggio P.108B heavy bomber. New ground-attack aircraft in service included the German Focke Wulf Fw190A-4 Jabo version and the twin-engined Henschel Hs129B, the latter with a variety of Rüstsätze conversion sets for ventral armaments and equipment; the US Vultee Vengeance dive-bomber, initially with the RAF, later as the A-31/A-35 with the USAAF; and the A-36 dive-bomber version of the North American P-51 Mustang fighter, having dive brakes although these proved to be unsatisfactory. Bomber Technology; Bomber Projects The Boeing B-17E introduced the war's only fully successful ventral turret, the Sperry hydraulic 'ball' turret, using a gunner on his back in a near-foetal position, firing between his legs. For safety, the turret was not manned during take-off and landing; on the B-24, it was made retractable to reduce drag when not in use; and in an emergency it could be unbolted and dropped. Another Sperry turret, the mid-upper introduced a refined firing safety cut-out which treated the two guns individually; when only one gun would hit a part of the airframe, its neighbour could keep firing. In Britain the Mk.XIV gyro-stabilized semi-automatic 'Area Sight', the most advanced vector bombsight of the war, was introduced first with the PFF late in 1942, replacing the CSBS; a US T-1 version followed in 1943. In Germany, the Fw190A-4 Jabo introduce
