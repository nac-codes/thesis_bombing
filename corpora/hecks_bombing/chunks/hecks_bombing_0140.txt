few in the area outside. The Germans had not been expecting an attack so far east, hence accuracy was greatly aided by the absence of flak, enabling bombing from an unusually low altitude - 11,000 to 14,000 ft. Below: Monte Cassino: at the request of Allied ground forces, on 15 February 1944, US B-17, B-25 and B-26 bombers dropped 427 tons of 500- and 1,000-1b GP bombs on the mountain-top monastery of Monte Cassino in Italy. The demolition was thorough. The dead included over 300 women and children who had sought refuge in the monastery, but German troops had not been present. Since the War, the monastery has been painstakingly rebuilt  Above: Occupational hazard: two photos taken seconds apart during a raid by 8th AF B-17 Fortress bombers. The bombers are out of position, and in the left photo bombs are heading down towards the B-17 below, one of them about to strike the port side tailplane near the root. In the right photo, the bomb has hit; it had not fallen far enough to be armed, so did not explode, but the impact has broken the tail off, leaving it dangling. The damaged aircraft successfully bombed and returned to base. Right: Daylight strike: RAF crews converting from Blenheims found the Boston light bomber was 80 mph faster, with twice the bomb load and a big improvement in comfort and reliability. Here, a gaggle of RAF Bostons are bombing individually amid a few black flak bursts, during an attack on a naval stores depot at Rennes, in France, on 8 August 1943. Overlord Operations: the 5- man B-25 Mitchell medium bomber served with US, RAF and Commonwealth units, and over 800 were supplied to the USSR. Here, AEAF Mitchells, in D-Day invasion markings, are pattern bombing a target in Normandy in June 1944, dropping 500-lb bombs. The formation is impressively tight. Limitations on daylight precision bombing: 15th AF B-17s raid the Wiener Neustadt Bf109 factory, near Vienna. Some bomb bursts appear to be in open country, but the photo also illustrates a seriou
