Here, 2TAF rocket- and cannon-armed Typhoons leave dust plumes as they take off for a close-support operation, summer 1944; less than 30 minutes later they were back. US 9th Air Force en route: despite a high initial accident rate, largely due to an exceptionally high wing loading, the Martin B-26 Marauder medium bomber became a 9th AF success. Here, B-26s of the 9th AF head out for a major daylight raid on the German E-boat pens at Ijmuiden, Holland, on 26 March 1944.  00 BOMBER DEVELOPMENTS 12 129 ance bomber. In September, GÃ¶ring admitted that demand- ing a dive-bombing capability from the He177 had been 'asinine'; and with the Me210 also rendered 'useless' by compromising it for dive-bombing, a post-war German view was that pursuing the dive-bomber concept generally had 'brought ultimate ruin to the Luftwaffe' [Faber, 1979:152]. The bomber projects of 1942 which did not materialize included some advanced ones. In the USA, the Martin XB-33A Super Marauder was cancelled with two prototypes nearing completion. In Britain, proposals were made for a giant long-range bomber, similar to the US B-36; the Bristol design, adapted for the post-war 'Brabazon' airliner, featured a 'V' tail plus eight radial engines buried in the wings and geared in pairs to drive four pusher propellers. German projects included one for a fast precision bomber version of the Me155 fighter. A Dornier projected high-speed unarmed intruder bomber of novel twin-engined (fore and aft) push- pull layout became the Do335. A revised requirement for an aircraft able to bomb New York from bases in Europe brought competing proposals from Junkers (Ju390), Focke Wulf (Ta400) and Messerschmitt (Me264B, a six-engined derivative of the Me264A). Projected turbojet-powered bombers included the British Armstrong Whitworth A W50, a four-jet laminar-flow flying wing design. airfield, Bf109s on another. minutes.
