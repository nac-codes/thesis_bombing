It was larger and heavier, more powerful (turbosupercharged 2,200hp Wright R-3350 Cyclone radials) more advanced and more complex than previous production bombers, with all-round greater performance. It was the first heavy bomber to have pressurized crew compartments, for the cockpit, amidships and tail, with connecting crawl-tunnels; to avoid explosive decompression when hit, the compartments were to be depressurized when hostile action was expected, the crews reverting to the use of oxygen. Except for the (hydraulic) wheel brakes, its systems were electrical, as wiring was thought less susceptible to battle damage than hydraulic pipework, and easier to repair. Since Sperry  1942 130 WEAPON DEVELOPMENTS periscope-sighted individually controlled gun barbettes gave inadequate fields of view, General Electric developed a computerized central fire control barbette system, with all except the tail guns operated from remote stations with viewing blisters; any gunner except the tail gunner could operate more than one barbette at a time. The computer made automatic corrections for speed, range, temperature, altitude, wind, deflection lead and bullet drop. Weapon Developments HE and Incendiary Bombs; Rocket-assisted Bombs The war's largest bomb yet, the British 8,000lb HC/HE bomb (essentially two 4,000lb HC canisters in tandem) was first used in a night raid on Essen on
