ts HE and Incendiary Bombs; Rocket-assisted Bombs The war's largest bomb yet, the British 8,000lb HC/HE bomb (essentially two 4,000lb HC canisters in tandem) was first used in a night raid on Essen on 10 April 1942. The Halifax carrying it could only reach 11,000ft, where it was exposed to medium as well as heavy flak and was severely damaged. The crew had instructions not to drop the bomb if cloud would prevent observation of the explosion, but it was seen to explode with a 'tremendous orange flame'. [Renaut, 1982:75] Despite the difficulties, the British heavy bombers ability to carry such large bombs gave the RAF extra effectiveness and flexibility. Among fragmentation bombs. the British 8lb 'F' airfield denial bomb was intended to be strewn across enemy airfields, and was fitted with anti-tamper and delayed action fuses. The Japanese introduced multiple scattering 'baby bombs', dropped in clusters or released in sequence from auxiliary bomb racks, to destroy parked aircraft. The US made limited use of the air-to-air Mk.34 5lb anti-aircraft bomb against ground targets. In 1942, the Germans introduced the 50kg Sprengbrand C-50 (the 'Firepot'), a weapon combining HE and incendiary elements, and the Phosphorbrandbombe derivatives of the C-50, namely the Brand C-50A and C-50B phosphorus/oil incendiary bombs. The British tried a 2501b LC with an incendiary filling, but it tended to break up on impact and was soon withdrawn. The small Braddock II incendiary was an SOE 'do-it-yourself' sabotage device with instructions in eleven languages; a Lancaster could drop 10,000 of them into enemy-occupied territory. 131 AP bombs boosted by solid propellant rockets could be dropped from lower altitude and still achieve high impact speed for penetration. By 1942, the Germans had developed versions of their 500, 1,000 and 1,800kg AP bombs, filled with 'desensitized' TNT, boosted by a tail group of 19 rockets, and intended to be released in steep dive attacks. But with use at dive a
