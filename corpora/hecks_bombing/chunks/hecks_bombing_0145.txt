oped versions of their 500, 1,000 and 1,800kg AP bombs, filled with 'desensitized' TNT, boosted by a tail group of 19 rockets, and intended to be released in steep dive attacks. But with use at dive angles of 30 degrees or less (causing failure to penetrate), 'their development was in vain' [Faber, 1979:152]. These weapons were primarily for anti-shipping use, but a number of the 1,000kg PC1000RS version were used on the night of 20 March 1942 by Ju88 bombers attacking Takali airfield, Malta, to destroy a supposed underground hangar. Further rocket bombs appeared in 1943: the US 1,250lb Mk.50, for use by US Navy dive-bombers; the Japanese 315kg Type 3 No.25; and the British 'Conkernut' for use against concrete defences. It seems these received even less use. Bomb Containers For carrying small bombs, the Germans developed the 500kg-sized Abwurf Behalter Brandbomben ABB500, one of a number of different types of expendable container, designated by the equivalent size of bomb. Some 140 B1El incendiaries could be carried in the ABB500, used with a barometric release pre-set to open at a low altitude, the resulting high concentration of incendiaries in a small area giving intense fires. Introduced in the 'Baedeker raids', ABB500 containers were also variously used to carry and drop 'crowsfeet', fragmentation bombs and parachute flares. Other, mostly later, German containers ranged from the 50kg-sized BdC10 (able to carry five SC10 anti-personnel bombs) to the 1,000kg-sized AB1000 (for up to 610 1kg incendiaries). The non-expendable BSB700 was especially complex, compartmentalized with an automatic distributor to spread the incendiaries. The containers were mostly cylindrical with tail fins, the larger ones being carried and dropped from external bomb racks. Similar containers were developed and introduced in other air forces.
