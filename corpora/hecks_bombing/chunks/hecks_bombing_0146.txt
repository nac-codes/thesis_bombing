were developed and introduced in other air forces. New HE Techniques: 'RDX' Explosive; Hollow-charge Bombs Discovered in 1899, 'cyclonite' (cyclomethylene trinitra-  1942 132 WEAPON DEVELOPMENTS mine) was a powerful explosive, but too expensive and sensitive for normal use. After the British found a wax additive which made it stable, Canada devised a manufac- turing method and put the new 'RDX' (Research Department Explosives) into production in July 1942 for British and US HE bombs. Adopted in preference to 'pentalite', RDX had 30 per cent more power than TNT, and was to be the only significant new chemical explosive of the war. A mix of RDX, TNT and aluminium known as 'torpex' was developed primarily for underwater use. The Germans also used cyclonite (as 'hexagen'), in a mix of explosives. Devised by Mohaupt in Switzerland, shaped- or hollow-charge (h/c) munitions used the 'Monroe effect' in which a concave front to the explosive charge directed the energy of the explosion forwards, e.g. to punch through armour plate. Use of the technique came in demolition charges (Germany, 1940), and field weapons (Bazooka, PIAT, etc.), then in 1942, aircraft bomblets for use against tanks; unlike AP bombs they did not need high impact speed for penetration and so could be dropped from low altitude. On the Eastern Front, Henschel Hs129s began dropping the 4kg SD4 h/c bomb, able to penetrate the armour of the new Soviet tanks. Later, the Soviets introduced the 2.5kg PTAB. 200 of which could be dispensed from DAG-10 containers under the wings of an Il-2 Shturmovik, to shower down onto a group of tanks. The Italians used a 3.5kg h/c bomb, and later the Japanese introduced the 100mm Ta-105 h/c bomb against landing craft and tanks; a container housed 21. Larger German examples included the open-nosed 250HL. 500HL and 800HL; and an unusual SD250 version with an added h/c nose attachment to punch a hole in thick armour large enough for the delay-fused main bomb to pass through before
