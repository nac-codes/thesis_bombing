the open-nosed 250HL. 500HL and 800HL; and an unusual SD250 version with an added h/c nose attachment to punch a hole in thick armour large enough for the delay-fused main bomb to pass through before exploding. The British and US seem not to have used h/c aircraft bombs. The British Bouncing Bombs: Golf Mine, Upkeep The rolling/bouncing bomb/mine was devised in Britain by N. Barnes Wallis, as a means of breaching a massive concrete dam by placing a heavy explosive load right up against the base of the dam wall. A spherical bomb dropped 133 from very low altitude would bounce and skip across the surface of the reservoir, so evading any defensive torpedo nets. If dropped at the right distance, it would slow down to hit the dam wall with little force and then sink down to explode at the base. After feasibility tests with children's marbles, then with golf balls catapulted along a ship test tank, the concept evolved into a spherical or cylindrical bomb, with back spin to enable dropping from slightly higher altitude to achieve a longer range trajectory. Use of an unwinding rope to achieve spin like a yo-yo was changed to a mechanical drive for spin up before release. The proposed bomb became a family of weapons with the group code-name 'Golf Mine'. 'Upkeep' was the intended Dams bomb, now cylindrical in shape; the smaller 'Highball', proposed in light and heavy versions, was a spherical weapon for use against surface shipping; and 'Baseball' was a naval 'spherical torpedo' to be mortar-fired against enemy shipping. A half-scale dummy Upkeep bomb was first successfully test dropped on 12 December 1942, from a Wellington - with Wallis himself on board - off Chesil Beach, skipping half-a-mile over the surface of the sea. Remote Bombing: Towed Bomb-gliders; Balloon Bombing The US Army and Navy both developed experimental towed missiles in 1942. These guided bomb-gliders, or glider-bombs were explosive-filled unpowered unmanned aeroplanes, air-towed by a bomber and released
