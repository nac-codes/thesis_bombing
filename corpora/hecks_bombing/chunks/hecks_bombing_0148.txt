US Army and Navy both developed experimental towed missiles in 1942. These guided bomb-gliders, or glider-bombs were explosive-filled unpowered unmanned aeroplanes, air-towed by a bomber and released to dive to impact under 'Dog' (visual tracking) or 'Fox' (TV-aided) radio control from the bomber. The USAAF 'BG' (bomb-glider) missiles were the Fletcher XBG-1 and XBG-2, and the canard configuration Cornelius XBG-3. The US Navy's 'GLOMB' (GLider bOMB) missiles were converted Army training gliders: Taylorcraft LNT, Piper LNP and Aeronca LNR - all lightplanes with the engine removed and faired over; the Waco LRW (ex CG-4A troop glider); and the largest towed glider-bomb of the War, the 110ft span Naval Aircraft Factory XLRN-4 glider of 1944. In Germany, the Gotha P-57 glider-bomb was cancelled. The balloon-borne bomb made unsung appearances. In  1942 134 WEAPON DEVELOPMENTS 1942 the British began limited offensive use of their leaflet balloons. With favourable winds, they were launched towards enemy-occupied territory carrying incendiaries and devices to jam radio communications and to snag overhead cables. [Kinsey, 1977:165] Later, balloon bombing systems were developed under Maj. S. Kondo of the Japanese Army in 1944. The little-used Manchuria version controlled altitude via barometric gas release, and dropped the three 10kg bombs by timer. The larger (10.7m diameter) trans-Pacific Fu-Go balloon used sand ballast and gas release; the load (two incendiaries and a 35kg HE bomb) was dropped after the last sandbag. Of 9,300 launched, at least 150 reached the USA and Canada. But a US news blackout (to prevent a 'germ warfare' panic) about the balloons caused the Japanese to assume that there had been no success at all, and the campaign was abandoned. Unorthodox Approaches: the US Live Bat Programme; Trail Weapons In February 1942, Roosevelt authorized US work on a proposal to use bombers to drop large numbers of live bats over Japan, based on an erroneous report that the
