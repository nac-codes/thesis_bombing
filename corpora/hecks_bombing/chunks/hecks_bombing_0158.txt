NS Steel plates protected the wings from efflux/blast. Warheads were interchangeable 251b AP or SAP, or 60lb HE. A salvo with HE warheads was ranked with a broadside from a light cruiser. The solid head AP version was tested against tanks, but it was to become far more successful as an anti-submarine weapon. Also during 1942, the British tested the much larger 10-inch 'Uncle Tom' RP. In the USA on 6 July, the M8 4.5-inch RP was test fired in flight from a Curtiss P-40 fighter. The M8 was subsequently used with 10ft-long triple-tube launchers mounted under the wing; the RP's six 'flick-out' fins deployed on leaving the tube. In Germany, a Junkers Ju88C-4 was tested with a Nebelwerfer revolving six-barrelled recoilless projectile launcher for ground-attack use; it fired WGr21 or WGr28 projectiles. A Messerschmitt Bf110 was tested with a ventral battery of 12 tubes for RZ65 73mm rocket shells as a ground-attack weapon. Neither concept was adopted. Anti-tank Aircraft/Gun Developments On the Eastern Front, the Germans had found that the heavy Soviet tanks were less susceptible to near misses by Stuka dive-bombing than had been the case with most British and French tanks. This had led to increased use of anti-tank cannon instead. But the new Soviet T-34 and KV-1 heavy battle tanks had frontal armour which could withstand the Hs129's 30mm MK101 shells. This led the Germans to evaluate higher powered weapons including the 30mm MK103, 37mm BK3.7 and 50mm BK5. Also, a Ju88A-4 was tested with a ventrally-mounted 75mm KwK39 cannon against captured T-34 tanks. Then, late in 1942, the Germans introduced the Ju87G anti-tank version of the Stuka, with two underwing 37mm Flak 18 cannon. Being slow and precise, the Ju87G made a good gun platform and proved very successful in the role, but vulnerable to fighters. While tanks were the main problem, by 1942 the Germans had developed various types of aircraft bolt-on weapons pack (Waffenbeh√§lter). One such, the WB81 'watering can' was us
