t vulnerable to fighters. While tanks were the main problem, by 1942 the Germans had developed various types of aircraft bolt-on weapons pack (Waffenbehälter). One such, the WB81 'watering can' was used on Ju87s (one under each wing) against infantry, its 6 or 8 fixed, splayed MG81 machine guns spraying bullets fore and aft as it passed overhead. In Britain, after 18 months of war, a report by AVM Sir 143 John Slessor in May 1941 had reaffirmed the Air Staff's view that, 'It is not the job of the Air Force to destroy tanks'. But in June 1942, the RAF introduced the 'tin opener' Mk. IID Hurricane. With the two 40mm Vickers cannon mounted low (underwing), the recoil pitched the aircraft nose down when fired, so to allow correction, the gun installation was made self-loading but not automatic firing. Having no other armament, the IID Hurricanes were themselves vulnerable to enemy fighters, but were used with success in North Africa and in Burma. After the Battle of Alam Halfa, a sick Rommel flew home, taking a sample of the US-made AP shells that the Hurricanes had been firing at German tanks; HQ staff, including Göring, would not take the news seriously. [Tute, 1976:158] In September, SAAF Hurri- canes began dropping magnetic 'sticky bombs' in low-level attacks on German tanks. Ground-attack Operations Pacific/CBI Theatre Ground Attack In the rapid Japanese advance in the Far East, attacks on the Allied airfields used fragmentation bombs, wiping out personnel, vehicles and aircraft, but leaving runways intact for future Japanese use. Staging into forward airfields, AAF and Navy units also flew widespread support operations against Allied troops, the Japanese air superiority enabling the Zero escort fighters to supplement the bombing and dive-bombing with strafing attacks. But the Japanese did not have the ground-to-air communications for rapid response against designated targets, most attacks being made at will. In Malaya, the British noted poor Japanese use of close
