But the Japanese did not have the ground-to-air communications for rapid response against designated targets, most attacks being made at will. In Malaya, the British noted poor Japanese use of close support, but the air strikes added casualties and confusion among the retreating Allied forces. The Allied response was limited, the British still having obsolete or unsuitable aircraft, and losing many of these on the ground. With the Japanese approaching through Burma, the tiny Indian Air Force (Bharatiya Vayu Sena) adapted its Lysanders as  1942 144 GROUND-ATTACK OPERATIONS bombers. Elsewhere, hurried fighter-bomber conversions included US P-40, RAAF Wirraway and Dutch East Indies Brewster Buffalo fighters. A vital success was achieved on 6 May when eight P-40Es of Chennault's 'Flying Tigers' AVG attacked a Japanese armoured column invading south-east China via the Salween gorge. Dive-bombing of the gorge face at 70 degrees with Soviet 250kg bombs brought landslides down trapping the column, which over the next four days was attacked with fragmentation bombs and strafing; Chinese SB-3 and Curtiss Hawk biplanes added to the later attacks. Eastern Front Day Ground Attack In 1942, the Germans stepped up attacks on the Soviet rail system - bombing trains as well as stations, yards and bridges - and on river traffic, especially on the Volga. In February, a Ju87B unit, I./St. G5 based in Norway, was assigned to operations against the Soviet Murmansk railway transporting supplies delivered by the Allied convoys. Other railway squadrons followed in 1943. The Soviets reacted with fighters patrolling the lines, and with armoured AA-defended trains. On rivers and lakes, the provision of armoured, AA-equipped gunboats was increased. Mean- while, with the spring, the Soviets built new airstrips 15 to 30km from the Front (with main supply dumps at a safer 250km), set up observation posts, introduced mobile service/repair units, and began a more offensive approach.
