level, the section leader firing at any vehicles encountered, the No.2 following behind attacking anything missed. For small targets generally, in 1942 the RAF also began using single-seat fighter-bombers, first the Hurricane, then in March, the Kittyhawk. Compared with say, a Boston light bomber, a fighter-bomber needed less maintenance, only one crewman and no escort fighters, and eventually (1944) the 'Kittybomber' would carry the same 2,000lb bomb load as a Boston. But the Boston could fly further, and bomb with some accuracy from medium altitude when the flak was too intense for fighter-bombers. Thus the use of fighter-bombers at low level against small/mobile targets released the Bostons for higher-level use against larger targets - tank concentrations, supply dumps and air- fields. Each had its place, but the Bostons were ordered to cruise at low altitude (below the radar) so as to release more escort fighters to fighter-bomber duty. On the German side, in 1942 the Stuka was proving too vulnerable, and the Gnome Rh√¥ne engines of the Hs129 too unreliable and prone to damage from sand and dust; to compensate, the Luftwaffe introduced the Bf109 Jabo for desert operations.  1942 150 DAYLIGHT BOMBING Daylight Bombing Japanese Bomber Formations and Operations; the Darwin Raid The Japanese having no modern bombsight, high-level bombing by the land-based medium bombers of the IJN, and those of the IJAAF, consisted of pattern bombing by formations led by the most skilled crews, all crews 'bombing on the leader'. HE bombs from 15 to 1,000kg were used. The normal formation size was 36 bombers, but this reduced as the war progressed. Escort fighters normally flew in three groups, two at 1,000m below at right and left, the third 1,000m above and to the rear. The bomber formation was maintained when under AA fire or fighter attack; for the latter, the formation normally tightened up, the crews only breaking away if subjected to unusual attack manoeuvres.
