the bomb loads being too small for the less precise bombing achieved at night; and the fact that a combination of US day and British night bombing would give the German defences no respite. On 4 July, US crews made their first bombing mission in Europe, manning 6 out of 12 RAF Bostons against targets in Holland. On 6 July, the 97th Bomb Group at Polebrook began receiving B-17E bombers. Early training flights included defensive practice against mock attacks by RAF fighters. After each flight, the Norden sights were removed and stored under armed guard. With the prospect of large US and RAF bomber forces operating in parallel, the British airfield building programme was stepped up to become one of the largest of the war, using rubble from the blitzed towns and cities to build runways and hardstands. The runways needed to be strongly built; those at Kilbolton - built hurriedly in 1940 for fighters - were badly damaged by the impact and weight of B-17s landing on them. The 'Drems' system of electrically operated approach, runway and peri-track lighting replaced Glim lamps; a Chance Light flashed airfield code letters; and a red/green/yellow illuminated Angle of Glide Indicator aided the approach. Eventually, the RAF and 8th AF Bomber Commands were to use 180 airfields in Britain, mostly in East Anglia, with over 4,000 miles of runways and taxiways. The Lamy Raid; the Axis Offensive against Malta; 'Tip and Run' Raids In a unique long distance raid, on 21 January a single He111 with extra tankage flew 1,500 miles from North Africa for a surprise attack on the airbase at Fort Lamy, south of Lake Chad, destroying fuel supplies and 10 aircraft. In preparation for a proposed airborne invasion of Malta (Operation Hercules), the Axis forces began weakening the island's defences by attacking British supply convoys and by the Luftwaffe's most intensive bombing campaign against a single target. The heavy bombing began in mid-January 1942, by Ju87, Ju88 and He111 aircraft flying f
