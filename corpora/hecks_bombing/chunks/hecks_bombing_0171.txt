attacking British supply convoys and by the Luftwaffe's most intensive bombing campaign against a single target. The heavy bombing began in mid-January 1942, by Ju87, Ju88 and He111 aircraft flying from Sicily, mostly in daylight with fighter escort. The attacks were aimed primarily at the harbour and shipping at Valletta, the 153 airfields, and the AA batteries. The raids built up during April and May, using double and triple sorties. In April, Malta and Gozo's 143 square miles received over 6,500 tons of bombs, more than the whole of Britain in any month of the 'Blitz'. Supplies of fighters from Britain were often sunk en route or destroyed before they could be used, and the island became near-paralysed by shortages. The bombing continued through the summer, mostly by the RA with small escorted tight formations of Z.1007bis bombers attacking the airfields from high altitude. But Malta survived, and continued its key role in the Mediterranean war. In response to British raids on German historic towns (Lübeck, Rostock), in April 1942 the Germans themselves began surprise Seeräuberangriff (pirate) or 'tip and run' attacks by Bf109 fighter-bombers on largely undefended south coast towns in Britain, beginning with Torquay. The raiders swept in over the sea at low level with guns firing, dropped their bombs, turned and were heading for home by the time the air raid sirens sounded. The raids were mostly very small, but on 31 October around 60 fighters escorted some 30 Fw190s each with a 500kg bomb in an attack on Canterbury; at the speed the fighter-bombers travelled they were over Britain for less than six minutes. [Price, 1977c:142] Eastern Front: Soviet Long-range Bomber Force; Sevastopol; Stalingrad In the German retreat from Moscow, Soviet VVS units attacked mainly at the Front itself, making few deep strikes in the German rear. This allowed the Germans to withdraw in reasonable order, and was judged a tactical error by the Soviets. [Hardesty, 1982:88] In April 194
