ing units, were ordered to supplement the transport fleet. The losses of aircraft and trained crews to the steadily tightening Soviet defences around the pocket were severe. GÃ¶ring later said 'There died the core of the German bomber fleet'. [Air Ministry, 1983:218] Selective RAF Daylight Raids; the Armoured Lancaster; Mosquito Raids Although the RAF was concentrating heavily on night bombing, thought was still being given to ways of achieving daylight bombing with acceptable losses. On 17 April, diversion raids by light bombers and over 500 fighters were used to support an RAF low-level daylight raid on the MAN works at Augsburg. The attack was made near dusk, to allow a return flight in darkness, but only 5 of the 12 Lancasters got back home, all of them damaged. On 11 July, 44 Lancasters used cloud over Denmark and the Baltic to reach Danzig to attack the U-boat yards at dusk in the longest (1,500 miles) round trip yet attempted; two were lost. On 17 October, a larger low-level dusk raid, by 94 Lancasters on the Schneider Armaments Arsenal at Le Creusot and a nearby transformer station, was achieved by 155 flying around north-west France and then in from the Bay of Biscay; only one aircraft was lost, but 1,000 civilians were killed. On 6 December, 93 Ventura, Boston and Mosquito bombers of the RAF's 2 Group mounted a low-level daylight raid on the Philips works at Eindhoven. The raid caused major damage, but 15 aircraft were lost. In May 1942 the Air Staff advocated a specially armoured Mk.III day bomber version of the Lancaster. Harris thought such an aircraft offered little reduction in vulnerability compared with an unmodified Lancaster, and rejected the proposal; the aircraft was already in production. [Webster and Frankland, Vol.I, 1961:451] With the Mosquito, RAF Bomber Command had a bomber with the speed, altitude and manoeuvrability to outstrip existing German day fighters, plus the range to penetrate far into Germany. The first such daylight raid was at
