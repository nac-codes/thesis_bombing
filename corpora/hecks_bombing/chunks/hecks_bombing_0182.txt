f the 350 bombers being equipped with Gee. During 1942, the RAF's BSDU and FIU flew trials to evaluate bomber defence measures, including evasion tac- tics. The Lancaster's supposedly flame-damped exhausts were found to be visible at ranges which the night fighter crews found 'alarming' [Chisholm, 1953:119], but improving the masking - without overheating the exhaust manifolds or losing engine power through increased back pressure - was to prove very difficult.  1942 162 NIGHT BOMBING The L端beck Raid and Incendiaries; the German On the night of 28 March, 234 RAF bombers raided the historic German town of L端beck, chosen by Harris because it was easy to find and to destroy, so giving the crews 'a taste of success'. The raid was the first by Lancaster bombers, the first major one against a population centre, the first to make major use of incendiaries, and the first with British liquid incendiaries. Like the Germans, who had used a 15:1 ratio of HE to incendiaries in the Coventry raid, the British had underestimated the destructive effect of incendiaries. Now. weight for weight, the incendiaries caused nearly six times the damage of HE bombs, in part because L端beck's old buildings had a high wood content. The result led to greatly increased use of incendiaries in RAF raids, typically more than 50 per cent, as in the Hamburg firestorm raid. 'Baedeker' Raids Provoked by the attack on L端beck, Hitler ordered reprisals against British historic/cultural towns as given in the Baedeker guide. These began with an attack by 40 bombers (mostly Do217s and Ju88s), on Exeter on the night of 23 April. Other raids followed, with Exeter, Bath. Norwich and York each bombed several times. Bombing was from relatively low altitude (2,000m) because of the inadequate AA defence. But thanks to frequent course changes to foil the night fighters, and British jamming of the blind bombing systems, many crews got lost. The raids petered out during September. On 30 December, eight of eleven Fw200s
