es. Carefully planned timing and bombing directions, chosen to minimize risk of collision and risk of damage from bombs falling from aircraft at higher altitude, were largely abandoned over the target. Because of icing and other problems, only about 910 aircraft actually bombed the target, 48 being lost. It was the RAF's 107th raid on Cologne, and the city's defences now included over 500. AA guns and 150 searchlights. But this huge raid devastated large areas of the city, with over 1,000 separate fires. Later bomber crews could see the glow over Cologne from 130 miles away. Less successful '1,000 bomber' raids were mounted on 1 June and 25 June, against Essen and Bremen respectively; there were no others until 1944. Soviet Night Bombing: Stalingrad On 19 July 1942, the Soviets attacked KÃ¶nigsberg in the first of a series of small night strategic raids; other targets included Berlin, Danzig, Stettin and Budapest. Later, night harassment bombing was used to effect against German forces surrounded at Stalingrad, the Po-2s bombing transport aircraft unloading supplies flown in at night to airfields in the 'pocket'. With their wood/fabric construction, the Po-2s had a low radar signature, making them difficult to detect at long range. At times the aircraft flew in pairs, one  1942 164 using a spotlight to illuminate the target area for the second aircraft, flying in low to drop its 200kg bomb load. In addition, the Soviet ADD began night raids of 30 to 40 aircraft, attacking the airfields and troops in the 'pocket'. Early US Night Raids The first B-24 raid had been a British one, a night attack on Tripoli on 10 January 1942 by an RAF Liberator. But USAAF B-24s began to arrive in the Middle East in June. On the night of 9 June, 13 B-24Ds flying individually from Egypt attempted the first US night raid in Europe, attacking the Ploesti refineries, but none found the target. Further small night raids followed, against Benghazi and Tobruk. In July, B-25s arrived and these to
