emberg; the 250lb RBF contained a mix of benzol, rubber and phosphorus coloured to burn with a red glow. Then, in the 4 September raid on Bremen, the PFF operated in three groups: 'Illuminators' dropping white flares to light up the general target area, then 'Primary Visual Markers' dropping coloured flares over the Aiming Point for 'Backers-Up' to drop incendiary markers. On 10 September, the improvised 'Pink Pansy' marker was introduced, in a raid on Düsseldorf. The Pink Pansy was a 4000lb MC bomb case filled with a similar mix to the RBF, and igniting with a distinctive pink flash. The Düsseldorf raid also saw red and green flares being dropped to mark the west and east boundaries of the town, the Pink Pansies being dropped in the middle. Then, on 19 September in a raid on Munich, the PFF introduced route marking, dropping flares to mark a course turning-point. Such route marking aided tight streaming for the bomber force, but was also a good way of attracting German night fighters. Introduction of the 'Oboe' Blind-bombing aid; Skymarking On 20 December, six 109 Sqdn Mosquito B.Mk.IV bombers, bombing at intervals, carried out the first raid to use the Oboe radar-ranging blind-bombing aid, in an attack on a coking plant at Lutterade in Holland. Similar small Oboe raids were to continue for months, despite the risk of giving its secrets to the Germans for little result. For targets obscured by dense overcast, the PFF devised blind 'Skymar- king', dropping parachute flares to burst in mid-air, upwind above the cloud over the target. Following bomb aimers then aimed at the illuminated parts of the cloud. The first use of Skymarking, and the first use of Oboe for target marking, was made by a PFF Mosquito in a raid on Düsseldorf on 31 December. Skymarking was code-named 'Wanganui', and was laid using Oboe ('Musical Wanganui') or H2S ('H2S Wanganui'). Skymarking was inaccurate (the flares drifting with the wind as they descended) and required re-marking at five-minute
