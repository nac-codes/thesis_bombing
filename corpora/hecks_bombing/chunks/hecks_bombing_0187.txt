Wanganui', and was laid using Oboe ('Musical Wanganui') or H2S ('H2S Wanganui'). Skymarking was inaccurate (the flares drifting with the wind as they descended) and required re-marking at five-minute intervals. Also, the Germans soon began sending up decoy flares nearby, to confuse bomber crews. But the technique remained in use right through the war.  V 1943 Bomber Developments New bombers making their first flights in 1943 included: the twin-engined Bristol Buckingham (Britain, 4 February). which with ten 0.303in machine guns was the fastest fully armed bomber of the day; the single-engined Brewster XA-32 ground attack aircraft (USA, 22 April); the twin-engined Hughes D-2 high-speed long-range bomber (USA, 20 June), with an airframe built of 'Duramold' plastic-impregnated wood; the twin-engined Yokosuka P1Y1 Ginga fast medium bomber (Japan, c.August). ordered into production but with many delays; the Vickers Type 447 Windsor heavy bomber (Britain, 23 October), the only four-engined aircraft to have Barnes Wallis geodetic construction, and also featuring four separate main u/c units (one for each nacelle) and twin-gun barbettes in the rear of each outer nacelle; the twin-engined Dornier Do317 (Germany), a development of the Do217 intended to have a pressure cabin; the twin-engined experimental Myasischev DVB-102 (USSR), a further Soviet attempt to achieve a stratospheric bomber, with two separate pressure cabins; and the Heinkel He277 (Germany), a development of the He177 with four separate engines to avoid the fire problems with the He177's coupled engines. New Bombers New aircraft in service included the Yakovlev Yak-6 light bomber, the Me410 and Ju188, the Yokosuka D4Y1 ('Judy') dive-bomber, and versions of the British Typhoon, Mosquito and Beaufighter. In the Pacific theatre, USAAF B-17 and B-26 bombers were replaced by B-24s (for longer range) and B-25s (for longer range and ability to use the shorter island runways). 166 BOMBER DEVELOPMENTS 167 Bomber Develop
