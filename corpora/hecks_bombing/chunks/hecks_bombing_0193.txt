on Casualties; Soviet BW Although they remained unused, the secret stockpiling of chemical weapons in all war theatres continued apace, bringing a risk of accidents as a result of enemy action. Some 83 people dying from escaping mustard gas were among the casualties when 96 Ju88 bombers using DÃ¼ppel attacked the harbour at Bari, Italy on 2 December 1943. One of the ships hit, the ss John Harvey, was secretly carrying 100 tons of M47A2 mustard gas bombs for the 15th AF at Foggia. The bombs were themselves of unstable type, being made with the cheap but impure Levinstein H process, giving a gas build-up which had to be vented regularly. Aside from the 1001b M47, USAAF chemical bombs available at this time included the 115lb M70, 500lb M78, and 1,000lb M79. Inexplicably, details of the tabun nerve gas, provided in July 1943 by a German chemist captured in North Africa, were ignored at Porton Down. Despite their proficiency in CW, it seems the Germans did not begin BW development until 1943, and even then the priority given remained low so that little progress was achieved by the end of the war. Information on the much greater Soviet BW work remains scant. However a Soviet Air Force germ warfare specialist, a Capt. Von Apen, deserting to the Germans, described Soviet BW exper- iments, including plague-spraying and the parachute- dropping of rats with containers which would break on impact to spray them with virulent bacteria. [Harris and Paxman, 1982:85,142] Nuclear Developments; Allied Fears of German Radiation Weapons In 1943, the Allies noted that even if the Germans failed to achieve an atomic bomb, they might use a uranium reactor  1943 172 NAVIGATION, BLIND BOMBING AND RADAR to generate highly radioactive material. This could be used in bombs as a form of poison gas, or (as Groves later warned Eisenhower) applied as a 'radiation barrage' against ground troops. In Britain, the possible need to evacuate the population of London because of radiation bombs was address
