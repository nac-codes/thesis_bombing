or (as Groves later warned Eisenhower) applied as a 'radiation barrage' against ground troops. In Britain, the possible need to evacuate the population of London because of radiation bombs was addressed, and the Medical Research Council produced the first report on the possible long-term genetic effects of exposure to radiation. Apparently the Germans did briefly consider such radiation weapons, as a deterrent against Allied use. [Irving, 1967:182] While the US Manhattan programme advanced, in Europe Allied efforts were directed at preventing German nuclear research, where possible, with disruption of heavy water production at Rjukan by sabotage operations, then by a bombing raid by 140 US B-17s on 16 November. Navigation, Blind Bombing and Radar Developments Ground Markers for Air Navigation Radio aids being vulnerable to jamming or interference. visual aids were often preferable. In 1943, the Germans introduced two powerful searchlights shining vertically into the sky, near Dunkirk. Being visible from much of southern England, these helped German crews raiding Britain at night to find their way home. Before this, in May of 1943 alone, four Fw190 fighter-bombers had landed in Britain. apparently thanks to 'Meaconing'. The British were themselves using searchlights as navigation aids, guiding returning crippled bombers around towns and towards airfields; the airfields themselves carried homing searchlights ('Sandra'). On the Eastern Front, by 1943 the Soviet ZOS service was using a mix of tools to help guide Soviet aircraft, especially at night. As well as radio D/F and homing beacons, these included flares, searchlights, bonfires, and lights laid out in an arrowhead pattern to indicate direction. Later, large symbols painted on the ground or laid out in white fabric, 173 and in one sector a large tethered balloon, were also used. It appears that the Luftwaffe also learned to make good use of the ZOS markers. [Boyd, 1977:146] 'H2S' in Service, and German Reactions;
