and German Intelligence; Egon; Gee-H Despite the importance of 'Oboe', the RAF allowed the Germans opportunities to learn its secrets, by repeatedly using it on minor raids. Only after the success of the first large Oboe-marked raid, on 5 March, was Oboe banned  1943 174 ELECTRONIC WARNING AND COUNTERMEASURES 175 except for target marking on major raids. Oboe radar pulses were masked by their similarity to other pulses, but the Germans picked up the course control radio signals, and by mid-1943 associated them with the high-flying Mosquitos. But the means by which the Mosquitos achieved their objectives remained unclear, and attempts to shoot one down to examine its equipment were unsuccessful. After an accurate raid through overcast on steel furnaces in the Ruhr. Hitler believed that IR-guided bombs were being used. Others suspected that agents were setting up homing radio beacons close to the targets. But eventually the signals for bomb release were noticed and then the curved flight path and the eight-minute bombing run. In December, Oboe was first countered with Karl, which jammed the course radio signals. During 1943, TRE increased the potential range of Oboe by use of repeater aircraft at intermediate positions to relay the Oboe signals, but the system was never used in full. Meanwhile, apparently while the Germans were still puzzling over the British Oboe system, in mid-1943 I/KG66 began using a blind bombing aid code-named Egon, which operated on similar lines to Oboe, with radar-ranging from two modified Freya sets (designated FuSAn730 Freya Egon 1) some 150km apart. The aircraft itself carried a two-channel FuG25a IFF-type repeater for the two radar signals. The Germans also uprated Knickebein to operate on 34 frequencies instead of 3. TRE also developed the 'H' radio system, for use with 'Gee' as a combined navigation/blind bombing aid, 'Gee-H'. The 'H' part operated like Oboe in reverse, giving pulses which were picked up at two separate ground stations
