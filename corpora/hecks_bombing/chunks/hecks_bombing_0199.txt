jammers had been introduced in B-17s over Italy in October 1943, AN/APT-2 'Carpet' jamming WÃ¼rzburg AA control radars. and AN/APT-3 'American Mandrel' countering the Freya EW sets. Allied Communications Monitoring and Jamming In 1943, first RAF then US bombers carried an extra German-speaking crewman and receivers to monitor German shorter range VHF fighter R/T communications. This provided real-time information to the cr crews, plus valuable strategic information on the German defences. Longer range 3-6Mc/s signals were monitored from the Y-service station at Kingsdown in Kent. One German reaction to 'Window' was Wilde Sau, operating night fighters on a freelance basis aided by a broadcast 'running commentary' giving the whereabouts of the British bomber stream. The British responded by changing 'Tinsel' (operated at will by the bomber crews) to 'Special Tinsel' (used under instruction from Kingsdown); and introducing the 'Airborne Cigar' (or 'ABC') R/T jammer, able to jam three different frequencies simul- taneously. 177 Realizing that German high-altitude night raids on Britain by Fw190 fighter-bombers operated under R/T control, the British introduced ground transmitters for jamming the frequencies used, under code-name 'Cigarette'. The British also began aiding their own bombers via ground-based countermeasures, first with the 'Ground Cigar' VHF jammer introduced on the night of 30 July. The 'Corona' countermea- sure begun at Kingsdown on the night of 22 October, involved using German-speaking operators to broadcast fake instruc- tions e.g. ordering the German night fighters towards diver- sionary raids, or to land at distant airfields. There were heated broadcast arguments with each side claiming to be the genuine control station. When the Germans introduced women controllers, the British responded with German- speaking WAAFs. Corona eventually became an annoyance system, sending test transmissions, Hitler's speeches, etc. In December, the German Forces Annem
