Landing Ground', RAF Woodbridge ELG at Sutton Heath in Suffolk. The site was chosen for being low lying and flat, by the east coast, and relatively fog free. The first emergency landing there was made by a US B-17 on 18 July 1943. Two further ELGs were built at Manston and Carnaby. These 'crash dromes' had few buildings or other obstacles to hit, and an oversized runway 4,500yd long (i.e around twice normal length) and 250yd wide (i.e five times normal width) to aim at - vital for aircraft that were scarcely controllable as a result of battle damage. Eight dispersal loops provided parking for 50 aircraft each. An abundance of ambulances, crash tenders, mobile cranes and bulldozers provided for crash attention and removal, and later these included US-supplied fire-appliances having remotely controlled telescopic arms capable of insertion right into the wreckage to spray foam. The runway was divided into three parallel strips, with green, white and amber lights for the south,  1943 182 183 GROUND-ATTACK DEVELOPMENTS centre and north lanes, respectively. When possible, crippled aircraft were directed to the south lane where a foam bed was laid for wheels-up landings; less damaged and partially powered aircraft to the centre lane; and aircraft low on fuel or diverted by bad weather to the north lane. By the end of the war, a total of 4,115 aircraft had made emergency landings at Woodbridge. Ground-attack Developments German Anti-tank Developments; Use of Heavy Bombers In 1943, the Luftwaffe made major efforts to increase its 'tank-busting' capability: Soviet tank production was increasing steeply, and more heavily armoured tanks (KV variants and the Josef Stalin) were being developed Specialist anti-tank units (Panzerj√§ger-Staffeln) were intro- duced, variously equipped with Ju88P, Bf110, Hs129B and especially Ju87G aircraft; and there were further exper- iments with heavy calibre cannon and new high-velocity ammunition with tungsten-hardened cores.
