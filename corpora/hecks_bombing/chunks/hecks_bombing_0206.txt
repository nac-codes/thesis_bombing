th Ju88P, Bf110, Hs129B and especially Ju87G aircraft; and there were further exper- iments with heavy calibre cannon and new high-velocity ammunition with tungsten-hardened cores. Service 30mm cannon were being replaced by the 37mm BK 3.7 Flak 18 Even this was unable to penetrate the thick frontal armour of the T-34 or KV-1 tanks, but was effective in attacking them from the side or rear. While some units took to using 4kg SD4 hollow-charge bombs against tanks, other and bigger anti-armour weapons were being tried, the 50mm BK 5 cannon entering service on the Ju88P-4. More impressive still, the Ju88P-1 saw limited service with a 75mm Pak 40 cannon, which was made jettisonable in the event of fighter attack because it made the aircraft so unwieldy. The DÃ¼ka 88 U-Boat gun was apparently also proposed for the Ju88P but not adopted. Despite the great size of a four-engine bomber for ground attack, the Germans used several Heinkel He177A bombers, each with a 50mm BK 5 cannon under the nose, in desperate attempts to relieve troops cut off at Stalingrad; this led to five He177A-3/R5 conversions having a 75mm BK 7.5 cannon under the nose. Elsewhere, and at less risk, British SOE Halifax crews, returning from night supply drops, took to train busting using the rear turret guns in a low, slow, parallel pass. Soviet Ground-attack Aircraft In the USSR, the Sukhoi Su-8 or DDBSch twin-engined Shturmovik had heavy armour plate protection, four 37mm anti-tank cannon, and a 600kg internal bomb load. But it was not adopted. New ground-attack versions of the Yak-9 fighter included the Yak-9T with a 37mm anti-tank cannon firing through the propeller hub, and the Yak-9B with a fuselage bomb bay for four 100kg bombs. Meanwhile, the Pe-2 was now being used in dives of up to 60 degrees. The Kuban conflict saw the first major Soviet use of western Lend-Lease aircraft: the Bell P-39, Curtiss P-40, Vickers Spitfire VB, and Douglas A-20 bomber. The P-40 and Spitfire were not greatly liked, th
