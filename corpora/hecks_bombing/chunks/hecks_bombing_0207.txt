uban conflict saw the first major Soviet use of western Lend-Lease aircraft: the Bell P-39, Curtiss P-40, Vickers Spitfire VB, and Douglas A-20 bomber. The P-40 and Spitfire were not greatly liked, the VVS believing more robust, more heavily armed aircraft were better for ground- attack operations. By contrast, the P-39 Airacobra - neglected by the Western Allies - was judged adequate as an interceptor, and with its central engine location giving good pilot view, and its 37mm cannon, near ideal for hedge-hopping ground-attack operations. Reportedly, the VVS assigned its best pilots to the P-39 Kobry. [Hardesty, 1982:141, 235] US Ground-attack Developments: 'Big Single' Aircraft, and Big Guns In the USA, the Curtiss A-25 Army version of the Navy's SB2C-1 dive-bomber entered limited service in 1943; like the RAF, the USAAF had remained sceptical of the merits of the dive-bomber. Meanwhile, almost uniquely, the US was pursuing development of large and powerful single-seat, single-engine ground-attack aircraft. The Brewster XA-32 was impressive enough, with a 3,000lb internal bomb load and four 37mm cannon. Two bigger ones, the Kaiser Fleetwings XA-39 and Curtiss XA-40 had been cancelled, but a third eventually flew in 1944. This, the Consolidated Vultee XA-41 could carry a 7,000lb war load internally, and  1943 184 had four 37mm and four 0.5-inch guns in the wings. But the A-36 dive-bomber version of the P-51 was now showing its worth, while fighter-bombers were thought capable of defending themselves, as well as delivering adequate ordnance. The Americans were also interested in very large ground-attack guns. Trial nose installations included a 75mm cannon in an A-26 Invader, and US Army 75mm M4 field gun in a Douglas B-18A. The M4 was adopted for B-25G bombers late in 1943.
