Il-2s in two groups laying the smoke. On 2 June, Snr Lt. N.P. Dedov introduced an Il-2 attack carousel, in an attack on German positions near Moldavanskaya; the Il-2s flew in columns of six to the target area where each column formed a defensive circle, the aircraft leaving in succession to attack and rejoin the circle. For Soviet night bombing raids close to the front, searchlights and tracer shells fired by ground forces were used to indicate the direction of the targets; the aircraft themselves dropped 'bombs that gave off light' [Fetzer, 1973:209] to aid visual attacks, and controllers in observation aircraft monitored the attacks. With the Po-2 harassment bombers suffering increasing losses to German mobile 'flak circuses', the pilots took to flying in pairs. If one was picked up by searchlights, he attempted evasion by sideslipping or 'shamming dead' in a spin, while the second moved in unnoticed to bomb the searchlights and guns. In a copying move, in December the Germans set up 1. Ostfliegerstaffel with volunteer Soviet crews and captured Po-2s, to fly harassment raids against the Soviets. Meanwhile, the Germans were also stepping up other night ground-attack operations. With the Stuka now too vulnerable by day, some Ju87D-7s were adapted for night use, with flame-damped exhausts and night-flying equipment. The Kursk Tank Battle The greatest tank battle and greatest aircraft versus tanks battle of the war came with the German Operation Zitadelle offensive at Kursk. Some 2,000 German aircraft flew over 37,000 sorties, many helping in the total of 1,100 Soviet  1943 186 GROUND-ATTACK TECHNIQUES AND OPERATIONS 187 tanks claimed destroyed. On the first day, 5 July, Hptm H.U. Rüdel of 1/St. G.2 used his Ju87G's twin 37mm cannon to destroy all 12 T-34s in a Soviet column, by aiming at the rear of each tank, which had limited protection and housed the engine and fuel. Rüdel went on to become the Luftwaffe's tank-busting ace, credited with 519 Soviet tanks. On 5 Ju
