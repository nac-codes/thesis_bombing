lumn, by aiming at the rear of each tank, which had limited protection and housed the engine and fuel. RÃ¼del went on to become the Luftwaffe's tank-busting ace, credited with 519 Soviet tanks. On 5 July Soviet Il-2s made the first use of PTAB 2.5kg hollow charge bombs and on 7 July, destroyed 70 tanks of the 9th Panzer Division in 20 minutes. Lavochkin La-5 fighter-bombers also flew many sorties against German tanks, firing RS-82s or dropping PTABs and climbing to provide cover for the Il-2s. The VVS also extended the Okhotniki freelance fighter concept to ground-attack operations, with Il-2s operating in groups roaming at will to attack enemy trains, vehicles and infantry. By late 1943, with the Germans pulling fighters back into Germany to counter the US day raids, the Soviets were able to convert more fighter squadrons to ground attack. Air Operations Lessons in the Allied Invasion of Sicily The 'Operation Husky' invasion of Sicily was the first major Allied invasion in Europe, notable for its use - and misuse - of air power. For the ill-fated night airborne landings on 9 July, Wellington bombers flew diversionary raids while cannon Hurricanes escorted the low-flying transport aircraft and gliders, to attack any AA searchlights used. Later, the first major use was made of A-36 dive-bombers, attacking reinforcement columns; and a successful offensive was achieved against road transport, the Germans having to use mules across country. The Luftwaffe managed only a few raids, achieving surprise by exploiting the radar cover provided by Mount Etna. But the Allied air support was not co-ordinated with Army and Navy requirements, requests for air strikes needing 12 hours notice [D'Este, 1988:175]. US commanders were critical that although fighter cover kept the Luftwaffe away, the landings received little air support against ground opposition, while communications and support thereafter also remained poor. Later air strikes were confined largely to inland interdiction,
