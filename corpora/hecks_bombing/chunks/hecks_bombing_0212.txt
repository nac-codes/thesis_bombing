operating from Italian airfields. In November, the DAF implemented a 'Rover David' rapid-response version of the close-support system. Instead of waiting to be scrambled, the Kittyhawk fighter-bombers flew 'Cab Rank' standing patrols over the Front, usually in line astern, peeling off singly or in groups when called down to attack particular targets, identified on photographic maps with grid references. If there were no 'request' targets, the aircraft attacked pre-selected targets before returning to base. 'Rover Frank' was a variation for use against enemy artillery; 'Rover Joe' was a US derivative. Allied Ground Attack in South-east Asia In South-east Asia, RAF Hurricanes flew roving 'rhubarb' search/strike sorties over the Burma jungle, while a new US  1943 188 DAYLIGHT BOMBING TECHNIQUES 5th AF specialty was the use of heavily armed A-20 and B-25 'gunships' to strafe Japanese positions. These could be difficult to identify from the air, friendly and enemy troops often being hidden under the jungle canopy. Hence ground marking by coloured smoke shells was desirable, as were ground reports on the success of air attacks. Casualties under trees could be high, due to bombs detonating in the tree tops and dispersing the shrapnel further. As the US offensive against Japanese-held islands progressed, support for the actual landings was mostly provided by carrier-based Navy aircraft. As airfields became available on the islands. AF and Marine aircraft were flown in to assist. RAAF operations included attacks by Beaufighters on Japanese positions at Nassan Bay, and support by Vengeances for the Australian landings at Langemak Bay. China was the only war theatre where an air force operated extensively in an army support r√¥le with almost no tactical co-ordination with ground forces. Language, liaison and training difficulties prevented the setting up of ground-to-air communications by the US 14th AF and the Chinese until late in the war. Instead, the aircraft operated with
