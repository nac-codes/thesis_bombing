during the night, on 19 July 270 US B-17s and B-24s made the first Allied raid on Rome, attacking rail targets and airfields. The fall of Corsica to the Allies made its 17 airfields available. Then on 27 September, the 13 vital air bases on the Foggia plain in Italy fell to the British 8th Army. From these airfields, bombers could strike at targets in southern Germany, Eastern Europe and the Balkans. From Foggia the new US 15th AF carried out its first raid on 2 November. attacking the Wiener-Neustadt Bf109 factory. The 15th AF had a mix of medium and heavy bombers and concentrated on a variety of selected small targets - factories, bridges, etc. By the end of the war, it had grown to 85 squadrons of bombers and 22 of escort fighters. Bombing Operations in the Pacific/CBI Theatre While RAF bombing was largely confined to Burma, US bombing attacks on the airfields, bases, ports, depots, etc. of Japan's expanded empire were also mostly small scale but now spread across six Air Forces, having one to four Bomb Groups each: the 5th AF (based in Australia and New Guinea); 7th (Central Pacific); 10th (India); 11th (Aleu- tians); 13th (New Hebrides); and 14th (China). The 5th AF operations were supported by RAAF Bostons, Beauforts and Beaufighters. Bombing missions were also flown by USN PB4Y-1 (B-24) patrol bombers, while PB4Y-1P 'photo-bomber' Liberators usually dropped bombs on one or other of their PR targets. Air operations were variously hampered by heat and damp, monsoon rains, flooding of airfields, aircraft lost in violent thunderstorms, and cyclonic winds able to lift and overturn a B-24. Nevertheless, the US advance in the Pacific was accelerating with an island leap-frogging approach, seizing weakly held points and establishing new airfields to use in attacking Japanese bases and supply shipping. After weeks of heavy 5th AF bombing of airfields on Bougainville, US forces landed in November. Then, with bombing support by the 7th AF from Funafuti in the Ellice Is
