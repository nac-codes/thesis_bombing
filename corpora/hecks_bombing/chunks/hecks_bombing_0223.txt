anese bases and supply shipping. After weeks of heavy 5th AF bombing of airfields on Bougainville, US forces landed in November. Then, with bombing support by the 7th AF from Funafuti in the Ellice Islands, the capture of key islands in the Gilberts was begun. But the landings on Tarawa atoll brought heavy casualties; the bombing by carrier-based aircraft had failed 197 to destroy the concrete defence positions. Japan itself being still out of reach, strategic bombing operations remained fewer and smaller than in Europe. In a notable one, on 13 August nine 5th AF B-24s flying from Darwin carried out the longest duration round trip raid of the war, a 17-hour, 2,400-mile mission to bomb the Balik Papan oil refineries in Borneo. Japan's own ability to mount long-range raids was already in severe decline, because of the rapidly increasing Allied fighter defences, and the vulnerability of the Japanese G3M and G4M bombers. But, operating in primitive conditions at Buin in Bougainville, the Japanese flew D3As and D4Ys on dive-bombing missions against US bases. In Burma, Japanese raids on the Chittagong airfields included one in which the bombers glided down with engines off, the attack setting fire to the elephant grass around the bomb dumps. Night Target Marking Developments Area Bombing v. Marking Small Targets; 'Target Indicator' Marker Bombs With the RAF's night bombing offensive increasing, Harris remained committed to area bombing of Germany's industrial towns and cities. He argued that because of German industrial dispersal, selective bombing of supposed key strategic targets ('panacea targets' he called them) would not have the impact claimed, while Bomber Command did not have the capability of finding and marking such small targets at night. But the Pathfinder Force, and later also 5 Group, were in fact developing a range of techniques for finding and visually marking targets in night raids. The emphasis was on ground marking by coloured pyrotechnic marker bombs,
