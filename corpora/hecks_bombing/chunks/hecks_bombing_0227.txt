container, deplov the parachute and ignite the flare, which burned for three minutes with a red or green light. Later a type which ejected 'stars' of a different colour (green, orange or red) was introduced, to help defeat decoys. The LNSF used a different 'White Drip' parachute flare of great brilliance dripping a 1,000ft tail of white molten magnesium while descending, but with too short a burn duration for general use. Blind dropping of flares using Oboe was called 'Musical Newhaven', but Oboe was usually considered accurate enough for dropping marker bombs directly. Blind dropping of flares by H2S was called 'H2S Newhaven', first used in a raid against Wilhelmshaven on 18 February 1943. Unfor- tunately, the use of flares also attracted enemy night fighters and helped illuminate the bombers for attack. On the night of 31 August, the Germans themselves began dropping 'fighter flares' over the bomber stream to aid the night fighters. Accurate re-marking was essential during a long night raid to counter the phenomenon of 'creepback', crews tending to bomb early rather than late with the result that the centre of bombing gradually moved away from the intended Aiming Point. For an attack on the long narrow town of Wuppertal-Barmen on 23 May, the approach and aiming point were chosen such that the creepback spread down the length of the town. The massive Hamburg raid of 27 July introduced elaborate re-marking procedures, with 53 back-up marking aircraft distributed through the main force. and using a two-second overshoot to try to re-centre the attack. Even so, a seven-mile creepback developed during NIGHT BOMBING TECHNIQUES AND OPERATIONS 201 the raid. Later, in 1944 Bomber Command planners introduced some allowance for creepback by selecting the Aiming Point beyond the required target area.
