's bombers simply joining the returning RAF bomber stream. This obviated any defence action until the bombs began falling. A new Pathfinder unit, I/KG66, flying Do217 and Ju88 bombers then Ju188s, made its first mission over Britain on 18 August. Target marking used 50kg Type LC50 marker bombs, which burned for four minutes, the flame colours being green, white or yellow. The marking technique involved: a target finder (Zielfinder) dropping flares over the target area; a target marker (Zielmarkierer) dropping the marker bombs; then two illuminator (Beleuchter) aircraft dropped further flares to light the target area for the start of the main force attack. Night Bombing on the Eastern Front On the night of 20 April, the Soviet Air Force mounted a rare large-scale strategic raid, some 200 medium bombers attacking Insterburg. German strategic raids on the Eastern Front were also rare. But a series was begun on the night of 3 June, 168 bombers (mainly He111s) attacking the Molotov Collective Combine T-34 tank-production centre at Gorki. Navigation was aided by use of the Moscow public broadcast transmitter, and the bombing was carried out using marking by KG100, and the new Lotfe 7D bombsight. In August, the Germans began belated plans for a strategic bombing corps to fly small precision raids against Soviet armaments factories and power stations. The new corps was to include the pathfinder unit KG100, and would use Ju88 and He111 bombers, eventually He177s. But instead, priority was given to countering the ever-growing Soviet ground force juggernaut; and with the German retreat, the prime strategic targets were soon out of range anyway. The Dambusters' Raid On the night of 16 May 1943, the RAF carried out Operation 'Chastise', one of the most innovative bombing raids of the war, a precision low-level night attack on a complex of five dams providing hydroelectric power to Germany's Ruhr industrial area. To breach a massive concrete dam (the MÃ¶hne was 100ft thick at its
