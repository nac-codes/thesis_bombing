a calculated false setting on the bombsights - for the second and third targets. The raid was not wholly successful, the initial marking being two miles off due to poor H2S imaging; many foreign workers in a nearby labour camp were killed. After the raid, amid the fire and rescue activity, work teams began painting, dynamiting and shifting rubble in key areas to create simulated damage in time for the early morning PR flight. But decentralization of work away from Peenemünde was quickly implemented. US Attempts with Night Bombing Having suffered heavy losses in unescorted daylight bombing raids, in the autumn of 1943 the US 8th AF experimented with night bombing, using B-17s with flame dampers and gunflash eliminators. For five weeks, the 422nd Bomb Squadron flew night missions (with 5 B-17s) with RAF Bomber Command. But two were shot down, the Norden sight proved unsatisfactory for this role, and with the retraining and aircraft modifications needed, the USAAF judged it preferable to press for escort day fighters instead. In October, a further attempt was made by the 492nd BG, using the Sperry S-1 sight. In the Pacific, small night raids were flown by US Navy PB4Ys and 13th AF B-24s from Henderson against Japanese bases, often using flares for target illumination. Flying from Buin, the Japanese themselves made some night raids either on moonlit nights or timed for a dawn or dusk attack. Over Burma, the Japanese had been flying small night raids without flame-damped exhausts and were now experiencing losses to RAF Beaufighters. Blind-bombing Developments: Gee-H, H2S, Oboe and SABS The RAF's first successful operational use of the new 'Gee-H' blind bombing aid was made by Mosquito aircraft in a raid on Aachen on 7 October 1943. The first use by Lancasters in a major raid (589 aircraft on Düsseldorf) followed on 3 November. Following criticism that H2S had not been tried for blind bombing directly (as opposed to blind marking), on 17 November 83 PFF aircraft attacked
