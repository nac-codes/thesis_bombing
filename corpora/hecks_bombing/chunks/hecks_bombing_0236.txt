(589 aircraft on DÃ¼sseldorf) followed on 3 November. Following criticism that H2S had not been tried for blind bombing directly (as opposed to blind marking), on 17 November 83 PFF aircraft attacked Ludwigshafen, all using H2S for blind bombing; no markers were carried, and the decoy TIs lit by the Germans were ignored. The first attempt at a large scale RAF night raid without PFF marking did not come until 12 August 1944, when only 23 of the 373 H2S-equipped heavy bombers  1943 208 managed to bomb the target, Brunswick. At 10cm., H2S imaging was very poor, especially for the area directly below the aircraft, the operator having to judge his position from the image around the screen periphery. The first raid to combine PFF Oboe marking with 617 Sqdn's precision bombing using the new 'SABS' (Stabilized Automatic BombSight) came on 16 December 1943 against a V-1 site at Abbeville. The bombs averaged 94 yards from the centre of the markers, but that centre was itself 350 yards from the target. This experience led 617 Sqdn, under Wing Cmdr L Cheshire, to begin developing low-level marking techniques for 5 Group, Bomber Command. RAF Bomber Command's third major bombing cam The Battle of Berlin campaign, the Battle of Berlin, lasted from 18 November until 30 March 1944. Despite the 'Pointblank' directive to concen- trate on attacking the German aircraft industry, the campaign against Berlin derived from Harris's claim that with 8th AF assistance, Bomber Command could bring about the collapse of Germany by wrecking Berlin 'from end to end'. The campaign saw 9,111 sorties in 16 major raids on the German capital. But Berlin was a much more difficult target than Hamburg: much bigger; more spread out: without a clear H2S image, and hence much more difficult to blind mark. Further, the much greater range meant greater vulnerability to night fighters and a smaller bomb load because of the extra fuel needed. Armour was reduced to increase the bomb load, and take-off was made at
