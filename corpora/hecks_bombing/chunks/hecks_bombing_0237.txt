, the much greater range meant greater vulnerability to night fighters and a smaller bomb load because of the extra fuel needed. Armour was reduced to increase the bomb load, and take-off was made at high weight, giving difficulty in climbing; cases of cre No crews dumping their largest (4,000lb HC) bomb in the North Sea to gain height were countered by wiring the raid camera and photoflash to operate automatically when the large bomb was released. Over Berlin, thick overcast usually prevented accurate marking and bombing, and also daylight PR raid assessments. Successive raids damaged different parts of the city without achieving really heavy concentration, and the lack of photos allowed Bomber Command chiefs to exaggerate the effectiveness of the campaign. In reality, the results did not justify the heavy losses in aircraft and crews.
