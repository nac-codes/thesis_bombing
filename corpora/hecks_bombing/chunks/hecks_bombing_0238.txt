VB-108 (USSR, summer), a high-altitude bomber with a pressure cabin; the four-engined Junkers Ju290B (Germany, summer) a strategic bomber version of the Ju290 transport; the four-engined Nakajima G8N Renzan land-based Naval heavy bomber (Japan, 23 October), potentially a formidable aircraft, with turbosuper- charged engines, a high aspect ratio laminar-flow wing, and a defensive armament of six 20mm cannon and four 13mm machine guns in power-operated turrets; the Boeing XB-39 (USA), effectively an 8-engined B-29, the four nacelles housing Allison V-3420 double engines. New bombers and ground-attack aircraft entering service in 1944 included the Yokosuka P1Y1 Ginga ('Frances'), SAAB-18, Mitsubishi Ki-67 ('Peggy'), Hawker Tempest, 209  1944 210 211 BOMBER DEVELOPMENTS Bell P-63 (with the Soviet VVS), Nakajima JIN ('Irving'), Tupolev Tu-2, and Douglas A-26 Invader. Due to systems problems it was April 1944 before the first operational B-29s could be sent to China. The US declined to provide the USSR with the B-29, by far the most advanced strategic bomber in the world. But when three B-29s force-landed on Soviet territory after raids on Japan, Stalin ordered them impounded, two of them to be dismantled and 'reverse engineered' in every last detail. The Soviet copy emerged post-war as the Tupolev Tu-4. Technology Developments on Bombers New bombsights included the Soviet OPB-1D for horizontal and PBP-4 for dive-bombing; and the British Mk.III low-level angular bombsight provided to the RAF's specialist bombing unit, 617 Sqdn. This latter device avoided any need for estimating the bomber's height at bomb release, by measuring the rate of increase of angle of the line-of-sight to the target, below the flight path during the approach. Among armament developments, the British gyro-gunsight - effective during evasive movements as well in level flight - was introduced on RAF and US bombers. The new British Rose Brothers' hydraulic turret featured twin 0.5-inch guns, heating,
