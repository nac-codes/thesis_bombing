r234C had BMW003 turbojets in separate or paired nacelles, but none reached service. Turbojet Bomber Projects; the Sänger-Bredt Rocket Bomber Project The first turbojet-powered heavy bomber, the Junkers Ju287 featured six BMW 003A turbojets in clusters of three under the leading edges of a unique swept-forward wing. It was cancelled in July 1944 because of priority for Germany's emergency fighter programme, but the Ju287 V1 four. turbojet aerodynamic test bed was test flown to evaluate the wing with its adverse aeroelastic behaviour. Projected German turbojet bombers included mixed-power versions of the Me264 bomber (four radial engines plus two Jumo 004 or BMW 018 turbojets), plus a version powered by two BMW 028 turboprops; and the Heinkel He343 four-turbojet medium bomber. With the USA now also developing a more fuel-efficient axial-flow turbojet (GE J-35), US interest in turbojet bombers was increasing. The proposed Boeing Type 413 four-jet version of the B-29 was rejected, but in March the first US jet bomber was ordered, flying in 1946: derived from the piston-engined XB-42, the Douglas XB-43 light bomber was powered by two J35s in the fuselage. For the XB-42 itself, a proposed auxiliary turbojet under each wing to boost maximum speed was tried post-war (XB-42A). A requirement for a heavy jet bomber brought proposals for four competing designs, all flying post-war: the North American B-45, Convair B-46, Boeing B-47 and Martin B-48. An August 1944 report, 'On a Rocket Drive for Long Range Bombers' by Dr Eugen Sänger and Dr Irene Bredt of the Deutsche Luftfahrtforschung covered a highly imagina- tive project for a 'suborbital' or 'antipodal' bomber, but one needing technology that was far out of reach. This rocket-powered, hypersonic boost-glide 'aerospace-plane' was to have taken off on a rocket-boosted sled along a 3km monorail, climbing above the atmosphere to burn-out at a 213 speed of 22,000km/hr. At such speeds, centrifugal lift would allow a long coasting
