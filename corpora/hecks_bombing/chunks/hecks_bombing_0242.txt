s to have taken off on a rocket-boosted sled along a 3km monorail, climbing above the atmosphere to burn-out at a 213 speed of 22,000km/hr. At such speeds, centrifugal lift would allow a long coasting glide, the aircraft proceeding further by skipping in and out of the denser atmosphere while gradually slowing down, to give a total range of 23,500km. The skipping trajectory aimed to help dissipate the intense kinetic heating experienced during periods in the atmo- sphere. The Soviets, including Stalin, became very interested in the SÃ¤nger-Bredt project when they obtained the report at the end of the war. Weapon Developments New Blast Bombs; Mid-air Detonation; SBX The new bombs of 1944 included the largest operational US HE bomb of the war, the 4,000lb M56 LCHE blast bomb, carried in two pairs under the wings of a B-29; and the largest German bomb, the 2,500kg SC2500 'Max', carried one under each wing of the He177. The Germans also introduced the SB1000 blast bomb, dropped clean for accuracy but deploying a parachute to slow it just prior to detonation; the /410 variant was shaped to fit the bomb bay of the Me410. Finding fragmentation bombs effective against Japanese forces in jungle areas, in 1944 the US 11th AF also used larger GP bombs fitted with a precision time fuse; dropped from a pre-set altitude the bombs exploded 25-50ft above the ground. US, German and British attempts were made to develop an 'SBX' (Slow Burning Explosive) bomb, noting that industrial and mining explosions damped by solid particles like coal dust could cause greater damage than that given by a normal 'sharp' explosion. Trials confirmed the validity of the observation, but only for confined spaces; in a typical building, doors and windows burst early in the explosion and vented the rest of the blast, leaving the main structure intact. Related US work led post-war to the FAE (Fuel-Air Explosive) bomb.  1944 214 WEAPON DEVELOPMENTS The British 'Tallboy' Penetration Bomb In Britain, concern
