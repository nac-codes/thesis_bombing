e blast, leaving the main structure intact. Related US work led post-war to the FAE (Fuel-Air Explosive) bomb.  1944 214 WEAPON DEVELOPMENTS The British 'Tallboy' Penetration Bomb In Britain, concern at German construction of reinforced concrete V-weapon sites revived interest in the Barnes Wallis penetration bomb project of 1940. Development began on the 10-ton weapon, but when the Germans adopted simpler V-weapon launch sites, work changed to a six-ton version which could be carried further to targets in Germany. Streamlined, with a machined pointed nose casing, the 21ft long RDX-filled 12,000lb MC or DP/HE 'Tallboy' was accurately and strongly made for a precision drop and deep penetration. It was to be dropped by Lancasters of 617 Sqdn, from 18,000ft, using the SABS for accuracy. After initial test drops, it was given angled fins to impart a spin-up as it descended, to count unter instability through the transonic speed range. It was first used on the night of 8 June 1944, caving in the Saumur railway tunnel. Subsequent targets included U-boat pens, V-weapon sites. and the Tirpitz. Although not expected to penetrate thick concrete in a direct hit, on occasion Tallboys did so, bringing down 1,000 or more tons of concrete. A smaller 4,000lb version was used at times; it could be aimed much more accurately than a normal 4,000lb bomb. Incendiaries: the British 'J'; US Fuel Tank and Napalm Bombs Probably the largest incendiary bomb of the war was a 1944 British 2,700lb petrol/gel weapon in a 4,000lb HC case, for low-level attacks against fortified positions; it was not adopted. The unusual British 30lb 'J' (Jet) liquid incendiary bomb used thermite to heat a solution of methane in petrol, forcing it through a tube to form a 15-ft flaming jet. It was released in clusters, deploying individual parachutes. But many of the 400,000 dropped failed to ignite, and the Germans extracted the contents for use as a fuel. A 20-1b version used cordite to vaporize solid naphthalene
