deploying individual parachutes. But many of the 400,000 dropped failed to ignite, and the Germans extracted the contents for use as a fuel. A 20-1b version used cordite to vaporize solid naphthalene to form the jet. A 10lb 'J' bomb was also developed but not used. With ignition failures and storage problems delaying service use of napalm ('gel-gas'), US P-51 pilots began using their part-filled drop tanks as incendiary weapons, dropping them in a low-level skip bombing run, to burst across the target. The return strafing pass needed to ignite the fuel was later obviated by attaching a magnesium incendiary to the tank, or by fitting an impact fuse in place of the tank filling 215 cap. The purpose-built napalm bombs ranged from the 25-USgal Mk.65 to the torpedo-sized 200-USgal Mk.68. Also introduced were a napalm version of the 1001b M47, and the 61b M69 napalm/magnesium incendiary bomblet, dropped in a 500lb cluster. The M69 had a cloth streamer in place of a tail, plus a powder charge for tail ejection to spread the contents, making the weapon highly effective. In addition, jettisonable fuel tanks were filled with napalm and fitted with igniters. USAAF P-38 bombers made the first operational use of napalm bombs on 17 July, attacking fuel depots south of St LÃ´. Because they spread burning jelly which clung to any surface, napalm bombs were to prove effective, if peculiarly nasty, e.g. against personnel in gun emplacements and bunkers. The napalm burned off vegetation and camouflage, and penetrated trenches, bunker openings and pill-box slits, killing the occupants by asphyxiation if not incineration. But the M69s were also to be used in the US area bombing of Japanese cities where they proved more effective than the conventional 41b M17A1 magnesium-thermite bombs. The napalm M47s were to be used as markers. German Bomb-towing Trials In 1944, the Germans devised a method of enabling the Me262 twin-jet fighter to carry a large bomb by towing it.
