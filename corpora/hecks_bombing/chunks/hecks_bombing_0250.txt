the aircraft, so picking up any bombers or enemy night fighters below. Fishpond gradually replaced Monica.  1944 220 Blind Bombing: Centimetric Oboe Mk.II and Deception; Micro-H On 7 January, the Germans achieved the first Oboe Mosquito shot down, and by studying its equipment were able to improve their jammers for Oboe Mk.I. But the British were now ready with a new centimetric Oboe Mk.II (the major version being Mk.IIM, code-named 'Album Leaf') which was more accurate than Mk.I, and more difficult to jam. When Oboe Mk.II was implemented, Mk.I was kept operating in parallel, for deception. A Naxburg set picked up Oboe Mk.II signals on 30 January, but their significance went unrecognized as the Germans redoubled their efforts to jam the already successfully jammed Oboe Mk.I, and the RAF were able to use the unjammed Mk.II unhindered. This deception remained successful until 3 July when an Oboe ground station operator mistimed the 'spoof' Oboe Mk.I signals, and the Germans noticed that the Mosquito accurately dropped its markers some four minutes prior to receipt of the apparent release signal. Work on a new jammer was quickly implemented. In April, Oboe Mk.III introduced a 'multiple pulse recurrence frequency' facility enabling use by up to four aircraft on one wavelength; and a 'delta approach' facility, allowing aircraft to approach a target from different directions, the dot-dash audio control being based on rate of approach to the target. A Gee-H derivative, the US AN/APA-40 Micro-H (i.e. Microwave-H) navigation/blind bombing system for the 8th AF displayed the return pulses from the two ground stations as two spots on the H2X screen. The aircraft course was corrected to keep the spots equidistant from the centre, the spots coinciding with it at the target. Fitted to B-17s and B-24s, Micro-H was first used for navigation on 1 November, and for overcast blind bombing on 18 December. Unlike Gee-H, Micro-H was never jammed.
