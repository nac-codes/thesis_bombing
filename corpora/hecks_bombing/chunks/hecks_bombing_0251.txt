to B-17s and B-24s, Micro-H was first used for navigation on 1 November, and for overcast blind bombing on 18 December. Unlike Gee-H, Micro-H was never jammed. Airborne Countermeasures: New Jammers; 100(SD) Group; 803 BS During 1944, the Allied RCM effort supporting the bombers increased rapidly in sophistication and extent. New airborne jammers for use against ground and night fighter radars included: derivatives of Carpet (the British 'Carpet II' and NAVIGATION, BLIND BOMBING, RADAR 'Carpet Sweeper', the US AN/APQ-9 'Carpet III', AN/APT-5 'Carpet IV' or 'Robe', AN/APQ-2 'Rug', and 221 AN/APQ-21 'Mat'); derivatives of Mandrel (AN/APT-1 'Dina', AN/ARQ-8 'Dinamite', and 'Piperack'); and 'Airborne Grocer'. The British 2,000W 'Jostle IV' VHF jammer was the largest airborne jammer at that time, carried in the ventral turret well of B-17 and B-24 bombers. Introduced in July, it forced the Germans to revert to the old 3-6Mc/s communications. In November 1943, the RAF had formed No.100(SD - for 'Special Duties') Group, to 'confound and destroy' the enemy with electronic warfare operations. By mid-1944 the 'destroy' part of 100 Group consisted of seven squadrons of Mosquito night fighters equipped with Serrate, Perfectos and Monica, roaming over Germany on intruder missions. The 'confound' part consisted of one squadron (No.192) for radio/radar intelligence-gathering missions, flying Wellington, Mosquito and Halifax aircraft; and four squadrons (with Halifax, Stirling, Fortress and Liberator aircraft) of defence suppression RCM aircraft, using Jostle, Mandrel, Piperack and Window. These jamming aircraft joined the RAF's night raids. The Fortresses (B-17F and G), painted black and fitted with flame dampers, could operate at higher altitude, giving longer range jamming and reduced vulnerability to night fighters. In January 1944 the US 8th AF set up its own RCM unit (later, the 803rd BS), to work alongside 100 Group. The 803rd had five B-17s equipped with Gee, Carpet and Mand
