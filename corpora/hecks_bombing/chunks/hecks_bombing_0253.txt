using ABC and Window. On 14 July, 100 Group implemented a Special Window Force (SWF) for spoof missions, the SWF aircraft dropping Window to appear as a large bomber force. Thereafter, combined Mandrel/SWF operations penetrated deeper and deeper into Germany to keep the enemy's defences at full stretch. Typically the SWF formation and the real bomber force would emerge from the Mandrel screen in different places, heading in different directions. Bomber Support Flight Refuelling Developments During the war there was limited interest in using in-flight refuelling for achieving long-range bombing missions. The USAAF evaluated the pre-war British Flight Refuelling 'Looped Hose' system, using a B-24 as tanker and a B-17 as receiver. But the technique needed fine weather, and firing a line from the B-17 to engage a line trailed by the B-24 was judged too cumbersome. Later planned tests with a B-24 and a B-29 were cancelled, and the system was only adopted by the USAAF after the war. In 1944, the Germans considered 223 using the six-engined Ju390 transport as a tanker for flight refuelling a Ju290A or Me264 for bombing New York from bases in Europe. Although successful day trials were carried out with the Ju390, refuelling at night would have been needed and the concept was not adopted. In 1944 the British authorized conversion of 600 Lancasters to tankers, to refuel 600 Lincoln bombers for long-range bombing of Japan by the RAF 'Tiger Force' from bases in south-east Asia. A possible stop-gap, a large dorsal dummy 'saddle' tank of 1,200-Imp.gal was tried on two Lancasters but rejected when flight tests showed unaccept- able take-off performance and handling. In the event, the advance of US forces in the Pacific was rapid, and few Lancasters had been converted for in-flight refuelling by VJ-Day Alternative concepts tried for carrying additional fuel for long range included towed unmanned 'fuel gliders' (e.g. the US Cornelius XFG-1), and a towed winged fuel tank tried with
