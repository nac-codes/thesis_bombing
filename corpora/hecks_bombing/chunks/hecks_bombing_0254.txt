fuelling by VJ-Day Alternative concepts tried for carrying additional fuel for long range included towed unmanned 'fuel gliders' (e.g. the US Cornelius XFG-1), and a towed winged fuel tank tried with the Me262 and Ar234C in Germany. The British 'FIDO' Fog Dispersal System Fog was a special hazard for returning bomber crews. One night in 1941, the crews of 30 Whitleys all baled out because they were unable to see to land; and in December 1943, six out of seven Halifaxes trying to land at Woodbridge ELG in fog crashed with great loss of life. Prompted by Churchill, Britain's PWD undertook work on fog dispersal for airfields, under FIDO (Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation). Pre-war work on fog dispersal by moisture-absorbing chemicals, by refrigeration, by intense noise, and by electrical discharges, was superseded by direct heat methods. Some tests used lines of coke braziers, others raised petrol pipelines which were finally adopted with a trial airfield installation at Gravely. FIDO became operational at Woodbridge in June 1944. The pipelines each side of the runway carried petrol to burners at intervals along the pipe. When operating, the intense heat generated at the burners caused great up-draughts which cleared the fog locally. Disadvantages included the fuel cost, initial black smoke, and handling difficulties at final approach caused by the up-draughts and turbulence, while the flames themselves  1944 224 were a hazard to aircraft veering to one side. But FIDO could raise ground visibility from 100 yards to 2,000 yards, and gave Allied bomber crews confidence that they could return and land safely even in thick fog. At Woodbridge, it was to enable over 100 aircraft to land safely during one foggy night in January 1945, and the total there reached 1,200 by the end of the war. FIDO installations were made at 15 airfields in Britain, one in France and one (by US Navy CBs) on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. + Ground-attack Developments The Decline of the
