he aircraft are B-17G Fortress bombers, identifiable by their 'chin' turrets. Mosquito low-level precision raid: 2TAF Mosquito bombers attacking the Gestapo HQ housed in two adjacent four-storey buildings in the University of Aarhus, Denmark, on 31 October 1944. One HQ building, centre, has largely been demolished, and a staff vehicle below it is on fire. The other building at left is also damaged, and did not survive the next few minutes.  DO1b Hell on earth: a dramatic view from 12,500 ft of a hugely destructive RAF raid on Pforzheim, on the night of 23 February 1945. Bomb bursts mingle with incendiaries, and scale is given by the Lancaster bombers silhouetted against the smoke and fire. Some 380 bombers dropped 1,825 tons of HE and incendiaries in 22 minutes; around 17,600 people were killed. 40 1b &p GRAND SLAM 9200016 MC TALL BOY 1200016 MC 12000ГЬ НС. 8000 16 HC. 190016GP 2000 |bMC 500 1 MC Inferno: a fire with fuel, ammunition and bombs aboard usually needed the autopilot for control, and a quick exit. This B-24 has its engines and main tanks ablaze within seconds of a fighter attack over Austria in September 1944, the crew having little chance. The B-24 was not especially fire-prone, but it had other problems: the bomb-bay doors tended to cave in when ditching, while at impact in a crash-landing the high wing with its great weight of engines tended to slam forward and down, crushing crewmen in the front fuselage. Bombs for all targets: a 1945 photograph showing some of the RAF's range of HE bombs; really large bombs (12,000 lb and up) were unique to the RAF. The tail of the 8,000-lb HC is the open cylinder at the far end. The Grand Slam's tail fins are canted 5 degrees to provide spin-up during descent. The bomb labelled 2,000-1b MC appears to be a 2,000-lb AP. Oil target: despite opposition from ACM Harris of Bomber Command, the Allied raids on refineries and synthetic oil plants in German and occupied territory eventually became a major factor in winning t
