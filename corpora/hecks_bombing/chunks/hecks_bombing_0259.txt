and War: US Marine Corps F4U Corsair fighter-bombers preparing for take off at a Central Pacific island base, late in the War. Each carries a single 500-1b bomb under the belly for a strike at a Japanese target, probably a base on another island. By 1945, the Japanese had few ships left to attack. 272 267  GROUND-ATTACK DEVELOPMENTS The RAF's bomber stream: the size of the stream for a major raid, usually only evident from the noise, became visible when the force was assembling late in a summer evening, or on a daylight raid late in the War. The 7-man Lancaster became the RAF's standard heavy bomber, and this still shows almost 100 of them filling the sky, setting out on a daylight raid in summer 1944. 'Little Boy': this unique uranium bomb was the first nuclear weapon to be used operationally, dropped on Hiroshima. It had a yield equivalent to 20,000 tons of HE, whereas the slightly heavier RAF Tallboy had just three tons of HE. The projections on the side near the nose are aerials for the radio altimeters carried by the bomb. 431 225 Hs129B-3 with a 6m long ventral 75mm BK 7.5 gun was successful even against the Josef Stalin tank. The US Consolidated Vultee XA-41 was built in prototype form only. In Germany, work was extended to more exotic ground-attack aircraft. The Berlin B.9 research aircraft had shown that a prone position (lying, stomach down) enabled a pilot to withstand higher 'g' in a pull-out manoeuvre, while offering low frontal area and therefore low drag. Early in 1944 the Henschel company adopted this approach for the Hs132 turbojet-powered ground-attack aircraft. Meanwhile, the Dornier Do335 'push-pull' fighter was evaluated as a fighter-bomber; an Me262A-1 jet fighter with a 50mm BK 5 nose cannon was tested against ground targets; and the projected Blohm und Voss P.191 eight-engined aircraft was apparently intended for flak suppression. In Japan, the MXY5 glider was adapted as the Yokosuka/Mizumo Shinryu anti-tank suicide glider, carrying a 100kg i
