hm und Voss P.191 eight-engined aircraft was apparently intended for flak suppression. In Japan, the MXY5 glider was adapted as the Yokosuka/Mizumo Shinryu anti-tank suicide glider, carrying a 100kg impact-fused warhead. It was to be given a rocket-assisted take-off for operations right at the front, or be towed to the battlefield area by a Yokosuka P1Y bomber. The crewman was then to make a steep dive to impact on an enemy tank. Only one was built. Rocket Projectiles By 1944 the RP had become a major RAF ground-attack weapon. The normal installation on Typhoons was eight 3-inch rockets, a bank of four under each wing; a double-stack 16 RP installation was less rigid/accurate. In 1944 P-51s in Burma and 14th AF P-40s in China were fitted with Bazooka-type launcher tubes for M-8 4.5-inch RPs, in a cluster of three under each wing. They were used for close support and against Japanese armour. The US 5th AF in New Guinea field-fitted 12 such tubes (4 clusters of 3) to some A-20G Havocs, for low-level attacks. One German response to the huge Soviet armoured offensive on the Eastern Front was hurried development work on tank- busting RPs. In October, the Panzerschreck 88mm anti-tank RP was introduced, the Fw190F-8 carrying three launcher tubes for it under each wing. It was quickly superseded by the 70mm Panzerblitz Pb1 (four under each wing) and then the 55mm Panzerblitz Pb2 version of the R4M (six or seven  GROUND-ATTACK OPERATIONS 1944 227 226 under each wing), the Pb2 having a hollow charge warhead. These rocket weapons were also tested on the Hs129B. In addition, a Ju88P-4 was tested with a 22-round magazine for an RZ65 rocket launcher. Ground-attack Operations Experimental/Unorthodox Weapons Notably in Germany, 1944 saw trials with a variety of new and unorthodox weapons and devices for ground-attack operations. A Ju87C was tested with an 88mm recoilless gun mounted under the fuselage to fire through the propeller disc, but severe damage was caused when the rear-fi
