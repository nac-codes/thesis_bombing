on. Troops, including each Chindit unit had an RAF officer to direct air attacks. The Vengeances were employed, e.g. in pin-point dive-bombing attacks against Japanese earth bunkers, using a mix of delay-fused GP bombs to explode deep down, and 'NITI' (Nose Instantaneous, Tail Instantaneous) fused rodded anti-personnel bombs. The wide-ranging Beaufighter earned its RAF name 'Whispering Death' from quiet, fast, low-level surprise attacks against road, rail and river traffic. The Mosquito was also used, but its glued/wooden structure proved susceptible to the hot, damp climate. US P-38s and P-51s made strikes on Japanese forward airfields. Wel- lington and Mitchell bombers airlifted munitions for ground attack squadrons with Allied forces cut off in the Imphal valley, the Hurricanes flying incessant attacks against the besieging Japanese. During the drive southward in autumn 1944, the US 10th AF alone flew 12,000 close support strikes, mostly by P-47s, some reportedly within 35 yards of Allied troops; just one Chinese and two British soldiers were killed. [USSBS, 1945-49: No.67] In December, co-ordinated attacks were made on all Japanese staging and forward airfields in Burma, catching aircraft on the ground refuelling. Features of the Allied operations included: employing Hurricanes to spray the malaria-ridden Kabaw valley with DDT ahead of Allied troops; use of a Spitfire ('The Looker') to confirm that a target area was cloud free before despatching the attack aircraft; the use of nets and frames under parked Hurricanes so that pilots could safely jettison their bombs and take off as fighters should the field come under attack; US use of liaison aircraft to help direct close support bombing; the use of Vengeance dive-bombers dropping first delayed action bombs in close support operations and then - as the Allied troops attacked - unfused bombs, the Japanese remaining under cover to 229 await the bomb explosions; similar use of Spitfires to make strafing passes, and
