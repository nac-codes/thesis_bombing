support operations and then - as the Allied troops attacked - unfused bombs, the Japanese remaining under cover to 229 await the bomb explosions; similar use of Spitfires to make strafing passes, and then dummy strafing passes as the Allied troops attacked. Eastern Front Ground Attack By 1944, Soviet close support operations were being directed by radio via a central command post at the Front, and local controllers in tanks; the artillery used coloured smoke shells to mark the targets. The Soviet operations included: in the Crimean mountains, bombing by Il-2s to cause landslides, cutting off roads and destroying convoys to obstruct German forces; heavy bombing against the fortifications and minefields built by the Finns across the Karelian Isthmus; the strewing of incendiaries in the Steppes in high summer, the resulting grass fires forcing the German troops to move positions; and set-piece attacks against major targets, with two or three bomber regiments (of 30 aircraft each) bombing from 3,000m, then two or three ground- attack regiments, and finally two or three fighter-bomber regiments attacking at low level. With the huge Soviet offensive - supported by 7,000 aircraft - on the third anniversary of 'Barbarossa', the scale of the Soviet ground- attack operations rivalled those by the Allies on the Western Front; and the losses to German flak were equally large. Faced with Soviet armour breaking through the German lines, daily Luftwaffe operations began with reconnaissance sorties to establish where the Red Army had moved to during the night. These were followed by bombing and strafing attacks by Fw190 fighter-bombers. Where Soviet tanks were engaging German troops, they became priority targets, a frequently used technique being a fast, low skip-bombing attack, releasing a 250kg bomb with a one-second delay fuse, to bounce off the ground into the tank or to hit it directly. Where Soviet columns were moving forward unopposed, the priority targets were the fuel supp
