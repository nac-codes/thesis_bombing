t German light flak took a steady toll of the Allied fighter-bombers. The losses were greater for low-level than for dive-bombing, but without dive-brakes, fighters built up too much speed in a dive for really accurate/low dive-bombing. Overall, the immense Allied air operations in support of the Normandy invasion were highly successful, but 4,100 aircraft were lost from the 480,000 sorties flown between 6 June and 31 August. German Attacks Against the Normandy Beachhead With inadequate resources (and its ground-attack units all on the Eastern Front), the Luftwaffe's response to the D-Day invasion was late and improvised. Features included: initial unescorted daylight sorties by Ju88s, with inevitable losses; small scale night raids by Ju88, Do217 and He177 bombers, with further losses to flak and night fighters; attempts, with pilots untrained for ground attack, to use Fw190 fighters as fighter-bombers, some with 21cm rocket mortars; restricting 231 night bombing to high altitude, thereby reducing losses but rendering the bombing ineffective; diversion of the bombers to minelaying; assigning night fighters to aid in ground strafing; and the return of the Ju87 for night attacks. Overall, the German losses in France were heavy, 931 aircraft by 30 June. Allied Close Support; 'Column Cover'; 'Horsefly' The Allied advance after D-Day was spearheaded by air-supported armour, the lead tanks carrying fluorescent coloured panels to aid recognition from the air. Close support, including 'cab-rank' standing patrols, relied on target marking by coloured (usually red) smoke mortar shells, the air-to-ground fragmentation rocket attacks being directed by Forward Air Controllers (FACs) in armoured 'contact cars'; German troops at times fired their own red smoke shells as decoys. An exceptionally large operation came on 22 June with the US assault on Cherbourg, supported by 14 Wings of AEAF fighters and fighter- bombers providing a bomb-line carpet. The attack was opened by rocket-
