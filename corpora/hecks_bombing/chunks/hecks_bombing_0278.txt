stronghold by German troops. Heavy bombing of the town of Cassino followed, converting it to rubble and craters which provided defensive positions for the Germans while hampering any Allied advance - a practical lesson that was proving difficult to learn. In December, RAF Bomber Command flew eight major tactical raids, blind marking through thick fog to disrupt the German Ardennes offensive. After practising on a mock-up of the target, under Operation 'Jericho' on 18 February, 19 Australian, Canadian and British-crewed RAF Mosquito VI bombers carried out a special low-level daylight raid for SOE. Three waves of bombers attacked Amiens jail, breaching the walls. Around 100 prisoners were killed, but 285 others (many of them Resistance members) were able to escape. Other such raids included one on an art gallery housing personnel records at The Hague on 11 April; and one on the German Gestapo HQ at Aarhus University in Denmark on 31 October, by four waves of six Mosquitos; bombs with one-minute fuses were dropped at two-second intervals. Renewed 8th AF Deep Penetration Raids: 'Big Week' Under Operation 'Argument', in February 1944 the US 8th AF resumed deep penetration missions into Germany, the bombers now supported by P-51B long-range escort fighters. In Operation Pointblank's highly successful 'Big Week' (19-25 February), the 8th and 15th AFs flew 3,800 sorties against the German aircraft factories, with support from 5 RAF night raids. The 8th AF had now overtaken RAF Bomber Command in having the world's largest force of heavy bombers, and as the RAF were doing already, began flying co-ordinated missions against several targets at once, to split the German fighter defences. Although increasingly using blind bombing against German cities, the US continued to give priority to precision attacks on key strategic targets when the weather permitted. Favoured targets were ones the Germans would be forced to defend, notably oil plants and aircraft factories. The result wa
