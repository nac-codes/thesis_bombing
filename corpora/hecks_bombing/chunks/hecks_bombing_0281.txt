ered aircraft. But the Allied offensive then eased, due to bad weather (making precision attacks difficult) and over-optimistic interpretation of raid damage photos. Plant repairs enabled ed an increase in production, to 39,000 tons in November, so delaying defeat. Allied Use of Heavy Bombers for Invasion Support While the bombing of rail targets for 'Overlord' progressed, on 11 May the 8th AF and 2TAF also began attacks on the 40 main airfields within 150km of Caen, aiming primarily for maintenance and repair facilities. For the Normandy landings on 6 June, RAF and US heavy bombers were assigned to direct support to the landings. During the previous night, all 1,136 RAF bombers available were used to drop 5,000 tons of bombs, the largest amount ever in one night, on Atlantic Wall targets. By morning, only 1 of 10 German coastal gun batteries remained operational. On D-Day itself, the 8th AF alone despatched 882 B-17s and 409 B-24s stacked in precise formations for dawn attacks on beach targets, but early morning mist led to bombing on a Gee fix (with a safety margin), so reportedly the main casualties were cabbages inland from the beaches. More  1944 244 DAYLIGHT BOMBING OPERATIONS effective heavy bomber raids on targets in and around the beachhead followed that day and subsequently. After bombing attacks, notably against the Toulon naval base, on 13 and 14 August US 12th AF heavy bombers from Italy attacked gun emplacements, bridges, rail centres etc., in southern France in preparation for the 'Operation Dragoon' Allied landings on the 15th. Eastern Front: German Bombing; US Shuttle Missions to the USSR On the Eastern Front, c.May 1944 the Germans themselves began a daylight bombing campaign with heavy bombers, the 90 He177s of KG1. The attacks were of relatively short range against Soviet supply centres and troops rather than against strategic targets, bombing from 6,000m. Reportedly, Soviet fighter pilots treated the heavy defensive armament of the He177 with re
