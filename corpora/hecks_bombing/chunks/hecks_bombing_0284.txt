perations. Two B-29s made their first Hump cargo missions on 24 April, and in May the first B-29 tanker conversions were made, to fly fuel over the Hump. The first B-29 bombing mission, 100 aircraft attacking the Bangkok marshalling yards was made from India on 5 July. Thereafter, the initial B-29 bombing campaign from China was a night one. But the supply system was judged 'fantastically uneconomic and barely workable' [USSBS, 1945-49], and only 20 B-29 missions were flown from China, ten of them to Manchuria, nine to Japan and one to Formosa. In July, with major use of USN carrier-based air power, US forces captured Saipan and Tinian in the Marianas. These islands were within the B-29's flight radius of Tokyo, and the US 'SeaBees' (CBs) began building bases: first on Saipan; then on Tinian, the world's largest bomber base, North Field, with four parallel runways each nearly two miles long. B-29s of the 21st AF arrived on Saipan in October, on Tinian in December. Meanwhile, on 10 August, B-29s flew their first missions in what would become a major mine-laying programme. In August, LeMay revised the B-29 daylight bombing tactics, replacing the four-plane diamond formation by a 12-plane 'combat box', and introducing 'synchronous bombing' when visibility was in doubt. On 8 September, a raid by 18 Japanese bombers on Chengtu destroyed 18 B-29s. But after successful daylight B-29 reconnaissance overflights, 21st AF daylight raids against Japan were begun on 24 November, 100 B-29s being sent to bomb the Musashi engine factory near Tokyo. On 18 December, the 20th AF sent 77 B-29s to firebomb Hankow, the main supply port for Japanese forces in China; the fires burned for three days. Soviet 'ADD' Operations The Soviet 'ADD' (Long Range Aviation) grew to some 1,500 aircraft during 1944, mostly medium bombers (II-4, US A-20 and B-25) operating mainly in a tactical support role, bombing rail targets, supply dumps etc. at up to 300km beyond the front. Most raids were made in da
