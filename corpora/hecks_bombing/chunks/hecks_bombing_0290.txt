sing 50gal drop-tanks to achieve the range, LNSF Mosquitos regularly carried 4,000lb bombs to Berlin, a greater bomb load over that distance than was achieved with the four-engined B-17. [Bennett, 1958:203] To give new crews experience in navigation by H2S, on 23 December single LNSF Mosquitos began nightly nuisance 'Siren Tours' over Germany, se setting off air-raid sirens in each town they approached. Each aircraft normally dropped one 500lb bomb on each of four different towns. Bomber Command and Precision Targets; 3cm H2S; 'Controlled Oboe' Harris believed the better image resolution of the new 3cm H2S might enable Bomber Command to find and bomb the small town of Schweinfurt at night. Accordingly, after a successful USAAF daylight raid, on the night of 24 February Bomber Command mounted a much larger raid on Schweinfurt, but success was limited. For shorter ranges, raids on rail centres in Belgium and France during March confirmed the RAF's new ability to find and hit even small targets at night. In a further advance, the PFF introduced 'Controlled Oboe' in an attack on the Aulnoye marshalling yards on 10 April. Oboe Mosquitos dropped green TI's as proximity markers. Master Bombers then used flares to visually check the area around the green TIs and, having positively identified the target, dropped red TIs on it for the main force to aim at. Sometimes the RAF now achieved better accuracy than the 8th AF managed by day; individual bombing against accurately placed markers could give a closer bomb grouping than the US pattern bombing. In addition, even well camouflaged sites could usually be discovered and located by systematic PR/PI study. Once pin-pointed, such camouflaged sites were as vulnerable to Oboe raids as any other sites within range. In August, four oil dumps hidden in forest areas in France were destroyed by RAF bombing using Oboe. But despite the evident capability against 'key' targets, Harris continued to place emphasis on area bombing.  1944 252
