To divert the defences, a higher altitude force drew the flak, while Mustangs made gun and rocket attacks on the AA gun emplacements. On the night of 26 November, Tallboys were dropped in a raid on Munich, their first use against a population centre rather than against industrial or military targets. VII 1945 Bomber Developments Piston-engined Bombers With the running down of the war and the transition to turbojet power, 1945 saw a sharp drop in the number of new bomber types appearing. The new piston-engined bombers making their first flights were: the Boeing XB-44 four-engined heavy bomber (USA, May), a B-29 develop- ment which eventually became the B-50; and the Myasishchev VB-109 twin-engined bomber (USSR), flown in prototype form only. In France, with the nationalization of the Farman Co., the He274 V1 was renamed the AAS 01A, and flew post-war in December 1945. The prototype of the Japanese Army's Kawasaki Ki-91 four-engined heavy bomber was nearing completion at the end of the war; it had a pressure cabin, and an exceptionally heavy defensive armament of ten 20mm cannon. Bombers entering service in 1945 included the Conso- lidated B-32 and Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. Among technology developments, a power boosted side 'formation stick' introduced on B-17Gs helped reduce pilot fatigue in holding a tight formation on a long raid. US advances with fire prevention and fire extinguishing on B-17s and B-24s involved venting of wing tanks and purging with inert gases (CO2, nitrogen, methyl bromide, and engine exhaust gases). Also in the USA, experiments were made with dropping small bombs from a Sikorsky R-4 helicopter. In Japan, trials began with turbosupercharged engines fitted to G4M3 bombers. In Britain, a Bristol turret with two 20mm cannon was being progressed for the Lincoln. In Germany, the Mistel composite aircraft/missile concept was adapted to provide the Fuhrungsmaschine, a much-stretched Ju88H-4 manned long-range pathfinder aircraft carrying pick-a-bac
