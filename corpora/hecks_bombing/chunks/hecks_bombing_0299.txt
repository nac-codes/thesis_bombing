thickness of concrete protecting major installations in response to the Tallboy, the British developed the full Barnes Wallis bomb, the 25ft 6in long, 22,000lb MC or DP/HE 'Grand Slam'. To carry this largest operational HE bomb of the war, 617 Sqdn Lancasters needed a strengthened u/c, fuselage and bomb-bay main beams, and removal of the bomb doors. After one prior test drop the previous day, a Grand Slam was first used against the Bielefeld viaduct on 14 March 1945. The subterranean explosion caused seven arches of the  1945 260 WEAPON DEVELOPMENTS viaduct to disappear downwards - a neat demonstration of Barnes Wallis's theory. In total, 41 Grand Slams were dropped by the RAF on German targets. A few US B-29s were modified to carry a Grand Slam under each inboard wing. No operational drops were made, however B-29s carrying a Grand Slam semi-buried in the front bomb-bay were used in post-war bombing tests against German defence structures. The US Smith Corp., manufacturers of the Tallboy and Grand Slam for Britain, also scaled up the Grand Slam to produce an experimental 45,000lb version, almost certainly the largest bomb of the war but not used operationally. [Huskinson, 1949:191] The US 4,000lb Mk.63 unpowered AP bomb also appeared in 1945, too late for operational use; an 8,000lb version was cancelled. For use against smaller concrete emplacements, the little-known Ko-Dan bomb exploited 'Kobayashi's prin- ciple'. The front half of the case was of 2mm thick rubber and the explosive charge was in the form of small balls, so that at impact, the whole front of the bomb squashed flat against the target surface, giving a large increase in contact area during detonation. A Ko-Dan of 85kg was expected to equal a 250kg conventional bomb, but despite much experimental work, it may not have reached operational use. Bomb Proximity Fuses With no gun-barrel discharge acceleration involved, proximity fuses for bombs were easier to develop than those for shells. They were usabl
