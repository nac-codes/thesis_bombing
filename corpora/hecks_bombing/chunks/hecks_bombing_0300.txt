t may not have reached operational use. Bomb Proximity Fuses With no gun-barrel discharge acceleration involved, proximity fuses for bombs were easier to develop than those for shells. They were usable to give detonation prior to impact, for maximum blast damage and shrapnel spread, e.g. for AA suppression. The Japanese had introduced a photoelectric fuse in 1944, used on 250 and 800kg bombs to cause detonation 10-15m above ground; it transmitted light pulses and detected the return, and was usable in daylight as well as at night. [USSBS, 1945-49:No.63] In Britain, the No.44 Air Burst Pistol was successfully used with the 500lb MC bomb in night flare attacks on German troop convoys. Other than for air-to-air bombing, the Germans developed at least two bomb proximity fuses. The acoustic BAZ55A was usable when bombs were dropped in sticks, the first bomb detonating on impact, the noise of the explosion then detonating the second bomb in mid-air, and so on. The Zunder-19 was apparently a radio fuse for single bomb use, 261 and with its relatively high detonation altitude of 30m, may have been intended for chemical bombs. Beginning with 7th AF attacks on Iwo Jima in February 1945, US forces used the AA-shell VT radio proximity fuse in GP, fragmentation and napalm bombs. One USMC Corsair squadron was blown to bits when its VT-fused bombs were armed incorrectly and triggered by the aircraft themselves at release. US Guided- and Glide-bombs In the USA, two new radio-guided free-fall bombs appeared, the 1,000lb VB-3 and 2,000lb VB-4 'Razon' bombs. As the added 'R' in the name denoted, these had control in range as well as azimuth. The first homing free-fall bomb, the 1,000lb VB-5 used an optical seeker based on image contrast; another, the 1,000lb VB-6 'Felix' used an IR seeker. 'Dove', the Navy Bomb Mark 64 project for an IR-homing M65 1,000lb GP bomb was also under way in 1945. None of these later guided bombs reached service by the end of the war. Air Force GB-series gli
