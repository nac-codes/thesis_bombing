aircraft and automatically release the bombs. 'Rebecca-H', used by 2TAF Mosquitos, was based on the British Rebecca/Eureka radio homing system, using an onboard Rebecca set to determine the aircraft's position relative to two Eureka-H mobile ground beacons. New US airborne radars of 1945 included: (on B-29s) the AN/APQ-13 ground imaging set, with a ventral radome; (on B-29Bs, B-17s and B-24s) the AN/APQ-7 'Eagle' ground imaging set, synchronizing with the Norden bombsight, and using a wide high-definition scanner in a 17ft span wing-like ventral housing, pivoted for 45-degree scan; (on B-17s, experimentally) the AN/APA-46 'Nosmo' equipment pro- viding for synchronization of H2X radar inputs with the Norden sight; (on B-29s) the SCR-729 radar interrogator system to give the range and bearing of any aircraft interrogated. In Britain, H2S improvements under develop- ment included a large (6ft) scanner named 'Whirlygig', and a K-band (1.25cm) Mk. VI version of H2S, code-named 'Lion Tamer'. Neither reached service by the end of the war. The Germans had provided details of the 'Rotterdam Ger√§t' to the Japanese in 1944, but Japanese ground imaging sets had not reached service when the war ended. In 1944, RAF and 8th AF bombers had begun flying 'radarscope missions', obtaining photos of H2S/H2X radar images of cities, landfall points and navigation way points, for use in future raid planning and crew familiarization. For  1945 264 GROUND-ATTACK DEVELOPMENTS D-Day, US B-17s had obtained radarscope photos of much of the northern coastline of France. In 1945, radarscope reconnaissance was exploited by the USAAF in the Pacific theatre, with a first B-29 radarscope sortie over Japan on the night of 4 March 1945, seven B-29s bombing Nagoya from 26,000ft while an eighth one bombed from 7,000ft and then loitered to obtain some 30 good quality radar photos. Beginning on the night of 5 May, radarscope missions were flown by single 'Eagle' B-29B aircraft using the new AN/APQ-7 'Eagle'
