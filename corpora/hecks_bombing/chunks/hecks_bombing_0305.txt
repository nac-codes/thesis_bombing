unwinding as it fell away. The Japanese response 265 was to develop radar sets operating on even longer wavelengths. The principal new offensive use of RCM came with four B-29 RCM conversions, known as 'Angels' or 'porcupines' from their aerials. These aircraft were required to arrive over the target first and remain throughout the bombing, jamming the Japanese R/T communications and searchlight and AA radars. Some of the rope strips used were 400ft long. [Birdsall, 1981:206] The 'Angels' first operated on the night of 1 July 1945, during a raid on Kure. Ground-attack Developments, Techniques and Operations Ground-attack Aircraft and Weapons; German Adaptations for Large Bombs By early 1945, the Soviets were working on the Tupolev Tu-2Sh, a heavy Shturmovik version of the Tu-2 twin- engined bomber, with a 57mm anti-tank cannon in the nose; it appeared post-war. In March, construction began on the Henschel Hs132 prone-pilot turbojet-powered dive-bomber, but the prototype did not reach completion. Among modifications for ground attack, some US A-26 Invaders were given an extra eight 0.5-inch guns in underwing packs, plus provision for locking the upper barbette to fire forward under pilot control; this gave a total of 18 forward firing guns. Also impressive, the Japanese devised a unique gun installation on the Yokosuka P1Y1-S Ginga, consisting of no fewer than 17 Type 99 20mm cannon in oblique/downward configuration in the bomb bay, 12 angled forward, 5 to the rear. At the end of the war, some 30 aircraft with this installation were being prepared to make attacks on US airfields in the Marianas, to wipe out the B-29 fleet in single, low-level passes. US ground-attack RP innovations included AF use of VT proximity-fused HVAR rockets in Europe, and limited Navy use of the huge 11.75-inch Tiny Tim anti-shipping RP against concrete emplacements in Okinawa. In Britain, Hurricanes were used for firing trials  1945 266 GROUND-ATTACK DEVELOPMENTS with the 500lb warhead Long
