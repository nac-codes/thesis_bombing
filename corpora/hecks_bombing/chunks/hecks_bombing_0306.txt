In Britain, Hurricanes were used for firing trials  1945 266 GROUND-ATTACK DEVELOPMENTS with the 500lb warhead Long Tom RP. Of all the combatants, the Germans went furthest in trying to make small fighter-bombers carry large bombs: first a Bf109G with a tall, jettisonable rear undercarriage leg to allow ground clearance for a SC500 bomb; then a few Fw190Gs carrying single SB1000 and SC1000 bombs, with the lower fin cut away to provide ground clearance. Now several Fw190G-1s of NSG20 were adapted to carry the 1,800kg SC1800 bomb, the largest carried operationally by a single-seat single-engine fighter during the war. Although stripped, the aircraft required special tyres and a very long take-off run. On 7 March, the Fw190s dropped 1,800kg bombs in attempts to destroy the US-held Remagen bridge over the Rhine, the attacks being foiled by Allied fighters and flak. Operation Bodenplatte; Night Jet Bombers; Pathfinder Aircraft On New Year's Day 1945, the Luftwaffe mounted Operation Bodenplatte, its last major ground attack operation of the war. It was preceded by two Ar234Bs making the first jet bomber night raid, dropping bombs on Brussels and Li√®ge as a cover for what was in reality a weather reconnaissance mission for Bodenplatte. Some 800 fighters and fighter-bombers, including 20 Me262s, took off in darkness for a surprise dawn attack on 13 British and 4 US-held airfields in France and the Low Countries. Initial navigation was aided by coloured smoke and by pyrotechnic markers fired by AA guns, while searchlights showed the location of airfields for emergency landings. Each unit was guided by Ju88 or Do17 pathfinder aircraft, and flew in radio silence at low level to avoid radar detection. Surprise was achieved. The Germans were to claim 439 Allied aircraft destroyed on the airfields, but on the way there and back around 100 of the German aircraft were shot down by the Luftwaffe's ow
