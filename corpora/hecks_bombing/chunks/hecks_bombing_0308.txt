. For the offensive in East Prussia, the Soviets again made extensive use of a concealed build-up, with dummy airfields, and radio stations simulating an Air Army HQ and its units. Later, to begin the assault on Berlin on 16 April, relays of VVS fighters laid and maintained a 240-mile long smokescreen to conceal Soviet troops crossing the Oder at 150 points. Eventually, Soviet fighters and ground-attack aircraft were operating from the German autobahnen. On 9 May, Soviet Il-2 Shturmoviks and US P-38 fighter-bombers carried out the first and only joint tactical air operation by the two forces, attacking a German armoured column heading West (actually with the intention of surrendering to the Americans).

Features of the campaign included: in January, amphibious landings on Ramree Island, supported by Hurricane-laid smokescreens and Mitchell and Thunderbolt bombing strikes; close 'Earthquake Major' heavy and 'Earthquake Minor' medium bombing operations to dislodge Japanese troops well dug in at the front; spectacular HE and napalm close support attacks, giving ground troops a tendency 'to watch the exhibition rather than to get on with the attack'; night 'Rhubarbs', with aircraft u
