dug in at the front; spectacular HE and napalm close support attacks, giving ground troops a tendency 'to watch the exhibition rather than to get on with the attack'; night 'Rhubarbs', with aircraft using their landing lights to aid the attacks, Japanese vehicles being now mostly hidden by day with fuel tanks drained to reduce the risk of fire if attacked; in February, night 'Cloak' operations, with Beaufighters dropping dummy paratroops, automatic Very lights, and 'canned battle' flash and noise simulators to distract the Japanese, plus use of aircraft noise to drown troop and tank movements; in March, the use of a Master Bomber to direct bomb and rocket attacks against the earth walls of Fort Dufferin at Mandalay; on 15 March, a 1,600-mile round trip by 40 USAAF P-51s, destroying 26 Japanese aircraft at Don Mouang in Siam; and in May, the parachuting of VCPs, men and equipment behind enemy lines for ground attack near Rangoon. With aircrew lost over the jungle mostly disappearing without trace, some Allied fighter-bombers undertook AJSR (Air Jungle Search and Rescue) sorties when aircraft were missing, to search and drop emergency supplies while rescue was organized. German Night Ground-attack Operations With enemy fighters omnipresent during daylight hours, by early 1945 the Germans had extended the use of Fw190s and Ju87s in Nachtslachtgruppen for night ground-attack 269 operations on the Eastern Front and in Italy. Sorties were made singly at low altitude to avoid night fighters, climbing over the target for a dive attack. For front-line operations, flare illumination by ground units was used to mark the target; otherwise operations were carried out under moonlit conditions. Dive-bombing with the Fw190 involved over- flying the target, rolling upside down and pulling through an effective second half of a loop, releasing the bombs at 40 degrees using the Revi gunsight; or more usually, flying to one side of the target and making a banked turning dive so as to ke
