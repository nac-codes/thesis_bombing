ar Direction In February 1945, the US 8th AF revised its bomber formation yet again, recognizing the near elimination of the German fighter force, but increased strength of the Flak units. The basic Group was changed from 3 squadrons of 12 aircraft to 4 of 9 aircraft, and these were spread further in height to reduce the AA threat. Also in February, the 8th AF began using its Mosquitos as command aircraft on bombing raids, one aircraft carrying the task force commander to the target, to monitor and direct the raid by R/T. Later, a specially lightened B-17 was introduced as a 'Command Scout' staff aircraft. This flew on raids to France on 15 April and Dresden on 17 April, joining each combat box as it crossed the target. By February, the PFF's daylight marking (including for close support) had improved by the introduction of non-illuminating TIs. The 250lb 'Coloured Smoke' TI ground marker burned for eight minutes, the red, blue, green or yellow smoke remaining visible thereafter until dispersed by the wind. Later a 1,000lb version was introduced. On 2 March, 858 RAF bombers supported the Rhine crossing by attacking German armour at Cologne, using ground marking by Smoke Puffs dropped by Oboe Mosquitos. [Musgrove, 1976:176] For daylight sky marking in overcast conditions, a parachute-dropped 'Skymarker Puff' TI floater ejected coloured powder in mid-air to form a red, blue, green or yellow puff. One offensive use of the huge US AN/CPS-1 MEW (Microwave Early Warning) ground radar introduced in autumn 1944, was for the tracking of Allied fighter- bombers, enabling voice instruction from a ground controller to direct them to the target area for visual search and attack, and to guide them back to base afterwards. Now  1945 272 DAYLIGHT BOMBING in 1945, the shorter ranged (30 miles) but more accurate US SCR-584 radar could be used for blind bombing if need be, a bomb-release instruction being given if cloud prevailed. Most such attacks were made by US 9th AF bombers, but
