miles) but more accurate US SCR-584 radar could be used for blind bombing if need be, a bomb-release instruction being given if cloud prevailed. Most such attacks were made by US 9th AF bombers, but on 8 February RAF Typhoons used the technique for high-level bombing in the Cleve area. [Franks, 1979:197] The Allied Operation 'Clarion'; US Medium-bomber Operations On 22 February 1945, the Allies began Operation 'Clarion' the systematic destruction of German road and rail transport. Some 9,000 RAF and US aircraft participated, including heavy, medium, and fighter-bombers, plus covering fighters. Within days around 90 per cent of the German transport capability had been eliminated. The US 9th AF medium bombers alone flew 17,847 sorties in 37 days. Many of the raids were blind, led by B-26 pathfinders, mostly using Oboe but at times relying variously on Gee, SCR-584, Shoran, and even dead-reckoning.

With the German day fighter force now all but annihilated, the RAF now also undertook large-scale daylight raids into Germany. On 11 March, some 1,055 Lancasters, Halifaxes and Mosquitos dropped 4,700 tons of bombs in a daylight sky-marked raid on Essen; the only fighters seen were the Spitfire and Mustang escorts. On 12 March, 1,107 Lancasters and Halifaxes dropped 4,851 tons on Dortmund in the heaviest single raid of the war. On 18 March, 1,221 8th AF B-17s and B-24s, escorted by 632 fighters, made the heaviest raid on Berlin, dropping 4,000 tons of bombs. The heaviest 8th AF raid of the war followed on 7 April, 1,300 bombers attacking Dessau. On 18 April, 978 Lancasters, Halifaxes and Mosquitos inflicted huge destruction on Heligoland and DÃ¼nne.
