apanese fighter force could offer little opposition to large-scale daylight B-29 raids, the P-51 escorts were able to drop down low for strafing attacks. On 16 April, P-51s from Iwo Jima made the first of 33 sweeps over Japan, attacking airfields, factories and transport targets; usually a formation of P-51s was guided there and back by a B-29 'navigation ship'. The Hiroshima A-bomb Raid In May 1945, the US 509th Group moved to Tinian Island in the Marianas. Training now included lone high-altitude flights over Japan, to accustom the Japanese to single B-29 overflights apparently on weather or reconnaissance missions and not justifying defence action. In July the 'Little Boy' bomb, without its 235U 'ring', was secretly transported to Tinian by the cruiser USS Indianapolis. The ring was taken separately, by a 509th transport aircraft. On 25 July, incoming US President H.Truman formally ordered the dropping of A-bombs on Japan. On 5 August, the 'Little Boy' 235U bomb was hoisted from a special pit into B-29 'Enola Gay' (named after Tibbets' mother). With Tibbets in command, the aircraft took off in the early hours, preceded by three weather-scout B-29s, and followed by two further B-29s, carrying monitoring and photographic equipment, plus several SB-29 rescue aircraft. The bomb was armed in flight. Most crew members were not told of the nature of the weapon until close to the target. All were given dark polaroid goggles for protection against the flash; and reportedly, Tibbets carried cyanide pills for all crew members, should the aircraft be brought down over Japan. [Thomas and Witts, 1977:300] At 8.15 a.m. on 6 August 1945, the first operational drop of an A-bomb was made, over the Japanese city and military base of Hiroshima. The 277 bomb, decorated with impolite graffiti, was released at 30,000ft, aimed using the Norden sight. As it fell away, the escorting scientific monitoring B-29 (named 'The Great Artiste' and flown by Maj. C. Sweeney) dropped three canisters
