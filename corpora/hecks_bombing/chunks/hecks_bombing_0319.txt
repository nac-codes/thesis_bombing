The bomb exploded at 1,850ft altitude, destroying 62,000 buildings, and killing or mortally wounding some 80,000 people, one third of whom were soldiers. The B-29s themselves were hit violently by two shock waves (one direct, one reflected from the ground), each fully visible travelling at the speed of sound.
