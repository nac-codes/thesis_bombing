d on Kobe on 3 February, another on Tokyo on 23 February; neither was decisive, despite the largely wood-built Japanese houses. A more positive approach was thought necessary. Noting Intelligence reports that Japanese cities had few medium AA guns protecting them from attacks at lower altitude, LeMay ordered a change to night area fire-bombing from intermediate altitude (8,000ft), enabling three times the bomb load to be carried. In the ETO, the USAAF had argued that a change to night bombing would represent a major upheaval, needing extensive retraining. Now, in the Pacific, such a change was implemented with little difficulty. The first night raid was made by 170 B-29s against Tokyo on the night of 25 February. With Japanese night defences minimal, the B-29s were stripped of their defensive armour and all except tail guns in order to increase the bomb load still further. But in a 281 night attack on Nagoya on 11 March, B-29 tail gunners carried additional ammunition for use against ground searchlights. On later missions, this defence suppression role was extended. Some B-29s, retaining all guns and full ammunition but with reduced bomb load, flew at below 3,000ft just ahead of the main force, to shoot out searchlights. The new 'Eagle' B-29B high-altitude night bomber had only tail guns-fitted, but these used the AN/APG-15B gun laying radar. The B-29B flew its first mission, a radarscope sortie, on 5 May. The B-29Bs typically bombed individually, with altitude separation on three converging tracks. If an aircraft was found by a radar-directed searchlight, it dropped 'rope' and used full throttle to accelerate and so leave the flak bursts behind. In July 1945, some B-29B crews began painting the undersides of their aircraft black. After it was found that Japanese searchlights tended to follow only unpainted aircraft, a dark paint scheme was generally adopted.
