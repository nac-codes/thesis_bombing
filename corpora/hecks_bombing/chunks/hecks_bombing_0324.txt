lights tended to follow only unpainted aircraft, a dark paint scheme was generally adopted. Limited US Use of Night Precision Attacks In Europe, the US 9th AF's 410th Bomb Group began precision night bombing operations on 1 February, using black-painted medium bombers and RAF-type pathfinder techniques. But after four such raids, further ones were judged unnecessary. The last of the four, against the Hildesheim marshalling yards on 24 February, used the evolved tactics: flare illumination (103 flares dropped by 7 B-26s); target marking using red, green and yellow TIs (14 TIs dropped at low altitude by two A-26s - the Master Bomber and Master Marker); individual bombing of the TIs from medium altitude (34 A-20s dropping 5001b GP bombs), under instruction from the Master Bomber. In the Pacific, advocated by Gen. H.H. Arnold, the USAAF made a few attempts at precision night bombing attacks on Japan by B-29 heavy bombers using pathfinder techniques. In particular, use was made of proximity flares, dropped using ground-imaging radar, enabling visual marking of specific targets by M69 incendiaries for the main  1945 282 Summing Up force to aim at. The first such raid was on the night of 24 March, 250 B-29s attacking the Mitsubishi factory at Nagoya, but cloud prevented accurate marking. After several further smaller attempts, LeMay reverted to area bombing. The Tokyo Firestorm Raid; Homing and Observation Aircraft On the night of 9 March, 334 B-29s, dropping 2,000 tons of incendiaries, attacked Tokyo in 'the most devastating air attack in history, not excluding the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki'. [MacIsaac, 1976:106] A US pathfinding innovation was first used on this raid. As an aid to inexperienced crews, several 'homing aircraft' were employed to precede the main force by 20 minutes and loiter over the target area to provide homing signals to guide main force aircraft to it. These aircraft were fully armed B-29s, carrying extra fuel plus a dedicated radio and radio
