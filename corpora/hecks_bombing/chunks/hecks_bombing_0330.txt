g. Although the Germans had no prior experience to follow, critics were to argue that the bombing policy was misguided; Britain's Achilles' heel was its reliance on maritime supply, and its defeat might have been obtained by diverting Luftwaffe bomber capacity to supporting the highly effective U-boat operations against Allied shipping. The Bombing of Britain The Bombing of Germany The RAF and USAAF dropped 955,000 and 395,000 tons of bombs respectively, on Germany during the war; of these, 430,000 and 80,000 tons respectively fell on populated areas, killing 590,000 civilians. Critics of the Allied bombing, especially the (mainly British) area bombing, have pointed to the increase in German war production despite the bombing, and argued that - morality aside - it was perverse 287 to devote such huge resources to attacking German civilians instead of the military; and that it starved other aspects of the war effort, even prolonging the war by delaying provision of mat√©riel for the invasion. [Rumpf, 1963:210] Supporters of the bombing claimed that it: provided a 'second front' to support the USSR when there was no other way of doing so; tied down two million people in Germany on AA defence; forced the Germans to build fighters and AA guns rather than bombers and artillery, to keep large fighter forces in Germany, and to divert vital resources to 'retaliation weapons'; forced the dispersion of industry, aggravating Germany's labour shortage and reducing quality (through poor materials and manual work instead of mass production); and ensured that even at its peak, German war production did not reach World War One levels. Others point to the consequences for the Axis powers of their inability to mount strategic air strikes against the sources and supply lines from US and Soviet production centres; and to the more obviously decisive US bombing of Japan. But greater concentration on the destruction of rail and oil targets, once it became possible in 1943, would probably h
