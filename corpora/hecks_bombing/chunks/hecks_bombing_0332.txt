Eastern Front differed from that elsewhere in that the air power on both sides was used almost exclusively in direct support to the huge land war. On both sides, most aircraft losses were to enemy AA. Eastern Front Bombing The Germans had expected a quick blitzkrieg victory without needing long-range bombing, but had grossly underestimated the strength and resilience of the Soviet armed forces, Soviet industrial capacity, and their own supply difficulties. The German medium-bomber force had been weaker at the start of Barbarossa than at the start of the Battle of Britain, and was steadily frittered away by diversion to ground attack and transport operations. A German view is that ' ... the reason for Germany's defeat at the hands of the Russian giant was the fact that she made no attempt to carry out strategic air warfare'. [Faber, 1979:219] Expediency had overruled; Germany had become fully stretched in a multi-front war. The Soviet air effort was far greater, increasing steadily as the war progressed. But although increasing air superiority gradually allowed a greater range of options away from pure expediency, it was Stalin's will that the air power usage remained largely the same; mostly close support, with few offensive fighter sweeps, limited interdiction in the enemy's rear, mostly at small scale (no saturation bombing), and almost no strategic bombing except at the end. In line with this policy, it seems the Soviets made little effort to develop advanced navigation, marking and bombing aids them- 289 selves, or to make much use of equipment (e.g. the Norden sight) supplied under Lend-Lease. Even the long-range ADD 'confined itself to cooperation with the Red Army'. [Baumbach, 1986:159] The Soviets dropped a total of 660,000 tons of bombs during the 'Great Patriotic War'. CWIBW: The Weapon in Reserve Only the Japanese made much use of chemical weapons during the war, and only against the Chinese who were unable to retaliate. Hard evidence for German and Alli
