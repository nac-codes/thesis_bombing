rshall (Army), King (Navy) and Arnold (Air Force) -  Bibliography SUMMING UP had all resisted the use of the Bomb [Kurzman, 1986:364], at least without a prior demonstration to the Japanese; and LeMay believed that a few more weeks of conventional bombing would finish Japan anyway, albeit with greater civilian casualties than the two A-bombs would give. But political factors overruled. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks made plain to the world the destructiveness of the new weapons. A marriage of nuclear weapons with the ballistic missile had already been foreseen, and once the Soviet aim of acquiring nuclear weapons was appreciated, US work on far more powerful thermonuclear weapons restarted.
