id By 1943, the Soviets were using fewer escort fighters, reassigning them to other duties; to compensate, the bombers flew in larger groups of 50 to 60. But Soviet tactical bombing at the front now included the use of escorted Pe-8 heavy bombers, some against German tank concentrations prior to the Kursk battle. Forewarned by Intelligence, on 5 July (the first day of the German Kursk offensive) the Soviets mounted their largest bombing raid yet, an attempted dawn pre-emptive strike at five Luftwaffe bases near Kharkov, all crowded with aircraft for the offensive. But the raid became a disaster that 40 years later was still not recognized in Soviet war histories. The 400 bombers of the VVS 2nd and 17th Air Armies were detected by German radar, and met by waves of Bf109s. Some 120 bombers were shot down, and few others got through to bomb the target airfields. [Hardesty, 1982:159] The Finnish bomber force of four squadrons had remained committed to the support of ground forces1943 194 DAYLIGHT BOMBING OPERATIONS throughout the Continuation War, but with increasing losses to Soviet AA and fighters. On 19 September, a rare major raid was attempted, a unique mix of 30 Ju88, Do17, Blenheim and Ilyushin DB-3 bombers being despatched to attack the Soviet base on Lavansaari Island. But in poor weather, few crews found the target. The US Ploesti Oil Refinery Raid On 1 August 1943, the 9th AF in North Africa mounted Operation 'Tidal Wave', a one-off large-scale daylight low-level attack on seven individual targets in the Rumanian oilfields at Ploesti. Only unescorted B-24s had sufficient range, the flight being made at low level to avoid early radar detection. Low-level bombing was practised beforehand For the raid, the 179 B-24s flew from airfields s near Benghazi, in two formations. But the defences were ready thanks to the decoding of a US radio message and, in part' because of a delay when the lead group made a turn at the wrong landmark. The B-24s formed large, slow and
