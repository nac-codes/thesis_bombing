de by Mosquito aircraft in a raid on Aachen on 7 October 1943. The first use by Lancasters in a major raid (589 aircraft on DÃ¼sseldorf) followed on 3 November. Following criticism that H2S had not been tried for blind bombing directly (as opposed to blind marking), on 17 November 83 PFF aircraft attacked Ludwigshafen, all using H2S for blind bombing; no markers were carried, and the decoy TIs lit by the Germans were ignored. The first attempt at a large scale RAF night raid without PFF marking did not come until 12 August 1944, when only 23 of the 373 H2S-equipped heavy bombers1944 216 WEAPON DEVELOPMENTS see major use during the war was the VB-1. This was a 1,000lb M44 bomb with a new tail assembly having control surfaces and actuators, a vertical gyro for roll stabilization, a radio receiver, and a tracking flare. Named 'Azon' (for AZimuth ONly), it was controllable in direction (left or right), but not in range (undershoot or overshoot), the latter being much more difficult to judge anyway. This made it advantageous for long, narrow targets like bridges, the attack being made in line with the target. It gave much greater accuracy than an unguided bomb, but training proved difficult. First used by 8th AF B-24s on 31 May 1944. the Azon was soon rejected for the European Theatre of Operations (ETO) because of frequent cloud plus bomber vulnerability to flak; for controllability the Azon needed to be released at intermediate height. However, the VB-1 was later successfully used by the 7th and 14th AFs, against bridges and viaducts in south-east Asia. The VB-2 was a 2,000lb version. US and German Glide-bombs The US Aeronca-built GB-1 winged pre-set glide bomb was a 2,200lb stand-off weapon intended to enable bombers to attack a target from outside the range of most flak units protecting the target; but without active guidance its accuracy was poor. It used a 20001b M34 GP bomb, with a 12-ft span twin-finned airframe. B-17 bombers carried a GB-1 under each wing. In the
