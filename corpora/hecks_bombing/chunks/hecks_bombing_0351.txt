nits protecting the target; but without active guidance its accuracy was poor. It used a 20001b M34 GP bomb, with a 12-ft span twin-finned airframe. B-17 bombers carried a GB-1 under each wing. In the first operational use, 58 8th AF B-17s launched over 100 GB-1 'Grapefruit' at a Cologne marshal- ling yard on 28 May 1944, but most were dropped early because of the fierce AA fire and so impacted short of the target. Of the other GB-series glide bombs, only the GB-4 saw service in the war, becoming the first operational guided weapon to use TV. The 2,500lb GB-4 used the GB-1's airframe, with a nose-mounted vidicon camera for TV- assisted radio-command guidance from the launching air- craft. Under Operation 'Batty', the 388th BG at Fersfield launched two GB-4s against E-boat pens at Le Havre on 13 August, four others against targets in France and Germany up to 13 September, but operational difficulties proved severe. The German Blohm und Voss Bv226 (later Bv246) Hagel- korn was a high-performance guided glide bomb of 217 sailplane-like configuration for shallow glide angle and hence long range, but heavy (with reinforced concrete wings) for high speed. The range was 200km if released at 10,500m altitude. Carrier aircraft included the He111 and Fw190. Guidance systems tried included radio command, an IR homer, and eventually the Radieschen radio homer - the latter for attacking Allied 'Loran' transmitters. Many test rounds were launched by Fw190Fs from Karlshagen in 1944, but it did not reach operational use. Planned developments included a CW version. Chemical Weapon Developments: a Third Nerve Gas By 1944, the German stockpile of nerve gas weapons included 12,000 tons of tabun-filled aircraft bombs. During 1944 the Germans developed 'soman' (fluoromethylpina- colyloxyphosphine oxide), a third nerve gas. It was more lethal than sarin but also much more persistent, and again difficult to make. Little had been produced by the end of the war. In Britain, Churchill briefly
