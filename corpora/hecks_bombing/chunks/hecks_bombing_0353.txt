s. Meanwhile however, botulinus toxin - rated as the most virulent BW agent of the war [Hersh: 12,97] - was also isolated, at Fort Detrick in 1944. Eight ounces of the agent, distributed appropriately, could wipe out the world's population; and it was non-persistent, being destroyed by 12 hours of exposure to air, so avoiding the uncontrollability of most BW agents. Allied chiefs feared that the German V-1 flying bomb might be used to launch botulinus toxin into British cities, and the arrival of V-1s with only HE warheads came as some relief. German Work on an HE/Thermonuclear Bomb Early in 1944, under Dr K. Diebner, the German weapons establishment at Kummersdorf carried out experiments towards an HE/thermonuclear bomb. The tests used conventional explosive surrounding a silver spherical container filled with deuterium. It was hoped that the melting silver and converging shock waves generated by the explosion would momentarily achieve the enormous temperatures and pressures needed to cause nuclear fusion (hydrogen atoms forming helium) with great release of energy. Success at small scale would be shown by radioactivity after the experiment, but none was found and the programme was abandoned. In mid-1944, the appear- ance of extra-large craters (presumably from the RAF's 'Tallboy' bombs) led to German fears that the Allies might themselves have developed an HE/Thermonuclear bomb, perhaps using hollow-charge explosive. Technicians with Geiger-MÃ¼ller counters examined the craters, but found no radioactivity. [Irving, 1967:216, 226] In November, the Allies became concerned at major construction at sites around Hechingen, the centre for German nuclear physics. The plants were quickly found to be for the extraction of oil Navigation, Blind Bombing, Radar and Countermeasures Navigation: German use of 'Gee'; SS Loran; H2S and Fishpond With their own beam systems jammed, in 1944 the Germans made limited use of the British 'Gee' to navigate on raids over Britain.
