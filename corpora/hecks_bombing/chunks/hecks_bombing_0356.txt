170 B-29s against Tokyo on the night of 25 February. With Japanese night defences minimal, the B-29s were stripped of their defensive armour and all except tail guns in order to increase the bomb load still further. But in a 281 night attack on Nagoya on 11 March, B-29 tail gunners carried additional ammunition for use against ground searchlights. On later missions, this defence suppression role was extended. Some B-29s, retaining all guns and full ammunition but with reduced bomb load, flew at below 3,000ft just ahead of the main force, to shoot out searchlights. The new 'Eagle' B-29B high-altitude night bomber had only tail guns-fitted, but these used the AN/APG-15B gun laying radar. The B-29B flew its first mission, a radarscope sortie, on 5 May. The B-29Bs typically bombed individually, with altitude separation on three converging tracks. If an aircraft was found by a radar-directed searchlight, it dropped 'rope' and used full throttle to accelerate and so leave the flak bursts behind. In July 1945, some B-29B crews began painting the undersides of their aircraft black. After it was found that Japanese searchlights tended to follow only unpainted aircraft, a dark paint scheme was generally adopted. Limited US Use of Night Precision Attacks In Europe, the US 9th AF's 410th Bomb Group began precision night bombing operations on 1 February, using black-painted medium bombers and RAF-type pathfinder techniques. But after four such raids, further ones were judged unnecessary. The last of the four, against the Hildesheim marshalling yards on 24 February, used the evolved tactics: flare illumination (103 flares dropped by 7 B-26s); target marking using red, green and yellow TIs (14 TIs dropped at low altitude by two A-26s - the Master Bomber and Master Marker); individual bombing of the TIs from medium altitude (34 A-20s dropping 5001b GP bombs), under instruction from the Master Bomber. In the Pacific, advocated by Gen. H.H. Arnold, the USAAF made a few attempts at p
