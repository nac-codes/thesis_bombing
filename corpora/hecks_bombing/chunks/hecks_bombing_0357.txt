bombing of the TIs from medium altitude (34 A-20s dropping 5001b GP bombs), under instruction from the Master Bomber. In the Pacific, advocated by Gen. H.H. Arnold, the USAAF made a few attempts at precision night bombing attacks on Japan by B-29 heavy bombers using pathfinder techniques. In particular, use was made of proximity flares, dropped using ground-imaging radar, enabling visual marking of specific targets by M69 incendiaries for the main1945 282 Summing Up force to aim at. The first such raid was on the night of 24 March, 250 B-29s attacking the Mitsubishi factory at Nagoya, but cloud prevented accurate marking. After several further smaller attempts, LeMay reverted to area bombing. The Tokyo Firestorm Raid; Homing and Observation Aircraft On the night of 9 March, 334 B-29s, dropping 2,000 tons of incendiaries, attacked Tokyo in 'the most devastating air attack in history, not excluding the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki'. [MacIsaac, 1976:106] A US pathfinding innovation was first used on this raid. As an aid to inexperienced crews, several 'homing aircraft' were employed to precede the main force by 20 minutes and loiter over the target area to provide homing signals to guide main force aircraft to it. These aircraft were fully armed B-29s, carrying extra fuel plus a dedicated radio and radio operator, but no bomb load. The attack itself was made by marking with M47 incendiaries and using a fan approach to improve coverage. The raid was hugely destructive, later crews aiming not at the fires but at black areas among the fires. Some 15 square miles of Tokyo, almost four times the area to be devastated by the A-bomb at Hiroshima, were destroyed in a great firestorm caused by the clustered, napalm-filled M69 incendiaries. The US bombers were tossed and raised by the violent thermal updraughts, crews could feel the intense heat, and some vomited at the stench of burning flesh. The death toll was 78,660 in the official Japanese estimate, probably nearer 13
