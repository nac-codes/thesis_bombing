inspiration today. I have chosen the term 'liberal conscience', for the word 'conscience' implies not simply a belief or an attitude but also an inner compulsion to act upon it. And by 'liberals' I mean in general all those thinkers who believe the world to be profoundly other than it should be, and who have faith in the power of human reason and human action to change it, so that the inner potential of all human beings can be more fully realised. This excludes on the one hand those conservatives who accept the world as it unalterably is and adjust to it with more or less of good grace; and on the other those disciples of Karl Marx and other determinists who see men as trapped in predicaments from which they can be rescued only by historical processes, which they may understand but are powerless to control. It is a definition which today would probably cover almost the entire range of political thinkers in Britain and the United States. But it was a doctrine which sprang from obscure roots and took many centuries to grow to its present maturity. 2 Garibldi's Defence of the Roman Republic (London 1907).

But even those who saw it as evil normally considered it a necessary evil; one for which responsi- bility lay elsewhere, which was part of God's purpose for the world, or an indispensable activity in preserving or extending one's creed and culture. Such has been in general the position of the Christian Church throughout most of its history. T
