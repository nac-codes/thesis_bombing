Crucé, however, had thought more deeply about the causation of war than this simplistic analysis might suggest. He was one of the first scholars to realise that the incidence of war might be connected with the structure of society, and that this structure might be changed. Wars occurred, he considered, because 'men, particularly men of war, are naturally impatient of repose'. The way to abolish them was therefore to alter the balance of the social structure by encouraging the peaceful occupations-agriculture, commerce, the mechanical and liberal arts.

Finally, these peaceful pursuits would be best encouraged by total freedom of trade. Peace would encourage trade; trade would nurture peace. 'Conditions of intercourse must
