More orthodox thinkers, even men of such genius as Francis Bacon and John Locke, took this so much for granted that they devoted little time in their works to discussing war as a moral problem. Both considered it to be an entirely rational activity in the absence of a common tribunal to which nations could appeal. 'Want of a common judge with authority puts all men in a state of nature'
