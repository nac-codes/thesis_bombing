War was a social evil; it could be cured only by severing the bonds which held society together.22 Rousseau was no doubt being sardonic in putting forward this solution, but it was one that has appealed to the optimistic or the desperate in every generation; although to the more conventional it seems comparable to a recipe for curing a man of acute sinus trouble by cutting off his head.
