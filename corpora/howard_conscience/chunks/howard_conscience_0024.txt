'All the business of kings,' he wrote in his commen- tary on the work of St. Pierre, 'or of those to whom they delegate their duties, is concerned with two objects alone; to extend their rule abroad or make it more absolute at home.' War was indispensable to them in consolidating their hold over their peoples; as a result, 'con- quering princes make war at least as much on their subjects as their enemies.'31 If it was true that the end of absolutism would mean the end of war, then the converse would also be the case. The abolition of war would strike such a mortal blow at the raison d'Ãªtre and the con- trolling mechanism of governments that they could never be brought to consent it.

One of the most extreme and consistent members of this latter school was Marquis de Condorcet, who constantly reiterated the view that 'the people' were always peace loving, plunged only by the whim of their rulers into war. For this situation, he maintained, diplomats had to bear a primary responsi- bility. So far instead of preventing war, diplomats only provoked it. Diplomacy, according to one of his contemporaries, was 'an obscure art which h
