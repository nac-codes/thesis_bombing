The cause of the general poverty and wretchedness of mankind, argued Paine, fol- lowing Quensnay, 'lies not in any natural defect in the principles of civilisation but in preventing those principles having a universal operation; the consequence of which is a perpetual system of war and expense that drains the country and defeats the general felicity of which civilisation is capable.'37 The answer, he considered, following Adam Smith, lay in free trade: 'If commerce were permitted to act to the universal extent it is capable, it would extirpate the system of war, and produce a revolution in the uncivilised state of governments.'38 The fault, he stated, following Rousseau, lay in .... the system of government on the old construction, [for] the animosity which Nations reciprocally entertain is nothing more than what the policy o
