TIONALISM 1789-1870 By the end of the eighteenth century a complete liberal theory of international relations, of war and peace, had thus already developed. Tom Paine's synthesis of the views of the Enlightenment in The Rights of Man provided a gospel which was to be preached virtually without alteration by many Western liberals until our own day. According to this doctrine, mankind would naturally live in a state of perfect har- mony if it were not for the vested interests of governments-of what William Cobbett was soon to term 'The Establishment'.

That it did survive was largely due to a process of diversification and adaptation. The original view of the
