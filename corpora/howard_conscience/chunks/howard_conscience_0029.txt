n in the incidence of wars-is in itself a legitimate subject for the historian's attention. That it did survive was largely due to a process of diversification and adaptation. The original view of the eighteenth-century philosophes, that inter- national disputes could be settled without violence, by reasoned dis- cussion and agreement between men of good will, has remained the basis of most liberal Western thinking about international relations. The view held by Tom Paine, that such reasoned discussion would be possible only after revolutions had destroyed the old systems of government and brought reasonable and disinterested men to power, was also to thrive with appropriate modifications, and remains to- day the basis of most socialist thinking about international politics, but during the nineteenth century there emerged a third variant of the liberal teaching. According to this view, peace between nations would be possible only when those nations fully and freely existed. It was a necessary condition of peace that 'the people'-naturally by definition peace-loving-should come first to self-consciousness through struggle. Before co-operation must come self-realisation, which meant an emphasis on diversity rather than on community. This process would involve just and necessary wars to make possible ultimate peace. The description attached to the red, black and gold of the German tricolour would be appropriate for all the new national flags: durch Blut und Nacht zum Licht. That is the attitude to war and international politics, which, by and large, is now adopted by many of the nations of the 'Third World', and is now the rationale behind struggles for 'national liberation'. Let us first consider what happened to the first of these views; the belief that once the underlying laws binding men together by com- mon interest were fully understood the problem of war would disap- pear. The most influential formulation of this doctrine was to be that of Jeremy Bentham, whose
