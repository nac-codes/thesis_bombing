The most influential formulation of this doctrine was to be that of Jeremy Bentham, whose Plan for a Universal and Perpetual Peace appeared in 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution. Bentham saw the problem of war and peace purely in terms of sensible action by governments responding to the free expression of public opinion. Like so much that Bentham wrote, the work was smug, parochial and simplistic, making sweeping generalisations on the basis of minimal 25 knowledge. The necessary condition, in his view, for a universal and perpetual peace was for Britain and France to stop fighting one an- other about colonies. If it were not for colonial rivalries, he asserted, Europe 'would have had no wars but for the feudal system, religious antipathy, the rage of conquest and the uncertainties of succession. Of these for causes, the first is happily extinct everywhere, the second and third almost everywhere-and at any rate in France and England the last might, if not already extinguished, be so with great ease."1 So if Britain and France abandoned their foreign dependencies, reduced their navies to police proportions, foreswore discrimination in their trade and abandoned all alliances, foundations would be laid for the establishment of universal and perpetual peace. Bentham thus applied the general prescription of the philosophes to the particular case of his own country and devised a programme which was to become the foundation of the British liberal foreign policy until the eve of the First World War. Peace would come through the abandonment of colonial ambitions, through reduction of armaments, through freedom of trade, and through detachment from continental entanglements; to which Bentham added some pointed remarks about secret diplomacy, which were to remain an intrinsic part of the liberal creed.
