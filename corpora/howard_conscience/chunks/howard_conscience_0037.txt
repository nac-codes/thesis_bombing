principles of international solidarity.12 The belief that the producing classes were replacing the despoiling classes and that therefore peace would replace war-a belief soon to be embodied in the work of Auguste Comte and the Positivists-is to be found in the work of Frédéric Bastiat who, in the 1840s, in Edmond Silberner's words, 'summed up the wholly optimistic and enthusiastic social dream of one or two generations of economists.'13 Bastiat considered that war arose from the desire to despoil the labour of others. In the long run production would replace despoliation, and it was the duty of political economy to show the way. 'Political economy shows that, even if we consider only victorious people, wars are always waged in the interests of the few and at the expense of the many. It is therefore sufficient that many realise this truth clearly. The weight of Public Opinion, which is as yet divided, will bear entirely on the scale of peace.'14 In the education of public opinion, then, in the spread of com- merce, and the advent to power of those classes which derive their wealth from commerce, these liberal thinkers of the early nineteenth century saw the answer to the problem of war. It was in order to work on public opinion that the first peace movements were founded; but the initiative came from men whose objection to war was not so much utilitarian as moral. The Society of Friends, or 'Quakers', founded in England by George Fox in the seventeenth century and rapidly spreading in the American colonies, was one of the few Christian sects to adhere un- swervingly to the absolute pacifism of the pre-Augustinian Church. Until the end of the eighteenth century it was a creed that applied only to their own intricate network of families; but by the beginning of the nineteenth century those families-Frys, Cadburys, Lloyds, Gurneys, Foxes, Sturges-were becoming increasingly prosperous, influential, and politically active both in Britain and the United States, and a new
