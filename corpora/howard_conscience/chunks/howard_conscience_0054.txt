Innumerable functional links were established in the fields of trade, travel and communications, which broadened the common culture of Europe from a thin aristocratic crust deep into the mid- dle classes.1 Political manifestations of good-will and co-operation abounded. Arbitration, something for which the Peace Movement had worked since its foundation, achieved a spectacular victory with the Alabama award in 1872, made against Britain by a court whose members were selected by the United Kingdom, the United States. Italy, Switzerland and Brazil. Thereafter 194 treaties containing provision for arbitration were signed before 1914, and arbitration procedures were successfully employed in 90 cases. By 1900, accord- ing to one historian of the Peace Movement, there were 425 Peace Organisations in being throughout the world, though their distribu- tion was revealing: 46 in Britain, 72 in Germany 16 in France, 15 in the United States, 1 in Russia, and no less than 211 in Scandinavia, 2 Universal Peace Congresses were held annually from 1892. An In- ternational Parliamentary Conference was established in 1889 and became institutionalised as the Inter-Parliamentary Union; while of the Hague Conferences held in 1899 and 1907 and of all the hopes attached to them (which were given physical expression in the Palace of Peace, opened in the Hague in 1913 in preparation for a third Hague Conference planned for 1915) it is hardly necessary to speak. The abolition of war, that dream of the eighteenth-century philosophers, seemed almost within reach, and by the means ad- vocated by those philosophers-the civilised intercourse of rational men, representing the aspirations of the broad, peace-loving masses of the world. 101 290 1 A good account is to be found in F.S.L.
