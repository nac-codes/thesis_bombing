We are only just beginning to acquire the intellectual tools to explore and explain the creation of tensions and the movement of opinion in mass societies. Very few historians now, Marxist or non-Marxist, would be satis- fied with the simple explanations in terms of economic determinism which were already widespread at the turn of the century and which had become almost orthodox by the inter-war years.
