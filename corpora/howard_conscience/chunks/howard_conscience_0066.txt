Historians and political scientists who try to explain the First World War simply in terms of the accumulation of capitalist rivalries and capitalist search for markets are like the drunk in the story who, when asked why he was searching for his lost watch under a street lamp rather than further up the road where he had dropped it, explained that it was because there was more light there. For Karl Marx and his followers there was no problem. For them the pacific protestations of the Manchester School had been merely a device by which the capitalists had sought to establish their ascend- ancy and erode that of the aristocracy. Once established, they would fight to preserve that ascendancy against the workers and against one another. The bourgeoisie therefore simply replaced the aristocracy as the ruling class with a vested interest in war, and their overthrow would in turn be necessary before the peoples of the world could live together in peace. For them capitalism, no less than feudalism, inevi- tably meant war.25 The Socialist creed thus differed little in essentials from that of Tom Paine, and by the end of the nineteenth century radical liberals and socialists were virtually united in their analysis of the situation. They differed only as to whether peaceful political action would remedy it before it was too late, or whether the disease would yield only to the surgery of violent revolution. Both groups found equally persuasive the famous thesis of J.A.
