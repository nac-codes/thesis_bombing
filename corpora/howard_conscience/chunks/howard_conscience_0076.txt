Popular ideas were still dominated by archaic and outmoded concepts inherited from a former era, and 'a change in the political climate of Europe can only come about as the result of a change of thought.'49 Brailsford, whose equally influential War of Steel and Gold appeared in the summer of 1914, agreed that public opinion must be educated: 'There must be a more educative propaganda, a more conscious effort 45 Brailsford, War of Steel & Gold, p. 161. 46 Norman, Angell, The Great Illusion (London 1913), p. vi.
