Continental social- ists had not shown themselves equally optimistic. In June 1914 the Second International declared that the international situation was characterised by general d√©tente; and while a few hopeful spirits at- tributed that to the effect of the impressive popular demonstrations in favour of peace the previous year in overawing the ruling classes, there was broad agreement with the view expressed by Karl Kautsky that, though imperialism certainly created dangerous tensions, 'there are at present in the same society conflicting elements which are economically interested in the preservation of peace and which thus encourage the growth of the other factors.'

It was these which combined to destroy the transnational community they had laboured to create, almost beyond hope of repair. Yet overwhelm- ingly, when they went to war in 1914, liberals everywhere did so with a clear conscience. They were fighting for irreproachable causes: to assert or to defend national rights; to defend their native soil against invasion; or
