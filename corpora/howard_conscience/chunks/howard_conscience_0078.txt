They were fighting for irreproachable causes: to assert or to defend national rights; to defend their native soil against invasion; or, in the case of the British, to uphold the Gladstonian concept of the public law in Europe. At the end of the last chapter we saw how it came about that to most European liberals, even to those who had been most active in the Peace Movement, the First World War appeared at its outset to be a profoundly just war in which they could partake with a good conscience.
