Poincar√© in his punitive treatment of the defeated Germans could hardly be explained in terms of capitalism, imperialism, or the machinations of a traditional ruling class. Brailsford concluded that 'in spite of Republican forms, a nation of small peasant-owners and small investors never will be Liberal in the British sense of the word.'29 That was the trouble: so very few people, outside Britain.
