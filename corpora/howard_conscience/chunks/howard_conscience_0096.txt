to declare that 'the League of Nations will remain the keystone of British foreign policy.' But no less important was the attitude of the Labour Party. In 1933 the Party Conference had supported a motion introduced by Sir Charles Trevelyan, pledging the Labour Movement 'to take no part in war and to resist it with the whole force of the Labour Movement'; and further to consider 'what steps, including a general strike, are to be taken to organise the opposition of the organised working-class movement in the event of war or threat of war'39-that proposal of Gustav Herv√© which had been so universally condemned by the Second International before 1914. Support came from two quarters. There were the absolute pacifists and war-resisters headed by the party's leader, George Lansbury; and there were what might be described as the unreconstructed socialists, those who clung to the Hobson-Leninist theory that war arose simply from the clash of rival imperialisms which in their turn derived from the inherent contradictions of capitalism. The intellectual leader of this group was the immensely prolific Professor Harold Laski, who stated its creed succinctly: 'Foreign investment begat imperialism; imperialism begat militarism; militarism begat war ... Once the imperialistic phase has arrived, the relationship between capitalism and war is inescapable.'40 Or, as Bernard Shaw put it, 'This hideous war of 1914-18 was at bottom a fight between the Capitalists of England, France and Italy on the one side and of those of Germany on the other for command of the African markets.'41 The political leader of this group was Sir Stafford Cripps, a man of much the same social background as Sir Charles Trevelyan.
