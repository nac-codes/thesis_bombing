al Secretary of the Cabinet and of the Committee 48 See R.B. McCallum, Public Opinion and the Last Peace (Oxford University Press 1944), pp. 177-9. 8I of Imperial Defence, records an interesting discussion which he held on 25 November with Sir Samuel Hoare. Now that the Government had won the election, Hankey suggested, they no longer had to angle for votes from the Left Wing and could do what they liked. Hoare said this would be letting down the League. Public opinion would not stand it.49 I disagreed. All the official world outside the Foreign Office (and many within it) are against sanctions and especially the oil sanction. Most intelligent people outside that I had met felt the same. He said, in effect, that the official world had 'cold feet' about it. I replied in effect that we knew the facts.50 We knew the facts'! That cold, unanswerable statement with which bureaucrats always floor their critics! What were these facts? Briefly, that ever since 1931 British defence planners had been con- cerned about the vulnerability of British possessions in the Far East to attack by the Japanese Navy. They relied on having a capital fleet capable of sailing to Singapore to deter and if necessary combat such attack. Second, ever since 1933 they had been concerned about the revival of German military power, and the French had been even more concerned. Prudence dictated that Italy should not be unne- cessarily antagonised, and if possible should be won over as an ally. If war came, Hankey told Hoare: Although we should probably beat Italy, we might sustain some serious losses of warships (from aircraft and submarine attack for example) and ... in view of the obscure attitude of Japan in the Far East and German rearma- ment in the West, we cannot afford to weaken ourselves by such a futile war, or to make a permanent enemy of a nation that lies athwart our main line of communication to the Far East. These were the arguments of the old system-exactly those calcu- lations based
