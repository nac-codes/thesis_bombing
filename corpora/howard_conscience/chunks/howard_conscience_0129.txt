Of course it was seen as a world in which the United States and its citizens would flourish and enrich themselves, and historians of the revisionist school have seen in such aspirations no more than a cloak for American capitalist-imperialistic designs for the domination of the world.4 The same accusations had been made, with as much justification, against Cobden and the Manchester School, whose teaching provided the inspiration for the thinking of Roosevelt's Secretary of State, Cordell Hull. But like Cobden, Hull and colleagues could see no incompatibility between the welfare of their own countrymen and that of everyone else. It was, after all, fun- damental to the liberal creed that there was no necessary conflict of interests among the diverse nations of the world. Neither commerce nor politics were zero-sum games, and what was good for Manches- ter, or Detroit, was almost by definition good for mankind. The converse of this amiable creed, unfortunately, was that if this hidden hand of Providence did not operate, it must be the fault of ei- ther ignorance or of interested malice on the part of those concerned.
