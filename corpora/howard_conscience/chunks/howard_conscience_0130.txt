But during the war it was not the Soviet Union which was seen in Washington as being likely to cause the greatest difficulties after the war. Russia was a largely unknown quantity from which every- one, especially President Roosevelt, hoped for the best, and whose bitterest critics were at least temporarily silenced by the victories of the Red Army.
