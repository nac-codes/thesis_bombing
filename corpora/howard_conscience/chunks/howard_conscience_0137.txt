So this time collective security must be made to work, and thanks to the American leadership and fortuitous Soviet absence from the United Nations at the crucial moment, work it did-for the first and so far the last time. America and her associates went to the aid of South Korea flying the flag of the United Nations, fulfilling their ob- ligations under the Charter as, only fifteen years earlier, the members of the League of Nations should have gone to the aid of Abyssinia but disastrously did not. They were the posse comitatus, enforcing the rule of law against the malefactors and their associates; in particular the People's Republic of China which, by helping the North Kore- ans, brought aid and comfort to the aggressors and so disqualified itself as a peace-loving power worthy of admission to the United Na- tions. The American liberal conscience, and that of their European and other associates, was quite clear: this also was a profoundly just war.
