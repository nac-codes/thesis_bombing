he appalling suspicion began to grow among American liberals that the United States, the very embodiment of democratic and peaceful values, might, as it approached the end of its second century, be waging a murderously oppressive war against a small people struggling to be free. It would not be relevant to our subject to dwell on the irony of America's rescue from her predicament by a European-born ad- mirer of Metternich, Dr Henry Kissinger: a man whose name was to become synonymous with power politics, secret diplomacy, and all the apparatus of international manoeuvre which American liber- als hoped they had put behind them forever. Kissinger set himself the astonishing task of transforming the Manichean confrontation of the past thirty years into a global equivalent of the Old Concert of Europe, wherein the Great Powers would collaborate in preserving the framework of an orderly international system which would en- able them to pursue their own interests within tacitly accepted limits imposed by the generally accepted need to avoid dangerous confron- tation: a system within which the military power of the adversary was recognised and accepted as an essential and legitimate element in the II5 maintenance of international stability. American liberals watched this process with a kind of stunned bewilderment, but since it was so self-evidently preferable to what had gone before they made only muted protests; except when, in a particularly brutal exhibition of Machtpolitik, Kissinger extended the conflict to Cambodia. Only now is President Carter reasserting more traditional American values in foreign policy. Whether he will succeed in creating a synthesis between the universalist liberal values which he professes and the framework of power politics which he has inherited yet remains to be seen. What conclusions are we to draw form this melancholy story of the efforts of good men to abolish war but only succeeding thereby in making it more terrible? Let us look again
