yet remains to be seen. What conclusions are we to draw form this melancholy story of the efforts of good men to abolish war but only succeeding thereby in making it more terrible? Let us look again at some of the beliefs which they have professed. First there was the view which underlay the writings of Erasmus, which was expounded at the beginning of the seventeenth century by Cruc√©, and which became the orthodoxy both of the eighteenth- century philosophes and of the nineteenth-century Cobdenites: that wars occurred because they were a way of life among a militarised aristocratic ruling class and would die out when this was replaced by what St. Simon called les industrieux. The inadequacy of such an ex- planation was proved by events. The disappearance of the aristocracy was accompanied by an intensification, not a diminution of warfare. What can perhaps be said is that it was because of the social structure of Europe from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, because of the dominance of an aristocratic warrior elite, that wars took the form that they then did; that they occurred so frequently but also that they were so limited in their scope. The transition to democracy, as Clausewitz was the first thinker to recognise, so far from abolishing war, brought into it an entirely new dimension of violent passion to which advances in technology could, unfortunately, give full reign. Democracies, from France at the end of the eighteenth century to the United States in the mid- dle of the twentieth, have failed to live up to the expectations of the eighteenth-century liberal thinkers. On the contrary they have repeatedly displayed bellicose passion reminiscent of the worst years  WAR AND THE LIBERAL CONSCIENCE II6 THE CHALLENGE OF COMMUNISM 1945-1975 of the Wars of Religion. They may in general, as Tocqueville rightly discerned, be uninterested in foreign affairs, hostile to alliances and sceptical about such abstract concepts as the balance of power. On the othe
