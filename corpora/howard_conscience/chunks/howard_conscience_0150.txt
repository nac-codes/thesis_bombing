The danger lies in forgetting that each actor in this society of states, including those who have not yet achieved statehood, embodies distinct cultural perceptions and values; that it is ultimately concerned quite inevitably and properly with its own survival; and that it is unwilling, whatever declarations may be made to the contrary, totally to rely on the power and will of the interna- tional community as a whole to protect it. We have thus not yet escaped from the world of power politics and raison d'Ã©tat. Nor does an increasing multiplicity of national ac- tors in itself guarantee a more peaceful and a better-ordered world. Kant was right when he said that a state of peace had to be 'estab- lished'. What perhaps even he did discern was that this is a task which has to be tackled afresh every day of our lives; and that no formula, no organisation and no political or social revolution can ever free mankind from this inexorable duty.
