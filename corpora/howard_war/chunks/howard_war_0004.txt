Nevertheless the experience of the two World Wars-not least, the experience of historians who had taken part in them- had gradually made clear how sterile such a separation was for specialists and generalists alike. For the specialist, to abstract the conduct of war from the environment in which it was fought-social, cultural, political, economic-was to ignore dimensions essential to its understanding. For the generalist, it was impossible to understand how societies had developed without understanding how the warfare in which most of them continuously engaged had shaped their economies, their political framework, and often their entire culture.
