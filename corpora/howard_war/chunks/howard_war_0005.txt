Michael Howard April 2008 I The Wars of the Knights "The origins of Europe', a historian of the Middle Ages has recently reminded us 'were hammered out on the anvil of war';1 and indeed 'war' is really too benign a term to describe the condition of the European continent once the precarious Pax Romana had disintegrated and waves of invaders swept over it; Goths and Vandals from the east, Moslems from the south and finally, most terrible of all, Vikings from the north. Nearly six hundred years elapsed between the first barbarian incursions in the fourth century and the end of the tenth century, when the last of the invaders had been either assimi- lated or repulsed. Then in their turn the peoples of Europe began to expand, first eastward and then, as they learned the arts of navigation, southward and westward. So for a time- span as long as that which divides the thirteenth century from our own day, 'peace' in Europe, that peace for which the congregations in Christian churches so sincerely prayed, existed only in exceptional and precarious oases of time and place. It is hardly surprising that an entire social pattern should have come into being to enable the peoples of Europe to survive in such an environment: the pattern to be known to later generations of historians as 'feudalism'. The successive quasi-nomadic warrior societies followed, clashed with, and absorbed one another like the waves of a turbulent sea. Following the Gothic and other invaders of the fourth century came those Frankish tribes who, loosely asso- ciated under the leadership of the Merovingian family, were to repulse the Moslems invading France from the south in the eighth century and to create, under the Carolingians at the beginning of the ninth, the short-lived unity of the west.
