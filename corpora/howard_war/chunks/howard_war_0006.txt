The  THE WARS OF THE KNIGHTS 2 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY lands east of the Rhine had then to face for nearly a hundred years the onslaughts of the Magyars. For an even longer period the coastal districts of northern, western and southern Europe -and inland regions as far as long-boats could penetrate upstream-were ravaged by Vikings from Scandinavia; looting, burning, sometimes settling. Such a settlement was made in Normandy at the beginning of the tenth century. Then for two centuries the Normans, Christianized, feuda- lized, the acknowledged warrior-leaders of Europe, extended their own sway; conquering the Saxon kingdom of England and the Moslems in south Italy and Sicily; and finally, at the end of the eleventh century, turning the tide of invasion back from Europe and beginning to penetrate into Asia in their turn with the First Crusade. Simultaneously, in the same holy cause, the warrior-caste in Germany, having sealed up the Magyars in Hungary, began to push their own frontiers eastward again, subduing, colonizing, and converting the heathen Slavs. 'Feudalism' was a response to economic as much as to military necessity. The decline of economic activity resulting from the Moslem disruption of the historic Mediterranean trading area meant that by the beginning of the ninth century specie was rare in Europe and land the only source of wealth. Further, the variety of threats that the Carolingians had to meet made mobility in their forces essential-mobility to match that given the Vikings by their long-boats, the Magyars by their tough little ponies. This could be provided only by the horse. And once the stirrup came into general use among the Franks, in the eighth century, the horse could be used not simply for mobility but for fighting.2 Speed could be con- verted into shock.
