asing codification of the laws of war was due less to any searching of Christian, legal, or knightly cons- ciences than to a very different development indeed: the growing commercialization of war.4 Ransom and booty were no longer agreeable bonuses but, for a growing number of belligerents, the major object of their activity. The pay for which men enlisted was always exiguous, but the profits of a campaign might make their fortunes. So it was important to know, if war was to be conducted and peace concluded in an orderly manner, what and when booty could be seized and how it should be divided; what ransom could be asked, and who could legitimately ask it. Expectation of these legitimate rewards for services obediently rendered, risks courageously courted, and trials patiently undergone was, by the end of the Middle Ages, the motive which led men to set out on a cam- paign. Even within a framework of strict feudalism war could be a thoroughly mercenary occupation for all classes of society. In any case, as medieval historians are constantly at pains to remind us, feudalism was neither uniform nor exclusive of other systems of tenure and service in Europe. It might be helpful to look at some of its variations. In France, where the systems originated, the inability of the later Carolingians to provide more than the semblance of protection for their lands against the Norsemen led to the decentralization of effective power on to allegedly sub- ordinate 'counts' (the comites, 'companions' of the old Germanic  8 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE KNIGHTS warrior bands), who settled in hereditary and so virtually independent fiefs such as Hainault, Flanders, Brittany, Provence; increasingly neglectful of the obligations they owed a Crown in no position to enforce them.
