These might be landless knights at a loose end-an increasing number as peace in Europe was gradually esta- blished and its population began to grow; or mounted troops more economically equipped than knights, known as servientes, or sergeants; or foot soldiers contemptuously-or perhaps convivially ?- called fanti, boys; or the expensive specialists in that miracle of twelfth-century technology, the cross-bow, who had usually to be imported from Italy or Provence.
