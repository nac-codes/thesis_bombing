There they established themselves as a dominant class which was to be heard of again in European history. As for England, the Norse invasions of the ninth and tenth centuries led the Saxon kings to supplement the fyrd, the obligation of all free men to bear arms, with a system of tenure somewhat on the lines of their Carolingian contemporaries across the Channel.

But militarily speaking the Norman dynasty in England and their successors we
