ttle. But in Wales they came up against an adversary who was not a military aristocracy like themselves, nor a conquering tribe to be chased back to its own lands, but men defending their own mountains; men who skilfully harassed them but seldom stood to fight. It was more like hunting game than war between Christians: foot soldiers were needed as beaters to flush the Welshmen out of their cover, long-bowmen to bring them down with long shots at distant or fleeting targets. And these long-bowmen proved their worth also in pitched battle in the traditional rôle of artillery, delivering missile fire to disorganize the enemy ranks before the charging knights delivered the coup de grâce; techniques used to good effect in the wars against the Scots early in the fourteenth century. This had been since the twelfth century the rôle of the cross-bowmen; but for every bolt discharged by the cross-bow, the long-bow with its six-foot shaft could get off five or six arrows, which by the end of the fourteenth century were lethal at 400 yards; without the destructive effect of the cross-bow bolt, admittedly, but still able to pierce chain mail. So, anyhow, it was discovered at the remarkable battle of Creçy in 1346. Edward III had invaded France seven years earlier to prosecute his claim to the French crown-one of those interminable succession problems which were to keep the military noblesse of Europe happily occupied for another four centuries-with an immensely expensive army consisting mainly of mercenary German princelings paid for by loans from the merchants of the Hanse. The King of France prudently avoided battle; Edward's allies drifted home as the money ran out and he had no credit to raise more. By the campaign of 1346 he had so few mounted knights left that, on  WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY 12 THE WARS OF THE KNIGHTS encountering the greatly superior French host, he dismounted them and set them to fight, as they had learned to do in the Scottish wars, among the archers to en
