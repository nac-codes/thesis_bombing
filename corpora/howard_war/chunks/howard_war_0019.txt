PEAN HISTORY 12 THE WARS OF THE KNIGHTS encountering the greatly superior French host, he dismounted them and set them to fight, as they had learned to do in the Scottish wars, among the archers to encourage them to stand theirground. The remarkable thing about Cre√ßy was not so much the havoc the long-bowmen caused to the French chivalry- more than 1500 killed, according to reliable authorities, for about a hundred English casualties5-but the fact that they remained to cause any havoc at all; instead of fleeing, as infantry normally did in medieval warfare, at the first onset of the enemy horse. Crecy was not the first occasion on which the mounted feudal host had been worsted by foot soldiers. In 1302 the bur- ghers of Courtrai had successfully stood their ground with pike and spear against the mounted knights of the Count of Artois. But the humiliation of Crecy forced the French chivalry, the fashionable pacemakers of the western world, to reconsider their equipment and their tactics. They abandoned chain mail for plate armour-a material which anyhow lent itself far more readily to decorative ornamentation indicating wealth and status; and they also dismounted for battle. This they did partly because of the vulnerability of their horses; partly because of the growing expense of maintaining a force of fully- equipped 'lances'; but partly out of considerations of pure gallantry: a dismounted knight could not flee to save himself but had to stand and fight. So long as they stood and fought the French chivalry enjoyed some success. But when they attacked, their invulnerability to arrows was outweighed by their ponderousness of movement and restriction of vision, which enabled the English to notch up two further victories at Poitiers in 1356 and most notably in Agincourt in 1415; where the English killed probably five thousand Frenchmen (a thou- sand after they had taken them prisoner) for the loss of a few hundred men of their own.6 By the fifteenth century a 'man-at-
