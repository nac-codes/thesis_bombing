normally in the form of fireballs propelled by catapult in siege or naval warfare. To reverse the process and use combustion itself as a propellant of missiles was a more difficult and dangerous affair, demanding among other things an expertise in metal casting which was developed in the West, ironically enough, to serve that most peaceful of purposes, bell founding. From bells to bombards was an all too easy step, and it appears to have been taken early in the fourteenth century. The first experi- ments-great mortars which could be fired only once a day, ribauldequins or bundles of tubes like primitive mitrailleuses, infernal machines lovingly moulded by medieval craftsmen in the shape of dragons and devils-are depicted, sometimes highly imaginatively, in the earliest printed books. By the fifteenth century the more exotic products had disappeared, and the two weapons which between them were to dominate the conduct of war for another five hundred years were emerging in clearly recognizable form: the cannon and the  WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY 14 THE WARS OF THE KNIGHTS hand gun. Men complained as bitterly about them as today we do about napalm; not simply because they were inhumane in their effects but because they degraded war, putting as they did the noble man-at-arms at the mercy of the vile and base born. But as today, those who complained about the presence of these weapons in their opponents' armies regarded it as an unanswerable argument for providing them in their own. Both weapons were integrated into the revived French armies of the fifteenth century and used effectively against an England where a combination of military nostalgia and political confusion held back any comparable innovations. On the battlefield a few artillery discharges at the beginning shattered the ranks of the archers and enabled the men-at-arms to close for hand-to-hand fighting on equal terms. More generally the kings of France developed a train of siege artil- lery before which the cas
