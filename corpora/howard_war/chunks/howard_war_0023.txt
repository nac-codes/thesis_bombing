efiles at Morgarten in 1315, but in the open field at Laupen in 1339 and Sempach in 1386; which bears out the view that the revival of infantry was due far more to moral, and thus social, factors than to any technical changes. The pike came a little later, in time for the Swiss victories over the Burgundian chivalry in 1476 and 1477. By then the Swiss pikemen had learned not only how to stand on the defensive like a huge and invulnerable hedgehog, but how to move as well, their phalanxes-'battles' several thousand strong-trundling forward and annihilating anything unwise enough to remain in their path. Moreover once they had assured the independence of their own cantons they were prepared to rent out their 'battles' to neighbouring armies; a natural enough way of supporting a population becoming too great for its own sparse pastoral economy. But there was nothing in the Swiss tactics that could not be copied by others. Their neighbours in south Germany and Austria, equally impoverished, no less bellicose, began to raise their own formations, known as landsknechte or lansequenets. Their only difference from the Swiss was that they were drawn from a broader social spectrum: the nobility did not scruple, not only to raise and organize them, but to serve on foot in their ranks. Thereafter 'to trail a pike' became a perfectly acceptable form of military activity for the nobly-born in Germany, as later in England. As for Spain, heavy cavalry had never been a major component of the Christian armies in a country lacking forage and in the slow campaigns of the reconquista; and the Spanish kings found no problem in recruiting the poor, proud Castilian nobility to serve on foot in their wars. So by the end of the fifteenth century 'battles', or 'batta- lions', of pikemen were a necessary part of every serious armed force; and increasingly there were being attached to them contingents of men armed with hand guns, especially the 'hooked' gun, Hackenb√ºchse or arquebus, which with
