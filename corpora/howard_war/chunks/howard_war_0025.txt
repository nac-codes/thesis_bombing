if the French gens d'armes who invaded Italy in 1494 were feudal in their ideology, there was nothing feudal about their economic base. Like the infantry and the gunners they now served purely for pay. There had, as we have seen, been some stipendiary element in military service throughout the Middle Ages. For prolonged and distant campaigns tenants-in-chief and their followers needed more remuneration than the simple subsistence pro- vided by their lord. The transition from receiving expenses for services rendered to fulfil feudal obligation, to rendering services for pay alone, was not a difficult one to make; especially for a class of men who had nothing to occupy their 17 time except fighting and to occupy their minds except thinking about fighting. Since the twelfth century Europe had been no longer under siege. Its population and wealth was beginning to increase. The safety valve of the crusades was closing fast and, most important of all, the number of available fiefs had drastically shrunk. Where property could be inde- finitely sub-divided, as in Germany, it ceased to provide economic support. Where primogeniture applied, as in England, younger brothers were left with little alternative except to seek their fortunes on a crusade or to turn mercenary. So the later Middle Ages saw the development of a larger military class than either the countryside or the available wars could support; and if no wars were available, not surprisingly the military class tended to manufacture its own. The existence of these men, 'freelances' prepared to put their swords at the disposal of the highest bidder, at first enhanced the power of the princes-so long as they had money to pay for them. By the beginning of the fourteenth century, as we have seen, the kings of England and France had virtually placed their entire military force on a stipendiary basis. Even the greatest of their vassals provided an agreed number of troops by 'indenture', or contract. And once one prince was
