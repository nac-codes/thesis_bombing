The Hundred Years War produced the greatest concentration yet seen of these mercenary companies on both sides, both of noble and of base-born soldiers of fortune, and in the intervals of fighting they simply lived off the country- side. From the middle of the fourteenth century until the middle of the 15th, these Ã©corcheurs, as they were called with horrible descriptiveness, roamed France at will, collectively or individually pillaging, raping, and burning. They suspended their activities only during the increasingly brief and irregular periods when they were re-recruited into the service of an authority in a position to provide regular pay.

By the end of the fifteenth century the taille had become a permanent tax for which the authority of the Estates was no longer required. The original grant was made by the Estates to Charles VII of France in 1439. In 1444 he issued ordonnances whereby a number of the mercenary bands pullulating about the country were taken into the royal service on a permanent basis and used to forcibly disband the rest.
