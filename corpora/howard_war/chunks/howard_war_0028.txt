And when eventually Charles VIII set out for Italy in 1494 in quest of glory, adventure, power, and virt√π, all those alluring prizes of the Renaissance, he did so with the finest army Europe had yet seen: Swiss pikemen making up the core of the infantry, a proud and noble cavalry, a train of bronze artillery which was to lay every castle it attacked in ruins, all drawing wages from a well-stocked treasury. It was an army not fundamentally different in composition from that which Napoleon was to lead to the same battlefields three hundred years later. Although the gens d'armes themselves would have indignantly denied it, the wars of the knights were over.  2 THE WARS OF THE MERCENARIES The Wars of the Mercenaries With hindsight we can describe Charles VIII's force as the first 'modern' army, in that it consisted of the three arms deployed in various mutually supporting tactical combina- tions, and was very largely made up of men paid from a central treasury. Historians indeed normally date the beginnings of 'Modern European History' from the Italian Wars which opened with the French invasion of 1494. But few men
