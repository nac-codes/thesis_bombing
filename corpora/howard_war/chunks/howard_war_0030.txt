As late as 1536 Charles V saw nothing odd in challenging his rival to single combat, and the challenge was accepted. The Pope had to intervene and the quarrel was patched up at a sumptuously extravagant display of mutual friendship at Nice, with both princes pledging themselves, as Christian princes had re- peatedly for four hundred years past, to sink their differences in a joint crusade.
