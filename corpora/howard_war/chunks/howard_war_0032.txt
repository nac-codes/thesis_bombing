he Welser, could put armies into the field which steam-rollered their lesser opponents into oblivion. Certainly all this was easier said than done : the wars of Charles V and Francis I proceeded by fits and starts, as did those of Philip II of Spain, being brought to frequent sudden halts by spectacular royal bankruptcies. It was not until the second half of the seventeenth century that European princes acquired sufficient control of their territorial resources to maintain standing armies on a continuing basis and to wage prolonged campaigns almost as a matter of course. Nevertheless by the end of the sixteenth century the men, as it were, had become separated from the boys : it was clear which princes were capable of waging war on their own account and which were not. This change was reflected in writings about war. Medieval writers from Aquinas onwards had always insisted that war could only be justly waged by a sovereign prince, a doctrine which was transcribed into that fourteenth-century vade mecum for gentlemen at arms, Honor√© Bonet's Tree of Battles.1 'A man cannot' wrote Bonet 'take upon himself to do justice on another who has wronged him, but the prince must do justice between these men. But' he went on to confess a little ruefully, 'nowadays every man wishes to have the right of making war, even simple knights, and by law this cannot be'. The law in fact remained a dead letter so long as the prince commanded little more power than did his major vassals, and minor barons in impregnable castles could exercise un- challenged sway over their own countryside. The consolida- tion of princely power put an end to what medieval jurists called 'private war', and writers in the sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries drew a firm line between wars fought by 'perfect states' and those conducted by private enterprise, which lost their last feudal sanctions and degenerated into private duelling or brigandage.
