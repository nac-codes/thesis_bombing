Grotius virtually created the framework of thinking about international relations, about war and peace, within which consciously or unconsciously we still function. Grotius wrote out of his own experience of almost continuous warfare in north-west Europe. By the beginning of the seven- teenth century the chevaleresque glamour which had attended war a hundred years earlier had completely disappeared. 'I saw prevailing throughout the Christian world' Grotius wrote in 1625 'a license in making war of which even barbarous nations would have been ashamed; recourse was had to arms for slight reasons, or for no reason; and when arms were once taken up, all reverence for divine and human law was thrown away; just as if men were thenceforth authorized to commit all crimes without restraint'.3 It is time to examine in rather greater detail the nature of this warfare to which Grotius hoped to set some bounds. The main characteristic was that indicated by the title of this chapter. Whatever the rationale of wars during this period, whether disputes over inheritance or, as they became during the latter part of the sixteenth century, conflicts of religious belief, they were carried on by a largely international class of contractors on a purely commercial basis. There was nothing new about this; it was only the continuation of a process which had been going on, as we saw in the last chapter, throughout the later Middle Ages; but now it had become systematic and complete. Even where feudal obliga- tion to knight service survived, as it did in France in the ban and arri√®re ban in the early years of the sixteenth century, the noblesse had either lost their military inclinations or preferred to turn them to commercial profit. Indeed it was in France, as we have already seen, that there first developed the rudi- mentary pattern for what would in the next century become a professional army. But the gens d'armes of the compagnies d'ordonnance established in the fifteenth century, and the
