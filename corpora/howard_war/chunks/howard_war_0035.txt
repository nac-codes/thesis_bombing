But the gens d'armes of the compagnies d'ordonnance established in the fifteenth century, and the corresponding infantry 'legions' raised by Francis I and paid from the royal exchequer in the sixteenth, were only a small part of armies which, in France as elsewhere in Europe, were raised, maintained, and led into battle by a class of entre- preneurs whose only bond of loyalty to their employer was the assurance of cash payment, punctually and in full. Military contractors of this kind had been flourishing in the Italian peninsula a couple of centuries before they took root north of the Alps.

In addition bands of foreign knights brought south by the German Emperors or washed up by the receding tides of the crusades were prepared, in the fourteenth century, to put their swords at the service of anyone who would pay them and to make life hell for anyone who did not. Among the most outrageous of these was the 'Great Company', a band nearly ten thousand strong and totally international in membership which persisted for fifteen years between 1338 and 1354 and ran what would now be called a protection racket on a very large scale.
