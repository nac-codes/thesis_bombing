ecisive moment, of manoeuvre as well as shock. Tactics and strategy became something of an art form. But their employers, having paid good money, demanded decisive results of a kind that the condottieri were often reluctant to provide. Machiavelli's scornful accusation that they fought bloodless battles is not borne out by the facts, but they certainly had the caution of all pro- fessionals, especially of professionals with a heavy personal investment in their own work-force which might be squan- dered by a single rash decision and which would be ruinously expensive to replace. Certainly their sophistication and indecisiveness made a poor showing when at the end of the fifteenth century Swiss pike battalions, French gens d'armes, and Spanish tercios converged on the peninsula, bringing a new thoroughness and with it a new bloodiness to the battlefields of Italy. But this new phase was shortlived. Between the battles of Fornovo in 1494 and of Pavia in 1525 there were a dozen or so decisive engagements, but for nearly a hundred years there- after the major battle almost disappeared from western 27 Europe. One can identify several reasons for this, including the development of fortification and of fire power, which will be considered later; but not the least important was the exten- sion north of the Alps of military entrepreneurship on the Italian model and with it the natural desire to conserve expen- sive plant. Cautious professional competence took the place of the quest for glory in the planning and conduct of campaigns; the caution of men who intended to see their investment in armed forces pay off in terms of wealth, political influence, or land. Professional competence did indeed demand courage, endurance, on occasion self-sacrifice; there was no market for cowards or blunderers in the business of war. But professional soldiers do not get themselves or those they command killed if there is some other way to gain their object; and not the least effective way of
