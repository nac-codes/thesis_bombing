But professional soldiers do not get themselves or those they command killed if there is some other way to gain their object; and not the least effective way of terminating a campaign successfully was to prolong it, avoiding battle and living off the enemy's country until his money ran out, his own mercenaries deserted and he had to patch up the best peace he could.

The most notorious and for a time the most sought-after mercenaries in Europe were the Swiss, who having established the independence of their cantons in the fourteenth century with halberds and pike were driven, as we have seen, by the sparseness of their economy to put their military skills at the disposal of whoever was prepared to pay them-though in- creasingly, as the sixteenth century went on, this tended to be the French. But the Swiss were very much in a class by them- selves. In the first place war was for them a nationalized industry. The negotiation of all contracts was in the hands of the canton authorities, as was the selection of the troops, among whom there reigned, during the campaign, the kind of cantankerous democracy one finds in a successful trades union.

Thus as shot became increasingly important and formations increasingly flexible the Swiss pi
