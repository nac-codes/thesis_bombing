Thus as shot became increasingly important and formations increasingly flexible the Swiss pike phalanxes became left behind like dinosaurs unable to adapt to a new environment, as much of a curiosity in the history of infantry as the English bowman of the later Middle Ages. Infantry fighting in the sixteenth century was to be shaped by professionals from Germany, and from Spain. The great rivals of the Swiss, the south German landsknechte, adapted themselves more easily to the changing requirements of war, if only because for their leaders war and its associated techniques was a pure business proposition and not, as it tended to become with the Swiss, an inflexible social institution.

Their area of recruitment, both socially and geographi- cally, was wider than that of the Swiss. The original landsknechte were drawn from the minor nobility of south Germany and their retainers.
