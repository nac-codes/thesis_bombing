desperate from every class. As the soldier had to provide his own arms and equipment the utterly indigent were excluded; but once enrolled, the prospects before a tough, ambitious, and unscrupulous young man of moving upwards in the social lad- der were very fair. Pay was erratic; but if he survived diseases and battle, was not robbed by his colleagues, and did not drink or gamble his fortune away, then loot, ransom, and booty might provide him with the capital needed to set up business on his own account.
