rs before. What of the armies which these men led? In essence they were not very different from that which we have seen Charles VIII leading into Italy in 1494 : cavalry, infantry armed partly with pike, partly with hand guns, and artillery trains. Still, during this period such extensive developments took place within each of the three arms that by 1648 the armies fighting in Europe had more in common with those of Marlborough and Frederick the Great in the eighteenth century than with those of Francis I and Charles V in the sixteenth. These deve- lopments were due, not to any striking technological or scientific advances, but rather to a process of trial and error and to minor adjustments in the craft of weapon-making within a very stable and limited technological framework-a framework which was to remain fundamentally unaltered until the industrial transformations of the nineteenth century. The most striking innovation of the late Middle Ages, fire- arms, were slow to take effect on the battlefield, and this was particularly true of artillery. In siege warfare the great guns were indeed to have profound and lasting effects, but as auxiliaries to the armies of the day their effectiveness was slight compared with their heavy cost. This made itself felt not only through the cost of the weapons themselves but in all the problems involved in deploying them on the battlefield. The eighteen guns proudly deployed by the Duke of Milan in 1472 required 522 pairs of oxen and 227 carts to draw them and their train. The French replaced oxen by horses and stone cannon-balls by the more destructive iron, but the whole apparatus remained ineffably ponderous. By the end of the sixteenth century it was generally reckoned that a single gun needed a team of twenty to thirty horses to draw it, with a further forty to pull its ammunition carts. The effect of these lumbering convoys on the movement of armies over the un- surfaced roads of Europe may be well imagined. War in the winter
