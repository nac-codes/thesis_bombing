ss-bows, and though they could not sustain a comparable rate of fire, their killing power against armoured horsemen was not less. Early in the sixteenth century the arquebus gave way to the long, heavy musket. This suffered the disadvantage of needing a fork to support it and a lengthy and cumbrous process for loading and firing; but it fired a ball which could crash  32 THE WARS OF THE MERCENARIES WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY through the heaviest armour at 300 yards, and so was invalu- able against charging cavalry. The English clung on to their beloved long-bows until almost the end of the century, their defenders arguing that they were lighter and handier than the musket, and enjoyed a higher rate of fire. But to be effective they required a prolonged and intensive training which was ceasing to be available even in England; and against armoured cavalrymen all seasoned campaigners preferred to rely on the heavy shot of the musketeer. Defence against cavalry however was not the original func- tion of 'shot'. As with the cross-bowmen whom they replaced, the hand gun men had the task of disorganizing and harassing the enemy force before the main encounter took place, when they slipped into the protection of the squares of pikemen who did the real business of fighting. It was the pikemen who stood steady to receive cavalry charges, checking horses at the end of their pikes, hauling off the riders with the hooks of their halberds, and finishing them off with their great swords. It was the pike squares which moved on the offensive, marching for- ward to the tap of drum and hacking their way through all opposition. In all sixteenth-century armies, save one, it was the man trailing the puissant pike who was held in highest honour. The exception was the Spanish army, and since the Spanish tercios were to dominate the battlefields of Europe throughout the sixteenth century and the first third of the seventeenth, the exception is an important one. Spanish infantry was unusual in
