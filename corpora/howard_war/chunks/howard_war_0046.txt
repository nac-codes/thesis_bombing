s Machiavelli, but made no impression whatever on the Swiss pike squares. The Spanish commander Gonsalvo di Cordova quickly accommodated him- self to the new style. He provided not merely pike but arque- buses in greater numbers than his adversaries; and like Edward III of England with his long-bows at Crecy, he transformed the arquebus from an auxiliary harassing weapon for the attack into a decisive one in the defence. This he did by using it in combination with field fortifications. The battle of Cerignola in 1503 set a pattern to be frequently repeated. The Spaniards allowed their enemies, both French cavalry and Swiss pike, to batter in vain against their fortified positions while the arquebuses picked them off, till they were too weakened to stand up to the Spanish counter-attack. The most triumphant example of all was to be Charles V's crowning victory at Pavia in 1525, when Francis I was himself taken prisoner. In the twenty-one years of fighting between the battle of Fornovo in 1494 and Pavia in 1525 we can see fire power moving from a purely auxiliary r√¥le to one where it was central and decisive; when the arquebus was no longer a minor appurtenance of the pike square, but when the pike square's principal function was to protect the shot. This the Spaniards recognized when they reorganized their infantry in 1534 into tercios of 3000 men each. Instead of having one musketeer to every six pikemen, as had been habitual in the Italian wars,  34 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE MERCENARIES they had equal numbers of each, and the musketeers received specialist pay. The process was beginning which was to end with the pike surviving only as a bayonet on the end of the infantryman's musket. So the balance which at the end of the fifteenth century seemed to have tilted strongly in favour of the offensive, with the mobile pike phalanx, the great guns to blast away opposi- tion, and the revival of cavalry shock action, had within twenty-five years been sharply
