business of investing and relieving fortresses. There was nothing novel about this. The castle had domi- nated medieval warfare, when the only resources available to the besieger were those of classical antiquity-catapults, 35 battering-rams, escalade, and, most effective of all, hunger. The great gun brought this to an end: the demolition of the walls of Constantinople by Turkish artillery symbolized in this as in so many other respects the end of a long era in the history of western man. The high walls built to resist escalade, the even higher watch towers built to command the surrounding countryside, were pathetically vulnerable to the cannon balls crashing in to their base. Charles VIII had to besiege very few Italian fortresses in 1494; the mere reputation of his artillery brought them to terms. But the answer was quickly found. Fire could only be coun- tered by fire. At first the defenders improvised. They installed their own guns to fire through ports in the curtain walls, like cannon in a man-of-war, to keep the attack at a distance. They built and manned earthworks within any breaches made by the artillery of the besiegers. Then they began to abandon the vulnerable advantage of visibility for the more practical one of defence in depth: 'Our first care', as Machiavelli wrote, 'is to make our walls crooked and retort, with several vaults and places of receipt, that if the Enemy attempts to approach, he may be opposed and repulsed as well in the flank as in the front.'5 This led to 'the bastioned trace', the arrangement of mutually supporting bastions projecting from the walls, so dis- posed as to give fire from the flank and rear against any assault on the walls or one another. The walls themselves were lowered to present the smallest possible target to enemy fire, and internally reinforced with earthworks. A moat would sur- round the fortress, itself covered by fire and perhaps protected by further outworks; and beyond it lay a smooth bare glacis, over whic
