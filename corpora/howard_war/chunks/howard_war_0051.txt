acting as a catalyst establishing a new pattern of politic order. In the Thirty Years War warfare reached the nadir of brutality and pointlessness portrayed in the etchings of Callot and the black humour of Grimmel- shausen's prose. In order to survive at all, mercenary forces had to batten on the civil population. In order to survive at all civilians in their turn, their homes burned and their families butchered, had to turn mercenary. A soldier, in this period, was well described as a man who had to die so as to have some- thing to live on. His condition was no better than that of the peasants he tormented. Armies were in a continual state of deliquescence, melting away from death, wounds, sickness, straggling, and desertion, their movements governed not by strategic calculation but by the search for unplundered terri- tory.

From this condition there was, in western Europe, one great exception-the armies of the United Provinces; and they were exceptional for the very simple reason that they were regularly supplied and paid. If one could pay one's troops throughout the year, instead of hiring and firing them as occasion demanded, one could discipline them, train them, drill them, turn them in short into professionals.
