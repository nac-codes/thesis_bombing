F THE MERCHANTS The Wars of the Merchants In the last chapter we indicated how and why in the Europe of the sixteenth century wealth and military capability went hand in hand: pecunia nervus belli or, as the French phrased it no less laconically, pas d'argent, pas de Suisses. But by the begin- ning of the seventeenth century princes were finding it increas- ingly difficult to raise the money to pay their Swiss and the polyglot mercenaries who succeeded them. Such complaisant bankers as the Fuggers, the Welsers, and the Hochstetters who had made possible the campaigns of Charles V and Francis I had been dragged by their defaulting royal debtors into spec- tacular bankruptcy.1 Princes had not yet established the bureaucratic fiscal systems which enabled them to draw con- tinuously on the wealth of their subjects. Nor indeed had their subjects yet accumulated wealth on the scale necessary to finance the prolonged and indecisive campaigns which had, as we have seen, succeeded the spectacular forays of the early sixteenth century. So the capacity to sustain war and so main- tain political power in Europe became, during the seventeenth century, increasingly dependent on access to wealth either extracted from the extra-European world or created by the commerce ultimately derived from that wealth. There was in fact a continual interaction between the expan- sion of European enterprise overseas and the internecine con- flicts between the Europeans themselves. Expansion provided further resources for those conflicts and was to a considerable extent generated by them. But initially the expansion of Europe originated in that yet older and more fundamental confrontation between the forces of Christendom and those of the Moslem world in the Iberian peninsula which had lasted 39 throughout the later Middle Ages; and was actually still going on when a new phase in that conflict opened in the fifteenth century with the Ottoman Turks overrunning the last relics of Byzantine Christend
