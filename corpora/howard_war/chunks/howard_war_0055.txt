da Gama successfully did. That system, close knit and long estab- lished, was monopolized by Arabs and Indians who resented interlopers. It is unlikely that the Portuguese would have established and maintained themselves on the west coast of India, let alone (as they did with astonishing speed within the next two decades) in the Malayan peninsula and the spice islands of the Indonesian archipelago if they had not been equipped with those regrettably persuasive instruments, ultima ratio mercatorum as well as regum: guns. The gun, as we have seen, was only one element in the development of land warfare during the Renaissance and by no means the most important. But in the development of naval warfare it was central. Until the fifteenth century war at sea was an extension of war at land. The object in battle was to close with the enemy vessel, board it, and overwhelm the crew. The most effective warship was thus, as it had been throughout antiquity, the oared galley, independent of wind or tide for its propulsion and carrying armed forces to board, fight, and 41 capture the enemy. Merchant vessels, needing capacious stow- age, were dependent on sail, comparatively unmanoeuvrable, and thus useless for fighting except against one another. It was probably for defence against one another that they began to equip themselves in the fourteenth century with the light guns which were then becoming available; breech-loading affairs, throwing a stone ball a couple of hundred yards, useful addi- tions to the cross-bowmen but no more. Like the cross-bowmen they were carried in high castles at each end of the ship so that they could fire down on the decks of their enemies and if need be on their own decks, if it ever came to boarding. But then in the fifteenth century there came the Great Gun : cast in bronze in a single piece, capable of bearing far higher charges of explosive and firing heavier calibre of shot. A sixty- pound iron ball fired upward of 300 yards could not only kill
