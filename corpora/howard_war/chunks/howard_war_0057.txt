ply of scattered trading posts. But it had to have its communications protected no less than did the Spanish Empire in the New World with its huge inland possessions; and the Portuguese needed this protection all the more once their European enemies began to extend hostilities to the high seas and beyond. For if war be- tween Christian and infidel could be exported, so also could war between Christians; and if Spanish and Portuguese Catholics could be led to the East and to the New World by a mixture of religious enthusiasm and avarice, a search for souls and a search for gold, so also could their Protestant enemies when, in the second half of the sixteenth century, the dynastic conflicts of western Europe broadened into the Wars of Religion. Sooner or later adventurers from north-west Europe would probably have broken in on the Iberian monopolies anyway. Much the same social forces were at work there as had driven the Castilian nobility to seek their fortunes beyond the sea. Internal pacification deprived the lesser nobility of their tradi- tional occupations; inflation made it impossible for them to keep up traditional standards; laws of inheritance either divi- ded estates into uneconomical parcels or reserved them for the eldest son, leaving the younger to seek their fortunes by their wits or their swords. In central Europe these were the men who became mercenaries. Those within reach of the coasts, the squireens of Normandy, Brittany, Devon, Cornwall, Holland, and Zeeland, provincials remote from the royal courts where they were anyhow far too poor to make their fortunes, turned to the sea. It was probably the same mixture of historical forces that inclined such men towards Protestantism; and the fact that they were so inclined made it an agreeable duty to turn 'privateer' and break in on monopolies established by author- ity of the Pope of Rome.
