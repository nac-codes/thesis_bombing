The moment it was over a West India Company was formed to prey on the closed trading system which the Portuguese had built up over the past century in the South Atlantic : purchasing gold and ivory from West Africa, transporting slaves under hideous conditions from Africa to Brazil to work there on the sugar plantations, exporting the sugar thus grown to Europe.
