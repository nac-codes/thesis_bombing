This enabled the Dutch to earn the cash with which to pay the forces to protect their frontiers against the Spanish armies. It was an arrangement which con- temporaries and posterity have found equally puzzling, but it worked to everyone's satisfaction. Still, Dutch overseas enterprise was undeniably lucrative: after 1634 the East India Company paid a regular dividend which fluctuated between 122 and 50 per cent.

Like sensible merchants, the Dutch tended to go where the pickings were easy, so they did not break their teeth against the increasingly formidable fortresses which the Spaniards erected in the Philippines or the West Indies. For the Spaniards were not, like the Portuguese, traders.
