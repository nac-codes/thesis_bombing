Or, to put it better, it should be one of the chief objects of the application of Your Majesty during his whole life.

War, to paraphrase Clausewitz, was a continua- tion of commerce with an admixture of other means. Nowhere  48 THE WARS OF THE MERCHANTS WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY was this view to be held more strongly than in the England of the early eighteenth century, when she took the place of the Dutch as Europe's leading commercial power; and we find British merchants in 1745 viewing the prospect of peace with France and Spain with quite as much alarm as the Dutch had viewed the prospect of peace with Spain and Portugal a hun- dred years earlier.
