ising of 49 loans and the establishment of credit, must go at least as much responsibility for ultimate British success in that war-as indeed in all subsequent wars-as is due to the generalship of Marlborough and to the professional competence of armed forces by land and sea. There was little point in winning-let alone risking-a major battle if there were not to be any resources left over for a campaign the following year. The growing capacity of European governments to control, or at least to tap, the wealth of the community, and from it to create mechanisms-bureaucracies, fiscal systems, armed forces-which enabled them yet further to extend their con- trol over the community, is one of the central developments in the historical era which, opening in the latter part of the seventeenth century, has continued to our own time. In the eighteenth century this process was to gather increasing momentum, but until then it was a very halting affair. Its pro- gress can be traced as clearly as anywhere else in the gradual acquisition of state control over the means of making war- over that violent element in European society which, as we saw in the last chapter, had in the early seventeenth century virtually escaped from control and was feeding on itself, so that the historian has to speak not so much of 'war', or 'wars' as of (to borrow Sir George Clark's terminology) a mêlée.11 Such a term could have been applied quite as appropriately to war at sea as to war at land. In the sixteenth century the maintenance of a navy was an even more expensive business than the upkeep of an army. Armies could be, and were, hired or levied ad hoc and paid off at the end of a campaign. But even if sailors could be hired and fired as occasion demanded, ships had to be built and had to be maintained, war or no war. The capital investment was enormous. They required an infra- structure of dockyards, shipwrights, pilots, cartographers, ordnance experts-the nucleus in fact of a paid, permanent, p
