argoes were frequently hijacked; and the North Sea and the Channel, where free- booters operated out of Dunkirk almost unhindered; while the pirates of the Barbary coast exercised a reign of terror not only in the Mediterranean but throughout the Atlantic, on occasion raiding the south coast of England in search of plunder and galley slaves. The early seventeenth century in fact 'saw the creation of great areas of savage, unorganised conflict through which only the very well-armed or the very inconspicuous could move with any confidence.'13 Very slowly this problem was solved as governments extend- ed control over the bases from which the pirates operated. After 1650 British, Dutch, Spanish, and French officials in the West Indies sank their differences and made common cause against piracy, and by the end of the century they had almost eliminated it. But they could not control the shores of North Africa, from which corsairs continued to operate until the nineteenth century. So whether he went out looking for trouble or not, the European trader had learned to expect it, and went armed. 51 As an auxiliary arm of the state the privateer also survived into the nineteenth century, his value dwindling as naval vessels became swifter and more powerfully gunned, until with the advent of the ironclad man-of-war he virtually disappeared. But as a commerce raider he retained his value until the Napoleonic Wars, especially when he was supported and encouraged on the scale practised by France in the War of the Spanish Succession between 1701 and 1714.
