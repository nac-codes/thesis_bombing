ate with foreign potentates, to make war or peace, to establish garrisons, to purchase armaments, and to raise armies and fleets. The French followed suit more slowly but, once Colbert arrived on the scene, with passionate intensity. Whereas the Dutch and English companies were primarily associations for the promotion of private wealth from which the state would get, in one way or another, a substantial dividend, the French companies, obsessively supervised in every detail of their operations by Colbert himself, were quite explicitly instru- ments and agents of French power.

These companies Colbert described quite openly as armies, brought into being to wage that war specifically on the Dutch to which he urged Louis XIV to dedicate his life. And perhaps it was because they were so explicitly instruments of state power, because they were so obsessively controlled from the centre, that they failed to flourish anything like as successfully as did their Dutch and British rivals. These chartered companies continued to operate beyond the seas as independent actors on the world scene, making war and peace as well as money, until the nineteenth century, when the opening up of the interior of Africa saw the creation of a further generation of chartered companies whose activities, under the direction of such equivocal figures as King Leopold II of the Belgians and Cecil Rhodes, prolonged the pheno- menon almost until our own days; if one considers the acti- vities of the Union Minière in Katanga, indeed, to well within our own days. But by the eighteenth century the warlike activities of these con
