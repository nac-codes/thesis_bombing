non almost until our own days; if one considers the acti- vities of the Union Mini√®re in Katanga, indeed, to well within our own days. But by the eighteenth century the warlike activities of these concerns, like those of small-scale privateers, were increasingly subordinated to, and dependent on, state control. The navies of the European powers had become entirely professional, 53 their ships built in royal dockyards, commanded by full-time regular officers, their types categorized and specialized, their activities co-ordinated and controlled in accordance with centrally-planned strategies.

Nor did such men as Boscawen and Hawke, Rodney and Nelson think of themselves as mercenaries hiring their services to the state and getting a cut of the proceeds, even though 'prize money' remained a valued part of naval emoluments.

They were servants of the state who were gu
