They were servants of the state who were guaranteed regular employment, regular wages, and career prospects and who dedicated themselves to the service of the state, or rather of their 'country' (to use a more emotive term) come peace, come war. It was only with the development of these full-time professionals that it became possible to draw any clear distinction between the 'military' and the 'civilian' elements in society. Their evolution was gradual and uneven. Among the Prussian officer corps, feudal and even pre-feudal concepts of personal obligation to a 'War Lord' remained powerful until the twentieth century. The French officer-corps until the Revolution still consisted very largely of quarrelsome and self- indulgent noblesse with whom the state bureaucracy had to conduct a running fight. The development of the British Army from a collection of independent and heterogeneous regiments to a centralized and unified force is even today still far from complete. Yet by 1700, the essential outlines were there: a state machine responsible for, and capable of, maintaining a full-time force on foot in war and peace-paying, feeding, arming, and clothing it; and a coherent hierarchy of men with a distinct sub-culture of their own, set apart from the rest of the community not only by their function but by the habits, the dress, the outlook, the interpersonal relations, the THE WARS OF THE PROFESSIONALS 55 privileges, and the responsibilities which that function de- manded. The development of state power and organization made such professional forces possible; but the development of military practice and technology made them, functionally, almost essential. In noting this interaction one cannot ignore another which developed simultaneously: the manner in which the development of professional armed forces, itself made
