hem, functionally, almost essential. In noting this interaction one cannot ignore another which developed simultaneously: the manner in which the development of professional armed forces, itself made possible by the increasing control acquired by the state over the resources of the community, enabled the state to acquire yet greater control over those resources by serving as an instrument, not only of external defence but of internal compulsion.1 The existence of armed forces capable of coercing reluctant Estates into voting subsidies and reluctant taxpayers into paying taxes to increase those armed forces was an alarming residuary power at the disposal of the crown. It was enough to frighten the architects of the British constitution in 1688 and their imitators across the Atlantic a century later into circumscribing most narrowly the power of the executive to maintain armed forces in time of peace. Here one can refer only in passing to the difference not only in the constitutional and political system but in the entire cultural pattern between a country like the United Kingdom, whose fortunate geographical posi- tion enabled her for centuries to regard an army as an optional luxury, and Prussia, of which the German historian Hans Delbr√ºck could write 'The history of the development of the army ... is simultaneously the history of the Prussian State.'2 It was, as has been suggested in an earlier chapter, the United Provinces which took the lead in the development of a professional force. The wealth which the Dutch derived from their overseas trade enabled them, almost alone among the states of the early seventeenth century, to keep their forces under arms throughout the year. And because they could pay their soldiers regularly and well, they could make them do two things which all other mercenaries in Europe regarded as being beneath them. They could make them dig, and they could make them drill; both activities of enormous importance in increasing the power of the
