, discipline. The concept of discipline has become so much a part of our idea of military life that it is hard for us to realize what a new phenomenon it was in European warfare in the seventeenth century. Feudal men-at-arms were totally, gloriously undisciplined; so were the landsknechte and the tercios, men who simply arrived with their tools and did their job and who regarded one another very much as equals, distinguished by function but not by status. Discipline was not a welcome concept: in spite of their pay, the rate of desertion from the armies employed by the United Provinces was high. Nor was it an entirely original one. In the same way as Maurice, like so many other cultivated soldiers of his age, scanned the military textbooks of antiquity, especially the frequently reprinted works of Aelian and Vegetius, for ideas about the organization and deployment of 57 armies derived from the Greeks and the Romans, so did his more scholarly associates (particularly Justus Lipsius of the University of Leyden) rediscover those Stoic philosophers whose teaching about self-control, self-abnegation, and sub- mission to authority provided the necessary counterpart to the mechanism of Roman military models, the spirit of which alone would make them work. This stoical philosophy of self- sacrifice and obedience harmonized well with the sober life- style of Protestantism.

Although Maurice and his colleagues studied and discussed all these questions, practised the formations, drilled the troops, and actually founded a military academy at Siegen where Protestant noblesse could be educated in the new doctrines, the infrequency of pitched battles gave l
