ized as a state responsibility, even though it was one that the Swedish state found too heavy to sustain far beyond its own borders; so the Swedish armies were able, at 59 least initially, to move without the vast concourse of camp followers, many times their own size, which accompanied other forces in the Thirty Years War. On the battlefield they deployed in the flat formations practised by Maurice of Orange; but a lighter musket and constant practice made their rate of fire and reloading so rapid that the depth of infantry formations could be reduced from ten deep to six or even less ; the musketeers even being able to deliver, on rare and awful occasions, a simultaneous salvo of fire. Cavalry and artillery were transformed as well. Instead of practising the elegant but ineffective caracole, Swedish cavalry learned again how to use the arme blanche, how to charge with the sword in a disciplined mass, an instrument of shock more terrifying because more concentrated and more controlled even than the chivalry of the Middle Ages. It was to be a tactic which Oliver Cromwell's Ironsides were to bring to perfection in the English Civil Wars. As for artillery, Gustavus worked incessantly to overcome its basic disadvantage: immobility. The answer was provided by the discovery that the range of cannon did not necessarily increase with the length of the barrel; that their length indeed could be halved, and their weight accordingly, without any decrease in their effectiveness. This discovery, and the many other improvements in gun-founding introduced by the great Swedish ironmaster Louis de Geer, a major industrialist who dominated the economic life of western Europe in the first half of the seventeenth century, made possible the introduction of mobile field artillery; guns which could be moved-if necessary manhandled-on the battlefield, which could fire either solid shot or case-shot against infantry as circumstances demanded and whose rate of fire, previously two or three r
