could be moved-if necessary manhandled-on the battlefield, which could fire either solid shot or case-shot against infantry as circumstances demanded and whose rate of fire, previously two or three rounds an hour, began to compare not unfavourably with that of the musketeers themselves. Finally, perhaps the most important innovation of all, these three arms-two of them maximizing fire power, one offensive shock-were taught to co-operate and to manoeuvre on the battlefield; an operation of great difficulty which needed not only clear-sighted and quick-witted commanders but an inte- grated structure of hierarchical control and instantaneous,  60 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE PROFESSIONALS disciplined response. It was something seldom achieved; when Gustavus himself was not there, very rarely indeed. But for almost the first time since the far simpler and smaller conflicts of antiquity it was now possible for armies not simply at the outset of a battle but throughout its course, to be the instru- ments of a single controlling will. It was indeed thanks to all these developments during the first half of the seventeenth century that the second half witnessed the appearance of so many outstanding generals: Turenne and Luxemburg, Montecuccoli and Eugene of Savoy : and John Churchill Duke of Marlborough, the greatest of them all. So Gustavus provided a blueprint, an indication-it would be unwise to put it any more strongly than that-of the way in which the inconclusive and generalized violence into which warfare had degenerated, and into which its tendency is always to degenerate, might be got under total control; how the violent element which permeated European society could be canalized and put to the purposive, legitimized uses of the developing state machine; how brigands could be turned into soldiers, anarchic violence into the intelligent and controlled use of force by authorities recognized according to accepted value-systems as legitimate.
