brigands could be turned into soldiers, anarchic violence into the intelligent and controlled use of force by authorities recognized according to accepted value-systems as legitimate. Until this was done, no orderly state-system in Europe was really possible; but it could not be done until the mechanism of the states themselves had been very considerably improved. It was not until the end of the century that this possibility became even remotely realized- that European states had paid professional armies, supplied with all they required from their own magazines, directing their activities primarily against each other and not against the civilian populations, commanded by generals who could conduct operations with restraint and skill; until the era, in fact, of those 'temperate and indecisive contests' of which Edward Gibbon was to write with such complacency in the eighteenth century. By then two further changes had occurred in weapon technology. One was the replacement of the matchlock musket with its cumbrous and erratic loading procedure by the flint- lock, whose simple and sturdy mechanism made possible a discharge of three rounds a minute and the establishment of 61 three ranks, capable of simultaneous fire, as the normal infantry formation. The other was the invention of the ring bayonet which, by making every infantryman his own pike- man, made it possible to eliminate pikes from the battlefield altogether. These two developments occurred during the last two decades of the seventeenth century; so the soldiers who fought under Marlborough at the beginning of the eighteenth century did so with virtually the same weapons as those available to Wellington a hundred years later, deploying in the same long thin lines-l'ordre mince, as the French called it -capable of sustained, continuous fire and, so long as they held their ground, invulnerable to cavalry attack. But once these formations were broken by hostile fire, infantry were at the mercy of cavalry. So heavy
