ustained, continuous fire and, so long as they held their ground, invulnerable to cavalry attack. But once these formations were broken by hostile fire, infantry were at the mercy of cavalry. So heavy cavalry armed with sword or sabre or-an importation from eastern Europe -lances, remained an effective arm. And it was from eastern Europe that there came, by way of the Habsburg armies, light cavalry for skirmishing and reconnaissance, always necessary in the wars against the Turks; while mobile fire power was provided by 'dragoons', horsemen so named after the light musket with which they were armed, and who could also be used, as their name implies, for internal coercion. As for guns, the process of their improvement after Gustavus Adolphus was very gradual until the eighteenth century, when the French once again took the lead. Under the supervision of the Inspector of Artillery, Jean-Baptiste de Gribeauval (1715- 89), artillery pieces became standardized, their parts were made interchangeable, improvement in charges increased the range and gunsights the accuracy of fire, and lighter carriages, by greatly reducing the draught power needed to move them, made them truly flexible weapons both on and off the battle- field, capable of concentration against any desired point. But more important than any technical development was that which occurred among the gunners themselves. They ceased to be regarded as a group of civilian specialists concerned only with the obscure technicalities of their sinister craft, and became in all European armies an integrated branch of the armed forces, uniformed and disciplined like all the rest if somewhat more scientific in their approach to war.

Developments in weapon technology alone do not provide an adequate explanation of the change which came over European warfa
