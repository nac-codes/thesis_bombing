embracing every major European power. How was this done? Basically it was the work of two outstanding and tireless bureaucrats, Michel le Tellier, who laid the foundations of the work in the 1640s and 50s, and his son the Marquis de Louvois who continued it under Louis XIV. Their achieve- ment was never complete: their careers consisted of continual attacks on abuses they could never entirely overcome and many of which reappeared in full strength after their death. Still, by 1700 royal control had been effectively asserted; and instead of a congeries of independent, uncontrollable, in- efficient units there had come into being a disciplined and articulated body with a single centralized administration capable of putting several hundreds of thousands of men into the field and keeping them there for years. Of course a complete explanation of their success would have to take account of the growing wealth of the French  64 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE PROFESSIONALS community, so lovingly fostered by Colbert; the improvement in its agriculture and industries, in its internal and external commerce, and in the development of a fiscal system capable of tapping this through effective taxation and excise. But money by itself could not improve military efficiency. Indeed unless military administration was improved, more money would have simply stuck in larger quantities to the fingers of the regimental colonels and the contractors who supplied the army's material needs. Le Tellier and Louvois left these colonels as the operative agents, the men who did the work of raising and paying the regiments and bearing all the financial risk which that involved; but they inspected the finished product to make quite sure that the men for whose pay the colonels indented were really there; and they removed from the control of the regimental colonels responsibility both for equipment and supply and for the conduct of operations. The crown appointed the lieutenant-colonels who comm
