nded this into a complete administrative frame- work which was put to use by his son. These officials negotiated and supervised all contracts for food, arms, and equipment- including uniforms, an obvious and indeed unavoidable deve- lopment once the state undertook the responsibility of providing clothing on such a large scale. They divided France into areas whose economic potential was assessed and apportioned, where the feeding and billetting of troops was closely organized and where permanent magazines and arsenals were set up.

The intendants were under- standably detested at every level of the army, from the senior commanders whose pride they offended to the junior officers whose accounts they checked. But it was no use complaining : behind them stood the energetic and implacable Louvois and behind him, supporting him against the expostulations of senior officers and the abuses of junior, was the king.
