than did the rulers of that barren, impoverished, and politically insignificant Electorate of Brandenburg, whose loyalty to the Emperor gained them, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, the title of Kings of Prussia. It is not easy for us, looking back after a century of German triumph and tragedy, to appreciate from what a position of total weakness the Hohenzollerns began their long climb to world power. The French monarchy may have appeared weak enough at the beginning of the seventeenth century but at least its lands were compact and fertile. Those of the Electorate of Brandenburg, stitched together by a random process of inheritance, sprawling discontinuously and defencelessly across the German plain from the Vistula to the Rhine, could not compare in terms of natural wealth even with the neighbouring lands of Saxony and Bavaria, let alone in terms of commercial 67 growth-potential with the United Provinces and the free cities of the Hanseatic League. Strategically they linked those two storm-centres of Europe, the Rhineland and the Baltic, and even if one was peaceful hostilities were almost certainly threatening in the other. Moreover they contained some of the most stubbornly independent towns and insubordinate nobility in Europe. It was difficult enough to persuade the suspicious representatives of these Estates to provide money for forces even for local defence, let alone for conflicts which the Elector might have to fight at the other end of his domains.
