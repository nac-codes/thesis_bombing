or the present and future security, peace and tranquillity of the country'.3 And the combination of this shadowy legal sanction, his new bureau- cracy and a small army, gave him all the machinery he needed for raising a larger force. When in 1655 his central and western lands, Brandenburg and Cleves, refused to contribute to a Baltic War which they considered to be no concern of theirs, he used this army to levy taxes by force and then to establish them on a continuing basis. Eight years later when the Estates of Prussia attempted the same thing, refusing to contribute to the defences of the Rhineland territories of the Electorate when hostilities loomed between the United Provinces and France, they also were dragooned into submission. They were dra- gooned the more easily in that the nobility, their natural leaders, were exempt from the contribution : the bourgeoisie and the peasantry had to divide it between them. Thanks to these measures Frederick William raised an army which by 1678 was 45,000 strong and which remained at this level throughout his reign and that of his successor : not a spectacular size, but enough to achieve his purpose in making Brandenburg- Prussia a force to be reckoned with in an international commun- ity where the only ultimate sanction was military power. It was a force large enough, also, to impose a considerable strain on a society of only some two million inhabitants with few natural sources of wealth.

In the towns, where the money was found by an excise on goods, they extended their control over all the industrial and commercial activities. In the countryside they exercised a similar super- vision over harvests, rents, and general taxation. Like the French intendance, these Prussian officials, the steuerkommissäre and land- räthe, created a bureaucratic framework which gave the crown 69 a new degr
