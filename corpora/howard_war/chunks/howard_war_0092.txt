So wealthy bourgeoisie were able to purchase social mobility with a commission, and they set a life-style with which the poor provincial noblesse, the equivalent of the Prussian junkers, were quite unable to keep up. The upper ranks of the French army in the eighteenth century thus became choked with the sons of well-to-do rôturiers and fashionable court families while the keen young nobles whose parents had neither wealth nor influence found promotion barred to them.
