ete activities but the expressions of state policy, the implementation of that policy by other means. As states change their nature, so will their policy change, and so will their wars. If we consider the French armies which shattered the old system and established, however briefly, a new Carolingian Empire reaching from the Vistula to the Atlantic, we find no novel weapons to explain their achievement. Napoleon's armaments were almost identical with those of Frederick the Great. There were some important tactical innovations, but none that had not been widely discussed and to some extent practised by military theorists and commanders for decades before the revolutionary wars. Of these innovations one can pick out four: the articulation of armies into autonomous divisions which, since they could move along several roads simultaneously, gave greater speed and flexibility to military movement; the employment of free-moving, free-firing skir- mishers-'light' infantry or riflemen; a more flexible use of artillery on the battlefield to gain a superiority of fire at a given point; and the use of the column of attack instead of the line, a formation which emphasized offensive shock rather than defensive fire : the change from l'ordre mince to l'ordre profonde. The first two of these developments had been made possible by the improvement of infantry weapons, but that improve- ment had occurred as long ago as the end of the seventeenth century. The flintlock musket and bayonet then introduced gave to the individual infantryman a much greater independent capacity both for delivering fire and for defending himself, and it became possible for small groups armed with these weapons to be detached from the main body as advance, rear, or flank guards; detachments which could hold their own even against superior forces until they could be relieved or withdrawn. By the mid-century such detachment for a guerre des postes had become commonplace, but it was not until after the Seven Yea
