own even against superior forces until they could be relieved or withdrawn. By the mid-century such detachment for a guerre des postes had become commonplace, but it was not until after the Seven Years War that the French general Pierre de Bourcet suggested that the entire army might be organized along these lines. Instead of the army moving in a single block with outlying detachments Bourcet proposed, in his Principes de la Guerre des 77 Montagnes (1775) the splitting of the force into autonomous 'divisions' of all arms, each moving along its own line of advance, mutually supporting but each capable of sustained action. This would make possible not only far greater speed of movement but new flexibility of manoeuvre. So a new kind of strategic calculation had now to be added to the traditional sciences of siegecraft and supply; one based on the speed with which divisions could come to one anothers' aid and the length of time units of different strength could be expected to resist on their own. And there was a further advantage to this kind of deployment. Small units moving along by-roads did not have to depend entirely on their lines of supply but could to some extent subsist off the country, which made their movements more rapid still. And as in the pros- perous western Europe of the later eighteenth century road systems were improved and more land was brought under cultivation, the opportunities for such movement of armies increased. As the guerre des postes, small-scale skirmishing in woods and villages on the fringes of the main military forces, became more general in eighteenth-century warfare, so the need developed for specialists to undertake it. Action of this kind required a self-reliance, a quick-wittedness, and a reliability which was rarely to be found among troops conditioned to fight in line under the watchful eye of their officers. The army where these talents most abounded, as a result of their long campaigns against the Turks in south-east Europe,
