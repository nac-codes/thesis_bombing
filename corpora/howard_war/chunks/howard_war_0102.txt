g troops conditioned to fight in line under the watchful eye of their officers. The army where these talents most abounded, as a result of their long campaigns against the Turks in south-east Europe, was that of the Habsburg Empire. For the defence of their frontiers the Imperial Army has recruited local talent of a unique kind : Croatian pandours, Hungarian huszars, and Albanian stradiots, mainly light cavalry to scout and raid. When in 1741 the Empress Maria Theresa had to defend her western lands against the depredations of Prussia and France in the War of the Austrian Succession, she used these forces to very good effect. Her adversaries complained that these light troops, operating independently far ahead and on the flanks of the main Imperial armies, were no more than brigands and murderers, but they had to take steps to counter them. So both the French and the Prussian armies began to recruit special  78 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE REVOLUTION battalions of chasseurs or j√§gers, huntsmen used to stalking game in broken ground, who could fight in mountains or forests.

By the eve of the Revolutionary Wars light infantry formations of various kinds, often clad in the distinc- tive huntsman's green for camouflage, were an accepted part of all European armies.1 As for artillery, something has already been said about the reforms introduced in the French Army in the 176os by Jean-Baptiste de Gribeauval which
