. The leading French military writer of the early eighteenth century, the Chevalier de Folard, argued so powerfully in favour of the column of attack, a deep formation designed to maximize the power of shock rather than of fire, that his teaching remained influential in the French Army until the Revolution. Disastrous attempts to implement it during the War of the Austrian Succession, when French columns were predictably shredded to pieces by the fire of the enemy line, led to subtleties and modifications as the century wore on. The most effective were those introduced by Guibert, whose flexible ordre mixte of small battalion-columns deploying when necessary into line became the basis of the French Army Regulations of 1791 and at least the formal doctrine of the armies of the Revolution. But when the Revolution had to defend itself, in 1792, against the invading armies of its adversaries, there was little chance to practice formal military doctrines. Only part of the old royal army remained loyal to the revolutionary govern- ment, and that part was considered unreliable. Drilled, disciplined infantry was no longer available in sufficient quantity to practise the tactics of the ancien régime. The gaps in its ranks had to be filled by volunteers who had no intention of accepting the traditional discipline even if there had been time to inculcate it. So the revolutionary armies made a virtue of necessity, elevating the Rousseau-ite concept of 'the natural man' to a guiding principle and turning their backs on the artificiality of the old order. They were fighting as free men to defend freedom, and for free men a combination of individual skirmishing and mass column of attack to cries of à la baïonnette ! was the natural mode of fighting. Indeed it was the only possible mode of fighting for troops who had only handled a musket for the first time a day or two before the battle, and it did not work at all badly. One must not forget that the revolutionary armies contained
