heavy charge on their treasuries. But for a revolutionary nation, numbers were no object. By 1793 the supply of volunteers had run out, so the Law of August 23rd decreed that 'From this day until that when our enemies have been chased off the territories of the Republic, all Frenchmen are on permanent requisition for military service'.

And so long as terror was the order of the day at home, so should it be, a fortiori, on the battlefield. 'We must exter- minaté', he urged; 'exterminate to the bitter end !'3 Wars were no longer to be either temperate or inconclusive. If men could be conscripted, so also could the resources of the nation to arm, equip, clothe, and feed them; and in order to do so Carnot and his associates attempted to create a planned war economy, based on the fear of the guillotine.
