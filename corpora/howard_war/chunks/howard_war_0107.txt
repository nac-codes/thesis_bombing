foreign trade being regulated by a central commission. All transport and industrial output was national- ized and put to war needs. Evasion of the restrictions by hoarding or dealings on the black market was punished by death. The manufacture of arms, ammunition, uniforms, and equipment was organized on a national basis. Even scientists were conscripted to work on problems of metallurgy, explo- sives, ballistics, and other matters relevant to armament manufacture. A research laboratory was set up at Meudon which devised the first military observation balloons. A sema- phore telegraph was established between Paris and the frontier. For the first time science was applied to warfare on a national scale. The performance did not live up to the concept. Totali- tarian government could not be enforced with the means then available against a people who, once the immediate danger of invasion was over, were no longer prepared to accept it. Once the government of Terror and Virtue under Robespierre had been overthrown, in Thermidor 1794, the business of supplying the armies reverted to private enterprise; and since the machinery of the intendance normally responsible for regulating such matters was quite inadequate to control activities on so gigantic a scale, corruption flourished.
