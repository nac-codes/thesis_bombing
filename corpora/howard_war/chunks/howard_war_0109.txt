sovereignty of a kingdom as a reward for his services.5 The spirit of romantic heroism which inspired so much of the art of the period thus coexisted happily in the Grande 83 Arm√©e with a more straightforward zest for loot. It was an epoch on which generations of Frenchmen, irrespective of class, were to look back with understandable nostalgia. These were the ideas, and this the instrument, that Napoleon found to hand, and he used them with a genius that was as much political as military. Perhaps among his predecessors only Marlborough had shown a comparable capacity to visualize a campaign as a whole instead of as a series of discrete sieges and battles-to discern the object for which all military operations were conducted; whether it was, as with Piedmont in 1796, the isolation and conciliation of a wavering adversary or, as with Prussia in 1806, the total destruction and elimi- nation of a powerful opponent. Political objectives thus dictated strategic planning; and strategic planning was directed towards discerning the decisive point in the enemy position and striking against it with irresistible force. So much Napoleon had learned from du Teil and from his own studies as an artillery cadet. 'Strategic plans are like sieges', he wrote; 'concentrate your fire against a single point. Once the breach is made, the balance is shattered and all the rest becomes useless.'6 With numerically superior opponents the decisive point was that which divided their forces, making possible defeat in detail as happened in Italy in 1796 and very nearly happened again at Waterloo. With an inferior enemy it was the point at which his communications were most vulnerable, so that he was forced either to fight at a disadvantage or capitulate as ignominiously as did the luckless Austrian general Mack at Ulm in 1805. This decisive concentration arose from an initial dispersal of forces, a deployment so wide that it was impossible to dis- cern in advance where Napoleon intended to strike.
