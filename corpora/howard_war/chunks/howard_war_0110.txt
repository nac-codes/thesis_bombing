neral Mack at Ulm in 1805. This decisive concentration arose from an initial dispersal of forces, a deployment so wide that it was impossible to dis- cern in advance where Napoleon intended to strike. In the four years of peace between 1801 and 1805, the only substantial breathing-space between his wars, Napoleon organized the French armies according to a pattern which was to be adopted by all European forces for the next century and a half; one which made possible almost unlimited decentralization under a single supreme command. The army was divided into army corps, each composed of two or three divisions, infantry and cavalry, of 8000 men apiece. Each division comprised two  84 WAR UROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE REVOLUTION brigades, each brigade two regiments, each regiment two battalions. In 1805 these corps were quartered all over western Europe-northern France, the Netherlands, Hanover-and were brought together with perfect timing to surround the Austrian army at Ulm. Then they again dispersed, to converge on the Austrians and Russians at Austerlitz. The following year they advanced northward, spread out like beaters, to destroy the Prussians at Jena. The complex calculations involved in these movements by hundreds of thousands of men through broken country over indifferent roads, calculations which later generations established large general staffs to work out, Napoleon carried in his capacious head. The object of these strategic manoeuvres was to bring the French armies into the best possible position to deliver battle- a battle to be looked on not as at best a necessary evil but rather as the grand climax of the entire campaign. For this Napoleon adopted and refined the tactics of the revolutionary armies. A cloud of skirmishers and sharp-shooters went ahead of the main force to disorganize the enemy resistance. Artillery raked the enemy lines; and infantry columns several thousand strong charged repeatedly and enthusiastically with the bayonet against the
