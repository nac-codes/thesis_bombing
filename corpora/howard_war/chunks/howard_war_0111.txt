the main force to disorganize the enemy resistance. Artillery raked the enemy lines; and infantry columns several thousand strong charged repeatedly and enthusiastically with the bayonet against the enemy defences until a weak point showed itself against which Napoleon could concentrate his gunfire and launch his reserves. Clumsily used against steady and well-sited regular troops like the British in the Peninsula or at Waterloo, such tactics could be suicidal. But the Prussians at Jena were no less steady and professional, and even their discipline collapsed after hours of bombardment and skir- mishing fire from adversaries they could not even see. And then when the line had at last collapsed Napoleon unleashed his cavalry in a pursuit designed to complete the destruction of the enemy and the enemy state; a deep penetration to spread panic among the enemy population and destroy all hope of recovery. But as wars continued and the quality of the conscripts deteriorated, Napoleonic tactics became little more than straightforward slogging matches. The troops raised after 1806 were taught neither to march nor to manoeuvre; barely even to fire their weapons. Such rudimentary skills as they needed 85 they picked up from their comrades on the march. At Aspern- Essling in 1809 Napoleon threw his columns into battle against the Austrians with minimal preparation, and suffered as a result a well-deserved defeat. Thereafter he tried to make up for the poor quality of his troops by multiplying the number of his guns, but even so he bought his victories at the expense of increasingly heavy casualties. Aspern was revenged at Wagram a few days later, but Napoleon lost 30,000 men in the process (as against 8,000 at Austerlitz). At Borodino in 1812 he did not attempt any manoeuvres against the Russian position but charged it head on, carrying it eventually with a loss of 30,000 men he could ill afford but entirely failing to destroy Kutusov's army. As a result of their clumsy batte
