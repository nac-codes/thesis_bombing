LUTION Winter and starvation did the rest. In the three years left to him Napoleon had to confine himself to operations of more traditional scope; and the traditional talents conserved by the armies of his opponents were able to show up to a better effect. It is not to underrate the achievements of these opponents to suggest that Napoleon's downfall was brought about ulti- mately less through their efforts than through the weakness of his own methods-methods which made such outrageous demands on the resources of France and his own good fortune that nemesis was bound, sooner or later, to catch up with him. The success enjoyed by such cool-headed commanders of the old school as the Archduke Charles of Austria and the Duke of Wellington showed that the strategic and tactical doctrines of the eighteenth century, with their emphasis on good supply lines and solid discipline on the battlefield, still possessed enduring value.

Prussia's brief experience in the war of the First Coalition, 1792-5, and observation of Bonaparte's campaigns between 1796 and 1801 had convinced a group of young officers in the Prussian Army that they were confronting something new in warfare; that the release of national energies evident in the French Revolution was no passing phenomenon, but a funda- mental change which would transform both political and military relations in European societies, and to which their own country would need to react, not only with military but with political reforms.

Scharnhorst, their leader, was appointed Pre
