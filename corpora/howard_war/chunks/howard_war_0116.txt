Mistrust of the power of a crown which had in 1688 shown every sign of intending to use a standing army to extend its powers died only very slowly. The expansion of the army made necessary by the revolutionary wars-from under 40,000 men in 1793 to just under 150,000 in 1801-was scrutinized step by step by a jealous Parliament. The attempts made during this period by its royal commander-in-chief the Duke of York to bring it to a state of continental efficiency were attacked by Whigs and Radicals alike. Pioneer attempts to set up a Royal Military College for the education of officers were seen as evidence of incipient despotism. In fact, although the army in principle owed allegiance to the crown, the gentry retained an effective control over it by the institution of purchase of com- missions and the maintenance of a regimental system which ensured that wealth, even on a modest scale, and social self- selection should be the determining factor in the recruitment of officers. The British Army thus remained throughout the Napoleonic wars an eighteenth-century force, faithfully reflecting the stable class-structure of its society. Officers were drawn largely from the lesser aristocracy and gentry, barely at all from the professional and mercantile middle classes.
