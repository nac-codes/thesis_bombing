entieth century. It was this dominance, total after the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, that enabled Britain to make a yet greater contribution to the defeat of Napoleon: the continental blockade. In the economic conditions of the time, when the nations of Europe were very largely self-sufficient in foodstuffs, the reciprocal blockades imposed on one another by the British and the French were initially seen by both sides not, as they were to become in the world wars of the twentieth century, attempts at mutual starvation, but as a continuation of those 'wars of the merchants' that we have already considered : a reversion to the mercantilist attempts to ruin one's opponent financially by the capture of his trade. One reason why the peace concluded in 1802 between Britain and France at Amiens was so short-lived was that Napoleon, with considerable support from the French business community, was determined to revive the Colbertian mercantile war against British trade which had been briefly interrupted by the Eden Treaty of 1786, that gallant attempt by William Pitt to implement Adam Smith's principles of free trade. Free from the internal customs barriers of the ancien r√©gime, strengthened by the acquisition of the coal and iron of their newly annexed Belgian provinces, the French were now dangerous competitors.

The British response was to impose a blockade designed, not to destroy French trade, but to contro
