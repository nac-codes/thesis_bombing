The British Army was called out to perform the task which, far more than any foreign wars, was to keep it 93 occupied for the next forty years: the suppression of the discontents of the British people. So behind the spectacular military events of the revolu- tionary and Napoleonic eras there was taking place a struggle between two competing economic systems which was in the last resort to be no less decisive and, for the future of warfare, far more significant. War was beginning to become total-a conflict not of armies but of populations. And this trend was to be powerfully reinforced by the technical developments which, within a few years of the conclusion of the Congress of Vienna, began to transform the continent of Europe.  6 THE WARS OF THE NATIONS 95 3 The Wars of the Nations After 1814 the principal concern of the governing classes of Europe, settling uneasily back into the saddles from which twenty-five years of revolution and invasion had so nearly dislodged them, was to ensure that the Napoleonic experience should not be repeated; that the political and social balance which had kept eighteenth-century Europe in a state of stable equilibrium should be restored and maintained. The restora- tion of this balance was seen as a far more important objective than the exploitation of the new sources of political energy and military power which the French Revolution had revealed beneath the surface of European society.

Whatever value Napoleonic warfare might have for a power trying to overthrow the states-system of Europe, it could have little for statesmen trying to preserve it. For half a century, therefore, armies reverted so far as they could to an eighteenth-century pattern of aristocratic officers and long-serving professional troops kept isolat
