en trying to preserve it. For half a century, therefore, armies reverted so far as they could to an eighteenth-century pattern of aristocratic officers and long-serving professional troops kept isolated from the rest of the community. States which had made only marginal or temporary adjustments in their military structures to meet the Napoleonic challenge-Britain, Russia, the Habsburg Empire -returned without difficulty to their traditional ways. In Prussia the reforms introduced by Scharnhorst and his colleagues and established by the Army Law of 1814- conscription for three years with the colours and two with the reserve, a separate landwehr officered by men of property elected by their fellows-could not be totally abolished; but the reformers themselves were eased out into obscurity or retirement, the landwehr was allowed to decay into a country club, conscription was used as sparingly and cautiously as possible, and the aristocracy were allowed to re-establish their total dominance within the officer-corps. In France so total a reversion to the ancien régime was not possible : French military institutions had to be built on the framework of the old Napoleonic army-a task undertaken by Napoleon's former lieutenants Gouvion St. Cyr in 1818 and Soult in 1832. Their military legislation retained the principle of conscription; but by applying it virtually to the only classes too poor to purchase exemption and by making it last for a period of seven years, they used it to fashion a long-serving professional army very different from the Nation in Arms of the revolutionary period.
