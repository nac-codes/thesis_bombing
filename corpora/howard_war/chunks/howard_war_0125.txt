ently expected to hold good for the future. In the work of such men-the Prussian General von Willisen (Theorie des grossen Krieges, 1840), the English Edward Bruce Hamley (Operations of War, 1866), and above all the Swiss Antoine de Jomini (Précis de l' Art de la Guerre, 1838)- Napoleonic warfare became, like cighteenth-century warfare, a simple problem of manoeuvre, of threatening the enemy flanks and lines of communication while safeguarding one's own, of ensuring a superiority of strength at the decisive point. Much of the greatest military work of the time, Carl von Clausewitz's Vom Kriege (1832) was taken up with the same search for fundamental strategic principles; but Clausewitz was yet more concerned with analyzing and explaining the differences between the wars of the Revolution and those of the ancien régime than he was with stressing the similarities. War, he insisted, was at least as much a matter of moral and political factors as of military expertise, and it was the altera- tion in these factors brought about by the French Revolution that had apparently changed the nature of war and taken the armies of the ancien régime by surprise. Wars conducted with the full force of national energy in pursuit of total victory would always take a different form from those engaged with limited forces for limited objectives. The former category, 'absolute wars', might have seemed no more than a Platonic ideal, an abstract standard for calculation, if Europe had not actually experienced them during the revolutionary epoch. It would be rash, concluded Clausewitz, to assert that such conflicts would never recur. 'When barriers which in fact consisted only in ignorance of what was possible are broken down, it is not easy to build them up again; and mutual hostility, at least when major interests are at stake, will express itself in the same fashion as it has in our own day'.1 97 It was precisely this outburst of national enthusiasm, as dangerous to themselves as to their
