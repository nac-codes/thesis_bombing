But their very success in maintaining peace and order in Europe for so long made possible industrial and technical developments which ultimately ensured that war, when it did recur, was likely to be on a scale to dwarf even the Napoleonic experience. It was these years between the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 and the war in the Crimea forty years later that wit- nessed the transformation of land and sea transport by the development of the steam engine. The effect on naval warfare will be discussed in the next chapter. On land the introduction of the railway and its application to warfare eliminated the prolonged marches, lasting sometimes for weeks, which deci- mated even the toughest professional forces before they made contact with one another. In Britain in 1830 a regiment of troops was transported over the thirty-four miles between Manchester and Liverpool in two hours instead of taking two or three days on the march. At the same time the Germans of the Rhineland began to contemplate with apprehension the speed with which a renascent France would now be able to concentrate large bodies of troops swiftly and unexpectedly to renew the Napoleonic invasions. As it was, both the British and the French armies were initially interested in railways as a means of transporting troops to quell riots in their big cities, and it was to be the economic and military power of Prussia, whose sprawling territories in the centre of Europe could now be effectively linked together by a railway network, that was to benefit most from the new transport system. The first war in Europe to demonstrate the value of railways was that
