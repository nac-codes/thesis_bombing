e of Europe could now be effectively linked together by a railway network, that was to benefit most from the new transport system. The first war in Europe to demonstrate the value of railways was that fought between France and the Austrian Empire in northern Italy in 1859, when a French force 120,000 strong, which would have taken two months to march the distance, reached the theatre of operations in eleven days. But the campaign demonstrated also the problems of rail transport. Men and horses might be moved quickly, but their stores were a different matter. The French troops found themselves without  98 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARSur THE NATIONS 99 LIBRARY ammunition, medical supplies, fodder, bridging, or siege equipment, and were able to fight effectively only because the Austrians were no better. The Prussian General Staff, studying with deep interest a campaign fought between its two most probable enemies, did not miss this lesson, and established a railway section which, after making its own mistakes in the war against Austria in 1866, was to function with unprecedented efficiency in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870; by which time the American Civil War had provided further lavish examples of the problems and possibilities which rail transport presented to the strategist. Speed of movement was indeed only one of the military advantages conferred by the railway. No less important was the staying power it gave to armies in the field. No longer were armies dependent on the supplies stock-piled in forward magazines for a single campaign: now the economy of the entire country could be geared to providing a continuous supply. Secondly, troops now arrived in the theatre of opera- tions in full strength and in good physical shape; not an unimportant consideration if any significant proportion of them were reservists fresh from civil life, although this had the incidental disadvantage that the toughening process of the approach march could no longer provide a gradua
