y significant proportion of them were reservists fresh from civil life, although this had the incidental disadvantage that the toughening process of the approach march could no longer provide a gradual intro- duction to the rigours of the campaign. Thirdly the forces could be maintained in good condition : the sick and wounded could be evacuated to base hospitals and replaced by fit men, and if the campaign was prolonged, troops could come and go on leave. War was no longer a remote affair about which the civil population learned only from brief governmental announcements or soldiers' tales long after the event. And the intimacy of the contact between the theatre of operations and the home base was made closer by the concurrent development of the electric telegraph, which gave instantaneous com- munication, not only between political leaders in the capital and their military commanders in the field but, as newspapers became more established and ambitious, between editorial offices and their correspondents with the troops. The British public were able to follow the campaign in the Crimea in 1854-5 in far greater detail, and as a result with far greater critical interest, than they did Wellington's campaigns in the Peninsula; and they were only slightly less well-informed about the activities of their armed forces in yet more remote parts of the world.

But the same processes that were increasing the involvement of the armed forces with the community from which they were drawn were simultaneously creating a purely military r
