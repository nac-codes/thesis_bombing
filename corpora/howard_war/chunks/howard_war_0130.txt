rces they were able to put into the field. This assumption rested very largely on the experiences of the German Wars of Unification in 1866 and 1870, when Prussia had taken only a few weeks to destroy the armies first of the Austrian Empire and then of France and, in the latter case, to occupy the enemy capital in true Napoleonic fashion and dictate her own terms to a completely helpless foe. 'Absolute war', as predicted by Clausewitz, had appeared again; and it was brought back to Europe by Clausewitz's disciple, the Chief of the Prussian General Staff the elder Helmuth von Moltke. The foundation for Prussian military effectiveness was the system of compulsory military service which, though it had languished since its introduction in 1814, had never been totally abandoned. It was revitalized when there came to the throne in 1858, first as Regent and then as King William I, a prince who set the revival of Prussian military power as his primary aim, and who provoked a head-on collision with his Parliament in the process. His Minister for War, Albrecht von Roon, re-established the requirement for military service as three years with the colours, four with the reserve; after which the trained soldiers passed into a landwehr which lost its inde- pendent status and was brought under the control of the regular army. The system was administered by regionally- based army corps whose commanders were responsible for the call-up of conscripts, reservists, and landwehr alike; for their training and equipment; and, most important of all, for the speed and efficiency of their mobilization. On mobilization the regular army was reinforced by fully-trained reservists, equipped from mobilization stores, and then despatched by the carefully-planned railway system to whichever frontier was selected as the main theatre of operations according to plans previously worked out by the General Staff. This General Staff was perhaps the great military innovation of the nineteenth century. That
