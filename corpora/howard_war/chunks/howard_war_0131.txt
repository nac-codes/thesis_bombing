selected as the main theatre of operations according to plans previously worked out by the General Staff. This General Staff was perhaps the great military innovation of the nineteenth century. That of Prussia had been created under Scharnhorst but was entirely reorganized by Moltke when he became Chief in 1857. The problems of supplying and deploying large forces had long since made necessary the IOI expansion of the duties of command staffs and the provision of trained if not fully-specialized staff officers in all armies. With the increase in the size of these armies brought about by the development of railways the problems both of peacetime preparation and of wartime command and control were greatly increased. In the French, Austrian, and British armies staff officers, submerged beneath their weight, became little more than military bureaucrats, out of touch with and despised by their regimental colleagues. Moltke, on the contrary, turned them into an Ã©lite, drawn from the most promising regimental officers, trained under his eye and alternating in their careers between staff and command posts of increasing responsibility. In the Prussian Army, and the army of that German Empire which was born out of the triumph of 1871, staff officers were not simply chefs de bureau but professional advisers whose commanders increasingly allowed themselves to be guided by their views. 1870 was as much a victory for Prussian bureaucratic method as it was for Prussian arms: it set standards of social efficiency of an entirely new kind. The romantic heroism of the Napoleonic era, which had been revived in the armies of the Second Empire and had flourished in the small colonial campaigns where most of the French generals had made their mark, was steam-rollered into oblivion by a system which made war a matter of scientific calculation, administrative planning, and professional exper- tise.
