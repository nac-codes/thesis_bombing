the battlefields of 1870. After the first checks inflicted on German forces by the superior French chassepot rifles, the Prussian generals kept their infantry out of range and used their guns to batter the French armies into submission. Already by 1870, therefore, it was becoming difficult for an attacking force to close with the enemy. Prussian infantry assaulting French positions and French cavalry attacking Prussian positions suffered horribly. Prussian victories in the field were due partly to their artillery and partly to the out- flanking tactics made possible by their superiority in numbers. After 1870 this difficulty was to be yet further increased. The 1 88os saw the development of high explosives-lyddite, cordite, melinite: materials which, unlike gunpowder, combusted totally and instantaneously, making no smoke to betray the position of the firer, leaving little deposit in the barrel to slow down the rate of fire, and increasing the range of all weapons to a hitherto inconceivable extent. Infantry rifles could now be made effective up to a thousand yards. Their calibre could be reduced, rendering them lighter and more accurate and making it possible for infantrymen to carry more ammunition. Magazines and metal cartridges improved the ease and rapidity of loading. And the performance of even these improved weapons was to be dwarfed by the introduction, towards the end of the century, of belt-fed, water-cooled machine-guns, firing several hundred rounds a minute. How could positions defended by such weapons possibly be assaulted? Tactical writers at the close of the century all agreed that the attack could succeed only by developing a greater intensity of fire than the defence. Concurrent developments in artillery made this appear possible. Increased ranges meant that field- guns no longer had to fire at a range of a few thousand yards over open sights, as in 1870: they could now be brought into action from up to five miles, firing from concealed positions
