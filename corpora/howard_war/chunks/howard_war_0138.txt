But the French General Staff were less concerned than were the Germans over the strength of the defensive in modern war. In the first place they attributed their defeat in 1870 very largely to the passivity with which French generals had defended their positions instead of seizing the initiative in true Napoleonic style and manoeuvring boldly in the presence of the enemy. In the second, as we have already seen, the traditions of the French Army even in the eighteenth century were those of the offensive, and there was little inclination on the part of its commanders to sit behind their defences and allow their adversaries to exhaust themselves in the attack. Ever mindful of the Napoleonic dictum that in war the moral is to the physical as three to one, French military leaders, General Ferdinand Foch foremost among them, continued to believe that even the strongest defences could be carried by mass attacks under heroic leadership, so long as the offensive could build up a decisive superiority of fire. So they planned in 1914 to disrupt the German movements by taking the initia- tive with their own attacks-attacks in which bloody casualties were to be expected, but from which no strong-willed com- mander would shrink. Long before 1914, then, it was accepted by all the states of Europe that the military effectiveness on which they relied to preserve their relative power and status depended, not on the efficiency of small professional forces, but on a combination of the manpower of the population and a strategically appro- priate railway network. Any nation that gained a decisive advantage in these two respects, other things being equal, could transform the political map of Europe almost overnight.
