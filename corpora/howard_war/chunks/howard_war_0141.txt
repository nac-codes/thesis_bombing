need not have worried. The middle-class radicals of the 1820s and 3os who carried on the intellectual and political ferment of the Erhebungszeit were certainly revolutionary in 1848, and continued to constitute a troublesome opposition in the 1850s. But Bismarck drew their sting by persuading the Prussian monarchy to espouse the cause of German nationalism and in 1871 they shouted Hoch dem Kaiser! as loudly as anyone. Thereafter the German bourgeoisie supported and identified themselves with the Prussian military establishment, were delighted if they could wangle for themselves a commission in the officers' reserve, and were as frightened as anyone by the growth of socialism among the industrialist proletariat. This was particularly alarming to the military authorities. The workers in the big new industrial cities in the Ruhr and the Rhineland had no tradition of loyalty to a feudal master as had the good peasants of Brandenburg and Prussia where the nobility still owned most of the estates. But it was in these cities that population was growing fastest and from which the increment of military manpower had to be recruited; and how reliable would that manpower be-not necessarily against the 109 French, but against their own brothers, if they were called upon to defend the social order against the revolution which the German upper classes increasingly dreaded?

Neither had any sympathy for 'bourgeois pacifism'-the ideas inherited by British and French liberals from the Enlightenment, but which in Britain went back to still older r
