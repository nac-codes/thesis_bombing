Pre-war thinkers had believed that twentieth- century war would be short and decisive because they could not conceive how mass warfare could possibly be anything else. With all men of military age in uniform, who would till the fields and man the factories? Compelled to find the vast sums of money needed to carry on the war, would not the whole machinery of finance collapse-and would it not collapse anyhow once the international framework within which the world system of trade and finance now operated had been torn apart by war?
