The Germans, with the exception only of a courageous minority of socialists, demanded territorial acquisitions which would make them for ever safe against any conceivable combination of enemies; and the British pledged them- selves, in the words of Mr. Asquith, not to sheathe the sword until the menace of 'Prussian militarism' had been finally destroyed-until in fact Germany's military defeat was so total that her political system could be remoulded by her enemies. So the war had to go on. In 1915 the belligerents once again attempted to gain decisions in the field-the Germans in the east by deep penetrations and outflanking manoeuvres, the French in the west by a continuation of their frontal attacks, the British attempting to exploit their maritime power by an amphibious flanking attack on the Dardanelles. By the end of that year it was clear that the Napoleonic principles on which soldiers had been raised for a hundred years-Niederwer- fungsstrategie, as the Germans termed it, the strategy of over- throw-were no longer valid. More relevant were those wars of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when the object of strategy was not the destruction of the enemy army but the exhaustion of the enemy's economic resources-attrition, or Ermattungsstrategie.

Such was the reasoning behind the German assault on Verdun in 1916, and the justification for the prolonging, if not the initiation, of the Brit
