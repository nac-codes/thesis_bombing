They were instruments through which the belligerents could bleed one another dry of resources and of men. At the same time that other traditional weapon, the naval blockade, had become grimmer in its purpose. Very quickly the major maritime belligerents, Britain and Germany, abandoned restrictions worked out during three hundred years of naval warfare, reconfirmed as recently as the London Convention of 1909, which confined blockade strictly to those resources which enabled belligerents to make war. Or rather, they worked on the assumption that all resources could be, and were, now devoted to the purposes of war. Britain and Germany settled down to impose on one another a reciprocal state of siege.
