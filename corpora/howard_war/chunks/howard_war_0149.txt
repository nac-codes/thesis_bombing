Women took the place of men in the factories and the fields. Civilians forfeited luxuries, submitted to increasingly severe rationing of necessities, tightened their belts as consumer goods disappeared from the shops. In the process fundamental changes took place in the belligerent societies themselves. Governments acquired control over new areas of social and economic life. Pressure for wider participa- tion in government increased and had very largely to be accepted. Trades unions had to be accepted as partners with governments and exacted a price-much as the aristocracy had two centuries earlier-in terms of recognition of privileges and status within society.

To answer this question we must get the First World War into proportion. In the last chapter we described how in the nineteenth century developments in
