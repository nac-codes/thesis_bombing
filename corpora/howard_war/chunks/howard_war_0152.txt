OGISTS status, and purpose was to be a significant element in the confused political movements which were in the 1920s to give birth to various forms of Fascism. For although the experience of the Great War did produce in many countries a deep and widespread reaction against the militarism of the pre-war years, this reaction was by no means universal. There were many who, emerging from an appa- rently stable world of national loyalties and traditional values into one of chaos, defeat, and revolution, felt themselves betrayed; who sought for scapegoats; who tried to recreate the glamour and security of military hierarchies within new populist organizations; and who saw in the use of violence the path to power both in domestic and international politics.

So far from reacting against the militaristic nationalism which had been endemic in Europe before the war, they took it to a yet higher pitch of intensity. But whereas pre-war nationalism had been quite compatible with the ideals of the French Revolution, of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, and nations had commanded the loyalties of their citizens largely in the name of those ideals, Fascism set itself up in frank opposition to them.
