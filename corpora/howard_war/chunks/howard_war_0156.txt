d. Yet there does come a point when range and destructiveness of fire power is in itself enough to carry the day; when a technically inferior power, even if numerically superior, does not have the chance to show its fighting qualities and it is obvious even before the battle begins what the outcome is going to be. Such an advantage was enjoyed by the European Powers in their colonial wars in the nineteenth century. We saw in chapter III how at the beginning of the sixteenth century it was their monopoly of guns that enabled the Portuguese to break into and dominate the trading system of the Indian Ocean. But as the use of firearms became general throughout the world the advantage which Europeans gained from them disappeared. In the eighteenth century it was the professional qualities of drill and discipline, together with a careful attention to their supply system, that gave European armies such an ascendancy in, for example, India, rather than the weapons with which they were armed. But in the nineteenth century the balance swung decisively in favour of the techno- logically superior powers. Their railways opened up the interior of Africa and Asia and gave their armies a mobility which compensated for the smallness of their size; a factor as important in the Russian colonization of central Asia and the American drive to the west as it was for the imperial expansion of the European powers. European artillery, breech-loading rifles, and machine-guns made the outcome of any fighting almost a foregone conclusion .* * Almost, but not quite. The confident reassurance of Hilaire Belloc's Captain Blood, Whatever happens, we have got The Maxim gun, and they have not was not always valid, as the British survivors of the Zulu victory at Isandhlwana in 1879 and the Italian survivors of the Ethiopian victory at Adowa in 1896 would have been able to testify. Even superior weapons, if deployed without tactical skill and used against forces superior in leadership and courage, did
