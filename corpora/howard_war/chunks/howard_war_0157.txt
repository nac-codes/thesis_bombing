Even superior weapons, if deployed without tactical skill and used against forces superior in leadership and courage, did not  WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY 122 THE WARS OF THE TECHNOLOGISTS But there was one area of European conflict where techno- logical development was, during the later part of the nine- teenth century, beginning to appear profoundly destabilizing; where it looked as if it might provide an advantage sufficient not just to win a battle but to win a war and to establish a new kind of political dominance. That was naval warfare. It is difficult not to sympathize with nineteenth-century naval officers who had within the space of a single generation to adjust their thinking, their ships, their weapons, and their tactics from the age of Nelson to that of von Tirpitz, from the scale of H.M.S. Victory to that of the Dreadnought, knowing that if they lagged behind the result might be disastrous for their country. In the twentieth century their predicament was to become common to all the Services. Every new technological development from the steam-engine to nuclear fission had implications for warfare which had to be scrutinized and exploited. The military profession had to become increasingly versatile: at the same time as it was expanding to act as a cadre for the new mass armies, it had to establish technological and scientific branches to develop and service the new weapons systems-branches whose activities were in the twentieth century to achieve an almost overriding importance. W. S. Gilbert's picture of a modern Major-General who had all scientific knowledge at his finger-tips may have made Vic- torian audiences titter, but there was soon to be little place in the senior ranks of any armed service for officers who lacked the intellectual flexibility to keep abreast of technical change and ensure that their side exploited it first.
