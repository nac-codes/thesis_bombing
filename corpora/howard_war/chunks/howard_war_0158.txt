y armed service for officers who lacked the intellectual flexibility to keep abreast of technical change and ensure that their side exploited it first. The naval competition of the nineteenth century presents a picture familiar for our own day. As today a successful exploitation of nuclear physics and missile technology is seen to give one state a devastating advantage over its neighbour- so devastating that it could destroy it without having to fight at all-so in the nineteenth century it began to appear possible for the nation which most effectively applied in its naval necessarily guarantee victory. Colonial conquest still owed at least as much to the superior cohesion, organization, and above all self-confidence of the Europeans as it did to their weapons. 123 building programmes the developing techniques of marine engineering, metallurgy, and artillery construction to pul- verize any opposing fleet without its victim being able to land a single shot on its assailant. Already in the 1840s steam engines gave a decisive advantage in speed and manoeuvr- ability over sail, especially in narrow waters like the Channel and the Mediterranean where the sea-keeping qualities of sail were of minor importance. It began to look to worried British statesmen as if the ascendancy which Nelson's navy had established over the French in these theatres was a thing of the past. The use of iron in ship construction made it possible to break free from the limitations imposed by wood. Whereas Nelson's ships had been, at most, of 2,000 tons displacement, the iron vessels in the 186os were of 9,000 tons, and by the end of the century of 20,000 tons. This weight was accounted for not simply by increases in size, but also by the increasing thickness of armour plating, and this in turn was made necessary by the increasing calibre and range of guns which could be mounted as ships increased in size; guns which, because they were too heavy to be mounted to fire broadside, were housed centrall
