no clearer indication of the change which was coming 125 over the international system than the fact that the last naval war of the nineteenth century and the first of the twentieth saw the defeat of European fleets at the hands of non-European naval powers : Spain at the hands of the United States in 1898, Russia at the hands of Japan in 1904. When war came in 1914, Britain and her allies were still ahead in the naval race, and Tirpitz's High Seas Fleet could do no more than pin down their adversary in a game of cat and mouse. But German technological ingenuity opened up opportunities in another direction with the development of ocean-going submarines. With these an entirely new chapter in the history of naval warfare began. It had been the general expectation in 1914 that command of the sea would be settled, as it had been in the days of Nelson, by the clash of great capital fleets. The victor in such an encounter, it was assumed, would then be able to chase the enemy's small craft and commerce raiders from the oceans and impose on his victim a blockade which, for thickly-populated countries dependent upon overseas trade and imported food- stuffs, could only be ruinous. This was the doctrine preached by the American naval historian and theorist, Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose work The Influence of Sea Power on History (1890) became the Bible of European navies at the turn of the century. Although the destruction of trade was the ultimate object, taught Mahan, it was fallacious to use naval power, as had the French in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, to attack that trade directly. The task of naval power was to gain 'Command of the Sea', which made it possible to use the oceans as a highway for one's own trade and a barrier to that of the enemy; and that command was the perquisite of the strongest capital fleet. Mahan was vindicated by the events of the Great War in so far as the British Navy was able to impose a blockade of increasing severity on Germany whi
