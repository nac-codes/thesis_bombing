was the perquisite of the strongest capital fleet. Mahan was vindicated by the events of the Great War in so far as the British Navy was able to impose a blockade of increasing severity on Germany which Tirpitz's High Seas Fleet was too weak to challenge; cutting her off from free communication not only with her colonies, which were unimportant, but with such powerful neutral trading partners as the United States, which were very important indeed- although the process strained relations between Britain and  WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY 126 THE WARS OF THE TECHNOLOGISTS the United States almost to breaking point, as it had a hundred years before. But the development of the submarine, from the short-range weapon for coastal protection as which it was originally conceived, into an ocean-going vessel with a cruising capacity calculable in weeks, enabled Germany to retaliate with terrible effectiveness. But although submarines could impose a blockade, they could not operate according to principles of Prize Law laid down for the age of sail; forcing a vessel suspected of carrying contraband to heave to, searching her, placing a prize crew on board to take her to the nearest port where a Prize Court could adjudicate on the propriety of impounding her cargo. At best they could search their victim and give its crew time to take to the boats before sinking her. But for a submarine to surface at all was to render itself vulnerable to the smallest armed merchantman. The temptation to sink at sight and ask questions afterwards was overwhelming. The Germans re- strained their submarine commanders from considerations of prudence rather than humanity: such isolated instances as the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915, which was probably carrying contraband but was certainly carrying a number of American citizens, made it clear that unrestricted submarine warfare would add the United States to the already large number of Germany's enemies. But by the end of 1916 the prospects for the comple
