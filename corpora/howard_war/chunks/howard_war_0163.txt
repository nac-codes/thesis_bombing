f American citizens, made it clear that unrestricted submarine warfare would add the United States to the already large number of Germany's enemies. But by the end of 1916 the prospects for the complete defeat of Britain by blockade appeared so promising and those for any decision of the war by land appeared so bleak that the German High Command decided that this was a risk which had to be run. Four months later the United States entered the war. - It was not so much the physical contribution made by the United States forces when they reached Europe in 1918 as the moral reinforcement brought by the prospect of her resources being placed at the disposal of the Allies that decided the outcome of the war. But if the submarine had not been mastered in 1917 there might have been no Allies left for the United States to succour. Victory in anti-submarine warfare required not only the development of such specialized appara- tus as depth charges and location devices, but a revolution in British naval thinking; an acceptance that the defensive was a 127 more effective means of destroying submarines than the offensive, that merchant shipping should be convoyed not only for its own protection but to provide a bait, that such light craft as destroyers were better employed on escorting these convoys than on protecting the Grand Fleet. And it involved the perfection of techniques of communication and inter- ception of enemy communications-techniques which the invention of radio were beginning to make virtually a fourth dimension of war. In naval war, therefore, the participation of the mass of the population was irrelevant. It was a contest between the courage and endurance of the small groups of professional fighting-men manning the vessels themselves, including the aircraft which were soon to be added to the resources of the submarine-hunters; the ingenuity of those even smaller groups of scientists, technologists, and cryptographers responsible for developing their weapons and
