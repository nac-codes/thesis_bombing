re soon to be added to the resources of the submarine-hunters; the ingenuity of those even smaller groups of scientists, technologists, and cryptographers responsible for developing their weapons and communications systems; and the rival skill and judgement of the commanders and staffs who planned and conducted the campaign. Expertise in electronics was at least as important as seamanship. Success ultimately went to the side which was able to track the move- ments of its adversary and read his signals while keeping its own secret, and by the Second World War techniques of radar- scanning and radio-interception had been developed which made this possible. The crews of the submarines and of the surface vessels and aircraft hunting them were the instruments in a deadly game of hide and seek which might decide the entire outcome of the war. An identical pattern of conflict between small groups of highly trained fighting men manipulating complex weapons- systems, of competing technologists, and of commanders exercising control at very long distance, was to emerge with the development of war in the air. Air warfare originated during the First World War as an ancillary aspect of the land battle, as aircraft fought each other for freedom to carry out their primary task of reconnaissance. Only very slowly, as aircraft increased in range, speed, and armament, did it become clear that an air force which enjoyed command of the air over the battlefield might act not  128 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE TECHNOLOGISTS only as the eyes of the artillery but as a substitute for the artillery, and on a scale which might make all movement on and behind the battlefield impossible. In war at sea recognition of the effectiveness of air power was equally slow to dawn. Aircraft were obviously useful for reconnaissance and for harassing, but that they might have the capacity to sink ships, even battleships, in spite of all the defences that might be deployed against them, was somethi
