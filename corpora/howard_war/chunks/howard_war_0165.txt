iously useful for reconnaissance and for harassing, but that they might have the capacity to sink ships, even battleships, in spite of all the defences that might be deployed against them, was something that naval com- manders were understandably reluctant to admit. The inter- war years were loud with the squabbles between air forces who persistently overrated the capacity of their weapons and navies which continued defiantly to underrate them; a situation understandable enough in view of the speed with which technology was developing and the impossibility of effectively replicating in peacetime conditions of active service. It was to take the experiences of the war in the Pacific after 1941 to show conclusively that the aircraft carrier had re- placed the battleship as the primary instrument of naval domination. Understanding of the potentialities of air power in war by sea and by land was perhaps yet further delayed by the reluctance of air force leaders themselves to address their full attention to the problem. The early enthusiasts for air power were concerned to show not so much that air forces would change the nature of war by sea and land as that they would make it unnecessary. The outcome of the Great War, they maintained, had made it clear that war was no longer decided by traditional military skills. It had shown that armies in the field could not be defeated so long as they could be kept sup- plied with manpower and munitions. War in the twentieth century was not, as it had been in the past, a conflict between armed forces alone, or even between treasuries. It was one between the will-power and the morale of the belligerent populations. What had ultimately brought the war to an end had been, not military victory in itself, but the disintegration of what had now become known as 'the Home Front': the solidarity of the civilian population behind its leaders, their willingness to go on bearing the burdens of deprivation and suffering which 'the war effort' de
