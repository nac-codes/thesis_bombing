Peace, they argued, 129 had come as the result of revolution or fear of revolution, not through victory in the field. If then the centre of gravity of the war effort was not the armies, but the civil populations, and if the object of fighting was now to impose an unendurable burden on the enemy popu- lation by wearing out its armies, would it not be more effective to attack that centre of gravity directly, rather than by a process of attrition from which the conquerors themselves emerged almost as exhausted and bankrupt as the conquered? And would not the total of suffering, calculated as it would be in days and weeks rather than in years, be infinitely less? Above all, would not the fear of receiving such blows, against which there could be no possible defence, be the greatest possible deterrent against any power which contemplated a breach of the peace? This was the argument of, among others, the Italian Colonel Giulio Douhet, whose book Command of the Air enjoyed a wide circulation in the 1920s. It was also the argument of the founding fathers of the British Royal Air Force, in particular Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Trenchard, who used it to justify the creation of a Service with a strategic r√¥le entirely indepen- dent of the surface forces.
