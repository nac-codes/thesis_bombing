capable of intervention on a continental scale was regarded (not least by the soldiers themselves) as an atypical and disagreeable experience under no circumstances to be repeated. So when in the 1930s Britain began with enormous reluctance to re-arm, resources were allocated, not to an army equipped to fight a traditional land campaign, but to an air force capable of striking terror into the heart of the enemy-a capacity which would, it was hoped, deter Germany from initiating war at all. As it happened, the British aircraft industry showed itself unable to compete with the German, and it was Germany who first built up an air force apparently capable of inflicting  130 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE TECHNOLOGISTS immediate and unavoidable destruction on her neighbour's cities; a threat which Hitler used to good effect in the imple- mentation of his policy. It was taken for granted that there could be no defence against air attack-that the bomber, in the words of Stanley Baldwin, would always get through. It was also assumed, largely on the basis of two German air raids on London in July 1917, that the bomber, having got through, would wreak havoc on a vast and unacceptable scale. Events were to show both assumptions to be, if not false, at least greatly over-stated. In the later 1930s the development of fast-climbing low-wing monoplanes, and of radar interception techniques to give early warning of enemy attack, made it possible for defending forces to exact an unacceptably high price from bombers attempting to penetrate deep into their territory by day. When attacking forces took to bombing by night it took them some time to learn how to use radar offensively by the projection of beams which made possible accurate blind navigation, and scanning devices which re- vealed the topography of the ground through darkness or cloud. Even then the defence developed night-fighters and learned how to confuse the electronic directional signals on which the attack depe
