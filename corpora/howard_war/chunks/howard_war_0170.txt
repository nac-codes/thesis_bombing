een out of the question. But so sceptical was the High Command even of the German Army that it needed the personal intervention of Hitler to initiate the development of the first Panzer Divisions in 1934, and even the effectiveness of such divisions was discounted as late as 1938 not only by the High Command of the French Army but by one of the founding fathers of armoured warfare, the British specialist B. H. Liddell Hart, who was already devising means of countering them by a combination of minefields, anti-tank guns, and armoured counter-attack. Certainly the blitzkrieg tactics of 1940 and 1941 need not have worked so effectively as they did. In their attack on the West in May 1940 the Germans took very great risks-risks indeed so great that the strategic concept behind their attack had at first been dismissed out of hand by the German High Command and it required, again, Hitler's intervention to make them accept it. Competent adversaries who kept their heads might have sealed off the penetration achieved by the German armoured spearheads in the Ardennes, and the campaign would have gone down to history as a disastrous gamble. Like Napoleon's victories it owed its success primarily to the demoralization of opponents who, after the leisurely pace of previous conflicts, could not adjust themselves to tactics based so overwhelmingly on speed, concentration, and surprise. And in 1941 against Soviet forces already dis- organized by the massive political Ã©puration of their officer corps three years earlier, the success was to be even more far-reaching. == But such tactics could be rapid and decisive only against unprepared adversaries. The sceptics were in the long run right. If tanks could attack, tanks could counter-attack. An environment could be created with mines and anti-tank wea- pons in which armour could barely operate at all; and in any case its successful operation depended largely on maintaining command of the air over the battlefield as well. Armour could
