anti-tank wea- pons in which armour could barely operate at all; and in any case its successful operation depended largely on maintaining command of the air over the battlefield as well. Armour could achieve little except in close co-operation with highly-trained infantry capable of moving at speed, and artillery also had to be put on tracks in order to keep up. All this demanded 133 hundreds of vehicles whose requirements in terms of supplies, petrol, and ammunition made necessary the co-operation of thousands more. The interwar dream of small, swift, skilful units operating against each others' supply lines, securing maximum decisions with minimum of cost, turned into the reality of huge armies with massive 'tails', highly vulnerable to enemy air attack and demanding considerable logistical ingenuity to keep them moving at all. So armies in the Second World War, as in the First, depen- ded heavily on conscript manpower for their effectiveness; not so much because of their size as because of their complexity. The armies of 1914 consisted basically of great numbers of infantry armed with a limited range of standard weapons, whose logistical needs could be met very largely by railways and a simple shuttle service between the railheads and what was in most cases a fairly stable front line. In the Second World War fighting units were highly diversified. The inven- tory of the simple infantry battalion contained not only rifles and grenades but two types of mortar, two kinds of machine- gun, light tracked vehicles, anti-tank guns, hand-held anti- tank weapons, and several types of mine. The demands of armoured units were many times more complex; those of amphibious and airborne units more complex still. So a far greater proportion of the manpower in at any rate Western armies was absorbed in servicing and supplying fighting units than in manning them: in repairing and maintaining vehicles, weapons, and communications systems, in driving supply vehicles, manning depots a
