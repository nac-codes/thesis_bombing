The best fighting soldier found himself helpless * In the Soviet Union the proportion of 'teeth' to 'tail' was considerably higher : the bulk of infantry units operated on scales and with weapons comparable to those of the Western front in the Great War, and depended almost wholly on horse-borne transport. Only their armoured and Ã©lite infantry divisions ap- proached the technological sophistication common in the West.  134 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE TECHNOLOGISTS if his radio communications failed and his transport broke down; and the most successful generals tended to be those whose radio-interception services were able to bring them the promptest and most accurate information about the intentions of their opponents. So a very large proportion of the men and women called up into the armed forces found themselves employed in the same activities-as motor-mechanics, radio-operators, waitresses, or cooks-as in peacetime.
