oduced a factor which had not been present in the Napoleonic era, and which rendered all comparisons with the past of very doubtful value. A little more concentration by the Germans on the development of jet aircraft might have changed the course of the air war. Had they devoted more resources to missile technology they might have produced rocket weapons which would have laid central London waste and made the Allied landings in Normandy impossible. And if their nuclear research had taken a rather different turn and received greater political backing, they might have developed nuclear weapons, in the face of which the heroism of the Soviet peoples and the massive armadas of the Western allies would have been as ineffective as the charges of the Mahdi's tribesmen against Kitchener's armies at Omdurman. As it was, the first two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan by the United States in August 1945, each destroying a fair-sized city, between them killing 130,000 people outright. Used by one extra-European power against another, in termination of a conflict between them in which Europeans had figured only as auxiliaries, they marked the end of that era of European world dominance which the voyages of Columbus and Vasco da Gama had opened nearly five hun- dred years earlier. And they marked the close of the age of mass-warfare, of conflicts in which the fully-mobilized popu- lations of industrialized countries had devoted their full energies to overthrowing one another. Within a few years thermonuclear weapons were to be developed, each con- taining more destructive power than had been used by man- kind in its entire recorded history, with missiles capable of delivering them within minutes to any point on the surface of the world. Was there to be any place in the nuclear age for the traditional skills of professional soldiers or for the loyal participation of patriotic peoples? Had 'war', as it had been understood and conducted in Europe for a thousand years, come to an e
