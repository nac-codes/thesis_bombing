political system. Until the fifteenth century the European system had co-existed with many others in the world, communication with most of which was intermittent or non-existent. Then Europe had expanded first her geographical knowledge, then her trade, finally her military power; until by the end of the nineteenth century a single global political system had been created of which Europe was the undisputed centre, and of which very few parts could remain unaffected by European wars. In the twentieth century, indeed, Europe's wars were 'World Wars' in every sense of the term. But after the Second World War this Eurocentric world order yielded place to one of whose complexity such terms as 'bi-polarity' or 'multi-polarity' gave a quite inadequate description. Within this new global system the states of Europe were to retain considerable economic importance since their continent remained one of the wealthiest areas of the world, but until the end of the twentieth century their political significance was to derive primarily from their 137 position as the most sensitive point of contact between the two 'superpowers'. This very sensitivity was to keep conflict within the area frozen. Wars were to break out almost anywhere in the world except Europe. In the last decade of the twentieth century European subordination to the two 'superpowers' ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990. The formerly divided Germany was reunited. The states of Eastern Europe, freed from Soviet dominance, hastened to join their western neighbours to share their prosperity and American protection against any revived Russian threat. The first was provided by the European Union; the second by membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which had since 1949 provided an umbrella of American military protection for their Western neighbours. Yet neither organisation involved the revival of Europe as an independent military actor on the world stage. Attempts, led largely by France,
