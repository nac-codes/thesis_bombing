the rationale for Europe's 'conventional' forces highly problematic. During the 1950s the United States, rapidly followed by the Soviet Union, developed thermonuclear weapons a thousand times more powerful than the atomic bombs that had destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. First long-range bombers, then intercontinental missiles, could deliver enough nuclear warheads against their adversaries' homelands instantly to annihilate the bulk of their populations and render organized life impossible for the survivors. For the two superpowers strategy became a question, not of how effectively to use nuclear weapons, but how to deter their opponent from using them. For the states of Western Europe, the problem was how to ensure that their American allies might credibly threaten the use of their nuclear weapons to deter the Soviet Union from attacking in  138 EPILOGUE EPILOGUE Europe with 'conventional' forces while American cities were themselves vulnerable to Soviet nuclear retaliation. Both Britain and France reinsured themselves by developing their own nuclear weapons, but the German Federal Republic remained exposed. For thirty years strategists agonized as to how to reassure the Germans of American nuclear protection so as to discourage them from developing nuclear weapons of their own. The probability of their doing this was remote, but the huge literature engendered by the problem attained a quite amazing degree of intellectual complexity. In consequence the armies of continental Europe were reduced to the role of a 'trip-wire' to activate an American nuclear response, and there was no expectation that they could ever develop the capacity to resist Soviet invasion for more than a few days. This prospect excited little enthusiasm among the military themselves, while the very possibility of nuclear holocaust evoked strong protest movements among the civil population; which, although under- standably critical of the concept of nuclear deterrence, were not able to offer any
