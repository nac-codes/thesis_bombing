possibility of nuclear holocaust evoked strong protest movements among the civil population; which, although under- standably critical of the concept of nuclear deterrence, were not able to offer any plausible alternative. But in any case, deterrence worked. For forty years Europe remained, however precariously, at peace, and grew very prosperous in the process. A generation grew up indifferent if not positively hostile to military affairs. Conscription survived, but rather for social and political than for military reasons-most continental powers had good historical reasons for mistrusting professional armies-but everything possible was done to alleviate its burden. It existed rather to civilize the military than to militarize civilians.

The British, like their neighbours the French, had problems of their own. Both had unfinished business in their overseas empires. The British, econom- ically exhausted and chastened by a humiliation at the hands of the Japanese that not even their successful reconquest of Burma could redress, quickly accepted the impossibility of retaining control of the Indian subcontinent and abandoned it to its own devices, relinquishing thereby the Indian Army that had alone given them the status of a global military power.
