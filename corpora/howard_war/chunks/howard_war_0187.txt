This phase of what was later to be termed 'The War Against Terror' may be said to have opened when in 1979 the American-sponsored regime of the Shah of Iran was overthrown and an Islamic Republic established under the clerical dictatorship of the Ayatollah Khomeini; who thereupon summoned the entire Muslim world to join him in purifying Islam from the influence of the United States, 'the Great Satan'.
