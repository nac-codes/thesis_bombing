Notes on Further Reading General Peter Paret (ed.), Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age (1991), and Williamson Murray, MacGregor Knox and Alvin Bernstein (eds.), The Making of Strategy: Rulers, States and War (1994) are the core texts on Western strategic thought and practice. W.H.

Verbruggen, The Art of Warfare in Western Europe during the Middle Ages: From the Eighth Century to 1340 (1997), but Jim Bradbury, The Routledge Companion to Medieval Warfare (2004) affords a very accessible introduction with good notes on further reading. Philippe Contam- ine, War in the Middle Ages (1987), remains an excellent source of information, and a more modern treatment of the period is provided by Maurice Keen (ed.), Medieval Warfare: A History (1999); John France, Western Warfare in the Age of the Crusades (1999); and Helen Nicholson, Medieval Warfare: The
