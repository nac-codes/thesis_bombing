reatment of the period is provided by Maurice Keen (ed.), Medieval Warfare: A History (1999); John France, Western Warfare in the Age of the Crusades (1999); and Helen Nicholson, Medieval Warfare: Theory and Practice of War in Europe 300-1500 (2004). The most recent work to address the subject, Clifford Rogers, Soldiers Lives Through History: The Middle Ages (2007), gives a thematic survey of medieval warfare and soldiering between 500 and 1500 AD. More specific analyses are provided by Matthew Strickland, War and Chivalry: The Conduct and Perception of War in England and Normandy, 1066-1217 (1996); R.C. Smail, Crusading Warfare 1097-1193 (1991); Malcolm Vale, War and Chivalry: Warfare and Aristocratic Culture in England, France and Burgundy at the End of the Middle Ages (1981); and F.H. Russell, The Just War in the Middle Ages (1975). For fortress and siege warfare specifically, see the recently republished Sidney Toy, A History of Fortification from 3000 BC to AD 1700 (2005).  NOTES ON FURTHER READING 150 NOTES ON FURTHER READING The Wars of the Mercenaries The best general work on mercenaries in particular remains the two volume history by Fritz Redlich, The German Military Enterpriser and his Work Force: A Study in European Economic and Social History (1964). Michael Mallett, Mercenaries and their Masters: Warfare in Renaissance Italy (1974), R.A. Stradling, The Spanish Monarchy and Irish Mercenaries; The Wild Geese in Spain, 1618-68 (1993), and Kenneth Fowler, Medieval Mercenaries: The Great Companies (2001), address specific aspects in more detail. J.R. Hale, War and Society in Renaissance Europe. 1450-1620 (second edition, 1998), provides a good survey of the wider period, as does Jeremy Black, European Warfare 1494-1660 (2002), which is particularly strong on military developments.
