litary developments. Geoffrey Parker, The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road, 1567-1659 (1972), Michael Mallett and J.R. Hale, The Military Organisation of a Renaissance State: Venice c.1400 to 1617 (1984), Simon Pepper and Nicholas Adams, Firearms & Fortifications: Military Architecture and Siege Warfare in Sixteenth-Century Siena (1986) also provide useful information. For the best treatment of the mechanics of warfare in the period see Bert Hall, Weapons and Warfare in Renaissance Europe: Gunpowder, Technology, and Tactics (1997), and Christopher Duffy, Siege Warfare: The Fortress in the Early Modern World, 1494-1660 (1996). The Wars of the Merchants G.V. Scammell, The First Imperial Age: European Overseas Expansion 1400-1715 (1989) provides an excellent overview of the subject. Jan Glete, Warfare at Sea, 1500-1650: Maritime Conflicts and the Transformation of Europe (2000) is the best introduction on naval matters, but also useful are Richard Harding, The Evolution of the Sailing Navy, 1509-1815 (1995), and especially John Guilmartin, Gunpowder and Galleys: Changing Technology and Mediterranean Warfare at Sea in the Sixteenth Century (1975). Peter Earle, The Pirate Wars (2004) provides a brilliant, scholarly treatment of the relationship between privateers, imperial expansion, and piracy. N.A.M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain, Vol.1, 660-1649 (second edition, 2004) provides a good companion to Geoffrey Symcox, The Crisis of French Sea Power, 1688-1697: From the Guerre d'Escadre to the Guerre de Course (1974), while for the Anglo-Dutch wars see Jonathan Israel, Dutch Primacy in World Trade, 1585-1740 (1989), and also J.R. Jones, The Anglo- Dutch Wars of the Seventeenth Century (1996). For Portugal, read C.R. Boxer, The Portuguese Seaborne Empire, 1415-1825 (1991), and Malyn Newitt, A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400-1668 (2005).
