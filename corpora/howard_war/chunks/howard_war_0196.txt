orne Empire, 1415-1825 (1991), and Malyn Newitt, A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400-1668 (2005). The Wars of the Professionals Geoffrey Parker, The Military Revolution: Military Innovation and the Rise of the West, 1500-1800 (second edition, 1996) is essential for this and the two preceding chapters, but should be read in conjunction with Clifford Rogers (ed.), The Military Revolution Debate: Readings on the Military Transformation of Modern Europe (1995), that brings the subject matter up to date. Frank Tallett's thematic study, War and Society in Early Modern Europe, 1495-1715 (1997), updates and comple- ments Christopher Duffy, The Military Experience in the Age of Reason (1987), and 151 André Corvisier, Armies and Societies in Europe, 1494-1789 (1979). All afford a thorough treatment of the subject. On the French Army see especially David Parrott, Richelieu's Army: War, Government, and Society in France, 1624-1642 (2001), André Corvisier, Louvois (1983) and John Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667-1714 (1999), which provides valuable extra context, expanding on the same author's Giant of the Grand Siècle: The French Army, 1610-1715 (1997). Gordon Craig, The Politics of the Prussian Army, 1640-1945 (1964) remains a standard text on the subject for this and subsequent chapters, but readers should also consult Dennis Showalter, The Wars of Frederick the Great (1996); Philip Dwyer (ed.) The Rise of Prussia, 1700-1830 (2000); and especially Robert Citino, The German Way of War: From the Thirty Years' War to the Third Reich (2005). The essential study of the Austrian Army is Christopher Duffy, Instrument of War: The Austrian Army in the Seven Years War (2000), a revised and expanded version of his earlier work, The Army of Maria Theresa: The Armed Forces of Imperial Austria, 1740-1780 (1977). John Childs, The Nine Years' War and the British Army, 1688-1697: The Operations in the Low Countries (1991) and The British Army of William III, 1689-1702 (1987) cove
