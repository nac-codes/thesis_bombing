erial Austria, 1740-1780 (1977). John Childs, The Nine Years' War and the British Army, 1688-1697: The Operations in the Low Countries (1991) and The British Army of William III, 1689-1702 (1987) cover the British Army during the period. Brent Nosworthy, The Anatomy of Victory: Battle Tactics, 1689-1763 (1990) is the essential text on the conduct of warfare, whilst Azar Gat, A History of Military Thought: From the Enlightenment to the Cold War (2001), delivers a comprehensive treatment of the evolution of military theory from this period onwards, important reading for this and all subsequent chapters. The Wars of the Revolution Geoffrey Wawro, Warfare and Society in Europe, 1792-1914 (2000) gives a good survey of the period, and although much older, Geoffrey Best, War and Society in Revolutionary Europe, 1770-1870 (1982) remains a useful study. For the wars themselves, T.C.W. Blanning, The French Revolutionary Wars, 1787-1802 (1996), and David Gates, The Napoleonic Wars, 1803-1815 (1997) provide the best general accounts. The best study of naval aspects is Richard Harding, Seapower and Naval Warfare, 1650-1830 (1999), whilst Rory Muir, Britain and the Defeat of Napoleon, 1807-1815 (1996) ably examines the economic and political context. Gunther Rothenberg, The Art of Warfare in the Age of Napoleon (1977) is a good guide to the conduct of land warfare, with much further information available from David Chandler, Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars (1979). J.P. Bertaud, The Army of the French Revolution: From Citizen Soldiers to Instrument of Power (1988) is particularly strong on the French Army's political evolution, and Paddy Griffith, The Art of War of Revolutionary France, 1789-1802 (1998) provides a detailed study before Napoleon's rise to ascendancy. The same author's For- ward into Battle: Fighting Tactics from Waterloo to the Near Future (1991) is very good on the mechanics of late 18th century battle, as is John Lynn, The Bayonets of the Republic: Motivation a
