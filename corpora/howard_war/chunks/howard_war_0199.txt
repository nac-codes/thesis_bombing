2004). This book, and John Lynn (ed.), Feeding Mars: Logistics in Western Warfare from the Middle Ages to the Present (1993), provide a good introduction to this important subject. For the German Army in the period, see Craig and Citino (cited above), along with Martin Kitchen, A Military History of Germany, (1975); and for more detail, Gerhard Ritter, The Sword and the Sceptre (4 Vols., 1969-70). On the French Army, see Gary Cox, The Halt in the Mud: French Strategic Planning from Waterloo to Sedan (1994); the still useful Richard Challener, The French Theory of the Nation in Arms, 1866-1939 (1965); and most importantly, Douglas Porch, The March to the Marne: The French Army 1871-1914 (1991). Istvan Deak, Beyond Nationalism: A Social and Political History of the Habsburg Officer Corps, 1848-1918 (1990) describes the peculiar problems of the Dual Monarchy. Useful on the coming of the First World War are David Hermann, The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War (1996), and David Steven- son, Armaments and the Coming of War: Europe, 1904-1914 (1996); but Hew Stra- chan, The First World War, Vol.1: To Arms (2001), is now the definitive history of this period and the first year of the conflict. Two further volumes covering the rest of the war are projected. James Joll, The Origins of the First World War (1984) affords a concise overview, and for discussion of operational aspects, read Arden Bucholz, Moltke, Schlieffen, and Prussian War Planning (1990), and the important work by Robert Foley, German Strategy and the Path to Verdun: Erich von Falkenhayn and the Development of Attrition, 1870-1916 (2005). For general histories of the war see David Stevenson, 1914-1918: The History of the First World War (2005); Michael Howard, The First World War (2001); Ian Beckett, The Great War: 1914-1918 (2001); and John Keegan, The First World War (1998).
