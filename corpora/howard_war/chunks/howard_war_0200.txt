Avner Offer, The First World War: An Agrarian Interpretation (1991), and Niall Ferguson, The Pity of War (1998), provide an economic perspective. On tactical matters, Paddy Griffith, Battle Tactics of the Western Front: The British Army's Art of Attack, 1916-18 (1994) is essential reading, whilst Martin Samuels, Command or Control ?: Command, Training and Tactics in the British and German Armies, 1888-1918 153 (1995) provides a stimulating comparative analysis, but must be read in con- junction with Gary Sheffield and Dan Todman (eds.), Command and Control on the Western Front: The British Army's Experience, 1914-1918 (2004). Ian Brown's excel- lent British Logistics on the Western Front, 1914-1919 (1998) is also essential to understanding the conduct of the war. On the French Army, see Robert Doughty, Pyrrhic Victory: French Strategy and Operations in the Great War (2005) and Anthony Clayton, Paths of Glory: The French Army 1914-1918 (2003). Norman Stone, The Eastern Front, 1914-1917 (1975) remains the primary work on a still understudied subject, and Holger Herwig, The First World War: Germany and Austria-Hungary, 1914-1918 (1996), provides a view from the other side of the trenches. Domestic aspects are detailed in J.M. Bourne, Britain and the Great War: 1914-1918 (1989); Trevor Wilson, The Myriad Faces of War: Britain and the Great War, 1914-1918 (1986); Roger Chickering, Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914-1918 (1998); Laurence Moyer, Victory Must Be Ours: Germany in the Great War (1995); J.J. Becker, The Great War and the French People (1985); and P.J. Flood, France 1914-1918: Public Opinion and the War Effort (1990). Arthur Marwick (ed.), Total War and Social Change (1988) further covers the impact of both world wars on European society. The Wars of the Technologists Michael Neiberg, Warfare and Society in Europe, 1898 to the Present (2003) provides the best overview of
