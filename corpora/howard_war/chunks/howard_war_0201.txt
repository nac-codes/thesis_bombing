further covers the impact of both world wars on European society. The Wars of the Technologists Michael Neiberg, Warfare and Society in Europe, 1898 to the Present (2003) provides the best overview of the period and contains useful bibliographical notes. More detail on the conduct of land warfare can be found in J.M. House, Combined Arms Warfare in the Twentieth Century (2001), and Robert Citino, Blitzkreig to Desert Storm: The Evolution of Operational Warfare (2004). Lawrence Sondhaus, Naval Warfare, 1815-1914 (2001) and Andrew Lambert, Steam, Steel & Shellfire: The Steam Warship, 1815-1905 (edited with Robert Gardiner) give a broad survey of developments before the First World War, for which period the detail of Arthur Marder, From the Dreadnought to Scapa Flow: The Royal Navy in the Fisher Era, 1904-1919, (5 Vols., 1961-1970), is yet to be surpassed. Jon Sumida, In Defence of Naval Supremacy: Finance, Technology and British Naval Policy, 1889-1914 (1993) provides a critique of Marder's work, whilst Eric Grove, The Royal Navy since 1815 (2005) gives a concise, up to date history of the service. Theodore Ropp, The Development of a Modern Navy: French Naval Policy, 1871-1904 (1987) is the essential history of continental developments during the same period. For submarine warfare, the best general works are John Terraine, Business in Great Waters: The U-Boat Wars, 1916-1945 (1989), and Peter Padfield, War Beneath the Sea: Submarine Conflict 1939-1945 (1997). Williamson Murray, War in the Air 1914-45 (1999) and John Buckley, Air Power in the Age of Total War (1999) provide a good introduction to aerial warfare with useful notes on further reading. Richard Overy, The Air War, 1939-45 (1980), covers all aspects of the conflict, including chapters on aircraft production, whilst Tami Davis Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare: The Evolution of British and American Ideas about Strategic Bombing, 1914-1945 (2002) is the most recent, and comprehensive, treatment of th
