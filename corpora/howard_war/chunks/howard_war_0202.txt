lst Tami Davis Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare: The Evolution of British and American Ideas about Strategic Bombing, 1914-1945 (2002) is the most recent, and comprehensive, treatment of the subject. John Terraine, The Right of the Line: The Royal Air Force in the European War, 1939-1945 (1997) is still the best single volume history of the service, and  154 NOTES ON FURTHER READING NOTES ON FURTHER READING can be usefully read with Williamson Murray, The Luftwaffe, 1933-45: Strategy for Defeat (1996). The best general history of the Second World War is now Williamson Murray and Alan Millet, A War to be Won: Fighting the Second World War (2000), but see also Gerhard Weinberg, A World at Arms: A Global History of World War Two (1994) and Peter Calvocoressi, Guy Wint, and John Pritchard, Total War: The Causes and Courses of the Second World War (1989). Richard Overy, Why the Allies Won (1996) covers the strategic, political and economic underpinnings of Allied Victory. For more detail on the British Army see David French, Raising Churchill's Army: The British Army and the War Against Germany, 1919-1945 (2000), and Brian Holden Reid, Studies in British Military Thought: Debates with Fuller and Liddell Hart (1998), the essential guide to British military thinking during the same period. For Germany, James Corum, The Roots of Blitzkrieg: Hans von Seeckt and German Military Reform (1993) is indispensable, as for France is Robert Doughty, The Seeds of Disaster: The Development of French Army Doctrine 1919-1939 (1985). John Erickson's trilogy, The Soviet High Command (1962); The Road to Stalingrad (1975); and The Road to Berlin (1983), along with Richard Overy, Russia's War (1998), cover the war on the eastern front, whilst Richard Harri- son, The Russian Way of War: Operational Art 1904-1940 (2001) details interwar developments.
