Operational Art 1904-1940 (2001) details interwar developments. Stephen Budiansky, Battle of Wits: The Complete Story of Codebreak- ing in World War II (2000) and Rebecca Ratcliff, Delusions of Intelligence: Enigma, Ultra and the end of Secure Ciphers (2006) cover cryptography and signals intelli- gence, whilst their operational impact is described in Ralph Bennett, Behind the Battle: Intelligence in the War with Germany, 1939-45 (1994). Epilogue - The End of the European Era For a summary of the Cold War, John Gaddis, The Cold War (2005) is the essential history. Lawrence Freedman, The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy (third edition, 2003) is still required reading on the subject.

For discussion of the late 20th century RMA in a historical context see Tim Benbow, The Magic Bullet ?: Understanding the 'Revolution in Military Affairs' (2004), and especially Colin Gray, Strategy for Chaos: Revolutions in Military Affairs and the Evidence of History (2002).
