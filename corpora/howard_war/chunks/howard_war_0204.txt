The Sling and the Stone: On War in the 21st Century (2004). Bruce Hoffman, Inside Terrorism (revised, 2006), is the best introduction to the subject; as for insurgency is Ian Beckett, Modern Insurgencies and Counter-Insurgencies: Guerrillas and their Opponents Since 1750 (2001), tracing the I55 evolution of this type of conflict from the early 18th to the late 20th century. A new book by Daniel Marston and Carter Malkasian (eds.), Counterinsurgency in Modern Warfare (2008), covers the 20th century in more detail, and includes chapters on Afghanistan and Iraq. For an in-depth examination of the way Western armies have tackled the problem in the past see John Nagl, Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife: Counterinsurgency Lessons from Malaya and Vietnam (revised, 2005). A general history of the Malayan conflict is provided by Robert Jackson, The Malayan Emergency: The Commonwealth's Wars, 1948-1966 (1991), whilst Tho- mas Mockaitis, British Counterinsurgency, 1919-1960 (1990) delivers an overview of the British experience. For Algeria, Alastair Horne, A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954-1962 (revised, 2002), remains the best account, with further detail given by Martin Alexander and J.F.V. Keiger (eds.), France and the Algerian War, 1954-1962: Strategy, Operations and Diplomacy (2002).
