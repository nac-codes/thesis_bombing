Appointed a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserves in June 1928, LeMay spent the summer in basic training at Camp Knox, Kentucky, with the 62d Field Artillery Brigade, Field Artillery Reserve. In July he resigned his commission and accepted an officer’s commission in the Ohio National Guard. His purpose was to get a priority placement into the Army Air Corps, a feat he achieved in the fall of 1928. After resigning his commission again, he enlisted as a flying cadet and completed basic and advanced pilot training at March Field, California, and Kelly Field, Texas, in 1928-29.

Given command of the 305th Bombardment Group (35 B-17s) at Muroc Field, California, in April 1942, he trained this inexperienced group briefly, then led it in September to England. Except for LeMay, no one in the group had ever flown or navigated an aircraft across an ocean before. Within days of their arrival they were flying bombing missions over France. Colonel LeMay’s 305th Bomb Group was one of VIII Bomber Command’s first four combat groups; it remained active in combat throughout the war, fl
