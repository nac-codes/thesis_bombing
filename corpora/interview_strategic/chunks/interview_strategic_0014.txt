His legacy to SAC was the command itself: an American strategic air force that had become the dominant element in contemporary U.S. military strategy and the single most powerful military force in the history of war. He remained at USAF Headquarters for eight years (1957-65), four as Vice Chief and four as Chief of Staff. During these years many of the Air Forceâ€™s most significant issues concerned strategic forces. These included the acquisition and deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles (Atlas, Titan, and Minuteman); continued modernization of manned bombers (B-58, B-70); standardization of all air refueling systems; evolution of advanced command control systems; development of satellites for reconnaissance, communications, and weather missions; and the establishment of a joint service strategic target planning agency.

Also in these years LeMay participated in the Cuban Missile Crisis (October 1962) and the early period of the Vietnam War (1961-65), both of which he discusses in this interview. In 1965 LeMay retired, having served the nation in uniform for thirty-seven ye
