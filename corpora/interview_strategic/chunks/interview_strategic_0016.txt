es’ preeminent strategic air force was the Eighth Air Force in Europe. Johnson flew and fought with the Eighth throughout the war, from its activation in January 1942 until victory in Europe in May 1945. The Eighth had only 24 officers and no aircraft when it went to England in April 1942. Three years and a month later in May 1945 it was the United States’ and the Allies’ largest and most powerful bomber command, with 171,022 people and 4,080 aircraft-2,646 bombers and 1,434 fighters. Johnson was one of the Eighth’s first four flying officers, having responsibility for operations and training in early 1942. He went to Europe in June 1942, working as a staff officer directly for Maj. Gen. Ira C. Eaker, Commander, VIII Bomber Command. Although the first American bomb group arrived in England in July, the first strategic air strikes were not flown until mid-August. From that point forward into 1943, a new American bomb group arrived in England every few months. Initially, these inexperienced bomb groups fared poorly in combat: bombing accuracy was poor, navigation was inaccurate, and crew and aircraft losses were high. General Eaker, his staff, and group commanders established in the fall of 1942 an operational training school in England. Johnson, as the command’s operations and training officer, had direct responsibility for starting and running this school. His successful leadership at the school led to his selection by General Eaker in January 1943 to command one of Eighth Air Force’s first combat groups outfitted with B-24 Liberators: the 44th Bomb Group. In the winter and spring months of 1943, Colonel Johnson’s 44th Bomb Group experienced perhaps the roughest time of any unit in the Eighth Air Force. The 44th had arrived at Shipdham, England, in November 1942 with 27 B-24s and 90 crews. Over the next 7 months the group received a few replacement aircraft and crews, but despite these additions the group’s combat losses were staggering: 20 B-24s lost in combat acti
