B-24s and 90 crews. Over the next 7 months the group received a few replacement aircraft and crews, but despite these additions the group’s combat losses were staggering: 20 B-24s lost in combat action and 7 damaged so severely as to be beyond repair. In one of the 44th‘~ bomb squadrons, the 67th, 90 combat crewmen arrived at Shipdham in November; less than 10 were alive in May 1943. In that month replacement crews and aircraft arrived in sufficient numbers to reconstitute the group; shortly thereafter General Eaker sent Johnson’s bomb group from England to North Africa for a special 8  File: --- interview_strategic.pdf --- Page 18 --- INTRODUCTION Cadet Leon W.

On August 1, 1943, the 44th flew, along with 5 other B-24 bomb groups (177 bombers), from Allied bases in North Africa across the Mediterranean Sea to Rumania where they navigated through heavy antiaircraft fire and enemy fighter defenses to strike the oil refineries. Johnson copiloted the group's lead bomber and led the formation over the target. So dangerous was this mission that 15 of the 17 B-24s in Johnson's formation failed to return to the landing base in North Africa. For the entire raid, 54 of the 177 B-24s were destroyed or damaged so severely they could not return; 522 men were killed or captured. Johnson and his crew hit the target and returned successfully to North Africa. For his leadership, courage, and heroism he won the Medal of Honor, one of five awarded that day. Shortly after the Ploesti raid, Johnson became the commander of Eighth Air Force's 14th Combat Wing-a wing consisting of two, later four, groups of B-24s and B-17s. For the duration of the European war he led this wing, participating in every major bombing campaign: Central Europe, Normandy, Northern France, the Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace
