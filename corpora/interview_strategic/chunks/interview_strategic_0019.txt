or the possibility of war against the Soviet Union. Then in February 1952, Major General Johnson returned to the United States to lead the Air Force’s Continental Air Command, a composite command of Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve forces. Three years later, he was tapped for a significant staff assignment. Like all of the military services in the postwar years, the Air Force made some of its most talented senior leaders available for national and international policy positions. A consequence of the United States’ leadership role in the free world, especially in coordinating the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO), these positions called for a combination of military, political, and diplomatic experience. In succession, General Johnson served as the Air Force Member, Military Staff Commission, United Nations (1955), and United States Representative, North Atlantic Military Commission, NATO (1955-58). In April 1958, he became the Air Deputy, Supreme Allied Command, Europe. His final European duty started and ended with a significant international crisis. In 1958 Johnson helped direct the successful Lebanon intervention, and in 1961 he witnessed the Soviet-directed construc- tion of the Berlin Wall. With the wall under construction and Cold War tensions at fever pitch, General Johnson returned to Washington and became the Assistant, then Chairman, of the Net Evaluation Subcommittee, National Security Council. In this key advisory position during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, he participated in decisions affecting the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War. In April 1965 he retired, completing thirty-nine years of military service. 10  File: --- interview_strategic.pdf --- Page 20 --- INTRODUCTION A native of Pennsylvania and the son of a lawyer, General David A.
