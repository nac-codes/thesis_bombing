bers until the mid-1930s. Both aircraft had technological improvements over the DH4s. Both were biplanes that had maximum speeds of 120-130 miles per hour, ranges of 700-800 miles, and bomb load capacities of 2,500 pounds.

They represented significant technological advances in aircraft design and performance. These bombers had two engines, all-metal frames, retractable landing gear, a maximum speed of 210 miles per hour, a range of 1,240 miles, and a bomb capacity of 2,260 pounds. They could fly faster and higher than any Air Corps’ pursuit or fighter aircraft. Because of these characteristics, air power advocates within the Army pushed for a larger role for strategic bombers in American defense policy.

LeMay] were up in those Great Lakes maneuvers in 1931?5 I know I was up there. LeMay: Yes. Johnson: It was just flying a formation around to show the people we had airplanes. LeMay: We really didn’t have an air force. We were an Air Corps, part of the Army. I didn’t know it at the time-I was at Selfridge Field in Michigan in the 1930s-and about all we got done up there was to open up airports. That was the mission assigned up there. The battle for an air force was on; we were getting nothing in the Air Corps in the way of appropriations for new equipment to make any progress toward our goal. It was a matter of educating the people and the country to the potential of air power in order to try to do something about the budget. That was practically the mission at the time: to educate the people. So we opened airports all o
