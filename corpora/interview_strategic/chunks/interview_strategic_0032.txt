people and the country to the potential of air power in order to try to do something about the budget. That was practically the mission at the time: to educate the people. So we opened airports all over the place and flew demonstrations and things of that sort. It was more like a flying club than a military organization. True, we had a little bit of gunnery here and there, but day-to-day we had no emphasis on tactics or preparing to fight an air war. It was almost like a public relations outfit; that’s what it amounted to, throughout the air force. As Leon says, overseas-in the Philippines, Hawaii, and Panama-we would have a squadron of bombers, a squadron of fighters, and some observation airplanes. We did have a squadron of attack aircraft over in Hawaii. We may have had that in the Philippines. But the basic doctrine was that we would have the bombers and the fighters to escort them, and we Alexander P. de Seversky (18961974) was a World War I Russian military air ace and aeronautical engineer who emigrated to the United States during the Russian Revolution of 1917. In the 1920s he was a test pilot for the U.S. Air Service where he worked on special aeronautical projects for Brig. Gen. William Mitchell. Later he founded a small aircraft manufacturing company in California, and by the mid-1930s de Seversky had achieved a reputation as an aircraft designer. The P-35 was a small monoplane with an enclosed cockpit. It had a maximum speed of 290 miles per hour and a range of 950 miles. The U.S. Army Air Corps purchased 77 P-35s and 60 P35As in 1935-36 from de Seversky’s company, which reorganized in 1937 and became Republic Aviation. In 1938 de Seversky designed and built a turbo-charged, air-cooled, experimental fighter which became the P-47 Thunderbolt. During World War 11, Republic built a total of 15,579 P47s. The Air Corps maneuvers of May 1931 were led by Brig. Gen. Benjamin D. Foulois, Assistant Chief of the Air Corps, who organized a provisional air division
