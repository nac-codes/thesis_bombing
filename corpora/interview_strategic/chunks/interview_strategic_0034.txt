L. George, Maj. Donald Wilson, 1st Lt. Kenneth L. Walker, and 2d Lt. Haywood S. Hansell, Jr., developed a set of concepts about air power. They believed that air power could directly influence the course of wars by having strategic air forces fly long-range missions and destroy an enemy’s industrial infrastructure. Further, they taught that these long-range bombers, if properly equipped with defensive armament and organized into massed formations, would be capable of penetrating an enemy’s defenses and striking directly at the enemy’s will to resist. As the decade of the 1930s progressed, these teachings developed into an unoffical doctrine of air power that became prominent in World War 11. For fuller explanations of these men and their theories of air power, see Robert T. Finney, History of the Air Corps Tactical School 192G1940 (Maxwell AFB, Ala., 1955); Thomas S. Greer, et al., The Development of Air Doctrine in the Army Air Corps, 1917-1941 (Maxwell AFB, Ala.,1971); Robert F.

Hansell, Jr., The Strategic Air War Against Germany and Japan: A Memoir (Washington, 1987). 22  File: --- interview_strategic.pdf --- Page 32 --- WORLD WAR I1 PLANNING LeMay: Speaking generally, I don't think many ever believed that was the way to do it. We had to do some unescorted missions if we were going to do any bombing at all. It could be done, yes. On the first Schweinfurt mission, for instance, I flew clear across Germany without any fighter escort and destroyed a target. But you paid a price for it.' Schweinfurt left in flames as Flying Fortress departs. ' Several major American strategic air raids in the summer and fall of 1943 persuaded AAF leaders that the bombers had to have fighter escorts if they were to fly deep into Germany on a continuing basis. On the Ploesti, Rumania, raid of August 1, 1943, 177 E24s attacked the Easte
