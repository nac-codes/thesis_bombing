uaded AAF leaders that the bombers had to have fighter escorts if they were to fly deep into Germany on a continuing basis. On the Ploesti, Rumania, raid of August 1, 1943, 177 E24s attacked the Eastern European oil refineries and did limited damage, but suffered losses of 54 bombers and 532 men. The strike against Regensburg, Germany, on August 17, 1943, used 146 €3-17s to assault the Messerschmitt fighter aircraft factory, with some success, but with losses of 24 aircraft and 240 men. The raid on Schweinfurt, Germany, also on August 17, 1943, saw 230 B17s hit the ball bearing plants, with a loss of 36 aircraft and 360 crewmen. In one day, Eighth Air Force had lost 60 aircraft, which was 19 percent of the striking force. Finally, on October 14, 1943,291 E17s struck Schweinfurt in a second massed attack. While the aircraft manufacturing plants were damaged, Eighth Air Force lost 60 bombers and 600 men and sustained damage to 138 returning E17s. So severe were these losses that Eighth Air Force did not return again to Germany until January 1944. The Schweinfurt-Regensburg raids have long been considered milestones in the strategic air war, when American airmen decided that daylight raids into Germany had to await development and employment of long-range fighter escorts.

Those Schweinfurt missions were unbelievable. I know that I was fortunate enough to receive the Medal of Honor for fifteen minutes of fighting, over Ploesti, and they fought for about five hours over Schweinfurt. I don’t remembe
