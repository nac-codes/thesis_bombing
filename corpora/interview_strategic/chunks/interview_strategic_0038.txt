The other point which is obvious, of course, is that the bombers out-ranged the fighters, so that the fighters could not make the long haul with the bombers. As General LeMay says-and I am just affirming-nobody wanted to go without fighters. When we started operating out of the Marianas, for example, and out of India-China against Japan, we didn’t have any fighters that could go with us. We would have loved to have had them, and as soon as we could, we got them, and used them. Johnson: At first, in Europe we thought we could handle the enemy’s fighters better than we did. We handled them quite well until they started those nose attacks on our formation and came through, breaking up the formation. I remember very well we were going to do a mission down to Bordeaux, and I asked, “How many fighters are there?” Intelligence had predicted twenty- five. I said, “Oh, we can handle those all right,” because the enemy hadn’t had much experience. We had no trouble with them.” But those yellow- nosed babies over there learned how to go through our formations, they would break us up, and we were in real trouble then. LeMay: Another weakness of ours right from the start was our horrible gunnery. Gunnery was pretty low on the totem pole in peacetime. You never could get enough ammunition. I remember down at Langley Field before the war everybody shot skeet. When that was cut out, I gathered up all the old skeet ammunition. Then I had the gunners fire the then-standard flexible gunnery course. I took them to the skeet range and shot up all the ammunition I had accumulated over a period of months. Then I ran them through the gunnery course again. They increased their
