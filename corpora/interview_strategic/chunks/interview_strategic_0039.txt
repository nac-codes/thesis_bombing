They increased their scores by 300 percent. But did that make any difference and did we get our skeet ultimately successful air battle against the German Air Force in the spring of 1944.

This Bordeaux mission took place on May 17, 1948, when 198 American B-24s and B-17s flew from England along the Atlantic coast of France and bombed German U-boat facilities and the ports in Bordeaux and L‘Orient.
