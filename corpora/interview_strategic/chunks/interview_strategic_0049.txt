rockets shot down 60 and damaged 168 B-17s and 22 B-24s. General LeMay commanded the 3d Bomb Division and flew the Lead El7 over Regens'burg and bombed the Messerschmitt aircraft factory. His division, equipped with long-range fuel tanks, then flew south across the Alps to North Africa, landing in a dust storm at Telergma and Bone airfields, Algeria. General Hap Arnold had great expectations for this long flight pattern-England to Gemany to North Africa-hoping to take advantage of the better weather in 1 he Mediterranean for launching return missions over Europe. These return strikes, Arnold thought, would confuse the German air defense systems. But LeMay dashed Arnold's hopes when he reported from North Africa that the maintenance and living facilities were insufficient, operating conditions poor, and crew morale uniformly poor. As a result of LeMay's counsel, no further such flights were conducted by Eighth Air Force.

The B-18, for instance, was a twin- engine, medium bomber with a maximum speed of 215 miles per hour, a range of 1,200 miles, and a bomb capacity of 6,500 pounds. This bomber was modeled on the famous Douglas DC-3, and after 1935 it replaced the El0 as the Air Corps' standard bomber. The Air Corps acquired 350 B-18s between 1935 and 1940. The A-20 was a twin-engine, light attack bomber produced by Douglas in the late 1930s. It had a speed of 347 miles per hour, a range of 670 miles, and a bomb load of 2,600 pounds. Because it was in production before the war, A-20s were acquired by the British, French, Dutch, and American air forces. The designation of heavy bomber was reserved for the B-17, E24, and B-29 bombers, which were four-engine, long-range, strategic bombers. See Swanborough and Bowers, US. Milifary Aircmfr Since 190
