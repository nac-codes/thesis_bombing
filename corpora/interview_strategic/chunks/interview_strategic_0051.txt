nd. For the remainder of the year, American B-17 and B-24 missions to the continent were characterized by small numbers, short distances, and limited damage to the enemy. The bombing mission to Lille, France, on October 9, 1942, was typical. Early in the morning the Eighth dispatched 108 E17s and E24s to attack railroad yards ;and industrial areas. First, the bombers of the 97th, 301st, 92d, 306th, and 93d Bomb Groups formed up over England and began their flight across the channel. Then, three P-38 fighter squadrons joined the bombers at mid-channel and escorted them to the target and back. En route, 29 bombers turned back because of mechanical or crew problems. The remaining 79 bombers flew to Lille and dropped 16,700 pounds of high explosives on the steel mills and rail yards. The bombing pattern was poor, with many bombs falling outside of the target area and causing many civilian casualties. Over the city, the German Air Force attacked the American bomber formation with FW190 fighters, but their successes were few, shooting down but one B-17, damaging another, and damaging 10 E24s. Despite American bombers’ defensive skills in fending off the German fighters, the mission had glaring problems. Inexperienced crews contributed to the bombing inaccuracies, and the performance of the E24s was very poor. Of the 24 B-24s that started from bases in England, 14 turned back for mechanical reasons, and the 10 thai reached Lille were shot up badly. When Lt. John Stewart, for example, landed his B-24, named Bomerang, it had more than 200 bullet holes in its fuselage and wings. His ground crew chief, IWSgt Charles A. Chambers, took one look and said: “Goddamit Lieutenant-What the hell have you been doin’ to my ship!” Freeman, The Mighty Eighth, 18-19. 32  File: --- interview_strategic.pdf --- Page 43 --- PROCEDURE at I.P. for BOMB RUN Eighth Air Force squadrons have fol- lowed three procedures in peeling off at the Initial Point prior to the bomb run: 1) The original procedu
