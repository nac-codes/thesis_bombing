ategic.pdf --- Page 43 --- PROCEDURE at I.P. for BOMB RUN Eighth Air Force squadrons have fol- lowed three procedures in peeling off at the Initial Point prior to the bomb run: 1) The original procedure, depicted in Diagram A, had the squadrons flying as a group, proceeding along the penetration- route as lead, high, and low squadrons. Just prior to the Initial Point, all three positioned themselves an the outside of the turn. This allowed the lead squadron to turn directly over the Initial Point and make its bomb run to the target along the briefed course, followed by the remaining squadrons. SQUADRON RETAIN ORlGlNAl ALTITUDE 2) Dingrum B illustrates the "fanning Out" procedure that was adopted, in which all three squadrons followed the penetra- tion rmte until they reached a spot not more than five minutes before the Initial Point. The lead squadron would then pro- ceed straight ahead while the other two positioned themselves to the outside of the turn. This enabled all three squadrons to turn and pass directly over the briefed Initial Point and move in trail toward the target as briefed with an interval of ap- proximately two miles between squadrons. 3) Diagrom Cdemonstrates yet anoth- er change that occurred in the procedure. Flak losses dictated that the column must be shortened for the bomb run so that each group's "passing-over" time would be I-s. Interval between squadrons WBS subse- quently reduced from forty to twenty sec- onds with the result that an entire group could pass over the target in approximately one minute.
