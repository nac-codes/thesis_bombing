st 17, 1942, when Col. Armstrong led 12 B-17s of the 97th Bomb Group, Eighth Air Force, to Rouen, France, and bombed the railroad marshalling yards. For this successful operation he received a silver star, distinguished flying cross, and the British flying cross. An advocate of strategic bombing in the 1930s, Armstrong had been Eighth Bomber Command’s first operations officer, and had commanded its first combat-ready bomb group. Within the Army Air Forces he was considered an expert on strategic bombing operations. Early in 1942 he wrote the first training manual for E1’7 and B-24 crews preparing to go to the European theater. In February 1943, Armstrong became a general officer, and for the duration of the war he led American strategic bomber wings in Europe and the Pacific.

That didn’t sound too bad to me. In ‘my stupidity, not knowing any better, I said, “We are going to make a straight -in run from the time we see the target until we drop the bombs off.” We are going to get a bomb run, and we did. At the end of the run, we went right over the target and got the pictures, and then I took the airplane off automatic pilot an
