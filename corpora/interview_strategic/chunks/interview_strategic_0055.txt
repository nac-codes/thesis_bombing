until we drop the bombs off.” We are going to get a bomb run, and we did. At the end of the run, we went right over the target and got the pictures, and then I took the airplane off automatic pilot and got out of there. I asked the bombardier how he did. He said, ‘Well, we hit the target, but I would have done better if it wasn’t for the clouds.” There was not a cloud in the sky; we were flying through pretty heavy flak. But we didn’t lose any airplanes. From then on we did it that way. Kohn: And your accuracy improved.

Actually, when you figured it out with the accuracy of an artillery piece, the enemy was tiring up at you and the quicker you got through where he could shoot at you, the less rounds could be tired at you, and the less chance by the laws of probability of being hit. If you weaved around, you stayed in the vulnerable area longer. It was actually better to go straight through. We just ignored flak-I did--right from the very start. We had an antiaircraft artillery officer in our division headquarters, and every time we had a mission he had all the intelligence informati
