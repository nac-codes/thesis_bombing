echelon than I was. We carried out the orders. We fussed about them sometimes and tried to get changes made, but they generally came down to us from the division, and we accepted them most of the time unless we had something we really wanted to change. 25 Li:. Gen. Orvil A. Anderson (1895-1965). Early in the war Anderson was Assistant Chief of Staff fix Plans, at AAF Headquarters. In the fall of 1942, General Arnold directed Anderson to set up an ofice that would compile and digest all of the data regarding strategic bombing operations and prepare reports for the President, JCS, Chief of Naval Operations, and the Congress. As head of this ofice, Anderson became familiar with all aspects of Eighth Air Force operations in Europe. Then, in February 1943, he went to Europe where he became Chairman of the Comlbined Operational Planning Committee, an Allied committee with representatives from RAF Bomber Command, RAF Fighter Command, Eighth Air Force, VIII Bomber Command, and VIII Fighter Command.

At the end of the war General Anderson served on both the European and Pacific strategic bombing surveys that evaluated the bombing campaigns. In the postwar years, Anderson served as Commandant, Air War College, from 1946 to 1950. 36  File: --- interview_strategic.pdf --- Page 48 --- WORLD WAR 11: EUROPE Kohn: When. the Ploesti order came down and when that planning was revealed to you, what was your first reaction to it?26 Johnson: I see you are implying that I was opposed to it.
