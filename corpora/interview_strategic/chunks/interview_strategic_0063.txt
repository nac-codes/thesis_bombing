was not succeeding because of poor weather and an unexpectedly fast jet stream over Japanese targets. According to historian James Lea Cate, LeMay’s decision turned essentially on operational factors: not only the difficulties of wind and weather, but the inadequacy of the enemy’s antiaircraft fire (two E29s shot down in 2,148 sorties), the lack of Japanese night fighter units (only two according to intelligence), and LeMay’s personal belief in the ability of the crews to fly the night missions successfully. But General LeMay was also under considerable pressure from Washington, where discussioin of incendiary attacks had antedated the Pearl Harbor attack, where the use of fire had been studied extensively by staffs and experts for many months. Previously, small incendiary raids hadl been tried in late 1944 and early 1945, but the success of these tactics led, between March and August 1945, to a focus on incendiaries against urban targets in the rest of the campaign. In all, XXI Bomber Command‘s bombers dropped 147,000 tons of bombs and laid over 12.00 mines in Japanese waters; 66 cities were devastated, causing by the most recent estimates 900,000 deaths and perhaps 1,300,000 injuries, and forcing perhaps a fourth of Japan’s urban population to evacuate the cities. Historian Cate noted that the change in operation concept and in tactics, and the subsequent campaign, “was to mark him [LeMay] as one of the very greatest operational air commanders of the war . . . .” See Craven and Cate, AAF in WWZZ, V, 608, 609-627, 754-755; Michael S.
