always had in the back of our minds to keep the loss rates down, not any more fighiing than we could pay for, so that we would have an ever- increasing force, and someday out in the future, we would have a force large enough to do the job.29 When we finally got a force over there big enough to do the job, we were pulled off the strategic mission to help to prepare for the invasion. Thousands of sorties were directed against railyards and bridges and everything in order to isolate the battlefield to prepare for an invasion. Of course, we were pulled off on other chores, like sub pens, and trying to help win the Battle of the Atlantic, and things of that sort that were pressing matters.30 Johnson: On .3 January, 1943, I took over the 44th Bomb Group, and we didn’t receive any replacement crews until late March or April. So we had a limited number of crews. Every time we went out, while we might lose none, we might lose one or two. At dinner that night over at the club, there would be vacant seats. It was awfully hard. You didn’t have to be very smart to figure out that if your force was going down all the time and you were doing the same number of missions and you were losing one and two and getting no replacements, your chances of surviving didn’t look so 29 American bombers (light, medium, and heavy) and bomb tonnage in the European Theater in World War I1 were: Bombers in Theater Combat Sorties * Bomb Tonnage * (Jan-May) 1942 607 9,749 4,964 1943 3,514 233,523 97,931 1944 7,904 1,012,101 683,605 1945 6,977 438,192 310,288 * Figures aria totals for all U.S. combat aircraft in European Theater, 1942-1945.
