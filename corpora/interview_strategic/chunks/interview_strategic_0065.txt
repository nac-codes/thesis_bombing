Everybody was just tired out, and then all at once, “bang,” everything was back to normal again.

The men had concluded, “We are not going to make it. We might as well get shot down today as tomorrow; let’s go.” It was that simple. Johnson: As soon as the replacement crews started arriving, there were no problems at all. I don’t mean to say that there
