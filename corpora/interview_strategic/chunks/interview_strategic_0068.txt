summer of 1943 the German Air Force refined its fighter tactics against the massed formations of Allied bombers. The Germans began using large formations of fighters, which attacked the Allied bombers first by firing rockets at a range of 1,ooO to 1,700 yards into the rear of the bomber formations. Then the German fighters shot off explosive cannon shells and sent air-to-air bombs into the formations. Finally, they concentrated their forces and attacked directly at specific three-plane elements of the Allied formations. During the week of October 7-14, 1043, the Germans used all of these tactics and weapons and shot down 148 American bombers and approximately 1,500 air crewmen. Although the American losses were severe, so too were the Germans who lost hundreds of fighters and pilots. During the late summer of 1943 the air war over Western Europe had become a war of attrition. Between July and October 1943 the American Eighth Air Force lost or “wrote off’ 454 bombers, the RAF Bomber Command lost 813 aircraft, and the German Air Force lost 1,229 fighters.

At first our fighters escortedl the bombers. Then we got enough fighters to hit their bases and destroy their planes. So while the bomber crews didn’t feel comfortable not seeing our fighters, we came back with a lot fewer losses because our fighters were beating up their airdromes. LeMay:: There were crews that went through their twenty-five missions without even seeing a fighter. Burchinal: We got a help from Goering, too, and Hitler, when they stood down the -209a and didn’t push through with the -262~.~~ LeMay:: That helped. The -262 would have made a difference if they had gotten ar quantity of them there. The time came when Doolittle did release the fighters from escort duty to more beating up of the c
