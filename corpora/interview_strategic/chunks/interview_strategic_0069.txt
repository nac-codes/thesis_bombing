ay:: That helped. The -262 would have made a difference if they had gotten ar quantity of them there. The time came when Doolittle did release the fighters from escort duty to more beating up of the countryside. Burchinal: And it worked, really. LeMay:: There weren’t enough enemy fighters then to make much difference. We had a mass of bombers, so we could go without fighter escort without an exorbitant loss rate. Johnson: Curt, I am going to put in one thing about the loss rates. We have talked about milk runs, easy missions. You never knew which were easy missions. We attacked Foggia, Italy, one day in 1943 when we were in North Africa. I never saw any enemy aircraft as we flew from North Africa to Italy. About two weeks later we went back up there, and we lost eight airplanes. The Germans had fallen back out of Sicily, and they were defending Foggia at ’’ Hiistorians have believed that the Luftwaffe’s defeat was due to several factors: un- warranted German optimism after the quick military victories over Poland, Holland, Belgium, and France in 1939-40; German failure to anticipate the need for full industrial mobilization until 1941-42; the pressure of the Allies’ Combined Bomber Offensive against Germany and the German Air Force in 1943-45; and finally, the poor leadership of the German Air Force by Adolf Hider, Hermann Goering, Ernst Udet and the top command of the Luftwaffe. See Murray, Strategy .for Defeat, 299-319. The Me-209, designed by Willy Messerschmitt, was a second generation, twin-engine, fighter-bomber which was beset with production difficulties until Reichs Marshal Goering canceled the project in April 1942. Instead, he pushed for production of the Me-262, a twin-engine, turbojet fighter, then under development. However, the Me-262 was plagued by technical, administrative, production, and political delays. So few of the German jet fighters ever flew in combat that scholars estimate that they had little impact on the sustained air battle that raged
