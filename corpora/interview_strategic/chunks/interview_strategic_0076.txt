Catton 4’ On April 1, 1945, the Allies invaded the Japanese island of Okinawa. A massive naval flotilla of 1,200 ships, including more than 40 aircraft carriers, 18 battleships, and nearly 200 destroyers, carried more than 380,000 Marines and Army soldiers to the well-defended Japanese island. The Japanese defenders, anticipating the invasion, had devised superb defensive fortifications, including long-range artillery hidden in caves, machineguns placed at angles to produce withering crossfire patterns, and long-range artillery placements for use against American amphibious and naval forces. The Japanese also had assembled some 700 combat aircraft, half of them kamikaze suicide planes. During the invasion, the Japanese attacked the Allied flotilla assembled offshore. For eleven weeks the battle raged. For the men who remained shipboard the experience was one of seemingly endless alerts, suicidal enemy air attacks, artillery barrages from the hills, and large losses of men and machines. In all, the 0.S. Navy had 4,900 sailors killed and 4,800 wounded. The U.S. Army and Marines lost 7,163 men, including the commanding general of the ground forces, Lt. Gen. Simon B. Bruckner, U.S. Army. The Japanese lost 70,000 military, 80,000 civilians, and the island. See Spector, Eagle A
