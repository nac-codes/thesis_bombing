hemselvla into those cliffs way back in the caves. We were dropping napalm on them from E29s at low level; then we figured out we had to drop the napalm inert and come in with firebombs to light it after it had dropped and seeped into the caves. To make it effective, we had to get the fire down into the caves. Talk about close air support! Catton: It tells you something about the value and the versatility of long- range air; it really does. In many cases it is the only force you can apply. LeMay: We got pulled off on other occasions. For example, I once got a message from the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying, “Support Halsey and his soiree against the Empire.” His plan was to take the world’s mightiest fleet and sail up to Japan. Starting down south, he would make a run in during the night, launch his airplanes, and then come back out, sail up the coast and go in 43 In June 1945 when organized resistance ended on Okinawa, American military leaders reviewed final plans for the invasion of Japan. On June 18, 1945, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with President Truman and outlined the plan for invading Kyiishii, the southernmost of the Japanese home islands. The JCS told the President the invasion would require 767,000 men and would probably, based on the Okinawa battle experience, result in 268,000 casualties. Some military inielligence experts predicted even greater losses. President Truman approved the Kyiishii intasion (Operation OLYMPIC) for November 1, 1945, and the invasion of Honshii (Operation CORONET), the next major island, for the spring of 1946. See Ray S.
