into those before.48 Catton: I led our group on the first mission out of the Marianas, it was an entirely different situation than the raids run out of India through China. We flew in formation all the way from Saipan staying low to the start-climb point for the purpose of saving fuel. We were still carrying a bomb-bay tank then, as you will recall. Then we climbed to put ourselves at altitude before we made landfall, which was very telling on the airplanes. So our altitude on the first mission was 35,000 feet. Burchinal: If you could get there. Catton: As we were approaching the Island of Honshii, I had never seen drift like we were experiencing. We were heading north, and we were encountering for the first time the jetstream. The correction that we had to make to hit the IP [initial point] was something like 20 degrees. At any rate, turning over the IP we suddenly found ourselves far downwind. We had a bunch of clouds, not total cover, but a bunch of clouds, and I have to tell you that the speed on the bomb run was very, very much to our disadvantage in acquiring sighting and getting the bombs on the target. Burchinal: The bombsight couldn’t handle it. It would spin, and it couldn’t handle that speed. Kohn: Was it the same bombsight in the B-29 as on the B-17, General Burchinal? Catton: Yes, we had a Norden bombsight. LeMay: The winds were so high that if you bombed crosswind to the jetstream the bombsight wouldn’t take the drift that you needed; it was too great. 48 Strategic air operations in the Pacific began in June 1944 and ended in August 1945. Initially, the B-29s flew from bases in China and used precision bombing tactics in attacking iron and steel factories in Manchuria and Japan. Then in late November 1944, B-29 operations began from bases in the Mariana Islands in the Central Pacific. These Mananas bombing operations also used bombing tactics developed in Europe where Eighth and Fifteenth Air Force B17s and B-24s were attacking specific military and i
