(Why the Navy was up there, I never did find out, but they were there.) Once in a while they would send out a weather report. I established a station at Mao Zedong’s headquarters in northern China. I sent a radio set and a team of officers up there, including a weatherman. The Japanese controlled all of the main cities, the railroads, the roads, and the lines of communications, but there were large areas of China, particularly in the south, that Chiang’s troops controlled. There were big areas in the north that Mao Zedong controlled. If we had an airplane go down in one of Chiang’s 49 India was the location for five large Army Air Forces staging bases for the E29s flying out of China.
