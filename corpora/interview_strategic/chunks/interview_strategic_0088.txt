revolutionary movement of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen split into two factions. Mao was the principal Chinese marxist theorist, soldier, and leader in the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek‘s Nationalist Chinese government. Chiang Kai-shek was a general and leader of the Chinese Nationalist government from 1928 to 1949, and subsequently, the Nationalist government in exile on Taiwan from 1949 to 1975. For almost thirty years, 1920 to 1949, the Nationalists and the Communists fought for control of China. In 1931 Japan seized Manchuria, China’s northern province, and in 1937 the Japanese invaded central China and forced Chaing’s government and armies to retreat into the interior provinces in the south.

Although smoke and debris obliterated the target areas for most of the B-29s, damage to the city was severe: 40-50 percent burned out. Maj. Gen. Claire Chennault, Commander of Fourteenth Air Force and Air Advisor to General Chiang Kai-shek, said that the raid “destroyed Hankow as a major base.’ Craven and Cate, AAF in WWZZ, V, 143-144.

I didn’t make that decision; it was made back in Washington. In my reports I recommended no more B-29s be sent to India because they weren’t getting as
