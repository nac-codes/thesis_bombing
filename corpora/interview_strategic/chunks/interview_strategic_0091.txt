hauled bombs from the ships to the hardstands and skipped the bomb dumps from then on until the end of the war. Our whole goal was to try to end the war before the invasion. We were not going to be able to do it continuing on like we were, given the weather and the problem of high-altitude visual bombing. We just didn’t have enough airplanes and enough time. So we had to do something radical. We had always been thinking about incendiary attacks against the vulnerable Japanese cities. All the figures indicated we had to have at least 400 airplanes to get enough concentration to start really large fires, and we didn’t have 400 airplanes. We also started looking at radar bombing. In England before I left, we had gotten some of the early radars over in a few airplanes. We didn’t get any good out of it at all. They couldn’t even find Frankfurt, a big city in the middle of Germany. We sent the radar-equipped planes as lead aircraft on a mission against Frankfurt, planning if we couldn’t see the main target to drop by radar. It did not work well. The APQ-13 was supposed to be better, but how much better I did not know.54 We had a professor from Massachusetts Institute of Technology out there who had been in the radar program right from the start. So I sent him up to “Rosie” ODonnell’s outfit on Saipan and told him to fly with about a dozen of the stupidest radar operators he could find and see if they could fly over this spit of land sticking out of the northern s4 Two basic radars were used in World War 11: AN/APQ-13 and AN/APQ-7. The former was developed in the war as a navigational aid. It consisted of a radar mounted on the aircraft and two or more fixed beacons on land or sea. The aircraft radar operator or navigator queried the beacons and by triangulation located the aircraft at a fixed point. Once the aircraft’s position was known, the navigator could plan a route to the other known position: the target. In early bombing operations over Europe, the AN/APQ-13 radar
