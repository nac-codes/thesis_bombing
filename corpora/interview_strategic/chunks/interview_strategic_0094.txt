1945. In the postwar years, O’Donnell led combat air forces in the Strategic Air Command and the Far East Air Forces during the Korean War. Finally, he served as the Commanding General, Pacific Air Forces, from 1959 to 1963. 56 On February 25, 1945, LeMay sent 231 B-29s to bomb Tokyo in the largest strategic strike of the Pacific war to that date. Each B-29 bomber carried one 500-pound general purpose bomb and numerous E-46 incendiary bombs. In all, 172 B-29s reached Tokyo, dropping 453.7 tons of bombs. The results, like the size of the effort, exceeded all previous air strikes. According to the records of the Tokyo police, 27,970 buildings were destroyed in the raid.

In the bomb load were some incendiaries. It was a total radar attack; the weather was lousy. But from photo reconnaissance after the mission, we realized we had burned out a pretty respectable chunk of Kawasaki, the first area we hit.57 So we knew the effect was there; Japan would burn if we could get fire on it. Kohn: Had you discussed at all the idea, before February, of altering the whole character of the campaign? Or, was it a matter of seeing what happened and saying, “Gee, this might work?’ Catton: Let me add a little bit to what General LeMay is saying, but from a little bit different perspective. When he arrived from India to take command of the then XXI Bomber Command, which eventually became Twentieth Air Force down at Harmon Field, Guam, I had a lead crew, and I was about to get a squadron. We had achieved some successes in January and early 57 Kawasaki, a populous industrial suburb of 300,000, was located immediately south of Tokyo and north of Yokohama, the large port city for Tokyo. 61  File: --- interview_strategic.pdf ---
