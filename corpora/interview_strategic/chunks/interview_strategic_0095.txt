When General LeMay arrived, from a crew point of view, there was a very substantial change. The training, the development, and the selection of lead crews became very prominent, much more so than it had been in the past. For at least a week (I don’t recall now-you will, Dave), for a week or two, we didn’t fly combat; we flew training missions around the Marianas. General LeMay was airborne during those training exercises. We practiced formation flying. We were practicing for day visual bombing at appropriate altitudes, and at altitudes where we would have substantial fighter opposition. We trained; I will never forget that. We flew nearly every other day on training missions, and I can remember the boss sitting up there saying things like, “Okay, lead of the 498th, if you can’t do a better job of lead, then change lead-now.” We really were in a training environment. We all got the message very, very clearly and learned that the leadership of the formation, just as General Johnson was saying, had to be far better than it had been in the past. So formation leads then became a very important criterion in terms of crew, aircraft, equipment, tactics, techniques-the tactical doctrine was refined. We really improved in doctrine and training. That’s when General LeMay opened up the lead crew school at Muroc, as I recall. About that time we also began to make use of the APQ-7 radar and achieved the versatility to make the application of the force effective. I do want to underline the fact that we had achieved some success before General LeMay got there, but after General LeMay arrived, we really put our nose to the stone in terms of training, doctrine, and air discipline.
