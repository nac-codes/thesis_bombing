A brilliant strategist and statesman, Marshall has been credited with being the architect and organizer of the United States victory in World War 11. He was one of the most significant American statesmen of the twentieth century. In May-June 1945, General Marshall and War Department planners were reviewing the final details of Operations OLYMPIC and CORONET, the Allied invasion of Kyiishii and Honshc, the two major islands constituting Japan. Air and naval leaders tried to make the case that military pressure, if air and sea operations continued uninterrupted, would become so great against Japan that it would surrender and the invasion would not be necessary. Marshall and his planners disagreed, citing the fanatical Japanese defense of Okinawa. Subsequently, all senior military leaders, including General Arnold and Admiral King, agreed on the plan to invade Japan. See For
