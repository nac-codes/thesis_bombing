and our effectiveness went way up. p Participating in discussions following Germany's surrender, from left to right, are Maj. Gen. Lauris Norstad, Gen. Henry H. Arnold, and Gen. George C. Marshall. 66  File: --- interview_strategic.pdf --- Page 79 --- WORLD WAR 11: THE PACIFIC Burchinal: In June 1945 we did another thing, also. By then there wasn’t any fighter opposition. If you saw a fighter, it was incredible. Our doctrine had always been to hit a target and keep hitting it until it disappeared, until we had destroyed it. At that point we took a briefing to General LeMay. We said, “What we want to do now is damage-not destroy-the maximum number of targets. Put them out of action. We want to break the attack into squadron formations and give a target to a squadron instead of to a whole wing or a group.” General LeMay said, “OK.” That greatly multiplied force effectiveness for short-term shock effect. Whenever we could fly day-visual-we had individual targets. The principal ground defenses, the AA fire, were centered around the big cities. The smaller areas, had little defense, but railyards and POL [petroleum, oil, and lubricants] targets and other meaningful targets were there to hit for squadron-size efforts.64 LeMay: By this time the lead crew business had started paying off, and we were getting some good visual bombing missions. I remember once betting “Butch” Blanchard ten bucks that we couldn’t do as good a job on a certain Japanese steel mill as they did on the cement plant in India that we had used for practice runs.65 Finally we got a pattern of bombs on a target that was as good; I lost the $10, and Butch framed it. But actually there weren’t enough visual days to do the overall job we wanted. Actually my target list came from the world almanac that we used for picking out the biggest industrial areas. Catton: We owned the air, and the opposition was minimal, so you could spread the force without risk of high attrition. 64 Within the Twentieth Air Force,
