then out to the targets and then repeating the procedure to bring in our supplies. In the Marianas we had geography very much on our side. During the initial operations, with that long, 1,500-mile flight to the target and 1,500-mile flight back, we suffered mechanical problems because of the high altitudes at which we were flying and the loads that we were carrying. And enemy action hampered us. We lost airplanes. But once we captured Iwo Jima,73 got “Mickey” Moore’s fighters up there, and once we could take a full bomb load out of Tinian, Guam, and Saipan, we really had a tremendous setup to do the kind of things that bombers are able to do.74 B-29s, mined the Shimonoseki Straits and Nakaumi Lagoon. This combined strike was the largest single one-day bombing effort of the Pacific War. Carson and Mueller, Combat Chronology 1941-1945, 683. 73 The battle for Iwo Jima, a small atoll lying midway between the Mariana Islands and Tokyo, began on February 19, 1945. It lasted for nearly 30 days and was one of the bloodiest amphibious landings and battles of the entire Pacific war. The U.S. Navy and Marines suffered 24,854 casualties-6,821 dead and 18,033 wounded. The Japanese defenders had proportionally even greater losses: of the estimated 23,000 Japanese soldiers and airmen defending Iwo Jima, only 213 were taken prisoner; the rest perished. Once taken by the Marines, the island became an air base for long-range fighters (P-51s) and an intermediate landing point for B29s returning from bombing runs over Japan. From March to September 1945, more than 2,250 B-29s, carrying 24,761 airmen, made emergency landings on Iwo Jima. See George W.
