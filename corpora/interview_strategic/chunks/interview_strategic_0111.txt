All the Japanese that we interviewed, including their top commanders, said that the war was over and would have ended prior to 1 November, the invasion date, without the atomic bomb. They said it was their realization that the military forces could no longer protect the Japanese people from destruction. One thing we haven’t discussed is the aerial mining campaign that we ran out of the Marianas with the 313th Wing, which was one of the most successful that has ever been done any~here.’~ In fact, we were starving Japan by late summer 1945, because all her ports were blocked with mines. They couldn’t sweep them, they couldn’t clear them, and it was a heck of a complementary effort as far as the forces were concerned. Catton: Nothing moved through the Shimonoseki Straits, for example, for months before the end.76 Burchinal: Between the aerial mining and the bombing, we tore up the Japanese so much that they couldn’t really move around. They were flat on their tail.
