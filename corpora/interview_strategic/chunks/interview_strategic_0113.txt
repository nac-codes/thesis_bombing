interview_strategic.pdf --- Page 85 --- THE LATE 1940s arrived in India, I was under General Stilwell for administration and supplies, so I went to call on him.” He was not in his headquarters; he was out in the jungle someplace. I left a couple of cards, said hello to his chief of staff, and went back home. I didn’t see Stilwell until he showed up in China one day when we were up there running a mission. He appeared right at the hot part. I said, “Come along with me until we get the mission off, and then we can sit down, and I can show you something.” So he did.
