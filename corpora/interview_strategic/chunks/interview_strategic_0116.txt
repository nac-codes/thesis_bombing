and four-star rank as Gen. Douglas MacArthur’s air commander in the Southwest Pacific. In that role Kenney was a superb tactical air leader, an innovator, and an articulate spokesman for the role of air power in warfare. A prolific writer, General Kenney was the author of several books, including a reminiscence of his war experiences, General Kenney Reports: A Personal History of the Pacific War (New York, 1949; reprint, Washington, 1987). Lt. Gen. Clements McMullen (1892-1959) was both Chief of Staff and Deputy Com- mander of the Strategic Air Command from January 1947 to November 1948. A senior officer in the prewar Army Air Corps, McMullen was a rated pilot, an aeronautical engineer, and an expert in supply and maintenance. During World War I1 he was a general officer, serving in the United States and the Southwest Pacific. He commanded logistics, maintenance, and supply organizations and in 1944-45 worked directly for General Kenney as the Commander of the Far East Area Service Command. Following the war, Maj. Gen. McMullen was Chief of Staff for the Pacific Air Forces before moving to the Strategic Air Command. When Kenney became the SAC Commander in March 1946 he retained his former position as US. Military Air Advisor to the United Nations. He devoted most of his time and attention to the United Nations’ position. Then in January 1947, Kenney named McMullen as his chief deputy, giving him wide latitude to run the command. McMullen reorganized SAC, changing its headquarters structure, personnel assignments, and training policies. For the situation within SAC in these years, see Harry R. Borowski, A Hollow Threat: Strategic Air Power and Containment Before Korea (Westport, Conn., 1982), 57-58. 14  File: --- interview_strategic.pdf --- Page 87 --- THE LATE 1940s Brig. Gen. Leon W.
