completed the mission as briefed: aborts all over the place, equipment that wouldn’t work, the crews that didn’t work, nothing worked. Afterward we got the commanders all together and laid it out: “Look at this.”” Catton: There were a lot of people in the command that weren’t satisfied, General LeMay. LeMay: I am sure there were, General Catton; however, the briefing I originally received indicated that everything was rosy. 85 When this Dayton exercise began in mid-January 1949, every SAC flight crew received a prewar (1938) photograph of Dayton, which was indicative of the outdated air intelligence of cities in the Soviet Union. Then, every bomb group flew a mission against Dayton, simulating the bombing of industrial and urban targets from 30,000 feet. Bombardiers were directed to aim their radars on standard reflector targets. Bomb scores revealed that the simulated bombs fell in a range of 5,000 to 10,000 feet from the target, an unacceptable margin of error. LeMay later remarked, “You might call that just about one of the darkest nights in American aviation history.” The significance of this failed exercise was that it revealed graphically the gap between SAC’S training methods and the flying skills needed to carry out the mission of the nation’s strategic air force. With only a limited number of long-range B-29 and B-36 aircraft and crews available, and the Berlin Crisis still unresolved, the poor performance by the SAC crew had far- reaching consequences.

General LeMay asked, “What’s wrong with SAC?” I replied, “I won’t tell you. I have three young officers here with me who told you, and they mentioned cross-training.” We were so busy fighting our headquarters and trying to get the training that we didn’t have time to do anything else. LeMay: That is another factor, a dise
