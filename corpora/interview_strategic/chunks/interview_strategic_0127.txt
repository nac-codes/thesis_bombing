We knew we had supremacy, and we knew what we could do with it, but no one wanted to start another war. We had just finished one. We saw nothing bothering us right at that time worth the cost. Curt certainly went to work and made a very effective, efficient force very quickly when he got back. Catton: Maybe this will put it a little bit into perspective, and you will all remember this. Once General LeMay got back (we are always pointing at this man, but that is natural), we went to work. We not only started developing a war plan for the use of the forces that we had, but we developed a programming plan-the first time I learned about programming-how we were going to build the force.
