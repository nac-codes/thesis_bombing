ces could be brought from the United States if there were bases prepared for them. Bombers could be brought to bear very rapidly. I believe that led to bases in North Africa, bases in England, and the rotation concept. SAC could deploy very rapidly.95 94 The Korean War lasted 3 years and 1 month. South Korea had a population of 20,189,000 in 1950; it suffered approximately 3 million civilian and 225,000 military casualties. North Korea had 9,600,000 people in 1950; it had approximately 1,300,000 civilian and military casualties. R. Ernest Dupuy and Trevor N. Depuy, The Encyclopedia of Military History (New York, 1986), 1251; Tai Sung An, North Korea: A Political Handbook (Wilmington, Del., 1983), 33. ” In these years, 1950-60, American military strategy was rooted in a national policy of containing Communism and a military policy of deterrence and retaliation against aggression. As articulated in a series of war plans developed in the late 1940s, SAC‘s strategic bombers and support forces would be based in the United States but flown to staging bases in Great Britain, Iceland, Newfoundland, Alaska, Guam and other places in preparation for operations against targets in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and China. Shortly after their creation, these war plans were refined; the changes stipulated prepositioning a certain portion of SAC’s bombers, tankers, supplies, and people overseas at the staging bases on temporary duty. There they trained, stood combat alerts, and were ready to strike quickly when ordered. By 1957 SAC had 30 bases overseas, located in the United Kingdom, Spain, Morocco, Greenland, Newfoundland, Labrador, Puerto Rico, and Guam. In 1956 a review of this prepositioning policy by RAND demonstrated that the Soviet Union had the capability of launching crippling air and missile strikes against SAC‘s overseas staging bases. According to this analysis, SAC‘s forces overseas were extremely vulnerable to attack. Partly for this reason, and because of two oth
