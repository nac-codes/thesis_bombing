LeMay: Yes, go ahead. Catton: We never used strategic concepts in Korea. However, available to General MacArthur and later General Ridgeway, was the atomic capability of a unit of the 43d Wing which we put on the island of Guam, at Andersen Field.98 Those were B-50As, atomic capable.99 General LeMay provided through Gen. Thomas S. Power, originally the SAC X-ray commander in Tokyo, the wherewithal to provide MacArthur with atomic weapons if the President decided to use them.100 We could have atomic weapons very reliably and very accurately delivered within a period of forces in order to carry out the strategic bombing campaign against Japan, and to avoid diversion of the bombers to support ground and naval operations. Their logic was accepted, and the JCS authorized establishment of the Twentieth Air Force. This precedent became important in the postwar years. In December 1946 President Truman approved a JCS “unified” command plan which set up eight commands: seven overseas theater commands (Far East Command, Pacific Command, Alaska Command, Northeast Command, Atlantic Fleet, Caribbean Command, and European Command) and one specified command, the Strategic Air Command. Under this structure, the commanders of each of these regional or functional grouping of forces reported to , the Joint Chiefs of Staff. At first, the term “specified” was not well defined and it was not until 1951, in the midst of the Korean War, that the JCS clarified the term to mean a JCS command with the same operational and command arrangements as a unified command but which consisted essentially of forces from only one military service.
