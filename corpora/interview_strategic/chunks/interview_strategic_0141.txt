ntially of forces from only one military service. See Rearden, Formative Years, 98 Both Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur and Gen. Matthew B. Ridgeway served as Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command, during the Korean War. General MacArthur led UN forces from June 1950 to April 1951, while General Ridgeway commanded the same forces from April 1951 to May 1952. 99 B50A bombers entered SAC‘s inventory in February 1948. These B-5OAs were a derivative of the B-29 bombers used so extensively in World War 11. The newer bombers had more powerful engines, redesigned nacelles, and a new, stronger and lighter wing structure. Between 1948 and 1955, there were as many as 260 B-50s and RB-50s (reconnaissance) in SAC‘s operational forces. Because the B-50s could fly long distances (up to 4,900 miles, unrefueled) at high altitudes (up to 36,000 feet) and were capable of carrying a large bomb load (up to 10,OOO pounds), they were part of the United States’ first line of strategic bombers in the late 1940s and early 1950s. See Swanborough and Bowers, United States Military Aircraft Since 1909, 91-95, 101-1 12. loo Maj. Gen. Thomas S. Power was SAC‘s Vice Commander (1948-54) and at this time the general officer in charge of the command‘s atomic forces in the Far East. In the midst of the Korean War, General LeMay set up a system of commands, each named for a letter in the alphabet spelled out phonetically, to control SAC‘s forces and weapons deployed overseas. The first two commands, X-ray and Zebra, were located in Japan and Great Britain respectively. In 1952 the phonetic command system was expanded to control all SAC nuclear forces allocated to support the unified theater commanders. By 1954 SAC had five phonetic commands: X-ray (Far East), Victor (Alaska), Yoke (French Morocco), Zebra (United Kingdom), and Oboe (Northeast Atlantic, Newfoundland, and Greenland).
