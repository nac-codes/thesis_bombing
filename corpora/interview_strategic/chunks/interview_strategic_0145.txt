Catton: This business, of course, as you can understand, had progressed from nearly no capability to deliver atomic weapons to the absolute necessity of being able to launch within very brief periods of time, within the warning time available. Eventually, of course, we got to where we are today, and we have been there for quite a while. SAC finally got custody of the weapons. We were finally authorized to load them on ground alert.

These procedures were further enhanced by the addition in the 1960s of electronic locking devices called “permissive action links,” which prohi
