the President to CINCSAC and to the operational forces. These procedures were further enhanced by the addition in the 1960s of electronic locking devices called “permissive action links,” which prohibited the accidental or unauthorized arming of nuclear weapons. These procedural and technological developments are discussed in Paul Bracken, The Command and Control of Nuclear Forces (New Haven, Conn., 1983), 179-237; Bruce G.
