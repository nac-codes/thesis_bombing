Historians are interested in how we viewed the target structure, what we knew of Russian warmaking capability, and the deployment and disposition of their military forces. When some people talk about the era of massive retaliation, they assume that all SAC was going to do was wipe out every Russian city and the Russian population, rather than attack Russian military forces. LeMay: Let me talk about that a little bit. To start with, when I first came back from Germany, there wasn’t any doubt in my mind that if we had to go to a full-scale war we would use nuclear weapons. That was the capability we worked on, to go to nuclear weapons. We didn’t consider any unit really combat ready unless it had a nuclear capability. Of course, we didn’t have very many bombs at the beginning. The stockpile was rapidly growing of course, but we had a small number to start with.lo6 There was a time in the 1950s when we could have won a war against Russia. It would have cost us essentially the accident rate of the flying time, because their defenses were pretty weak. One time in the 1950s we flew all of the reconnaissance aircraft that SAC possessed over Vladivostok at high ‘06 The number of American atomic weapons and SAC bombers for the years 194650 were as follows: Year 1946 1947 1948 1949 Weapons Nuclear Modified Aircraft 9 23 (December) 13 23 (January) 50 58 (December) unknown 225 Pecember) Source: Rearden, The Formative Years, 439; Rosenberg, “US Nuclear Stockpile, 1945-1950,” Bulletin Atomic Scientists, 25-30. 95  File: --- interview_strategic.pdf --- Page 108 --- STRATEGIC AIR WARFARE noon. Two reconnaissance airplanes saw MiGs, but there were no intercep- tions made. It was well planned too-crisscrossing paths of all the reconnaissance airplanes. Each target was hit by at least two, and usually three, reconnaissance airplanes to make
