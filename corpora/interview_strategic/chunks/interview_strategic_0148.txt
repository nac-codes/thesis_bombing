were no intercep- tions made. It was well planned too-crisscrossing paths of all the reconnaissance airplanes. Each target was hit by at least two, and usually three, reconnaissance airplanes to make sure we got pictures of it. We practically mapped the place up there with no resistance at all. We could have launched bombing attacks, planned and executed just as well, at that time. So I don’t think I am exaggerating when I say we could have delivered the stockpile had we wanted to do it, with practically no losses. Of course, that has changed now, but that was the condition that existed in the 1950s. Catton: I don’t think we ever had any great concern about being able to execute the mission from the standpoint of enemy action throughout the 1950s. We were quite confident that we could do that. Our problems were more operational, rather than the threat of being shot down by flak or fighters. LeMay: We were planning on a nuclear war. Then as time went on-the Korean experience for instance-it began to dawn on us that we might get some restrictions on the use of atomic weapons. Kohn: We have been talking almost exclusively about planning and flying operations. What was it like to be a wing commander in SAC in the 1950s? Catton: Very exciting. Johnson: It was first-rate. Burchinal: The best job around. Catton: A SAC wing commander-and there is a bias showing here-I think was the most sought after position in the Air Force. Do you agree, David? Burchinal: Yes. Even when I first got back to SAC, my first job was with the 40th, the last B-29 outfit in SAC.’” We were down low on the seniority totem pole; as soon as I would get a crew trained, they would pull it and assign it to one of the higher priority outfits. I was a replacement training center! The last B-29 went into storage out of the Mth! Catton: Salina, Kansas? Burchinal: Yes. lo’ From 1953 to 1954 General Burchinal, then a colonel, commanded the 40th Bomb Wing, a B-29 unit stationed at Smoky Hill AFB, Kansas. 96
