Thus people in the wings had more confidence in the plan, that it was the best plan that we possibly could devise with what we had at the time. Kohn: What was your reaction to the intercontinental missiles?'10 You all had grown up in the Air Force flying airplanes. You viewed yourselves as pilots. But here people were developing these ground machines. Was there opposition in the Air Force to missiles? Did you personally feel any? Catton: I think there was apprehension more than opposition. We were not sure whether missiles were going to replace airplanes, or supplement them. More than opposition, I think we wanted to be shown the reliability and the performance capability of the new weapon. Having said that, SAC indeed pushed hard for ICBMs, as well as for IRBMs."' Wasn't that your experience? Johnson: I believe so. Personally I was so delighted when I saw the Time cover years ago with 25 missiles on it that I said, "Gee, it won't be long before we can all quit worrying and go out and play golf." However, we really knew 'Io In the 1950s and 1960s the Air Force, Army, and Navy developed eight ballistic missiles: Jupiter, Thor, Atlas, Titan I and 11, Minuteman I and 11, and Polaris. Of these, the Air Force deployed operational units of Thors (1958), Atlases (1959), Titan Is (1962), Jupiters (1961), Titan 11s (1962), Minuteman Is (1962), and Minuteman 11s (1965). The Strategic Air Command had operational responsibility for almost all of these new units. See J. C.

'I' In the early 1950s the Air Force, Army, and Navy were developing ballistic missiles. Terminology identifying these missiles centered on range; ICBMs were intercontinental ballistic missiles with ranges in excess of 5,000 miles. The IRBMs were
