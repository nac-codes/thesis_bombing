Navy were developing ballistic missiles. Terminology identifying these missiles centered on range; ICBMs were intercontinental ballistic missiles with ranges in excess of 5,000 miles. The IRBMs were intermediate-range ballistic missiles with a range of approximately 1,500 miles. The Air Force, because of its strategic mission, was assigned development of ICBMs. The Army and Navy had joint responsibility for development of IRBMs until 1956, when Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson directed in a policy memorandum that the Air Force would research, develop, deploy, and operate all land- based ICBMs and IRBMs. The Army was restricted to deploying and operating ballistic missiles to a range of 200 miles, while the Navy was assigned development and deployment of all ship- based IRBMs. See Loyd S. Swenson, Jr., James M. Grimwood, and Charles C. Alexander, This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury (Washington, 1966), 23-25; Edmund Beard, Developing the ICBM, A Study in Bureaucratic Politics (New York, 1976), 196-197. 100  File: --- interview_strategic.pdf --- Page 113 --- SAC IN THE 1950s AND EARLY 1960s better. As the old wrestling coach used to say, “There ain’t no hold that can’t be broke.” LeMay: I never quite felt that way. I was glad to get missiles. As a matter of fact, some of those things were started back when I was in charge of R&D on the Air Staff. But look at it from the crews’ standpoint: they had practiced, practiced, and practiced. We had dropped atomic bombs; we knew what we could do with them. We have never as yet fired a missile with an atomic warhead on it. I think the Navy did one once, but that’s all. We have never fired a missile with an atomic warhead on it. In other words we have never gone through the whole cycle. So there is always some question: will they work? We have done everything humanly possible to ensure that they will, and they probably will, but we have never done it. Here again, in the back of one’s mind, is that first outfit goi
