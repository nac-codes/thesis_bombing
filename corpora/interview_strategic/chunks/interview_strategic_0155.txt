forces, the forces that were on TDY. As I recall we covered all their targets with manned airplanes initially; Thors and Jupiters, I think, were all backed up with manned airplanes. Johnson: Yes. Burchinal: One never counted on them as an independent strike force sufficiently reliable in themselves. LeMay: The accuracy of the first missiles was nothing to jump up and down about, either. Catton: Think about this for a moment. I remember when General LeMay pulled me into the headquarters the second time to do requirements, and I got my first briefing on something called Atlas.113 Christ, I had come from the 43d Wing, and we were still working real, real hard to bring our celestial navigation CEP down, so that we would be sure of a good radar fix, and hit 'I2 The Thor was developed in the mid-1950s as an intermediate range ballistic missile. Thor missiles could project a nuclear warhead approximately 1,900 miles. Between 1959 and 1965, the British Royal Air Force had three squadrons of the American-developed Thor missiles. Each RAF squadron had 20 missiles. The Jupiter was another American-developed intermediate range ballistic missile which was deployed in Europe, in single squadrons in Italy and Turkey. Beginning in 1961, the U.S. Air Force jointly operated these thirty-missile squadrons with the air forces of the host nations. The Jupiters were liquid-fueled missiles with a range of approximately 1,900 miles. By the end of 1963, both the Thors and Jupiters had been withdrawn from Europe. 'I3 The Atlas was a liquid-fueled, intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of approximately 5,000 miles. It was a large missile, 75 feet high and 10 feet in diameter, and was armed with a single warhead. Developed by a special USAF management team led by Maj. Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, the Atlas had the highest priority of any weapon developed and fielded during the Eisenhower administration. Begun in January 1955, the Atlas was rushed from research and development to opera
