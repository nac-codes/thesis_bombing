ll fall within a specified radius of a circle centered on the target. Thus, a one-mile CEP would mean that one-half of all the weapons aimed at a specific target or point would fall within one mile of that target. 103  File: --- interview_strategic.pdf --- Page 116 --- STRATEGIC AIR WARFARE Kohn: How about air refueling?

Remember, when “Jim” Gallagher made the around-the-world trip, those tankers were KB-29s equipped with hoses. ‘I5 I was General LeMay’s requirements guy, and I was supposed to be half-smart. He called me in one day. He called me Catton (he called me that for about seven or eight years). “Catton,” he said, “what do you think about air refueling as a capability we could put into the force?” I, in my brilliance and foresight, said, “General LeMay, I think refueling is a unique capability that we should perfect so we can use it in very specialized circumstances. We never should plan on broad use of it throughout the force.” That’s how I got to be a general! Burchinal: What did he respond? LeMay: I kind of agreed with him at the time. Catton: Thank you, General LeMay. LeMay: At that time we had those hoses trailing out of the tankers. ._ B-50 being refueled by a KB-29 tanker. ‘I5 On March 2, 1949, Capt. James C. Gallagher and his 14-man crew flew a B-50A, dubbed the “Lucky Lady 11,” on the first nonstop, round-the-world flight. The flight lasted 94 hours and 1 minute and covered 23,452 miles. The B-50 was refueled in the air 4 times by KB-29 tankers, which were specially modified EL29 aircraft. In contrast, less than a year earlier, 2 SAC B29s, the “Lucky Lady” and “Gas Gobbler,” flew around the globe in 15 days, stopping enroute 8 times.
