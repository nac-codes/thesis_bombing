-47, SAC'S first all-jet bomber. 'I8 The B47 was the Air Force's first all-jet bomber. Built by Boeing, the first flight of the XB47 was in December 1947, and the first production model, the B47A, arrived at SAC in October 1951. The range of the jet bomber was 4,000 miles. Boeing built 2,041 B47s for the Air Force and they were used in a variety of missions: medium-range bombing, photo-reconnais- sance, weather, and finally as target drones. In the early 196Os, the B47s were phased out of operation, with the last bomber leaving SAC in 1966. See Marcelle S. Knaack, Post-World War ZZ Bombers, 1945-1973 (Washington, 1988). 'I9 The KC-135 derived from developmental work done by Boeing on the famous commercial jet airliner, the 707. Produced for the Air Force by Boeing, the KC-135 was the Air Force's first all-jet tanker aircraft. Its first test flight was on August 31, 1956, and less than a year later it became operational in SAC (June 28, 1957). Capable of oftloading 120,000 pounds of fuel, the KC-135 had a range, depending upon the fuel load, in excess of 3,000 miles. Boeing built several variations of this aircraft for the Air Force's specialized missions: electronic reconnaissance, airborne command and control, electronic warfare, and military airlift. In all, the Air Force acquired 820 KC-135s and 45 C-135s. In 1981 SAC began a lengthy program to modernize the KC-135 fleet, equipping approximately one-half of the tankers with new engines and other modifications which are planned to extend the life of each aircraft by an estimated 27,000 flying hours (and the usage of the fleet to the year 2020).
