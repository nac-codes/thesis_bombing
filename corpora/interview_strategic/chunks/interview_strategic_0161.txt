Of course, it made a good transport, too, but they did it on their own, and we immediately bought that airplane with the boom. The boom produced a different ballgame altogether. Catton: We had the KC-97s with the boom first, and that was great, but to get a jet airplane to refuel a jet bomber force was reaZZy “arriving.”’20 LeMay: The KC-97 wouldn’t fly fast enough to keep the l3-47 from stalling when it had a full load of fuel. So in order to fuel, you had to dive the KC-97 to get up enough speed so that the bomber could get full and not stall off the boom. Catton: Even before that, you had to make the rendezvous. The KC-97s were operating at about 12,000 to 14,000 feet, and the l3-47~ up at 33,000 to 37,000 feet. The rendezvous was quite a trick, because you had to make a very precise descent to come out behind your tanker, go up to observation position, and grab-but we did it. We really did well. Burchinal: You didn’t waste any time once you got down to low altitude because you were burning fuel so fast. Catton: Yes. The KC-135 was a tremendous step forward because we were at jet altitudes and at jet speeds. The EL52 behind the KC-97 was a real lousy ’*’ The KC-97 tanker was the military counterpart of the famous Boeing Stratocruiser airliner of the early 1950s. Like the commercial airliner, the KC-97 (tanker) and the (2-97 (cargo) flew transoceanic and transcontinental distances (4,300-mile range). These aircraft entered the Air Force in July 1950, principally as refueling tankers for SAC‘S bombers and escort fighters. In all, the Air Force acquired 592 KC-97 tankers. Bowers, Boeing Aircraf?
