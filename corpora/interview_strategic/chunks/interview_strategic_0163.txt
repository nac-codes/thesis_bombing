with the Air Force in June 1955. They were all-jet, heavy bombers capable of carrying 28,250 pounds of bombs over an unrefueled range of 6,000 miles. Carrying a crew of six, the J3-52 went through eight major design models before the Air Force purchased in 1962 the last of the 722 strategic bombers. Still in operational service in SAC in the late 1980s, the B-52 holds the distinction of remaining operational longer than any other bomber in Air Force history. See Knaack, Post- World War ZZ Bombers; Bowers, Boeing Aircroft Since 1916, 337-347; Jeff Ethel1 and Joe Christy, B-52 Strotofortress (New York, 1981). 122 The B-36 was a product of the Army Air Forces’ long-range planning just prior to World War 11. The requirements stipulated that the B-36 would be a strategic bomber capable of flying transoceanic distances. Prior to and during World War 11, the El-36‘s development was preceded by the B-17, B-24, and B-29 bombers; consequently, it did not go into production until 1947. Between 1947 and 1959 the Air Force acquired 382 B-36 bombers; all were assigned to the Strategic Air Command. Despite the fact that no B-36 ever flew in combat, the bomber’s range of 7,500 miles and its payload of 72,000 pounds, made it a crucial part of the nation’s deterrent forces in the early 1950s. The B-36 was one of the largest aircraft ever built, with a wing span of 230 feet, a length of 162 feet, and 10 engines. Andrew W. Waters, All the US.

The degree of capability to fight at different parts or portions of the spectrum is what really matters. Burchinal: Of course, we didn’t have that much capability in other parts of the Air Force in the early to mid-1950s. We had it mostly in SAC. Catton: “Massive” referred to what we could do proportionately to what the Russi
