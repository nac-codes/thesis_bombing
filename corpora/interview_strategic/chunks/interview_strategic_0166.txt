Capable of flying over 2,000 miles per hour at altitudes as high as 85,000 feet, the SR-71 has become one of the United States’ principal manned reconnaissance platforms.

Hallion, Test Pilots: The Frontiersmen of Flight (New York, 1981), 240-244. 126 The Skybolt missile was an air-to-ground nuclear missile with a range of approximately 800 miles. Originally developed by the Air Force in the mid-l950s, the Skybolt was supported strongly by the British who
