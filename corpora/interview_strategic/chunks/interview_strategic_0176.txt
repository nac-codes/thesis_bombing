Ellis (1919- ), a native of Delaware, graduated from Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in 1941. Following Pearl Harbor, he joined the Army Air Forces, serving in the Pacific. In 1944, Ellis became a colonel at age 25, one of the youngest in the Army Air Forces. After the war he returned to school, completing a law degree. During the Korean War he was recalled to active duty, serving as an operations planner in the United States and Europe. When that war ended, Colonel Ellis remained in the Air Force, holding a succession of staff and command positions. From 1961 to 1963 he was General LeMay’s executive ofticer at Headquarters, USAF.
