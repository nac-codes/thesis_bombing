hem. Our involvement was not overtly in combat at that point, only with our Military Assistance Advisory Group.13’ Until 1961, the United States had a small military advisory group of less than 700 men in South Vietnam. During the Kennedy administration (1961-63), the number of American military advisors in Vietnam increased to 16,263, including 4,600 Air Force personnel. In the first year of the Johnson administration that figure grew to 23,310. The Americanization of the war began in 1965 with the introduction of large units of Army and Marine forces. By the end of 1965, there were 180,000 American military personnel in Vietnam; by January 1969 that figure had grown to 542,000. In the early years code names were used to designate combat forces in Vietnam. FARM GATE was the code name for the first Air Force combat unit, the 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron, sent to Vietnam in October 1961. The squadron’s mission was to train the South Vietnamese air forces in counterinsurgency tactics and to fly combat operations in support of U.S. Army Special Forces and Rangers.

Futrell, The United States Air Force in Southeast Asia: The Advisory Years to 1965 (Washington, 1981), 79-84, 127-134, 136146, 157-159; Stanley Karnow, Vietnam: A History (New York, 1983), 206240. 13’ American Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) went to Saigon, South Viet- nam, in 1950 with 65 officers and men. With few exceptions this was an Army group, and its mission was administrative: to assist the French military in Indo-China in requisitioning, procuring, and receiving American supplies and equipment. After the Geneva Conference of 1954 and the French withdrawal, the American MAAG remained in Saigon, although its mission was altered to include training of the South Vietnamese forces. Led by Lt. Gen. Samuel T. Williams, U.S. Army, the size of the group fluctuated between 600 and 700 men drawn from all of the military services
