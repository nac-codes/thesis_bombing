A brilliant student and leader, he went into the Field Artillery but returned to the academy to teach on two occasions in the interwar years. In July 1941, he joined the staff of Gen. George C. Marshall, Army Chief of Staff. In World War I1 Taylor served as Chief of Staff of the 82d Airborne Division, and later Commander of the lOlst Airborne Division. He led that division in the Normandy Invasion, parachuting behind Utah Beach and capturing key causeways leading from the beaches to the interior areas. Following the war, he rose in the Army, becoming Superintendent of West Point (1946-49); Commander, U.S. Eighth Army in Korea (1953); and Chief of Staff, U.S. Army (1955-59). He retired in 1959 and wrote a successful book, The Uncertain Trumpet (1959), which criticized the Eisenhower administra- tion’s military policy of massive retaliation and advocated a new policy of flexible response.
