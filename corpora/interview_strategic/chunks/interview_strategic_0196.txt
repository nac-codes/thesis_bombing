, General LeMay, that if we had been able to go get those 90 targets-and we certainly would have succeeded-we would have saved tens of thousands of lives and many, many years and billions of dollars in that effort. I think we could have made the point way back in 1964-65 by taking on those 90 targets and destroying them. LeMay: Well, I spent a lot of time trying to bring out the point that in any two-week period or so, we could have, with the proper application of air and naval power, won the war over there. Catton: That’s the point I was hoping you would make. Burchinal: We should have gone incendiary like we did in Japan: warned them to get out of the way, and then destroyed their means to exist. It wouldn’t have cost anything in the way of casualties, really. LeMay: I want to point out that if you look at the tonnage figures, at the tonnage of bombs that we dropped in the Vietnamese affair, and compare it with what we dropped on Japan and what we dropped on Germany, you will find that we dropped more on Vietnam than we did on Germany and Japan combined.’52 Look what happened to Germany, and above all, look what happened to Japan. There was no invasion necessary there. The only conclusion you can draw is that we were bombing the wrong things in Vietnam. Kohn: Perhaps you are saying that in the end, the ultimate target is the will of the enemy. It is something Douhet raised back in the 1920s: that you destroy enough or so much that your enemy simply ceases to make war against you. Burchinal: Destroy the will and capability; separate the two. ’” The Comparative U.S. bomb tonnage for World War 11, Korea, and Vietnam was as follows: World War I1 European Theater Pacific Theater Korean War Vietnam War 2,700,000 tons 650,000 tons 678,000 tons 6,162,000 tons Source: US.
