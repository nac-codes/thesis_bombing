hings unless you are a courageous guy with absolute integrity and dedication. I use the term image instead of mystique, but I like mystique better. Burchinal: But it is not necessarily charisma. Catton: I scratched out charisma, Dave. Kohn: Gentlemen, I greatly appreciate your time and effort in these interviews. Discussing the leadership of General LeMay is a fine way to end the interview. Johnson: Let me cut in here. I say that the people in the units want to look up to their leaders. They are very anxious to look up to their leaders. If they see that their leaders are trying, are honest and knowledgeable-I wonâ€™t repeat all the words of Generals Catton and Burchinal because I agree with all of them. But people will follow their leaders if they see the leaders are trying to do the right thing. Kohn: Thank you all again for sharing your thinking and experiences with the Air Force. 131  File: --- interview_strategic.pdf --- Page 145 --- Bibliography Oral Histories The United States Air Force Historical Research Center at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, maintains an extensive oral history collection.
