ll"? Are attacks on the enemy's urban centers militarily sound? Are they morally jus- tified? Or if they are militarily sound, are they justified ipso facto? Neither air power theorists nor air force generals have agreed on the answers to these questions, and the debates over them have been very much a part of the bomber's story. If strategic bombing has been a controversial subject, it can also become an extremely technical one. Here I have tried to avoid adding needless complexities to what is after all a broad-stroke history intended for general readers. Finally, I have made a choice every his- torian must make when writing a book of this nature: I have chosen ix  CHAPTER 1 x FOREWORD to place myself-and the reader-outside of the action, rather than in the middle of it. Some who read this book may regret that I did not take them through the darkened streets of London during the Blitz or send them over Germany inside a careening Lancaster bomber. But we can do more than simply know past events vicariously; we can understand them as well if we can see them and the men who partic- ipated in them in perspective, against the proper backdrop of time and place. In military history, then, the secret is to remain above the bat- tle, yet not so far above it that the participants become faceless pawns. I leave it to the reader to determine if I have succeeded. A WEAPON IS BORN ON NOVEMBER 21, 1783, man turned a page in his history. On that day a crowd gathered at the outskirts of Paris to watch a physician and an army officer climb into the gondola of a hot-air balloon and become the first men to fly. To be sure, there had been some preliminary experiments earlier that year with the newly devised balloon: animals had been sent aloft and had returned no worse for wear, and men had already made a modest ascent in a carefully tethered balloon. But this was man's first free flight, and it was at once epochal and uneventful. The balloon rose gently to a height of about three tho
