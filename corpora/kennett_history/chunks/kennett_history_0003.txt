ad already made a modest ascent in a carefully tethered balloon. But this was man's first free flight, and it was at once epochal and uneventful. The balloon rose gently to a height of about three thousand feet, drifted across the city, and then settled to earth again after being air- borne for about twenty-five minutes. The first balloon flights caused a sensation throughout Europe. Ascensions multiplied, both in the hot-air Montgolfières and in the hydrogen-filled Charlières. The decade of the 1780s was in many ways a frivolous and jaded age, and it took the new "aerostatic machines" to its heart. Ascensions became as fashionable as costume balls, and so numerous that the Paris city authorities had to issue an ordinance governing their use-the world's first air traffic regulations. The dis- tinctive form of the balloon lent itself to objects as diverse as chair backs and snuff boxes. Dr. Samuel Johnson regarded this "balloono- mania" as quite without justification. With the balloon man could now mount into the air, but that was all he could do: "The vehicles can 1  2 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING 1 A WEAPON IS BORN 3 serve no use until we can guide them."1 A full century would pass before the balloon became steerable, or, more properly, dirigible. From the beginning, soldiers were intrigued by the balloon and what it might mean for the future of warfare. A French officer named Jean-Baptiste-Marie Meusnier proposed constructing an elongated balloon driven by propellers; his sketch, dating from 1785, looks remarkably like the zeppelins that made their appearance a century later. In England, military ballooning had a warm partisan in Maj. Gen. John Money. He was one of the first English aeronauts, making two ascensions in 1785. On one of his first flights an "improper cur- rent" blew him out over the English Channel, where his balloon went down and he spent seven hours treading water before a boat happened along to rescue him. Nothing daunted, Money continued his in
