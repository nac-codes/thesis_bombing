ur- rent" blew him out over the English Channel, where his balloon went down and he spent seven hours treading water before a boat happened along to rescue him. Nothing daunted, Money continued his interest in balloons; in 1803 he published A Short Treatise on the Use of Bal- loons, in which he proposed that the British army adopt them as "observators." By that time the idea was no longer novel, for in 1794 the French revolutionary government had created a corps of balloon- ists, or aérostiers, who were to travel with the armies and serve as their eyes. The military balloons got some use, but authorities could not agree whether they were worth the considerable trouble involved in transporting and inflating them. After several years of trials the gov- ernment decided to close down the service. The balloons were with- drawn and the aérostiers found themselves transferred to more con- ventional duties. Here and there, reflective soldiers tried to see in the new devices something more than elevated observation posts. A writer in a German military review predicted that the first nation to occupy and control the air would be in a position to impose Universal-monarchie, which was the eighteenth century's way of saying global dominance. Some of the visions were ominous, revealing aerial weapons of awesome power. A Prussian lieutenant of engineers named J. C. G. Hayne was so impressed by the experiments in Paris that by January 1784 he had dashed off an entire book, the first lengthy work on military aeronau- tics. Hayne considered the balloon as a weapon and found it poten- tially a very powerful one. Balloons could undoubtedly be made to carry cannon, although Hayne was not quite sure how the guns would be accurately aimed or their recoil absorbed. Beyond a doubt, the bal- loon could be used to drop "grenades and other harmful things" on enemy troops and positions.2 It could rain down fire and destruction on whole towns, with catastrophic results for the inhabitants.
