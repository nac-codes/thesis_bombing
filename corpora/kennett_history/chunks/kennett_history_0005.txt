n could be used to drop "grenades and other harmful things" on enemy troops and positions.2 It could rain down fire and destruction on whole towns, with catastrophic results for the inhabitants. Some defenses might be possible: mortars could fire explosive charges at the balloons, while houses might fare better if they had armored roofs. But in the long run, Hayne felt this terrible danger would be removed another way. As the use of aerostatic machines for war became gen- eral and consequently a threat to all potential belligerents, the princes of his enlightened age would agree upon rules that would keep them from being instruments of terror and mass destruction. Such enlightened self-interest and reasoned moderation in war were real enough when Hayne wrote, but they would soon disappear in the fierce wars of the French revolutionary era. The French revo- lutionaries were willing to go to unusual lengths to ensure the triumph of their cause, as they demonstrated during the Reign of Terror and in their use of that new invention the guillotine. And in that desperate year of 1793, when the Jacobin leadership had to face both foreign invasion and domestic insurrection, there was talk of using the balloon as a weapon of terror and mass destruction against the rebellious city of Toulon. The plan, if it can be called that, seems to have come from one of the inventive balloon pioneers-the Montgolfier brothers, Joseph Michel and Jacques Ã‰tienne-who proposed to transport over the city by aerostatic means some fourteen tons of explosives, which would then be dropped on the rebellious town and level it. How seri- ously this massive aerial bombardment was considered we do not know. In any event, Toulon soon succumbed to a conventional siege directed by a rising young officer named Napoleon Bonaparte. The next time we hear of a terrifying air weapon, it is at the other end of Europe, and that episode too involved Napoleon. Sometime in the spring of 1812, when the emperor of the
