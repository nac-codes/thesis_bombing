Napoleon Bonaparte. The next time we hear of a terrifying air weapon, it is at the other end of Europe, and that episode too involved Napoleon. Sometime in the spring of 1812, when the emperor of the French was already mar- shaling his armies for the invasion of Russia, a German named Franz Leppig paid a visit to Czar Alexander I's diplomatic representative in Stuttgart.

He called himself Schmidt and told the workers, who were toiling away seventeen hours a day, that they were building agricultural machines.

If surviving pictures of it are accurate, the Leppig vessel resembled a fat, tailless fish. The envelope contained enough hydrogen to take the test model into the air, but the crude "wings" that were to propel it did not work satis- factorily. By this time, the French army was at the gates of
