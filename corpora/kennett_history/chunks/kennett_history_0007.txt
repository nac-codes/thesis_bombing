he envelope contained enough hydrogen to take the test model into the air, but the crude "wings" that were to propel it did not work satis- factorily. By this time, the French army was at the gates of Moscow, so Leppig and his balloons were hastily evacuated. The inventor and his creations took refuge in one town and then in another. Leppig con- tinued his tests when he could, but without great success. A Russian official reported that the airship could rise only a few yards in the air and was incapable of making headway against the slightest breeze. Alexander grew impatient and had his artillery experts give their judgment on the project. They pronounced it hopeless. Leppig left Russia soon afterward, having spent 180,000 rubles of the czar's money. The governor of Moscow pronounced the whole scheme pre- posterous and called Leppig a charlatan. More recent judgments are not so harsh. The basic design of the craft was eminently sensible. Leppig's arrangement for attaching the elongated balloon to a rigid keel presaged by many decades the first semirigid airships. Where Leppig ran into trouble, as did many aerial "mechanics" who followed him, was in trying to govern the movements of the craft once it was airborne. Even if man could not for the time being control the balloon's movement, he might still be able to use it as a weapon, provided nature cooperated with a favorable wind. This was the view put forward dur- ing the Mexican War of 1846-48 by a pioneer American aeronaut named John Wise. Wise suggested that tethered balloons bearing explosive charges could be sent aloft upwind of the Mexican-held Fort San Juan de Ulloa. The balloons would be reeled out until they were positioned over the fort and then would be made to rain their charges down on the Mexicans. This plan was never put into effect. At the same time that the Mexican War was coming to an end, a cycle of violent revolutionary movements was sweeping over Europe. One of the major battlegrounds was Italy,
