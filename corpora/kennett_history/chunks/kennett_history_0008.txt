n was never put into effect. At the same time that the Mexican War was coming to an end, a cycle of violent revolutionary movements was sweeping over Europe. One of the major battlegrounds was Italy, where there was an uprising to throw off the yoke of the Austrian Hapsburgs. The Hapsburgs fought back and ultimately regained the upper hand. The fighting in Italy provided the first occasion during which a city was actually to be attacked with airborne bombs. The city was Venice, and the occa- sion was the siege that the Austrians mounted against it in the sum- mer of 1849. The siege was not an easy one. Cholera and other dis- eases broke out among the Austrian troops, and in an effort to stem the contagion, the Austrians ordered the abandonment of several siege batteries in low-lying and swampy areas. The Austrian fleet had the port effectively blockaded, but its vessels drew too much water and therefore could not get close to the city. From the sea, as from the land, the besiegers were having difficulty bringing the city under the fire of their heavy guns. In June, Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky, commander of the Austrian forces in Italy, complained that the closest batteries were several thousand yards from the city. Radetzky had heard that the Austrian artillery had a new technique by which a city could be bombarded with projectiles borne by balloons. If there was such a weapon, now was the time to use it. The technique Radetzky spoke of was the work of an Austrian lieu- tenant of artillery named Franz Uchatius, who had been conducting tests with it during the spring of 1849. The weapon consisted of a hot- air balloon carrying a bomb designed to explode on any sharp impact. The balloon was a small affair, eighteen feet in diameter and inexpen- sively made of linen and paper. The bomb was a pear-shaped con- tainer of cast iron filled with gunpowder. To use the Uchatius balloon bomb, the bombardier had first to study air currents and distances, take a position upwind
