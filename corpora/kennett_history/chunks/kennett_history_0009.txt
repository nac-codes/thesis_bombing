paper. The bomb was a pear-shaped con- tainer of cast iron filled with gunpowder. To use the Uchatius balloon bomb, the bombardier had first to study air currents and distances, take a position upwind of the target, and calculate the number of min- utes it would take the balloon to drift over its objective. Then he would cut a requisite length of fuse, light it, and set the balloon free. The fuse ultimately reached and burned through the connection between balloon and bomb, releasing the latter. If the calcuations were accu- rate and the wind held, it was possible to release bombs over targets as far as four miles away. Lieutenant Uchatius headed for Venice, carrying with him 14 of his balloons; an additional 110 were to follow shortly. Preliminary study told Uchatius that the balloons could not be sent over Venice from any land position. The devices would have to be released from  6 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING A WEAPON IS BORN 7 shipboard, and for this purpose Uchatius installed himself and his apparatus on the paddle steamer Vulkan. On July 12, Uchatius released an unarmed test balloon from the deck of the Vulkan and then a fully armed one, which appeared to drop its bomb inside the city. Bad weather made it impossible to continue until July 15, when a second series went aloft. Then bad weather returned and obliged the Austrian fleet to weigh anchor and lift the blockade, thus ending the experiment. The exact number of balloons Uchatius released is not known, but the largest number given by any source is 200. What was the practical effect of this first aerial bombardment of a city? The Austrian press spoke of its "frightful effects" and hinted that it would now be easy to reduce the Queen of the Adriatic to a pile of rubble. These reports were obviously quite far from the truth, for almost all the bombs seem to have dropped harmlessly into the water. An Italian writer claimed that only a single projectile had hit the city and that it exploded harmlessly on the
