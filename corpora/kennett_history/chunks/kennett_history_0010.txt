rom the truth, for almost all the bombs seem to have dropped harmlessly into the water. An Italian writer claimed that only a single projectile had hit the city and that it exploded harmlessly on the Lido. The Venetians seem to have largely ignored the threat from the skies. (General Gug- lielmo Pepe, who left an account of his stay in the besieged city, barely mentioned the balloon bombs.) Most likely the defenders were preoc- cupied with more mundane problems, such as overcrowding, spoiled provisions, contaminated water, and an epidemic of cholera. Some ver- sions of the bombardment say that the wind shifted, so that the bal- loons returned over the horrified Austrians; but an Austrian eyewit- ness does not mention this. He treated the whole matter as a minor experiment in which no one on the Austrian side placed any great hopes. But he added, "Many discoveries which we laugh at as childish and fantastic later vindicate themselves."4 After 1849 nothing further was heard of the Uchatius balloon bombs, although their inventor went on to become a general in the Austrian service. The military balloon resumed its traditional role of elevated observation post, following the armies in the Italian war of 1859, the American Civil War, and the Franco-Prussian War. This last conflict, more than any other, dramatized wartime ballooning when Paris was invested by the Prusso-German armies and obliged to communicate with the rest of the country by air. The frequent flights of these messenger balloons led the Prussian high command to request from the Krupp works a special gun that could be used to bring them down. The result was the Ballonkanone of 1870, perhaps the first anti- aircraft cannon. It is curious, however, that neither the French nor the Prussians used balloons as weapons during their bitterly fought war. The French dropped on their enemies nothing more dangerous than leaflets. There were schemes to unleash deadly "fulminating" balloons on the Prussians, but they came
