during their bitterly fought war. The French dropped on their enemies nothing more dangerous than leaflets. There were schemes to unleash deadly "fulminating" balloons on the Prussians, but they came to nothing, perhaps because Paris itself would have been extremely vulnerable to such weapons if the Prussians had taken them up in turn. After the Franco-Prussian War there was something of a resur- gence of interest in ballooning. The 1880s saw the creation of balloon corps or "aerostatic sections"-usually attached to the corps of engi- neers-within the armies of most of the great powers. The late nine- teenth century was a period of rapid overseas expansion, and colonial campaigns offered new and fertile fields for military ballooning. The British reported from South Africa that ascensions had a wonderful psychological effect on native populations, and the French sent a bal- loon detachment to Indochina in hopes that it would make a similar impression there. Here and there, inventors still labored to produce an effective air weapon, but their efforts yielded little beyond obscure and impractical devices such as the Rodeck "aerial torpedo" and Freder- ick A. Gower's "aerial batteries," which were refinements of Ucha- tius's idea. Gower urged his invention on the British War Office, insist- ing it would work wonders in the fighting then going on in the Sudan. One of the effects of his weapon was "to produce panic among masses of men," and Gower thought the Dervishes would be especially susceptible.5 Realistically, the prospects were not bright for any of these devices, concluded the German authority H. W. L. Moedebeck in a survey of military ballooning that he wrote in 1886. A century after its discov- ery, the balloon's offensive capacities were almost nil. At best it could be used against a city under siege, where the charges it hurled down would undermine the morale of the inhabitants, for "it undoubtedly produces a depressing effect to have things dropped on one f
