uld be used against a city under siege, where the charges it hurled down would undermine the morale of the inhabitants, for "it undoubtedly produces a depressing effect to have things dropped on one from above."6 The notion that aerial bombardment somehow placed a spe- cial emotional strain on those subjected to it was already well estab- lished; it would become more prominent when an effective air weapon appeared. For the moment there was no air weapon, and Moedebeck and the other experts were not overly sanguine. But by the 1880s the reason- ably informed European had no doubt that powerful air vessels would soon be cruising the skies at will. Popularizers of science saw them in  8 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING A WEAPON IS BORN 9 the future and described them to their readers. And if science had not yet produced an airworthy ship, writers of science fiction and futuristic novels had launched several. Jules Verne introduced his readers to air power in Clipper of the Clouds (1873). Robur, the hero of the tale, dashed from continent to continent in a well-armed aéronef. But the aéronef was like Verne's fabulous submarine, the Nautilus: while it had a potential for combat, it was not solely intended for that purpose. In Albert Robida's War in the Twentieth Century (1883), the aerial war fleet appeared in all its power. Robida described a war that breaks out in April 1975 between Mozambique and Australia. The Austra- lians begin the war with a surprise air attack, using a fleet of six hundred war balloons armored with gutta-percha and firing torpedo rockets that carried devastating two-gram charges of "superdynam- ite." H. G. Wells would later exploit this idea in his War in the Air (1908), which opened with a sudden, massive raid on New York by a German air fleet. The popular literature of the late nineteenth century, because of its scientific and futuristic elements, had more than a casual relationship to the dawn of air power and, more particularly, to perceptions
