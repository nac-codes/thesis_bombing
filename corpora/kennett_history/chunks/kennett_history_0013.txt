pular literature of the late nineteenth century, because of its scientific and futuristic elements, had more than a casual relationship to the dawn of air power and, more particularly, to perceptions of that power. This sort of literature not only bred in its readers a faith in science and the inevitability of "progress," but it also created a kind of anticipation. When the armed airship did finally appear, it was already familiar to the popular mind. Not only was the weapon expected, but its role and functions had already been envisioned. The idea of the sudden, overwhelming air strike at the outset of a war appears first in the novels of Robida and Wells and then in the stra- tegic thought of Giulio Douhet of the Italian air service. The general phenomenon of anticipation was at work with other weapons-the submarine, the tank, and disabling gases, for example. Indeed, the popular mind conceived of several weapons that military technology was not able to perfect, chief among them the fabled death ray. But somehow it was the realm of the air that lent itself most readily to prognostication and speculation. Here a certain "fantasy factor" oper- ated, so that when airships and airplanes appeared, extravagant and impossible things would sometimes be expected of them. The 1880s produced several breakthroughs in the direction of pow- ered flight. In 1884 two captains in the French army, Charles Renard and Arthur Krebs, built a cigar-shaped balloon and suspended from it a sparlike structure to carry a crew, with a motor-driven propeller. On August 9 of that year the France, as they called their ship, took off, successfully followed a course 4.2 miles long, and then returned to its starting point. The France had one major flaw, which severely lim- ited its development. Its propeller was driven by an electric motor that required a half ton of batteries for a powered flight of under two hours. An alternative lay in the internal combustion engine, which was then being develop
