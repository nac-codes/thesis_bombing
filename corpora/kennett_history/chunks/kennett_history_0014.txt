peller was driven by an electric motor that required a half ton of batteries for a powered flight of under two hours. An alternative lay in the internal combustion engine, which was then being developed. Renard and Krebs were not able to marry the new power plant to the dirigible balloon, but others soon would. In 1886, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin began to catalog in his diary the mil- itary uses of the dirigible he planned to build. In 1893, feeling close to his goal, he wrote the chief of staff of the German Army that his craft would be able to carry out reconnaissance, transport personnel and military supplies, and "bombard enemy fortifications and troop formations with projectiles."7 As the 1890s drew to a close there were further advances. Knowl- edgeable people sensed that when they crossed the threshold into the new century they would also be entering the air age. Ivan S. Bliokh, a Polish lawyer and writer, as well as one of the most perceptive men of the era, published in 1898 a vast treatise on warfare. To him the military implications of the coming conquest of the air were ominous. He foresaw that airships would very soon be dropping explosive charges, adding a new dimension to warfare: "It seems that we are very close to facing a danger to which our world cannot remain indifferent."8 Statesmen as well were beginning to show concern over the rapid growth of all kinds of armaments. During the same year that Bliokh wrote his treatise, Czar Nicholas II issued a call for an international conference to promote peace and regulate armaments and warfare. A large number of nations responded, and all of the great powers were represented at the international conference assembled at The Hague in 1899. In matters of land and naval warfare, the delegates found a great number of precedents and traditions to guide them, but when they turned their attention to war in the air, they found themselves in a field where there was neither law nor custom. The only precedents conc
