er of precedents and traditions to guide them, but when they turned their attention to war in the air, they found themselves in a field where there was neither law nor custom. The only precedents concerned observation balloons and the status of persons who manned them. When the French used the first balloons in battle, enemy gen- erals vowed to hang the aerial observers as spies if they fell into their hands. During the Franco-Prussian War, Germany's Chancellor Otto von Bismarck threatened to do the same thing. After the war the issue )  10 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING A WEAPON IS BORN 11 was decided at a conference held in Brussels. An enemy balloonist could be summoned to descend and fired upon if he did not. If cap- tured, he was classified as an "officer of observation" and treated as a prisoner of war. Beyond this there were no rules for war in the air. In the circular that they issued in advance of the Hague conference, the Russians called for "prohibition of the discharge of any kind of projectile or explosive from balloons or by similar means."9 The Rus- sians meant the ban to be permanent, but they did not have their way. An American delegate, Capt. William R. Crozier, proposed instead that the prohibition be for a period of five years, reasoning that although the balloon as it existed in 1899 was a plaything of the winds and thus could only scatter its bombs indiscriminately, it was possible that the near future would see airships that could intervene precisely on the battlefield. If aerial bombardment could help decide the battle more quickly, it would produce shorter campaigns and wars and thus benefit humanity in general. The five-year ban was duly adopted. It was not until 1907, three years after the ban expired, that the second Hague conference assembled. In the intervening years the technology of flight had made impressive strides. Wilbur and Orville Wright had taken a heavier-than-air machine aloft in 1903; but more important in the short term, Ge
