d. In the intervening years the technology of flight had made impressive strides. Wilbur and Orville Wright had taken a heavier-than-air machine aloft in 1903; but more important in the short term, Germany, France, and Italy were well on the road to perfecting dirigibles that could be used for military pur- poses. In 1903 the brothers Paul and Pierre Lebaudy produced a suc- cessful dirigible, which the French Army purchased two years later. Toward the end of 1905, the ship had successfully dropped projectiles, and the French government was sufficiently satisfied with the results of its tests to order a second Lebaudy airship in 1906. At the 1907 Hague conference there were more calls for a perma- nent ban on aerial bombardment, but they were no more successful than before. In the end another temporary ban was proposed, but the French delegation opposed even this measure. The French argued that it was much more sensible to restrict bombing to legitimate military targets than to try to prohibit it altogether. They suggested that the Hague agreements on land warfare, which prohibited the bombard- ment of open or undefended cities, could simply be extended to cover aerial bombardments. Accordingly, article 25 of the Convention on Land Warfare was changed to read, "It is forbidden to attack or bom- bard by any means whatsoever, towns, villages, dwellings or buildings that are not defended."10 This attempt to make one type of warfare conform to the rules of another was not entirely successful. For exam- ple, article 24 provided that the attackers should give the city a chance to surrender before opening their bombardment, but how could a par- ley possibly be carried on through the air? What if an open town con- tained a legitimate military objective, say an arsenal? In land warfare the army could simply march into the town and take possession of the facility; an air force could not. Some students of the laws of war believed that in this case the aircraft should follow the
