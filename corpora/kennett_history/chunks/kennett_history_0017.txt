arfare the army could simply march into the town and take possession of the facility; an air force could not. Some students of the laws of war believed that in this case the aircraft should follow the rule laid down for naval bombardment: an attacking fleet could bombard a military installation in an undefended city so long as it took due care to direct its fire at the legitimate target and no other. These rather imprecise regulations were the only ones to obtain a sizable number of ratifica- tions; the ban on bombing was rejected by most of the great powers. In the years following the second Hague conference the powers began to extend their arms race into the air. In October 1907, Kaiser Wilhelm II confided to his ministers that he was concerned about the semirigid airship La Patrie, recently acquired by the French Army. Reports of its performance indicated that it could penetrate 90 miles into German territory, operating at an altitude of about three thou- sand feet. While the airship was intended primarily for reconnais- sance, the French had been experimenting with aerial bombing for some time, and their opposition to a ban on such bombing was dis- turbing to the Germans. The German artillery intensified its research into high-angle fire against moving objects, while the Krupp engineers set to work devising an aerial "torpedo" to use against intruders into German airspace. When Germany enthusiastically adopted the zeppelin in 1908, there was considerable concern on the other side of the Rhine-espe- cially when a zeppelin base opened at Metz, uncomfortably close to the French frontier and only a short flight from Paris. French ord- nance facilities began the development of incendiary fl√©chettes to use against the zeppelin. As a further countermeasure, in September 1909 the French Army purchased five airplanes at one blow; within a year it placed orders for a hundred more. The Germans in turn began buy- ing planes in 1910, so that the arms race spread to heavier-t
