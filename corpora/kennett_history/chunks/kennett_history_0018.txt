09 the French Army purchased five airplanes at one blow; within a year it placed orders for a hundred more. The Germans in turn began buy- ing planes in 1910, so that the arms race spread to heavier-than-air craft. Nor was the rivalry in the air limited to the French and the Germans. Italy acquired its first dirigible in 1908 and its first airplane (a Wright) a year later. Its building program for 1910 called for nine dirigibles and ten planes. The British government and public followed  12 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING A WEAPON IS BORN 13 these developments closely, partly because the country was far behind in this particular race and partly because the new weapons posed an unparalleled threat to its traditional position of isolation. In 1909, Sir Hiram Maxim pronounced Germany's growing force of zeppelins "a serious menace." They might strike at the very outset of a war, crip- pling the British home fleet while it rode at anchor and thus leading the way to a German invasion.11 The preoccupation with what could already be called the air men- ace showed itself quite clearly in the course of an international con- ference on aviation called by the French government in 1910. For some years jurists and aviators had discussed in rather academic fash- ion the question of airspace. Did the national boundaries extend ver- tically, so that all which lay above a nation was in its jurisdiction, or was the air, like the sea, open to all? The French jurist Paul Fauchille had suggested that national sovereignty might extend a certain dis- tance upward, much as it extended over territorial waters. The aviator Ferdinand Ferber, who proclaimed himself a champion of "the free- dom of the atmosphere," suggested that a commission of savants fix the height of the national territorial air zone; he himself felt that above fifteen hundred feet the skies should be open to all. When Louis Bl√©riot became the first to fly across the English Chan- nel in 1909, the question could no longer be t
