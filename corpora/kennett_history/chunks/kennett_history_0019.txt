one; he himself felt that above fifteen hundred feet the skies should be open to all. When Louis Blériot became the first to fly across the English Chan- nel in 1909, the question could no longer be treated casually; accord- ingly, it came up at the Paris meeting. Almost immediately it became clear that freedom of the airways was not acceptable to many dele- gations. The British were most outspoken in laying claim to absolute control of their airspace; the French and German governments took more moderate positions. The conference adjourned without agree- ment, leaving the various nations to resolve the problem by statute or bilateral agreements. Great Britain asserted exclusive control of its airspace with the Aerial Navigation Act of 1911, made even more stringent in 1913. The French and German governments agreed that the military aircraft of the one could enter the airspace of the other only by invitation. The czar closed Russia to foreign flights with a decree that threatened foreign interlopers with prison terms. In 1911 aerial warfare became a reality, for in that year fighting broke out between Italy and Turkey, and the Italians sent airplanes and dirigibles to the main seat of the war in Libya. By modern stan- dards, the war offered a very limited test of air power: the Italians sent to Libya only two dirigibles and nine planes; the Turks had no air strength at all when the conflict began, and although they tried to obtain both planes and pilots, the war ended before they could get them into battle. But the fragile Blériots and Taubes that flew off the Libyan desert did inaugurate air operations with a number of "firsts" to their credit, including the first radio transmission from a ground station to an airplane. Guglielmo Marconi was there in person to con- duct the experiment. Capt. Carlo Piazza flew the first mission in a brief reconnaissance over enemy lines on October 23, 1911; then, on November 1, Lt. Giulio Gavotti flew the first bombing mission, drop-
