the experiment. Capt. Carlo Piazza flew the first mission in a brief reconnaissance over enemy lines on October 23, 1911; then, on November 1, Lt. Giulio Gavotti flew the first bombing mission, drop- ping one small projectile on Ain Zara and three more on the oasis of Taguira. This event did not go unnoticed. The next day the Gazzetta del Popolo proclaimed in its headline: AVIATOR LT. GAVOTTI THROWS BOMB ON ENEMY CAMP. TERRORIZED TURKS SCATTER UPON UNEX- PECTED CELESTIAL ASSAULT. Elsewhere in Europe, newspapers also carried the story. Once begun, the bombing continued apace. On May 8, 1912, the Italian airmen carried out the first night bombing raid. Since the airplane had no lights on its instrument panel the pilot wore an electric lamp attached to his helmet. It was March 1912 before the Italian dirigibles were able to begin operations. There were many difficulties, and the violent winds blew down their hangars more than once. Although the airships had the skies to themselves and Turkish antiaircraft artillery was almost non- existent, the Turkish infantry proved a surprisingly dangerous foe. The dirigibles found it difficult to go higher than a thousand yards, and at that altitude they were within the range of the Turkish soldiers' Mausers. The Turks were poor shots but enthusiastic ones. The very volume of fire almost guaranteed that a few bullets would pierce the envelope. The dirigibles' engines made such a clatter that crewmen could not hear the sound of the rifle fire. They had to monitor their gauges very carefully; a drop in hydrogen pressure was the first sign that they had been hit. The crews spent a good bit of time between missions patching bullet holes. The bombing done by the Italian airplanes could hardly have been much more than a gesture, for the bombs themselves were very small and the planes could carry few of them. Old photographs show that the aviators often suspended a pair of bombs around their necks with a cord. The first projectiles throw
