bs themselves were very small and the planes could carry few of them. Old photographs show that the aviators often suspended a pair of bombs around their necks with a cord. The first projectiles thrown were Cipelli bombs, which were round, rather larger than an orange, and about two kilos in weight. The pilot-bombardier simply tossed the bomb over the side after hav-  14 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING A WEAPON IS BORN 15 ing pulled the pin with his teeth. In theory, the dirigibles could do more serious bombing, since they could take aloft a sizable payload and use much larger bombs, usually adapted from artillery and mortar shells. In all, the airships flew 127 missions and released 330 bombs (about 10 of them incendiaries). The results of the first aerial bombing operations must be deduced from highly contradictory sources. Italian general-staff reports rated the material damage as modest, but the psychological effect as signif- icant. Bombardment from the air "dampened the enemy's ardor." Press communiqu√©s showed that the new weapon had exceeded expec- tations in material damage as well as mental stress imposed on the Turks. Italian newspapers were generally enthusiastic; Prince Ludov- ico Potenziani told the Aero-Club d'Italia that their country had "con- quered for herself the distinction" of being first to use the airplane and the dirigible in war. 12 Outside of Italy there were conflicting judgments. An English reporter in the Turkish camp described air bombing as a terrible means of destruction that would revolutionize warfare, while a corre- spondent from the Berliner Tageblatt filed a story describing the offen- sive power of the airship and the airplane as almost nil. The latter view was shared by a French officer named Marzac who was in Libya as an observer. In his confidential report to the French Ministry of War, Marzac said he was present when an Italian dirigible released twenty- nine bombs on a Turkish camp containing eight thousand men. The bombs pr
