In his confidential report to the French Ministry of War, Marzac said he was present when an Italian dirigible released twenty- nine bombs on a Turkish camp containing eight thousand men. The bombs produced no casualties and no damage. Many of the projectiles sank into the sand without exploding; those that did detonate produced a small, harmless blast. Marzac added that the Turks were not in the least frightened by aerial bombardment. The war in Libya ended in October 1912; by then another conflict was convulsing the smaller nations of southeastern Europe. The Bal- kan wars of 1912-13 were watched with considerable interest in the capitals of Europe, partly because the belligerents had obtained their war mat√©riel from one or another of the great powers, who were anx- ious to see how their arms and equipment performed in war. None of the Balkan countries had an air force worthy of the name when war broke out, but most of them sought both planes and pilots. They recruited many of their pilots in western Europe and bought their planes on the secondhand market. A French aviator who flew for the Bulgarians found that most of the craft in the hastily assembled Bul- garian Air Force were incapable of flying. Here, as in Libya, some of the pilots dropped bombs, but usually only incidentally to their main mission of observation. French pilots generally refused to do any bombing, although their employers pressed them to do so. As one of the pilots explained, "We had agreed to fly with or without an observer, but not to become active belligerents and kill people against whom we had absolutely no resentment." The same pilot described the few bombs he saw dropped as "of a minimal effect, absolutely worth- less against fortifications and scarcely dangerous for troops in dis- persed order."13 A British pilot named Headley, who dropped bombs for the Bulgarians, described their effect as chiefly psychological, an observation now familiar to us. There was one other occasion for aeri
