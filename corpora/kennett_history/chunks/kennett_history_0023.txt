order."13 A British pilot named Headley, who dropped bombs for the Bulgarians, described their effect as chiefly psychological, an observation now familiar to us. There was one other occasion for aerial bombardment before 1914, although it did not attract very much attention; this was in French Morocco, where French authority was being challenged by rebel bands. Early in 1912 the Ministry of War sent a six-plane escadrille there for use in reconnaissance and communications. The planes car- ried out these tasks well enough, but their pilots asked for machine guns to defend themselves if forced down and for bombs to use on targets they might encounter. The Ministry of War honored the latter request, contracting with a Danish inventor named Aasen, who was trying to sell aerial bombs he had perfected. The French authorities tested the small bombs and found them satisfactory. They ordered sev- eral hundred and sent a number to Morocco (the remainder would be dropped on the advancing German armies in 1914). French pilots in Morocco reported modest successes with their new weapon, although their bombing objectives were not those approved by the Hague con- vention. The aerial operations in Morocco were the first in colonial areas, and they gave a clear indication of the harsh character of this type of warfare, the purpose of which was to teach severe lessons, the only kind that seemed likely to impress a hardy, warlike people. French pilots bombed villages and markets and even tried to hit flocks. They used the incendiary fl√©chettes that had been developed to bring down zeppelins, for they found them useful in setting fire to grain fields. While the airplane was still getting its first trials in war, it won a place for itself in the military establishments of Europe. In 1910 the air fleets of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Great Britain, France, and Russia contained some fifty airplanes in all; four years later, on the  A WEAPON IS BORN 17 16 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING eve o
