e air fleets of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Great Britain, France, and Russia contained some fifty airplanes in all; four years later, on the  A WEAPON IS BORN 17 16 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING eve of World War I, the five powers had available for service a total of over seven hundred. In some countries appropriations for military aeronautics increased tenfold in that same period. By no stretch of the imagination could the airplane and the dirigible be said to have proved themselves in the obscure wars that preceded the world conflict of 1914-18. Why, then, did the military establishments hasten to add them in such numbers? Many military leaders were unsure exactly how they could use the new weapons; others probably accepted them against their better judgment. Giulio Douhet, who was the head of the Italian air service just before the war, claimed that the leadership of the Italian Army had absolutely no use for flying machines, but that it acquired a few as a sop to public opinion. It seems quite clear that the French Navy was interested in nothing more than a few balloons which, it thought, might be useful for detecting submarines; but it acquired airplanes as well, because members of the Chamber of Depu- ties felt it should have them and wrote them into the navy budget. A British newspaper launched a public subscription to present to the War Office-with great fanfare-a secondhand French dirigible that France did not want; the War Office then had to explain to indignant members of Parliament why it kept the deflated ship locked in a shed in Wormwood Scrubs. In 1914 it was fashionable in pacifist circles to hint that the rapid growth of military aeronautics was essentially the work of aircraft manufacturers anxious to cut for themselves a larger slice of the arma- ments pie. Although recent studies argue that this may have been true, the larger truth is that military aeronautics was promoted by a broad spectrum of interests and from a wide range of motives. In almo
