s pie. Although recent studies argue that this may have been true, the larger truth is that military aeronautics was promoted by a broad spectrum of interests and from a wide range of motives. In almost every country, there were air-minded politicians and editors eager to lead crusades for aerial preparedness. There were soldiers intrigued by the possibilities of the new weapon and practical, patriotic indus- trialists like the brothers André and Édouard Michelin, who estab- lished an aerial bombing competition to find out if the bomber could be perfected. There was an international coterie of the wealthy and prominent-led by princes and grand dukes-who had taken to flying and become its propagandists. But masses of ordinary people were also fascinated by flight and wanted to give their country wings. When Count Zeppelin's pioneering airship was destroyed after a record- making flight in August 1908, the German people in a massive and spontaneous campaign gave the count 7 million marks with which to build another ship. When the Aero Club of Padua proposed early in 1912 a national subscription to buy the government a hundred air- planes, the outpouring was overwhelming. Italian schoolchildren donated 180,000 lire and Italians living abroad sent in 740,000 lire. The target was 2 million lire, but the total received exceeded 3.5 mil- lion-far more money than the aeronautical service needed or could use effectively. What would the impact of these new weapons be in the event of a general European conflict? Serious students of the art of war were already at work seeking the answer to this question; their conclusions, tentative and theoretical, were hidden away in obscure technical jour- nals. Within the flying fraternity there were prophets who spoke of an air war that would be at once apocalyptic and grandiose. In 1913 a French aviator named Pol Timonier shared his vision in a popular book with an arresting title: How We Are Going to Torpedo Berlin with Our Squadron of A
