be at once apocalyptic and grandiose. In 1913 a French aviator named Pol Timonier shared his vision in a popular book with an arresting title: How We Are Going to Torpedo Berlin with Our Squadron of Airplanes as Soon as the War Begins. Timon- ier's scenario was as follows: twenty German dirigibles bearing upward of 132,000 pounds of explosives would strike at Paris and deci- mate its population "amidst indescribable horrors"; immediately afterward a vast swarm of French airplanes would retaliate, smoth- ering Berlin under a deadly rain of 1,360 "torpedoes," winning the war then and there.14 No one in 1913 could really know how accurate Timonier's scenario might be. As it turned out, he was partly right. Zeppelins did attack Paris, and by postwar computation the city was hit by some 154,000 pounds of explosives. Paris survived almost unscarred; as for Berlin, not a single bomb fell on the city during the four years of World War I.  CHAPTER 2 THE GREAT WAR ON THE EVENING OF AUGUST 3, 1914, the German ambassador to France arrived at the Quai d'orsay with a brief but momentous message from his government-a declaration of war. Armies were already marching in eastern Europe; Ambassador Wilhelm von Schoen's communication would set them in motion in the west as well. The message began with a list of provocative acts perpetrated by the French-and cited the bombardment of Nuremberg by a French plane the day before. The "bombing" of Nuremberg long remained something of a mys- tery. The French always vigorously denied the charge and pointed out with inescapable logic that Nuremberg was deep inside Germany, so far from the French frontier that it was beyond the range of any air- craft then in French service. And since, on close examination, no one could find any hard evidence that the city was bombed, it was under- standable for the Allies to assume that the whole episode was a piece of German prevarication. It is clear today that the diplomatic impor- tance of the Nuremberg aff
