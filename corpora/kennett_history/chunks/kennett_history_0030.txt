lots charged with intercepting them had sworn to ram the dirigibles if necessary. The Times of London con- soled its readers with the thought that the larger the bombs dropped on the city, the fewer they would be in number. No one placed great faith in the protection offered by the Hague agreements. The World Peace Foundation reported in 1914 that Great Britain was the only major belligerent that had ratified the ban on airborne projectiles: consequently the ban was inoperative and aer- ial bombardments were quite legal, "though they may offend the world's sense of humanity."1 Almost all of the belligerents had ratified the Convention on Land Warfare, with its expanded clauses on the treatment of open cities. It was generally understood that within the war zone, the area in which armies contended and which was deline- ated by the range of their artillery, there would be little protection, save for churches, hospitals, and similar buildings if they were clearly marked. Outside the war zone, "open" towns and cities seemed to have some protection by virtue of the Hague agreements, but how durable this protection would be, no one could tell. In the years leading up to 1914, the major powers had given little attention to the legal and moral implications of the weapons they were  THE GREAT WAR 21 20 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING developing. Most of them were preoccupied with the technical aspects of bombing. The French, who issued a preliminary instruction on aer- ial bombardment in 1911, were busy testing a variety of bombsights. The German Army began work in 1912 to develop a family of spe- cialized aerial projectiles, the so-called APK bombs-although before the outbreak of the war only one zeppelin seems to have dropped live charges in bombing experiments. A bombing policy presupposed a bombing capability, and only Germany came close to that capability in 1914, thanks to the zeppelin and the Sch√ºtte-Lanz airships. It is known, on the authority of Gen.
