y presupposed a bombing capability, and only Germany came close to that capability in 1914, thanks to the zeppelin and the Schütte-Lanz airships. It is known, on the authority of Gen. Ernst von Hoeppner, head of the Ger- man air service in the second half of the war, that at the outset Ger- man authorities had decided to restrict bombing operations "strictly within the theatre of operations, that is, the area in which the armies were fighting."2 He goes on to say that later this limitation had to be dropped because the French and British persisted in bombing defense- less towns well behind the war zone. Since in the first months of the war the Germans were collecting planes for the "Ostend Carrier Pigeon Detachment," a cover name for a force that could be used to bomb the port of Dover, Hoeppner's assertion should be read with circumspection. The first zeppelin bombing attack took place over Liège on August 6, 1914. This was emphatically within the battle zone, since the city and its environs were the scene of intense fighting as the German Army tried to batter its way through to the French frontier. The zep- pelin was apparently called in to help bombard forts that were holding up the German advance. Twenty-four days later, on the eve of the First Battle of the Marne, Paris became the first great city to undergo an air attack. The aggressor was not a zeppelin but a single birdlike Taube monoplane, which appeared over the Gare de l'Est section of the city shortly after noon on August 30. The pilot threw out five small bombs, apparently aimed at the railway station, since they fell into streets surrounding it. One exploded at 39, rue des Vinaigriers, killing a woman-the first of some five hundred Parisians to die as a result of German air and land bombardments. Yet there was something almost quixotic about the attack. Along with the bombs, the German pilot threw out a message attached to a streamer in the colors of the German Empire: "The German Army is at the gates
