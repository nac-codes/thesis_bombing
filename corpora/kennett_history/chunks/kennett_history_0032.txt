was something almost quixotic about the attack. Along with the bombs, the German pilot threw out a message attached to a streamer in the colors of the German Empire: "The German Army is at the gates of Paris. You have no choice but to surrender. Lieutenant von Hindelsen."3 There were Parisians living who could remember the terrible siege of 1870-71, so the fifty-odd tiny bombs that the Taubes dropped on the city in the last months of 1914 caused no panic, and only a momentary sense of outrage when one of the bombs damaged Notre Dame. For a few weeks that fall the "five o'clock Taube" became as much a part of the Parisian's afternoon as an aperitif. No one ques- tioned the legality of the bombardment. For part of the time, Gen. Alexander von Kluck's army was almost at the gates of Paris, and forces sent out of the city helped turn the Germans back along the Marne. Paris was not an open city. It was ringed with fortifications, and its government was determined to defend it. The city even had air defenses, although at the outset these were only machine guns and searchlights on the Eiffel Tower. Had a Taube pilot fallen into French hands, most likely he would have been treated as any other prisoner of war. One Taube was brought down by a volley from French infan- trymen, landing near some workmen digging trenches. When the workmen approached the plane, its pilot emptied his Mauser at them, wounding several. Thereupon, they beat him to death with their shov- els. When Lieutenant von Hindelsen was shot down near Verdun early in 1915, he became just another prisoner of war, although French aviators dropped word of his fate to his unit. Other belligerents did not accept the legitimacy of aerial bombard- ment so easily. When the dirigible that attacked the Latvian port of LiepƒÅja in January 1915 was subsequently brought down by Russian fire, the Russian government announced its intention to put the cap- tured crew on trial for "piracy," for having attacked an undefended tow
