The German government protested through neutral channels, and German newspapers called for the most severe reprisals-which never came to pass, because the Russian government relented. The British cabinet was forced to make a decision at about the same time; Baron Fisher, First Sea Lord, proposed shooting a captured German civilian for each British civilian killed in a zeppelin raid. When the cabinet refused to go along with his scheme, Fisher came close to resigning. (When the first zeppelin crew fell into British hands a little later, they were vastly relieved to know they would not be executed.) But a number of Englishmen continued to feel as strongly as Fisher about the zeppelin raids. Well into 1915, coroner's juries handling the deaths provoked by zeppelin bombs brought in verdicts of "willful murder" against Kaiser Wilhelm. By the end of 1914 the Allies had made their own contribution to the spread of bombing with a series of raids into Germany. The first and most spectacular of these were mounted, oddly enough, by Brit-  22 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING ain's Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). A shifting of ministerial responsibilities left the Admiralty charged with defending the air and sea approaches to the British Isles, the RFC having departed for France with the British Expeditionary Corps. Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, regarded the German zeppelin and Schütte-Lanz airships as the greatest menace. These ships were most easy to find and destroy in their sheds, gigantic structures that a Brit- ish pilot described as big as the Crystal Palace and just as vulnerable. On September 22 and again on October 8, RNAS planes flew out of Antwerp to attack the sheds at Cologne and Düsseldorf. They suc- ceeded in destroying one airship and its shed, wh
