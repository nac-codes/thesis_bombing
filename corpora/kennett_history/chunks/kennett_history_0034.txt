d just as vulnerable. On September 22 and again on October 8, RNAS planes flew out of Antwerp to attack the sheds at Cologne and DÃ¼sseldorf. They suc- ceeded in destroying one airship and its shed, which disappeared in a gigantic ball of fire. In November and December, naval planes made similar raids on Friedrichshafen and Cuxhaven. On December 4, 1914, bombers of the French air service attacked Freiburg, located some fifty miles behind the German lines. The pilots tried to hit the railroad station, but their bombs scattered and killed a number of civilians. According to General Hoeppner, the British bombing attacks were a serious provocation, but the bombing of Freiburg made the French "the first power to introduce the horrors of the air war to a peaceable community."4 But it was Imperial Germany that first decided upon a sustained program of bombing-properly strategic in its scope and goals-out- side the battle zone. This was not because the kaiser was inhuman, as Germany's enemies liked to believe; it was because in the zeppelin, Germany alone possessed the ideal weapon for such action, and the advantage could be made to count only if the fleet were used. Back in 1913, Helmuth von Moltke, chief of the German general staff, had hailed the zeppelin as a weapon "which far surpasses anything our enemies have and which they will not be able to rival in the forseeable future."5 Von Moltke pushed development of the airship, so that at the outbreak of the war Germany had ten available for service and several others in the process of being built. These ships, although few in number, had two qualities for extended bombing operations that the airplane lacked: greater range and great load-lifting capacity. Some of the later zeppelin models could carry over 2 tons of bombs to the British Isles. The temptation to use the airships was very strong among Ger- many's military leaders. The very existence of the airship fleet had had an intimidating effect on its neighbors before 19
