The very existence of the airship fleet had had an intimidating effect on its neighbors before 1914, and with the advent of the war, "zeppelinitis" had if anything increased in the THE GREAT WAR 23 enemy camp. The impact would be even greater if the ships made attacks against targets deep inside France and England. Von Moltke thought the effect might be "extraordinary."6 Another strong partisan of air attacks was Rear Adm. Paul Behncke, deputy chief of the naval staff. Gen. Paul von Hindenburg and Adm.

Beyond considerations of state policy, the kaiser found the idea of bombing England personally repugnant, particularly if the target should be the city of London. Wilhelm had many relatives and acquaintances in the city and seems to have had a particular horror of causing the death of one of his kinsmen in the British royal family.
