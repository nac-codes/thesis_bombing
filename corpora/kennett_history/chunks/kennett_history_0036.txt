llied bombers and the ducal palace badly damaged, the kaiser loosened the reins further. Zeppelin commanders were still under orders to aim their bombs at legitimate military targets only, but in seeking them out they could range over London at will. Once the kaiser gave the authorization, the German high command lost no time in mounting its zeppelin offensive against England. The first raid on the English coast came on January 19, 1915. London, the ultimate target, first came under attack on the night of May 31-June 1. The story of this first air war against England has been told many times, and almost as well known are the strenuous efforts the British made to turn the intruders back-with guns, searchlights, smoke screens, sulfuric acid sprays, and, finally and most successfully, inter- cepting aircraft that fired incendiary bullets. There were in all fifty- one zeppelin raids, and although the last came in 1918, the German high command virtually ended the raids late in 1916, in the face of more effective resistance and consequently mounting losses. The end of 1916 saw a shake-up in German aviation in general,  24 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE GREAT WAR 25 including a critical review of air operations against England. The par- tisans of bombing had believed it would serve several purposes, but the results were discouraging. Admiral Behncke placed great faith in incendiary bombs, which he believed would set off vast fires in the warehouse and softgoods districts of London. But the city proved not to be very combustible, at least with the incendiary bombs that the Germans were then using; only once did the attacks set off a consid- erable blaze. Others said the port facilities in London and elsewhere would be high-yield targets. At the beginning of the war, it was believed (wrongly) that a large bomb exploding in a shallow harbor would generate shock waves that would crush the hulls of all nearby ships. Dockyards seemed particularly vulnerable; if they were des
