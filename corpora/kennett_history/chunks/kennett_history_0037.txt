believed (wrongly) that a large bomb exploding in a shallow harbor would generate shock waves that would crush the hulls of all nearby ships. Dockyards seemed particularly vulnerable; if they were destroyed, the flow of war mat√©riel to France could be halted. But inviting as these targets were, hitting them was not an easy matter, in London or elsewhere. At best, bombing accuracy was not great, and a zeppelin commander who attacked at night, driven to high altitudes by antiaircraft fire and dazzled by searchlights, had a difficult time fixing on a military target, much less placing bombs on it. Lack of precision was not just a German problem: in a study made in 1915, the Allies found that their bombing planes had about one chance in four of striking a huge target like a zeppelin shed; against railway stations and junctions two bombs in a hundred would hit the objective. Admiral Behncke believed that the raids might cause panic in the population "which may render it doubtful that the war can be contin- ued."1 Nothing that drastic happened, for the English did not give up; but there was ample evidence that British morale was suffering from the attacks. There was, for example, the testimonial that the aviation writer R. P. Hearne put in his book Zeppelins and Super-Zeppelins: "It is particularly humiliating to allow an enemy to come over your capital city and hurl bombs upon it. His aim may be very bad, the casualties may be few, but the moral effect is wholly undesirable. When the Zeppelins came to London they could have scored a galling technical triumph over us if they had showered us with confetti."8 It was undoubtedly what Hearne called "the principle of psycho- logical influence" which led the German political and military author- ities to open a new phase in the air war against England with new aircraft that became available in 1917.9 These were the twin-engine Gotha and the Riesenflugzeug, or R-plane, a multiengine giant that could bring a ton of high explosive
