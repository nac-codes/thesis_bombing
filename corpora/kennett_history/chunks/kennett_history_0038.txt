war against England with new aircraft that became available in 1917.9 These were the twin-engine Gotha and the Riesenflugzeug, or R-plane, a multiengine giant that could bring a ton of high explosives over London at a height of 14,000 feet. The new cycle of raids began on May 25, 1917, and ended almost exactly a year later, on May 20, 1918. There were twenty-seven of these raids in all, two-thirds of them conducted at night, with the city of London the target seventeen times. Initially, the bombers had a variety of assignments and tasks: they were to disrupt industry and communications, destroy supply dumps, and hinder cross-Channel traffic; but ultimately the flight orders simply read "to raid targets of military importance in Great Britain." By then, the planes were oper- ating exclusively by night and from great heights, so there was no pur- pose in stipulating more specific objectives. The bomber crews were told that they were making war on "the morale of the English people," sapping their will to fight by showering them with high explosives. In that sort of operation the bombs counted no matter where they hit.10 In grim statistical terms, the new bombing planes were more effi- cient than the zeppelins had been. They took more lives with a smaller amount of explosives. But when the effects of all the attacks on England, by zeppelins and planes alike, are added up, the figures are surprisingly small. The Germans dropped on England less than 300 tons of bombs, killing fourteen hundred people and injuring forty- eight hundred more. These are the kinds of totals one would find reported for a single "quiet" day on the western front. Total property damage was put at slightly over Â£2 million-less than half what the Great War cost the British each day. Yet the effect the Germans sought could not be expressed in sta- tistics of this sort, and they were right in thinking that regardless of human and material losses, the raids would deliver a profound jolt to the British
