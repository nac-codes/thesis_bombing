y used, the bomber could paralyze an ene- my's whole war effort. Before the crisis subsided, the British government resolved on a series of radical measures, including the creation of an air force with strategic capability. This was not at all a new idea in Britain, as air power enthusiasts had called for an air force independent in status and function at the very beginning of the war. Lord Kitchener had argued for attacks on German industry in 1914, and the idea found support in both political and military circles. The policy had also found prac- tical application in the activities of the RNAS. In its operations, it had directed its attention first to the zeppelin bases, then to submarine installations and marshaling yards, and ultimately to industrial targets in western Germany. Its Number 3 Wing, operating out of the French field at Luxeuil, had begun in the summer of 1916 a modest but methodical program of strategic bombardment; to carry out that pro- gram it had placed orders with British manufacturers for good bomb- ers, the Sopwith 1 1/2 strutter and the Handley Page 0/400. The RNAS was destined to lose its bombers and ultimately its identity as well. In the spring of 1918, it was merged with the RFC to form the Royal Air Force (RAF). Appointed as first chief of the new air staff was a somewhat reluc- tant Hugh Trenchard, fresh from command of the RFC in France, where the view prevailed that the function of the airplane was to assist ground troops. The almost precipitate creation of the RAF may have proceeded from sound military considerations, but there is no doubt that it was conceived in part to still both political and public clamor. The new force was charged with making good Prime Minister David Lloyd George's promise to the people of London: "We will give it all back to them and we will give it to them soon. We shall bomb Ger- many with compound interest."11 Before 1917 ended, the first British effort at sustained retaliation was under way; by June 1918
