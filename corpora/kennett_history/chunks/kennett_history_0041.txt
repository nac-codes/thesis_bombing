t all back to them and we will give it to them soon. We shall bomb Ger- many with compound interest."11 Before 1917 ended, the first British effort at sustained retaliation was under way; by June 1918, Trenchard found himself with a new command, the Independent Air Force, created "for direct action against the heart of the German industrial system." There were even plans for a multinational inter- Allied air force with British, French, American, and Italian compo- nents. These conceptions were grandiose, and although their architects were full of confidence, they were not completely successful. The multinational force never came into existence, while Trenchard's Independent Air Force was just warming to its work when the armi- stice was signed. When the war ended, the Independent Air Force had dropped 660 tons of bombs; the Germans had been paid back, but not with the compound interest that Lloyd George promised. Britain's eleventh-hour venture in strategic bombing did not find a great deal of favor with its chief ally. The French Army's air service had considerable experience of its own in strategic bombardment, but the lessons it had drawn from that experience were of a different order. The French high command was early attracted to the possibil- ities of aerial bombing. On September 27, 1914, Gen. Joseph Joffre signed an order creating Groupe de Bombardement no. 1 (GB 1), the first bombing unit created by any of the belligerents. It was formed of three escadrilles of Voisin pusher planes, which offered the bombar- dier a good view and could lift several of the 90mm artillery shells that served as makeshift bombs. GB 1 was in a sense the first strategic air arm as well, since it was not tied to a ground unit but took its orders directly from Joffre's chief of staff, who might send it on a mis- sion within the battle zone or far behind it. At first, GB 1 served as an extension of the French artillery, hitting targets in the arri√®re front, no more than thirty miles
