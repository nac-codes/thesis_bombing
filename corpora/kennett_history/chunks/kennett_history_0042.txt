ho might send it on a mis- sion within the battle zone or far behind it. At first, GB 1 served as an extension of the French artillery, hitting targets in the arrière front, no more than thirty miles from the front lines. Like the artillery, its forces proved most useful when used in mass. The first targets were enemy columns, depots, and heavy-artillery positions. But soon the Voisin bombers were seeking out targets within Germany, such as the Aviatik airplane factory in Freiburg and the Krupp works at Essen. From the very beginning circumstances obliged the French to choose their targets carefully. First of all, much of the arrière front was French territory, either overrun by the Germans in 1914 or taken in 1871; in either case, the French hoped to reclaim the areas and were obliged to spare them as much as possible, for both practical and humanitarian reasons. Thus, a number of French-owned factories in  THE GREAT WAR 28 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING German-occupied territory were réservés-that is, off limits to French bombers. The general location of the front in northeastern France put a number of French towns within easy reach of the German air ser- vice, while German towns were correspondingly at greater range for French bombing planes. Berlin was out of range completely, while Paris was so close to the front-about sixty miles-that German planes crossing the lines at good altitude would be over the city before defending fighters could be alerted and climb up to intercept them. For all these reasons, the French political and military leaders were anxious to avoid generalized bombardment of urban centers, a game in which they could only lose. The French high command had no inter- est in spectacular long-distance raids on German cities that did no serious damage to the enemy but invited retaliation. French head- quarters steadily turned down the proposals of volunteers who offered to take a few pounds of explosives to Berlin in a specially equipped plane. The
