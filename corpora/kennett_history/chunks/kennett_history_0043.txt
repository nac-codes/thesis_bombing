o the enemy but invited retaliation. French head- quarters steadily turned down the proposals of volunteers who offered to take a few pounds of explosives to Berlin in a specially equipped plane. The high command did from time to time order retaliation raids into Germany, but even these could not be made without the prior approval of the cabinet. But the French military leadership was not at all averse to raids in German territory that promised some tangible benefit or bore on the outcome of the ground battles without provoking a retaliatory raid on a French city; such was the case with the raid that GB 1 made on Ludwigshafen in May 1915, which was closely tied to the fighting on the ground. In April of that year, the Germans released several hundred tons of chlorine at the Allied lines, initiating gas warfare and catching their opponents by surprise. French intelli- gence traced the gas to the Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik at Lud- wigshafen, so the eighteen planes of GB 1 attacked the plant and a research laboratory at Oppau, doing some damage to both. (The Lud- wigshafen plant was almost impossible to miss, since it covered more than a hundred acres.) Somewhat later French bombers made a sim- ilar raid on the vast Mauser works at Oberndorf, which produced 240,000 rifles a month. Gradually a whole bombing policy grew up around what the French called points sensibles ("sensitive spots"), legitimate military targets whose destruction would block a critical supply line or produc- tion chain. In the plan of September 1916, blast furnaces in the Saar, Lorraine, and Luxembourg stood high on the list of priorities; they supplied about half of Germany's steel, they were near at hand, and finally, they were easy to spot, especially at night. This latter point 29 was particularly important in 1916 and 1917, when, for lack of a good day bomber, the French squadrons switched to night operations. Another campaign was the so-called blockade of the Briey Basin, from which the G
