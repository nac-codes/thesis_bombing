rly important in 1916 and 1917, when, for lack of a good day bomber, the French squadrons switched to night operations. Another campaign was the so-called blockade of the Briey Basin, from which the Germans were drawing large quantities of iron ore. The mines themselves were difficult to bomb by their very nature; more- over, the ore went to different locations, so it was not feasible to bomb at the delivery end of the chain. The points sensibles seemed to be the junctions and stations in the basin's rail network, which moved the ore. They were concentrated around the city of Metz, and that is where French bombers set up their blockade. In a campaign that lasted more than two years, the French air service used 1,800 tons of bombs. This approach to bombing accorded extremely well with the policy of the RNAS, whose operations in France came to be closely coordi- nated with those of French squadrons. When the RNAS departed the scene and was replaced by another force with other orders, the spirit of collaboration faded. Trenchard's Independent Air Force was not interested in joining in the Briey blockade. It was bent on retaliation. Even before the force was formed, British units had begun to hit Ger- man towns rather indiscriminately at the end of 1917. The Germans had warned that such attacks would lead to retaliation against the city of Paris; late in January German bombing planes hit the city for the first time in two and a half years. Sharp words passed between the two Allies, and Georges Clemenceau, the French premier, demanded a complete list of the British raids into Germany. In February the Brit- ish agreed to restrict their bombing more carefully to factories and rail targets. French relations with the Independent Air Force could hardly have been cordial. It offended Gen. Ferdinand Foch by its very name; its operations, pursued in sovereign disregard for what was hap- pening in the land battle, were anathema to Gen.
