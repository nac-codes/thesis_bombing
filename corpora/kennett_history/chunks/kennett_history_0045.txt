ded Gen. Ferdinand Foch by its very name; its operations, pursued in sovereign disregard for what was hap- pening in the land battle, were anathema to Gen. Maurice Duval, head of the French air service. There was a general feeling among the French military that the British had come to draw the lightning, which would then strike their hosts. The events on the western front dominated the headlines during the war and have tended to monopolize the attention of historians ever since. But there were other fronts, and they too offer lessons on the development of aerial bombardment. In May 1915, Italy entered the war on the Allied aide, and within hours of the opening of hostilities, two Austrian Taubes appeared over Venice to initiate the air war in that theater of operations. The Italians had the larger air force at the  30 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE GREAT WAR 31 beginning of the war, and they had an excellent bombing plane in the Caproni trimotor, which entered service in 1915 (the Austrians had to rely on German assistance, including Gotha bombers). From 1916 on, the Italians generally had the upper hand. Even so, their air fleet remained a modest one; at the armistice they had 1,700 aircraft, while the British, French, and Germans had three times that number. The Italian air service had to divide its attention and its resources between the ground fighting in the north and the air and naval threat coming from the Adriatic. The Italians were able to identify a number of tar- gets of strategic importance, such as the rail junction at Divaccia, near Trieste, and the mercury-refining facilities at Idria. But the Capronis were too few to mount steady and sustained bombing campaigns against them. Only toward the end of 1918 did the Italians have the means to create a special bombing force, or massa di bombardamento, of about fifty planes. The Italians, like the French, had to exercise considerable care in selecting bombing targets. Many of the towns and cities behind
