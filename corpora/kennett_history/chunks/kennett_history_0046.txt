ial bombing force, or massa di bombardamento, of about fifty planes. The Italians, like the French, had to exercise considerable care in selecting bombing targets. Many of the towns and cities behind the Austrian lines were Italian in population, and the Italian government had hopes of annexing them once the war was won. To strike beyond those areas was no easy task, in part because of distance and in part because of the Alps, which posed a formidable obstacle to the aircraft of the era. At the outset, the Italians hoped to make use of their dir- igibles for long-distance bombing, for they had nine operational in 1915. They made thirty-two airship raids that year, but they soon dis- covered, as the Germans did, that the big ships were vulnerable. In 1916 the number of airship raids fell to sixteen, and the Italians lost three of their fleet, one of them under particularly tragic circum- stances. On the night of May 4, the M-4 and a sister ship raided the Austrian base at Aisovizza, but on the return flight, the M-4 ran out of fuel. Dawn found it drifting helplessly over the Austrian positions at Gorizia. Two Austrian planes soon appeared, and their pilots made it clear by gestures that the Italians were to bring their ship to earth. The captain of the M-4 steadfastly refused. At length, the Austrians attacked the derelict airship and sent it down in an enormous streak of flame. Much of the aerial bombardment on both sides was directed at the teeming port cities that rimmed the Adriatic. On the Italian side, much of the early bombing was done with paper. The Italians had dropped propaganda leaflets with some effect during the Libyan war, and now they began to address the Italian-speaking population of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The leaflet campaign was distinguished by the participation of that flamboyant literary figure Gabriele D'An- nunzio. In August 1915 he dropped war communiqu√©s and poems to the inhabitants of Trieste. To the population of Zara, in Dalmatia,
