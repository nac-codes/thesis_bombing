harges and countercharges, the bombing of towns and cities spread and intensified; the Italians were the more vulnerable and they suf- fered most heavily. By the beginning of 1918, night raids on Padua and Treviso were so common that every evening there was an exodus into the countryside. Venice was the handiest target for the Austrians and received correspondingly heavy punishment. Early in 1918 the city underwent a prolonged night attack in which it received 300 bombs; by the war's end, it had been attacked forty-two times. On the eastern front, bombing activity took on an entirely different complexion. There bombers with strategic capabilities made their first  32 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE GREAT WAR appearance, but the air war against the cities did not develop. Russia was technologically the most backward of the belligerents, yet para- doxically it was the only power possessing an efficient long-range bomber in 1914. The airplane was the Ilya Murometz (IM), the work of a brilliant young engineer named Igor Sikorsky. The IM had four engines and wings whose span was only a few inches less than that of the Flying Fortress of 1935. In an era when the lifting power of air- craft was so circumscribed that the RFC put a weight limit on its pilots, Sikorsky took the IM aloft accompanied by sixteen people and a dog. Translated into bombing capacity, this meant that the IM could carry over a ton of explosives several hundred miles, a feat not to be equaled until the Germans introduced their R-planes, which may have been inspired by Sikorsky's design. There were four IM's in existence when the war broke out; it took the Russian authorities several months to decide how best to use them. In December 1914 the giant planes were formed into a special Flying Ship Squadron and sent to Yablonna, a base near Warsaw, with orders to carry out reconnaissance and bombing missions for the Rus- sian armies. The IM's performed these tasks extremely well (only one was to be lost i
