nd sent to Yablonna, a base near Warsaw, with orders to carry out reconnaissance and bombing missions for the Rus- sian armies. The IM's performed these tasks extremely well (only one was to be lost in combat). By 1915 the squadron contained fifty air- craft, twenty of them IM's (there were to be about seventy of these craft manufactured in all). In the first three years of the war, the bombers carried out 350 missions along a vast front stretching from the Black Sea to the Baltic. They flew photographic reconnaissance for the Russian Seventh Army and then gave bombing support to the Twelfth Army. On orders from the Russian high command, they attacked the German hydroplane base at Riga. They were capable of operating more than 150 miles behind the enemy lines, but the bulk of their activity was in what the Russians called the "operational" zone, the area behind the front, spanning 60 miles. The targets they struck in that zone were most frequently depots, marshaling yards, railway stations, and German troops held in reserve. This pattern of bombardment was also the one that the Germans generally followed on the eastern front. Here they had available con- siderable means for long-distance bombing. First of all, the German airship fleet remained active there after it ceased to be used much in the west; then, too, it was the German practice to try out new weapons in the east before using them on the other front. This was the case with the R-planes; a detachment of them operated out of Vilna begin- 33 ning in the summer of 1916, and an incomplete list of their missions indicates that they sought out the same categories of targets as the IM's. Geography probably had a lot to do with the bombing patterns on the eastern front. Here distances were great and the transport facili- ties more limited; the railway network in eastern Europe generally was less dense than in the west, so the destruction of a single station, junc- tion, or even a railway bridge or trestle could do g
