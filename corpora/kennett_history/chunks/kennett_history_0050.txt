- ties more limited; the railway network in eastern Europe generally was less dense than in the west, so the destruction of a single station, junc- tion, or even a railway bridge or trestle could do great harm. Small wonder that rail targets figured frequently in bombing operations by both sides. At the same time, there were fewer cities, and the most important of these were not within bombing range. Berlin was outside the radius of the IM's, and not until 1918 did the German armies come within easy flying range of Petrograd (now Leningrad). The first bombs had hardly fallen on the city when the new Bolshevik govern- ment signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, taking Russia out of the war. Eight months later, the fighting came to an end on the western front. Europe would never be the same again, and neither would the art of war. The science of destruction had been advanced by the cre- ation of a whole panoply of new weapons, not the least of them the airplane. Aerial bombardment, still a novelty in 1914, had become by 1918 a vast undertaking employing hundreds of specially designed air- craft. Early in the war bombing began to reach beyond the actual battlefields of the contending armies, and the distinction between com- batant and noncombatant began to blur. To be sure, targets desig- nated for the Gothas and the Handley Pages were legitimate military ones; but in practice it was impossible to pick such a target out of an urban complex and direct all of the bombs onto it. General Hoeppner wrote after the war, "Our opponents knew as well as we did that in an aerial bomb attack it was not just military targets that would be hit."13 And there seems little doubt that as the war progressed there was less punctiliousness, less concern for the consequences when bombs strayed from their target. Toward the end of the war Lord Weir, the British air minister, told Trenchard that he need not be overly concerned at the inaccuracies involved in bombing German towns. Trenchard repli
