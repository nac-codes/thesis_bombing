Trenchard replied, "All the pilots drop their eggs well into the center of the town generally."14 Such comments by military personnel may seem reprehensible, but they at least understood the technical problems involved. The press, the public, and many politicians did not. When enemy bombs aimed  A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING 34 THE GREAT WAR at a barracks fell into residential areas all around it, these groups called the attack indiscriminate or terroristic and demanded reprisals. There is no doubt that a number of bombing attacks on cities were essentially symbolic; they were undertaken mainly for political rea- sons-to embarrass the enemy and frighten him, and at the same time to provide stirring headlines for domestic consumption. It became a sort of game to demonstrate that the enemy's cities-particularly his capital-were vulnerable. Every belligerent capital in Europe was attacked from the air except Rome-no doubt because of the pope's presence. Even then the Austrians made it a point to fly near the city on their raids to Naples and other targets. As out of the way as Con- stantinople might seem, the French, British, and Russians all man- aged to bomb it. Petrograd escaped for a long time, but only because it was at extreme range. The Germans planned to attack it quite early by zeppelin (they needed a long winter night, mild winds, and mod- erate temperatures, but were never able to find these optimum con- ditions on the eastern front). When Italy entered the war, Col. Giulio Douhet wanted to lead a squadron of Caproni bombers over Vienna and drop empty bombs on Schoenbrunn castle as a lesson in "power and chivalry."15 The poet- aviator D'Annunzio tried unsuccessfully to make the flight in 1917, succeeding only in August 1918. He and his fellow airmen made a flight of 621 miles
