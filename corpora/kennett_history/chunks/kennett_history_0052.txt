as a lesson in "power and chivalry."15 The poet- aviator D'Annunzio tried unsuccessfully to make the flight in 1917, succeeding only in August 1918. He and his fellow airmen made a flight of 621 miles in all, strewing leaflets over Vienna. Berlin was the object of daring schemes, but it was maddeningly inaccessible, even though a British industrialist offered a reward of £1,000 to the first British aviator who dropped a bomb on the city. The giant Handley Page V/1500 bomber, capable of this feat, became operational in November 1918, and it is said that the first planes were on the point of leaving for Berlin when the armistice was signed. In June 1916, a single Allied plane did make it over Berlin, a spe- cially equipped Nieuport flown by Lt. Antoine Marchal of the French air service. Marchal's plan, approved by the French high command, was to fly across Europe from the western front to the Russian lines, passing over Berlin on the way-a flight of fourteen hours. Marchal made it over Berlin, where he tossed out leaflets announcing the French could also drop bombs, but that they did not make war on women and children. On the last leg of his flight, Marchal had to land because of a misfiring engine. He was changing spark plugs when a German patrol captured him about sixty miles from the Russian lines. 35 Flights like those of D'Annunzio and Marchal did little to alter the general impression that the air war was intensifying and degenerating into a decidedly unchivalrous affair. The German press communiqué following an Allied raid on Freiburg in April 1917 related that the enemy airmen had "selected" as targets the new municipal theater, the institutes, and the infirmaries. The Associated Press reported on May 30, 1918, "German airmen last night deliberately dropped bombs on hospitals in which there were scores of American and hundreds of French sick and wounded."16 The savagery of the Ger- mans in this instance seemed demonic; so, apparently, was their ability to find
