on hospitals in which there were scores of American and hundreds of French sick and wounded."16 The savagery of the Ger- mans in this instance seemed demonic; so, apparently, was their ability to find targets in the dark. It was widely believed on both sides that enemy bombers sought out prominent political and military figures for assassination by air. When German zeppelins struck Paris early in 1918, it was generally assumed that they had come after Lloyd George, who was staying at the Crillon Hotel. After French bombs struck the ducal palace at Karlsruhe, the German government sent word that it was establishing a prison camp for Allied officers just next door. This was not the limit of the enemy airmen's perfidy. In the last year of the war, there were persistent reports that German pilots were scattering poisoned candies; from Rumania came a story that German planes were dropping garlic laced with deadly bacilli. Atrocity stories aside, the air war was becoming more intensive and was dealing out greater punishment to civilian populations. In part, this was the result of technological advances: the aerial bombs used in 1914 were so small they could be carried in the pocket; toward the end of the conflict, an R-plane managed to release over London a monster bomb thirteen feet long, weighing over a ton. Incendiary devices were steadily perfected. The Allies used them to destroy Bulgarian wheat fields, the French systematically set fire to the grain fields in German- occupied portions of their own country, and the Germans attempted with less success to ignite vast forests in Russia. But it was the cities that were increasingly singled out for punish- ment. They were handy targets for reprisals, and in the first years of the war, it was not uncommon to bomb a town and throw out at the same time leaflets explaining that the attack was in reprisal for a spe- cific transgression on the enemy's part. Inevitably, reprisals bred more reprisals. Early in 1917 the British ca
