row out at the same time leaflets explaining that the attack was in reprisal for a spe- cific transgression on the enemy's part. Inevitably, reprisals bred more reprisals. Early in 1917 the British cabinet warned the Germans of dire consequences if their submarines continued to attack hospital ships. Shortly afterward, there were two incidents of this kind, so the  36 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING Allies bombed Freiburg. One of the bombs struck a clinic, causing a great stir in the German press. German planes were consequently sent to pound the towns of Châlons and Epernay; this prompted the French to bomb Freiburg again and Trier as well. The last year of the war cost the city of Paris 244 lives, nearly half the deaths the city suffered during the entire war; in 1918, Paris had forty-four air raids, and from March until August it was also bombarded by a battery of giant can- non sixty miles away, known collectively as Big Bertha. (Actually, this famous cannon was not used in the bombardment of Paris.) London was to some degree spared, since after March 1918 the German high command committed its heavy bombers to the great land offensive in France. But German towns came to know aerial bombardment all too well. In 1918, Germany recorded 657 air raids, which produced twelve hundred casualties. Both figures had doubled since 1917. There was worse to come. In September 1918 the German air ser- vice had available a new incendiary of unprecedented destructiveness. The Elektron bomb, as it was called, burned at between 2,000° and 3,000° Fahrenheit; it could not be extinguished by conventional meth- ods. According to careful estimates, the new incendiaries could destroy a third of the city of Paris in a single raid. The Allies, too, were readying new and fearsome weapons. The huge Handley Page bombers would be able to range over Germany at will, and British ordnance was building for them a special one-ton bomb, which was never used (its casing is still on display in the bas
