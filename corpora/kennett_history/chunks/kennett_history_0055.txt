uge Handley Page bombers would be able to range over Germany at will, and British ordnance was building for them a special one-ton bomb, which was never used (its casing is still on display in the basement of the Imperial War Museum). The cities of Germany were also to be the testing ground for a new conception in weaponry-aerial bombs filled with poison gas. As the threat to their cities grew, authorities in each country made strenuous efforts at defense. Germany began the war with 18 heavy antiaircraft guns and ended it with 896. The French Défense contre Aéronefs (DCA) was a nonexistent service in 1914, but four years later it comprised forty-eight thousand officers and men. The tele- phone system offered a ready-made communications network for air defense (in 1914 German border police were able to telephone to Friedrichshafen that British planes were on the way), so the warning system developed around it. By 1915 the air defense of western Ger- many was being directed from Frankfurt; the French warning system was centralized in a school building in downtown Paris, where two switchboards and four demoiselles téléphonistes linked DCA head- THE GREAT WAR 37 quarters with gun batteries, fighter fields, and fifty-odd observer posts. Within a short time, a whole panoply of antiaircraft weapons appeared. The Germans were using searchlights in air defense exer- cises as early as 1913. The British pushed the development of sound detectors, hoping to get an earlier warning of nighttime zeppelin raids; they even cut acoustical discs into the chalk cliffs along the Channel coast. The French produced a highly regarded mobile antiaircraft gun, their celebrated "75" mounted on a reinforced truck chassis. The British acquired a number of these eight-ton monsters for the defense of London, where they roared back and forth through darkened streets, seeking a clear shot at German raiders. The Italians contrib- uted the barrage balloon; a double cordon of them guarded Venice to a h
