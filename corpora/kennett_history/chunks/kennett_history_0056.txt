London, where they roared back and forth through darkened streets, seeking a clear shot at German raiders. The Italians contrib- uted the barrage balloon; a double cordon of them guarded Venice to a height of ten thousand feet. Then there were the blackouts, the smoke generators, and the "decoy" towns whose lights twinkled allur- ingly in the midst of empty fields-in short, most of the measures employed when Europe went to war again twenty years later. But the early defense against the bomber was hampered by two considera- tions: night gave the attacker a telling advantage, and the defense could not match his mobility-it had to stand guard over a hundred towns, while he attacked just one. At war's end, the bomber had emerged in the popular mind-with some justification-as the most dangerous weapon the conflict had spawned. This was a weapon from which no one was safe. It could penetrate frontiers at will and reach across entire nations. Indeed, there was no reason why it might not reach across oceans as well. In 1918 a goodly number of North Americans-and their leaders-were so mesmerized by the bomber that they believed they would be exposed to air attacks. As early as 1915, Canadian authorities worried that German-Americans in the United States might fly across the bor- der and bomb government buildings in Ottawa. Improbable as the danger seems in retrospect, the authorities set up a network of observ- ers. One day in 1918, an informant in New York State relayed word that three planeloads of Germans and explosives had crossed the bor- der, headed for the Canadian capital. The authorities evacuated the Parliament building, darkened the city, and posted sharpshooters. No planes ever appeared. What could happen to Ottawa could happen to New York, where an air raid scare in June 1918 was taken quite seriously. Late in 1917 a writer said in the [London] Observer that the Germans might try to  38 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING bomb the city in 1918. Adm. Robert E. Peary,
