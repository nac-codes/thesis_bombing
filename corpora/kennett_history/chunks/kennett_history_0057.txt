June 1918 was taken quite seriously. Late in 1917 a writer said in the [London] Observer that the Germans might try to  38 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING bomb the city in 1918. Adm. Robert E. Peary, who was then involved with air defense matters, told the press that such a raid was a distinct possibility. According to the most frequently mentioned scenario, a large German submarine would bring a crated seaplane off the New York coast; there it would seize a freighter and use the freighter's cargo-handling equipment to uncrate and assemble the plane and lower it into the water.
