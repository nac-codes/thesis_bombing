a few anxious hours New York knew something of the fear that had seized London, Venice, and Freiburg. To the generation of 1918, air power seemed awesome and limitless. The primitive bomb- ing planes of 1918 would send ominous echoes down the next two decades. CHAPTER 3 THE PROPHETS THE ARMISTICE CAME NONE TOO SOON for the men in the trenches, and the sense of relief was almost as keen on the home front. Even in Ger- many, where the end brought defeat, it was not unwelcome. But in the 1920s there was one group that wished the war could have lasted longer; these were the men at work in various countries trying to figure out what the next war would be like, either because they were being paid by their government to do so or because they were soldiers with a professional curiosity. In either case, their task was not an easy one. The war had thrown open a Pandora's box of weaponry and then come to an end before men could learn how that weaponry could best be used. For example the Allies had planned to put ten thousand tanks in the field in 1919. Col. J. F. C. Fuller, apostle of armor in the years between the wars, could only speculate on what those tanks might have accomplished. Much the same was true of the bombing plane, although spokesmen for the RAF liked to say that operations in 1918 clearly demonstrated the strategic air offensive could work.

Colonel Fuller was in 39  THE PROPHETS 41 40 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING agreement with B. H. Liddell Hart on this point. Gen.
