h B. H. Liddell Hart on this point. Gen. Hans von Seeckt, guiding spirit of the German Army in the 1920s, predicted waves of bombers opening hostilities in future wars. Marshal Ferdi- nand Foch, the most prestigious soldier of the postwar years, was cat- egorical in his pronouncement: "One of the great factors in the next war will be aircraft." And Foch was thinking specifically of aerial bombardment; the effects of massive bombing attacks would be "almost incalculable."2 But Foch was speaking of a potential, one he felt could not be mea- sured for the time being; for him, as for most of his contemporaries, the Great War had yielded only imperfect evidence of what air power might do in a major conflict. Then, to complicate the analyst's prob- lems, the armistice was followed by nearly twenty years of peace, dis- turbed only by minor conflicts that taught no lessons in air strategy. In the 1920s the RAF saw action chiefly against obstreperous subjects within the British Empire-rebels like the "Mad Mullah" of Somal- iland, who had neither air force nor air defenses and whose domains offered no bombing targets more tempting than souks and mud vil- lages. The French air service fought much the same type of war against Moroccan rebels under Abd-el-Krim. It was not until the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936 that the imperfect lessons of 1918 could be supplemented by any meaningful new data. Where practice is lacking, theory thrives, and so, the 1920s and the early 1930s saw a good deal of speculative work. Some of this was done in official "think tanks," such as the U.S. Army Air Corps' Tact- ical School at Maxwell Field or the secret facility at Lipetsk, which the Soviet government put at the disposal of the German Army in exchange for technical advice. But theory does not thrive in secrecy, and fortunately for its development a new generation of aeronautical reviews provided the forum for discussions and debates over doctrine.
