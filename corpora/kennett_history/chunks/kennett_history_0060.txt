t thrive in secrecy, and fortunately for its development a new generation of aeronautical reviews provided the forum for discussions and debates over doctrine. The French Revue de l'aéronautique militaire set the pace when it appeared in 1921, but Italy's Rivista Aeronautica, launched four years later, quickly became the busiest marketplace for ideas on air power; from 1927 on, its pages were a forum for Giulio Douhet, his defenders, and his critics. Then there were the spokesmen and theorists themselves-the cel- ebrated, flamboyant ones like Douhet and Billy Mitchell, but also a constellation of lesser-known prophets. Theirs was the job of reading the evidence of the Great War, identifying the significant trends and lines of development and projecting them into the future. But it is important to note that these men were actually second-generation prophets, for along with the empirical evidence of the war they inher- ited a considerable, if somewhat disorganized, body of thought dating from before 1914. Part of their work involved examining the validity of some of these prewar notions in light of the experience of 1914-18. And since the strategic bombing doctrines that flowered the 1920s and 1930s have their roots in those early notions, it is with them that one should begin. In the decade before 1914, serious students of warfare did a con- siderable amount of thinking about military aeronautics; after all, the airplane and the dirigible were already in existence, and their use in future wars seemed inevitable. Speculative works about air strategy and tactics began to appear in general treatises like Clément Ader's Aviation militaire (1909), but more often in obscure monographs and technical journals. Scattered and diverse as this "professional" liter- ature was, it led the well-read expert to have certain expectations of the new weapons. Although these first notions about how air weapons might be used were highly conjectural, the men who propounded them did not mak
