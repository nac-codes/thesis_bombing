the well-read expert to have certain expectations of the new weapons. Although these first notions about how air weapons might be used were highly conjectural, the men who propounded them did not make them up out of thin air. The first prophets of air power reasoned by analogy, proceeding from certain aspects of war already familiar to them. Thus, they saw aviation in its reconnaissance role as a variant of the cavalry, the arm which had traditionally filled that function. Furthermore, it was logical and convenient to think of aircraft in a tactical role as extensions of the artillery, capable of dropping charges of explosives beyond the range of artillery. Well before 1914, there were predictions that military aeronautics would become the "fourth arm," taking its place in the army alongside infantry, cavalry, and artillery. But another analogy suggested itself to some of the early theorists, and they pursued it until they arrived at a truly strategic conception of air power. Their point of departure was the premise that war in the air would resemble war on the seas. The parallels were, after all, numerous and compelling: both the airman and the sailor carried war into domains alien to man; they were able to fight there and, indeed, able to sustain themselves there, thanks only to the specialized craft  42 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE PROPHETS that human genius had designed. It followed that in both cases the nature and form of warfare would be determined by what these craft could and could not do. One of the qualities of both air- and seacraft was their extreme mobility; forces could be displaced and concentrated with a speed and an ease unknown in land warfare. In offensive operations, there was also more chance that movement might go undetected by the enemy until too late, so that descents could be made in superior force on an ill-prepared foe. After all, the entire enemy coast was vulnerable to a surface fleet, while an air fleet could strike any point in
