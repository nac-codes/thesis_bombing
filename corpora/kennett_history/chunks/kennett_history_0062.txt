til too late, so that descents could be made in superior force on an ill-prepared foe. After all, the entire enemy coast was vulnerable to a surface fleet, while an air fleet could strike any point inland as well. J. M. Spaight labeled this quality "penetrativeness." The idea that the air weapon might be utilized for a sudden, deci- sive intervention at the opening of a conflict was widely current before 1914. Ferdinand Ferber considered that the first target would be the enemy air fleet: "When all the enemy airplanes have been destroyed or forced to land, then the escadrilles will imitate naval tactics, setting up their patrols over hangars and construction sites to see that the enemy does not occupy the air again."3 There were a number of naval precedents for this sort of preemptive strike; the most recent, cited by Spaight and others, was the Japanese attack on the Russian naval forces in Port Arthur. None of the belligerents tried an aerial equiv- alent in 1914, of course; but the untested idea gained great currency in the 1930s, so that by September 1939 all the belligerents were braced for a first, massive blow at their air fleets. With the enemy driven from the skies and command of the air established, other targets would present themselves. There was some awareness that bombing attacks might be used to disrupt the enemy's industry and sever his transport and communications lines-a form of warfare somewhat like a naval blockade in its effects. But that sort of warfare took much time, weakening the enemy gradually; the pre- 1914 theorists thought in terms of short, sharp wars, so at this point many of them turned to another potential target, the city. Cl√©ment Ader was convinced that aircraft would attack urban centers, where they would become "veritable terrors."4 Riley E. Scott, West Point graduate and winner of the Michelin bombing contest of 1912, wrote that "no great accuracy would be needed in the congested areas, and the loss of life from fire, high-expl
