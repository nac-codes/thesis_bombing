Riley E. Scott, West Point graduate and winner of the Michelin bombing contest of 1912, wrote that "no great accuracy would be needed in the congested areas, and the loss of life from fire, high-explosive bombs and panic would be appalling."5 The bombing of the cities seemed to promise a quick sur- render, with an attack on the enemy's capital the most effective of all. 43 It was a dictum of Napoleonic warfare-still quoted in 1914-that when the enemy's capital came under bombardment, the war was con- sidered over. Similarly, there was a theory that the modern, highly centralized state, with its complex economic and political structures, could not survive the destruction or even the substantial damaging of its capital. Lord Montagu of Beaulieu predicted in 1909 that a single massive air attack on London would disable the entire country. The destruction of Parliament, the ministries, and the post and telegraph offices-the central nervous system of the body politic-would pro- duce in that body a massive and fatal paralysis. A Belgian officer named Poutrin, writing in the Revue générale de l'aéronautique mili- taire in June 1911, described how an equally stunning blow might be delivered to Paris. If the first air attack surprised a nation's capital rather than its air installations, that nation might be knocked out of a war almost imme- diately, like a boxer felled before he could even assume a fighting stance. Just such an attack seems to have been considered by the French high command in the autumn of 1914. The Turkish govern- ment, neutral at the outbreak of the war, was leaning toward the Cen- tral Powers, and the Allies were anxious to keep the Turks from enter- ing the war on the other side. A plan submitted by Captain de Goys of GB 1 called for the unit to be transferred to the eastern Mediter- ranean for a raid on Constantinople as soon as the Turkish govern- ment decided on war. The planes were to bomb military targets in and around the city and make noisy dem
