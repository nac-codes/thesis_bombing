erred to the eastern Mediter- ranean for a raid on Constantinople as soon as the Turkish govern- ment decided on war. The planes were to bomb military targets in and around the city and make noisy demonstrations in the skies above it. This might well stampede its volatile population and, given the tur- bulent nature of Turkish politics, lead to the overthrow of the govern- ment and the reversal of Turkey's foreign policy. The plan was given serious study at General Joffre's headquarters but was never imple- mented. So the aerial "knockout blow," as it was often called, remained in the realm of theoretical possibilities; like the lightning stroke at the enemy air force, it was often evoked in the literature of the 1920s and 1930s. Cl√©ment Ader, who was in many ways the most perceptive of all the early writers on aerial warfare, foresaw that the threat to the cities would become an important consideration in state policy and that no country would feel the danger more than England: "She, more than any other, will be compelled by aviation to undergo a radical trans- formation."6 Concern over the vulnerability of their great capital city  44 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE PROPHETS 45 would lead the English to abandon their traditional isolation and to seek mastery of the atmosphere just as they had sought dominance of the seas. In addition to his remarkable prescience, Ader was noteworthy because of his idea that a nation could feel secure from an attack only if it could dominate the element through which that attack must come. The only answer to an enemy's air force is an air force of one's own. These forces would contend for mastery of the atmosphere in ways still unclear (although Ader and others speculated on the forms that aerial combat might take); but the war in the air would be as distinc- tive and as proper to its element as naval warfare was to the sea. It followed in Ader's mind that an air force could not simply be a "fourth arm." It should become the "th
