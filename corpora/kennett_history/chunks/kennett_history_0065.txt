he air would be as distinc- tive and as proper to its element as naval warfare was to the sea. It followed in Ader's mind that an air force could not simply be a "fourth arm." It should become the "third service," enjoying equality with the army and the navy and directed by its own minister. Douhet was reaching the same conclusion at about the same time. He wrote in 1910 that the Italian armed forces should be enlarged by the addition of a fratello ("little brother")-that is, an air force. Before 1914 it was not easy to determine whether the obvious offen- sive potential of the airplane might be effectively countered or how this might be done. Early conceptions of air defense also borrowed heavily from naval warfare, introducing the aerial equivalent of picket ships and scouting vessels. Before the war, there were suggestions that Britain could best defend itself from zeppelin attack by means of a standing patrol of "hydroaeroplanes" guarding its air frontiers. Ader's solution to the security of Paris was a continuous shuttle of "sentinel" airplanes flying back and forth between two airfields well east of the city. In 1915 the Germans attempted this sort of "standing" defense along a section of the western front with an elaborate scheme they called the Luftsperre, or "air barrier," designed to seal off a section of the front. The problems with such a scheme proved insoluble. First of all, approaching enemy aircraft were difficult to spot, and the vigil was enormously complicated by the third dimension; to maintain aircraft on patrol at different altitudes and to replace them every hour or so when they needed to refuel required a tremendous number of air- planes. German military analyst Hans Ritter estimated that for a rea- sonably effective Luftsperre twelve miles long, 240 planes would have to be kept in the air, drawn from a pool of about 800 aircraft. In 1915 the Germans had about 1,000 machines available on the entire front. Ritter concluded, "An air barrier is
