240 planes would have to be kept in the air, drawn from a pool of about 800 aircraft. In 1915 the Germans had about 1,000 machines available on the entire front. Ritter concluded, "An air barrier is generally an impossible thing."7 The alternative to defending a broad front in the air was to meet individual attacks as they developed. Unfortunately, the speed of attacking aircraft and the inevitable delays in detecting them and get- ting intercepting planes aloft-the "lag time"-meant it was impos- sible to organize an air defense for Paris and very difficult to do so for London before enemy bombers were over their target. Spaight laid down a general rule that air power could not be prevented by air power from penetrating an enemy's defense. Gen. Bernard Serrigny reasoned that a nation's vulnerability was essentially a "function of its distance from an enemy's bases of departure."8 This did not mean that the bombing plane always had the advan- tage over air defenses. Only in the first few months of the war-what the French called "the golden age of bombing"-could those planes go about their work without fear of serious hindrance. Soon fighter craft developed and made the bomber their prey. By September 1915, losses in French bombing units were approaching a crisis level; by 1917 the Germans abandoned long-distance day bombardment com- pletely. There were several ways to meet the threat posed by the fighter: one was to increase the bomber's capacity to defend itself; another was formation flying, which allowed planes to put up a collec- tive defense; and a third was to have the bombers escorted by fighting craft of one's own. But the most effective response for planes with long-distance missions was simply to carry out those missions at night. The enemy fighter, so formidable by day, did not even attempt night interceptions until the end of the war; even then, said William C. Sherman of the U.S. Army Air Service, they "advanced little beyond the crudities of the experi
