ble by day, did not even attempt night interceptions until the end of the war; even then, said William C. Sherman of the U.S. Army Air Service, they "advanced little beyond the crudities of the experimental stage."9 For one of the early night- fighter pilots to sight an enemy bomber was no ordinary accomplish- ment; for him then to shoot the bomber down was a very extraordinary one. Sherman felt that night-fighter tactics might improve, but like most of the air strategists of the 1920s, he felt that the hours of dark- ness would belong to the bomber: "An inspection of the difficulties of the defensive . . . demonstrates that darkness increases many of them and decreases none. Nothing of human invention will ever entirely take the place of sunlight. Night attacks therefore will always be less liable to encounter opposition than those undertaken by day."10 For Sherman and for many of his contemporaries air defense meant defense by aircraft. Ground defenses, and antiaircraft guns in particular, he judged more a distraction to the bomber than a danger;  46 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE PROPHETS 47 at most, antiaircraft fire would do no more than drive enemy planes to higher altitudes. This view was rooted in the experience of 1914- 18. One of the great revelations of that war was the extraordinary difficulty of hitting aircraft, a difficulty that only grew as aircraft improved during the course of the war, increasing the speed and alti- tude at which they could operate. The antiaircraft guns of London. Venice, and Freiburg seemed to fire thousands of rounds with no appreciable effect; enemy bombers were able to fly unscathed through what seemed a torrent of projectiles. The ballistic problems were intimidating; for example, the 75mm shell-the type used by both French and British-took twelve seconds to reach an altitude of 16,500 feet. By that time, the aircraft at which it was fired would have traveled a third of a mile (assuming the plane was flying at 100 mph) an
