nd British-took twelve seconds to reach an altitude of 16,500 feet. By that time, the aircraft at which it was fired would have traveled a third of a mile (assuming the plane was flying at 100 mph) and might have changed altitude and direction. The British Ministry of Munitions estimated that if the target were a plane 8,000 feet up. moving at 100 mph, the antiaircraft batteries would have to fire 162,000 rounds simultaneously in order to put a shell in every position that the plane might occupy. Small wonder that postwar estimates credited antiaircraft batteries with only one "kill" per 5,000-8,000 rounds. There was every reason to believe that aircraft would continue to improve in performance, flying ever faster and higher, becoming ever more elusive targets; yet, in the 1920s and the early 1930s, there were few compensating improvements in antiaircraft defense tech- niques, and few were visible on the horizon. These difficulties of air defense seemed to confirm Spaight's notion of the distinctive "penetrativeness" of the airplane and, in general, enhanced the possibilities for its offensive use. If the bomber could thus "get through," to use Stanley Baldwin's phrase, what should it choose as its target? Here again, the war provided some answers, con- firming some ideas of bombing policy and showing the weaknesses of others. In the first weeks of the war, aircraft often intervened directly against enemy troops and positions, sometimes with considerable suc- cess. But those were days when the war was still one of movement, when great bodies of infantry and cavalry could be caught on the march or bivouacked in the field. Soon the armies went to earth, and the front stabilized into a complex of trenches and "dug-in" gun emplacements designed to withstand bombardment. For airmen, the front now offered smaller and less vulnerable targets. For attacks to have any chance of success, they had to be delivered at low altitude, where plane and pilot were subjected to the den
