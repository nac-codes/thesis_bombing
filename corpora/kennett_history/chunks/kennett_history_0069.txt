airmen, the front now offered smaller and less vulnerable targets. For attacks to have any chance of success, they had to be delivered at low altitude, where plane and pilot were subjected to the dense and dangerous fire that had become characteristic of the front. Not surprisingly, bombing planes were drawn to targets elsewhere that were more accessible and less fiercely defended. Direct intervention in the land battles was not totally abandoned, but generally the various air services did not regard it as a good invest- ment. In the spring of 1918, when the Ludendorff offensive tore a great gap in the Allied line and the German Army broke out into the open field, French and British aircraft were sent to stem the German advance until new lines could be formed. The air attacks did slow the Germans down, but at great cost to the airmen. Some units suffered 25 percent casualties per day, and the life expectancy of an Allied pilot was eight days. The impression left by such episodes was a durable one. Most air forces in the interwar period regarded direct intervention in the land battle as a mission to be undertaken only under exceptional circum- stances, and that view was reflected in tactical manuals. To be sure, there was a school of thought which held that with specifically designed aircraft and suitable tactics the air arm could contribute directly and effectively in ground operations. Amedeo Mecozzi in Italy and Camille Rougeron in France pleaded the case for what they called assault aviation, but resistance was very strong. Most theorists were convinced that the next war would be like the last, characterized by continuous, stable fronts with intensive fire, supported by deep "oper- ational" zones. This operational realm, with its varied and less fiercely defended targets, seemed a far better theater for bombing operations. Attacks behind the front proper had the fundamental goal of pre- venting the enemy army from drawing on supplies and reinforcements; in a bom
