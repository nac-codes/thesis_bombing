rgets, seemed a far better theater for bombing operations. Attacks behind the front proper had the fundamental goal of pre- venting the enemy army from drawing on supplies and reinforcements; in a bombing policy with this purpose, targets in the operational zone tended to merge with industrial objectives further to the rear. Attacks on the transport system and especially the railways were common to both areas, while the enemy's supply of artillery shells might be inter- rupted by destroying a depot in the operational zone or by attacking the factory where the shells were produced. As the bomber pilot flew deeper into the enemy's territory, the targets below him changed sub- tly in nature. As he destroyed objectives further away from the front, there was less chance that the destruction would have a direct and immediate impact on that front-but more of a chance that it might have an eventual impact on all the fighting fronts and the war effort  THE PROPHETS 48 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING as well, and in ways more than purely military. Thus, almost imper- ceptibly, bombing would change from operational to strategic. The evidence of the war seemed to indicate that great armies could be crippled and even destroyed simply by shutting off the flow of vital supplies. Capt. Hans Ritter speculated that Germany might well have won the Battle of Verdun if it had concentrated its bombing effort against the voie sacr√©e. This road was the only one by which the French could supply their army, and they could accomplish this only by running continuous truck convoys day and night. (In a ten-day period early in 1916, they transported 132 battalions of infantry and 22,000 tons of munitions and supplies.) Twentieth-century war machines proved so complex that they could be crippled by the short- age of a single commodity. The Germans worried constantly about their oil refinery at Pechelbronn; its absolutely critical production could have been stopped by a single well-placed French bom
