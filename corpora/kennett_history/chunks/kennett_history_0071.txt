short- age of a single commodity. The Germans worried constantly about their oil refinery at Pechelbronn; its absolutely critical production could have been stopped by a single well-placed French bomb. Although the French did bomb Pechelbronn several times, there was only minimal damage. As a general rule, the problem with the war against points sensibles, both in the operational zone and within the enemy's hinterland, was not so much a failure to identify the crucial targets as an inability to destroy them. There was a general tendency to overestimate the destructive effects of aerial bombs on unfortified structures, a tendency that continued to mislead air strategists during the interwar period. Lacking any reliable data on the effects of truly massive aerial bombardment, postwar strategists were compelled to reason by anal- ogy and extrapolation, a process that often led them to conclusions valid only on paper. Douhet, who was an artilleryman by training, "converted" an air attack into an artillery bombardment, where the destructive force was better known. He considered that 500 tons of aerial bombs would be the equivalent in destructiveness of ten thou- sand 305mm projectiles, since they would contain the same amount of high explosive. This quantity, he estimated, could be delivered in a single raid by a force of one thousand bombers. The French ace Ren√© Fonck calculated that a 4,400-pound bomb would destroy everything within a radius of 165 feet and a force of five hundred bombers each carrying such a projectile could level an area of 247 acres in a single night; in two or three weeks of mighty raids, they could destroy all of Paris. There are large discrepancies, however. Douhet says a city can be destroyed with 500 tons of high explosive, while Fonck estimates 49 that 15,000-20,000 tons are needed. But there are other problems: all of the bombers must reach the city-many nights in succession, in Fonck's scenario-and distribute their bombs in such a way that
