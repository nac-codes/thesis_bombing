9 that 15,000-20,000 tons are needed. But there are other problems: all of the bombers must reach the city-many nights in succession, in Fonck's scenario-and distribute their bombs in such a way that each projectile complements the work of the others, forming a vast, contin- uous pattern of destruction. In order for the pattern to be flawless, each plane, each pilot, each bombardier, and each bomb had to func- tion perfectly. The inaccuracy of aerial bombing became obvious during the war, but it was the studies conducted after the conflict was over that indi- cated how serious the problem really was. Shortly after the war, the British Air Ministry conducted a bombing survey in the Rhine area where the Independent Air Force had been active; the survey revealed that air attacks on railway stations and junctions had not had any serious effect. Russia's Gen. N. N. Golovin reported the same result from the eastern front. When the French reoccupied the Briey Basin, they made a thorough study of the effects of their blockade. Of thir- teen hundred bombs aimed at the Thionville railway station, only a hundred had struck the target, and a fourth of them failed to explode. The movement of iron ore through Thionville had continued uninter- rupted. The Germans had not been encouraged either. They regarded the great arsenal at Woolwich, just east of London, as a prime bomb- ing target; but during three and a half years of bombing raids, they managed to hit the sprawling complex-about two square miles of target-on only a single occasion. Aerial bombing was thus a highly inaccurate undertaking and seemed likely to to remain so in the foreseeable future. Maj. Oliver Stewart, writing in 1925, said with disarming frankness that a bomber "can hit a town from ten thousand feet-if the town is big enough."11 These words were not very reassuring, considering that the bombsight, the key element in accurate bombing, had been under continuous development for at least a dozen years.
