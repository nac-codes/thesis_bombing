is big enough."11 These words were not very reassuring, considering that the bombsight, the key element in accurate bombing, had been under continuous development for at least a dozen years. The instrument had grown significantly more complex since 1914, when French bombardiers used as a sighting device three nails driven into the fuselage of their Voisin pushers. By the mid-1920s the course-setting bombsight was coming into use; its chief advantage over the sights used in 1917-18 was that it freed the bombing plane from the necessity of approaching the target from upwind or downwind. In sheer accuracy, however, it offered little advantage over the sights used toward the end of the war. Major Oliver Stewart felt there would be no great improvements in  50 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE PROPHETS 51 the near future, and in fact, it was not until the late 1930s that another generation of more accurate bombsights appeared. If, for the moment, it was not possible to hit objectives of limited size with a few accurately aimed bombs, the other solution was to direct at those objectives larger numbers of bombs not so accurately aimed. The French estimated that they could have effectively block- aded the Briey Basin even with the customary low rate of hits. although they would have needed to increase bombing tonnages a hun- dredfold. The practice of employing sizable numbers of bombers on a single raid was adopted by most belligerents and was further refined after the war. The practice in the French air service in the 1920s was to use the aerial equivalent of what the artillerymen called "zone fire." Fifty or more bombers would fly over the objective in succeeding for- mations, releasing their bombs so that they fell in a rectangular pat- tern 250-320 feet wide and 320 feet or more long. The target, lying within this rectangle, would of necessity be hit. As a French officer explained, "On account of the sources of error we have studied, it is necessary to use about 800 pr
