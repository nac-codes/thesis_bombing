r more long. The target, lying within this rectangle, would of necessity be hit. As a French officer explained, "On account of the sources of error we have studied, it is necessary to use about 800 projectiles to produce the desired effect on a target."12 This is an early example of a practice that came to be known as area bombing. In the 1920s this technique had a severe limitation: it could only be used in day bombing. Night flying in near proximity to other planes was seldom attempted because of fear of collision. At night the bomb- ers usually took off at regular intervals, going to their target Indian file and following a somewhat different route back. (The German Gothas had departed for England at five- or ten-minute intervals.) By the 1940s the difficulties of flying at night were being resolved, so that massive attacks were possible in World War II. Zone or area bombing also had the obvious disadvantage of inefficiency; the bombers had to transport and release several hundred bombs in order for a score of them to strike the target. The projectiles that missed a factory might explode harmlessly in a field, but there was also the possibility-a gen- uinely troubling one to some theorists of air power-that they would fall on the factory workers' homes. Here we encounter that aspect of strategic bombardment which was at once the most promising and the most controversial: air attacks whose target was the enemy's civilian population or at least the morale of that population. One of the great discoveries of the war was the value of psychological factors. Despite all the sophisticated gadgetry of the war, it had been at bottom a contest of wills and of endurance. Germany's defeat offered eloquent proof, which the Germans them- selves were the first to accept. The German Navy had scarcely seen action; not a single foot of German territory had been invaded. Yet, at the end of 1918, the whole country suffered a sort of collapse-a massive disintegration of confidence, of
