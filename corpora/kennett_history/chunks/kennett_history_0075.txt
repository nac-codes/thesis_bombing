Navy had scarcely seen action; not a single foot of German territory had been invaded. Yet, at the end of 1918, the whole country suffered a sort of collapse-a massive disintegration of confidence, of resolve, of belief in victory- which compelled the German government to sue for peace. The Allies were witnesses to this astounding collapse, which some of their weapons and techniques helped induce. Much of the credit was claimed by Allied propaganda agencies, which spent half their time bolstering the morale of their own populations and the other half trying to undermine that of the Germans. Spokesmen for the Allied navies argued that privation and distress caused by their blockade had been major factors; but the experience of 1914-18 also confirmed the prewar notion that air attacks had significant psychological effects on those subjected to them. Sir Hugh Trenchard estimated that the psy- chological "yield" of the RAF's attacks on the Rhine towns was about twenty times the material damage inflicted. The RAF's postwar bombing survey in the Rhine verified what the British had noticed at Woolwich in 1917: when there was frequent bombing in the area, pro- duction fell. Workers who spent their nights in basements and sub- ways listening for the sound of bombs either did not come to work or performed poorly if they did. Here was a bombing technique that could curb the enemy's war production without destroying its facto- ries. It required neither great accuracy nor heavy commitment. After all, as P. R. C. Groves observed, a single airplane could keep an entire city awake. And if it triggered the air-raid warning system, it would produce the desired effect without dropping a single bomb. The town of Trier suffered seven air raids, but its air-raid warning system sent inhabitants scurrying to cover 107 times. The nearby town of Bous had seven raids and 300 alerts-and each alert emptied the factories for an hour and sometimes more. Where the bombing of urban areas was done w
