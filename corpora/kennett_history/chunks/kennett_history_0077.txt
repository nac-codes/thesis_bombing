ew weapon: for a time after its introduction it has a powerful psy- chological effect. Firearms had enjoyed the same sort of status when they were first introduced. Inherent in this interpretation was the assumption that aerial bombardment would ultimately lose its intim- idating effect. Group Capt. John Slessor, aide to Trenchard, preferred to think that the bomber was successful as a weapon against morale because it alone could attack the most vulnerable element in the pop- ulation, masses of civilians who did not have the discipline and "stick- ing power" of the military. This was also the view of Douhet, who believed that the great cities contained "the most delicate and suscep- tible part of the enemy."15 Given the distinctive psychological impact of aerial bombing, the experts were led on to the still unanswered question, How would the civilian population react to serious and sustained attacks directed at its "morale"? Some foresaw that such attacks would trigger massive panics, and here and there in the bombing episodes of the war, there were indeed glimpses of what those panics might be like. A crowd stampeded into a London subway at the beginning of one raid, and a similar incident claimed sixty lives in the Paris metro. Others felt that the raids would generate deep anger. Douhet, who studied press reports of the 1917 attacks on London, concluded that the average Londoner was as furious with his own government for its inability to protect him as he was with the Germans for attacking him. The anger would ultimately find outlets-perhaps in rioting and looting, as had occurred in isolated instances. There seemed an ominous possibility that the masses, impelled by fury, terror, or a combination of those emotions, could turn against their own leaders. Frenzied mobs in the capital, seeking an end to the nightmare, might storm the centers of government. No less an author- ity than Marshal Foch told Groves that a massive air attack could have such "a crushing mora
