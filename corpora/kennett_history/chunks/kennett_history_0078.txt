in the capital, seeking an end to the nightmare, might storm the centers of government. No less an author- ity than Marshal Foch told Groves that a massive air attack could have such "a crushing moral effect on a nation" that its government would find itself disarmed.16 H. A. Jones, writing in the official history of the RAF, even suggested that the Germans could have provoked an emotional tidal wave in London, had they played their cards more astutely: "A German night-bombing campaign against London in February or early in March, 1918, might have had results leading to a popular clamour which the government might have found them- selves unable to withstand."17 This would be, in effect, a variant of the "knockout blow"; the bombers do not attack the centers of power directly, but instead, they set the masses in motion against those cen- ters. In either case the outcome would be the same: the paralysis of the enemy, followed by his capitulation. Even if it were an infallible means to victory, a bombing policy whose sole purpose was to demoralize the enemy's population would have been extremely difficult to defend in the period between the wars. Understandably enough in the aftermath of the slaughter of 1914-18, the public regarded any method of war designed to terrorize the civil- ian population as morally indefensible, and a number of air power the- orists felt the same way. Some theorists preferred to link the concept of morale bombing with the more acceptable one of making war on the enemy's industries and other points sensibles. The actual purpose of strategic bombing became twofold: to deprive the enemy of both the material means and the will to continue the war. Even then, Billy Mitchell often spoke of the goals of strategic bombardment in curi- ously veiled terms; he mentions, for example, targets in the enemy's territory "which are further back than his troops are."18 Others used the euphemism "direct action" for attacks directed at the enemy's capital.
