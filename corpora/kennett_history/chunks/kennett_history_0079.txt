; he mentions, for example, targets in the enemy's territory "which are further back than his troops are."18 Others used the euphemism "direct action" for attacks directed at the enemy's capital. When John Slessor took up strategic bombing, he told his readers that "the moral issue should be borne in mind as a background to the consideration of the narrower-but probably not less impor-  54 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE PROPHETS tant-aspect of the problem, the dislocation and restriction by air action of the supply of war material at the source."" By the "moral issue," Slessor meant morale, but although he mentioned it, he devoted his attention exclusively to the material effects of bombing. Spaight came to grips with the ethical issue in several books. He was obviously troubled over the morality of attacks on the civilian pop- ulation, and the twists and turns in his thinking are visible in his works. He presented the rationale for such attacks clearly and suc- cinctly: "It is the sovereign people who will war today, and it is their nerve and morale that must be broken. The great cities are convenient assemblages of the sovereign people; therefore smash the cities and you smash the will to war."20 Writing in 1924, Spaight was sure this bombing policy would work: "No amount of composure, no surplusage of bull-dog tenacity can save a people raided copiously, scientifically. systematically."21 Six years later he was not so sure: "The difficulty is that you may not smash the will to war. You may only harden it, intensify it."22 In 1924, Spaight could justify assaults on the cities, on the grounds that they would decide the war quickly and thus actually save lives; the slaughter, he said, would be "as nothing compared with that of the older war."23 But, by 1930, attacks on urban populations were repugnant to Spaight. He called them "bad work for civilization" and he concentrated his efforts on preventing them.24 Spaight's dozen books on military aviation are reposit
