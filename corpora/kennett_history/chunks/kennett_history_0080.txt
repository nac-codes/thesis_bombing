on urban populations were repugnant to Spaight. He called them "bad work for civilization" and he concentrated his efforts on preventing them.24 Spaight's dozen books on military aviation are repositories of intel- ligent analysis and intellectual honesty, but they offer no comprehen- sive theory of strategic air power. Their author knew he was dealing with a weapon that had scarcely been tested, and the future use of which depended upon a number of technological unknowns; hence, the tentative, conditional nature of his conclusions. At the same time, he was clearly repelled by the idea of training the weapon on urban masses, although in raw terms they offered the most rewarding target. What was needed was a theoretician who could move beyond both technological trammels and moral reservations, a prophet who could forge a bold, comprehensive strategy for the new weapon, drawn from "cold logic and mathematical calculation."25 This prophet was Giulio Douhet. Although Douhet is probably the most celebrated theorist of air power, he had surprisingly little firsthand contact with military avia- tion. He was posted to the Aviation Section of the Italian Army shortly before World War I and served as its director for a few months 55 in 1913 and 1914. His tenure was a stormy one; he was transferred out of aviation after two investigations of his conduct (although the problem was not so much his advocacy of advanced ideas-as some of his admirers have hinted-but his dogmatic and imperious nature). He returned to the air service briefly in 1918 but retired from the army in the same year. In 1922, Mussolini named him "subsecretary of aeronautics," but Douhet soon abandoned that post as well. After 1923 he spent his time writing. It is more than likely that air power's most eloquent spokesman never learned to fly; in any event, his name does not appear on the lists of licensed pilots through 1918. The details of Douhet's career are important because they help explain how his views
