pokesman never learned to fly; in any event, his name does not appear on the lists of licensed pilots through 1918. The details of Douhet's career are important because they help explain how his views on air power could be so sweeping and so cate- gorical. They were developed in a vacuum of sorts, unfettered by prac- tical considerations. Douhet's bombers always flew; his pilots always found their targets. Furthermore, Douhet's most productive years as a theorist, the 1920s, were also years of semi-isolation and bitterness, judging from his published letters. His views became more rigid, and their application, more thoroughgoing. In the 1921 edition of his Com- mand of the Air, he proposed two air establishments, one independent and strategic, the other "auxiliary" to the land and sea forces; in his later work, the auxiliary air force was swept away. The offensive capa- bilities of the multiengined bomber grew in his perception until it became the supreme weapon for attack, and in the end, he would have abolished every other type of aircraft. From its status as "brother" and peer of the land and sea services, the air force rose to a sort of hege- mony, having first call on the nation's resources because it alone could secure victory. Like most other theorists of air power, Douhet spoke of the twin aims of strategic bombing as the destruction of both the enemy's mat√©riel and his psychological means of resistance. If he never com- pletely divorced the two, he did give strong indications that the cam- paign against morale was the more important. He had no compunc- tions about sending bombers against civilian populations, and on this subject he wrote with that relentless tough-mindedness so much in vogue in Fascist Italy. Making war on the masses was justified because it worked, and that was what counted: "Humanity and civi- lization may avert their eyes, but this is the way it will be, inevitably. And for that matter, the conception of belligerents and non-belliger- en
