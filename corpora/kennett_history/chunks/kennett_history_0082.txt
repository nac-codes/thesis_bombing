rked, and that was what counted: "Humanity and civi- lization may avert their eyes, but this is the way it will be, inevitably. And for that matter, the conception of belligerents and non-belliger- ents is outmoded. Today it is not armies but whole nations which make  56 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE PROPHETS 57 war; and all the citizens are belligerents and all are exposed to the hazards of war. The only salvation will be in caves, but those caves cannot hold entire cities, fleets, railways, bridges, industries, etc."26 The air war would be vicious and terrifying, and it would be won by the nation that endured stoically the enemy's blows and delivered more terrible ones itself. The quickest way to victory was through ter- ror. If light bombing produced panic-and here Douhet was impressed above all by the reported effects of bombing on the popu- lation of London-then massive bombing would create mass hysteria He placed great importance on the use of gas bombs, going so far as to say that his theories would not be valid if gas was not a successful weapon. He estimated that a modest air fleet of three hundred bomb- ers, each carrying two tons of gas bombs, could kill fifty thousand peo- ple in each of ten different cities, and in eight missions the fleet would account for 4 million deaths in eighty different localities. This "terri- fying offensive" would kill only one out of ten people in any given locality, but it would make life unbearable for the other nine and force the enemy population to its knees. 27 This appalling vision did not go unchallenged. The publication of a second edition of Command of the Air in 1927 created a storm of controversy in the Regia Aeronautica (the 1921 edition seems to have been largely ignored). Douhet was deeply involved in these doctrinal battles-which he clearly relished-when death overtook him early in 1930. The supreme prophet of airborne Armageddon died peacefully in a rose garden on Saint Valentine's Day. At that time he co
