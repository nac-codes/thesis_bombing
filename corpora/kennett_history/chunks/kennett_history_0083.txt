trinal battles-which he clearly relished-when death overtook him early in 1930. The supreme prophet of airborne Armageddon died peacefully in a rose garden on Saint Valentine's Day. At that time he could hardly have been known outside of Italy. Command of the Air did not appear in French, German, and Russian translations until the mid- 1930s; American and British editions appeared in 1942 and 1943, respectively, although manuscript translations are known to have cir- culated earlier in the RAF and the U.S. Army Air Corps. Robin Higham, who studied the development of British air power concepts between the wars, concludes that the views of the Italian theorist counted for nothing in that development. A half century after his death Giulio Douhet remains the best known theorist of air power and also the least understood. There is no satisfactory biography of the man, and studies of his thought have rarely gone beyond Command of the Air, a small sampling of his volu- minous writings over two decades. Speculation and controversy still swirl about Douhet. Higham and other historians speak of the "myth" of his influence between the wars, and they can put forward some impressive evidence. Amedeo Mecozzi has questioned the originality of Douhet's thought, arguing that much seems to have been taken from the works of Ader and other early writers. There are those who see Douhet as a creature of Gianni Caproni, with whom he was closely associated for years. This interpretation finds special favor among Marxist historians. We need not concern ourselves further with these quarrels. What- ever his reasons were for writing, Douhet stated the case for air power as no one else did-with all the stops out. Even if he offered nothing startlingly new, the views were advanced with ringing certitude and Latin fervor. Those who read Command of the Air, early or late, often found bold confirmation of ideas stirring in their own minds. But if the extreme case for air power attracted some, it re
