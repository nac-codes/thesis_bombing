irplane and the dirigible as allies, because they seemed likely to make national bound- aries and barriers obsolete as they came and went at will through the open skies, promoting contacts and understanding between peoples and binding them together for mutual benefit. One of those who believed in this idyllic future for aviation was Bertha von Suttner, pac- ifist, reformer, and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1905. Frau von Suttner lobbied vigorously at the first Hague conference in 1899. While there, she noted, "Inventors of airships and flying machines send me their plans and prospectuses."1 By the conquest of the atmo- sphere, national boundaries, with their customs houses and fortifica- tions, would soon disappear-or so said her correspondents. But the airship and the "flying machine" began to show up regu- larly at army maneuvers and naval exercises and to make a place for themselves alongside the traditional weapons. At that point, the par- tisans of peace and international understanding began to feel doubtful about the role of the airplane. The German Social Democratic news- paper Vorw√§rts warned its readers on October 9, 1907, "It really seems that in addition to our lordly army and our not quite so lordly but very pretentious fleet, we must also have militarism in the air." The Italo-Turkish War of 1911-12 brought the first use of the new air weapons as well as a round of protest against their use. The very first bombing attack against Ain Zara stirred up controversy when the Turks claimed the bomb had hit a hospital. The Italian government denied the charge but was concerned enough to try to find out dis- creetly if the Turks were telling the truth. They probably were not (the Italians had already shelled the objective by conventional means with- out any protests from the Turks); even so, the Ain Zara affair served to open a debate on the morality of aerial bombing. Bertha von Suttner fiercely denounced what she called the "bar- barization of the air,"
