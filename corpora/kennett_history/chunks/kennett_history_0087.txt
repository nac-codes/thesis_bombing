In England the wisdom of reprisal was much debated. Many professed they could not see the logic in punish- ing the inhabitants of a peaceful German town for the cruelties of a German U-boat commander. A conclave of the Church of England denounced reprisals, and the Archbishop of Canterbury spoke out against them.
