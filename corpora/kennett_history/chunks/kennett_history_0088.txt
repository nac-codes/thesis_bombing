Germans could hold their traditional Corpus Christi proces- sions safely. The British government honored the request. Unfortu- nately, on that same day, German long-range cannon fired a number of shells into Paris. In October 1918, the German government took another step. It sought to return to its bombing policy of 1914, limiting aerial bom- bardment to the battle zone, in the obvious hope that the Allies would reciprocate. The Allies did not, but it should be noted that about the same time, the U.S. government was showing concern over the RAF's bombing offensive. Secretary of War Newton Baker sent word that the American air service would not participate in any plan which had as its objective "promiscuous bombing upon industry, commerce, or population."5 What this might have meant for the air campaign of 1919, one can only guess; as it was, the war ended before American bombers could make anything more than a very modest contribution. The end of the war brought the first, and in some ways the most successful, effort to reduce the aerial danger. Although the effort was completely one-sided, involving the forced aerial disarmament of Ger- many by the Allies, it is important because it demonstrated for the first time some of the practical difficulties in regulating air arma- ments. The aerial disarmament of Germany began with the armistice of November 1918. According to the armistice's terms, Germany was obliged to turn over sizable quantities of war material as a pledge of its good faith. Aircraft figured prominently in the list of seventeen hundred weapons to be surrendered; the Allies required that all air- craft of two types be included in that number: the Fokker D-VII fight- ers and the night bombers. A month later, the Allies complained that they had received only 25 bombers out of a total of 730 aircraft received (many of the Gothas and R-planes had been lost in missions over the western front). When the Allies sat down to prepare their peace terms, they found
