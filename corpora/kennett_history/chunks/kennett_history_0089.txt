5 bombers out of a total of 730 aircraft received (many of the Gothas and R-planes had been lost in missions over the western front). When the Allies sat down to prepare their peace terms, they found that while they were in agreement on the disarmament of Germany, they differed very much on how, and to what degree, disarmament should be accomplished. When Lloyd George proposed setting a limit of two hundred thousand men for the German Army and air service combined, General Duval of the French air service questioned whether Germany should be allowed an air force at all. The other Allies made no objections to a blanket prohibition, so the text of the Treaty of Versailles came to read: "The armed forces of Germany must not include any military or naval air forces." A minor and temporary exception were the hundred seaplanes that the German government  62 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING BANNING THE BOMBER could continue to operate in order to aid in the search for the thou- sands of naval mines sown during the war.

The British thought a ban on all production and impor- tation for a period of two to five years might not be a bad thing, while the French favored a period of twenty or thirty years. In the end, the Americans and others argued successfully that a total ban was unduly punitive, and it was in force for only a few months.
