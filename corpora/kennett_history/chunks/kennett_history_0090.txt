rned over to the Allies some sixteen thousand aircraft and sixteen dirigibles. The Germans had little chance to hold anything back. German airspace was open to Allied planes; in addition, the Inter-Allied Control Commission had the right to roam Germany, looking into arsenals, factories, and hangars. The inspection team that visited Poll Airfield near Cologne shortly after the armistice made what seemed a particularly ominous find-an unfinished bombing plane of truly gigantic proportions. Its wings, measuring half the length of a football field, were to carry ten motors; its landing wheels were seven feet, nine inches in diameter. Workmen said it was being built to raid New York. These rights of inspection ultimately proved incompatible with Germany's notion of its own sovereignty, and indeed, it is hard to imagine any nation submitting to them unless, like Germany in 1918, it was submitting to force majeure. As emotions subsided and Ger- many was accepted back into the family of nations, the Allies made a series of concessions. In 1922 they permitted the production of com- mercial and civilian aircraft, in 1923 they relinquished to Germany complete control of its airspace, and in 1926 the Inter-Allied Control Commission withdrew. Germany was still committed to maintaining no military or naval air forces, but there was no longer any effective way to know if it were honoring its commitment. The other problem in maintaining Germany's aerial disarmament was in distinguishing between military aircraft, which were prohib- ited, and commercial craft, which were not. Where the problem was most acute was in craft designed to carry sizable loads of passengers or merchandise. The basic hallmark of the bomber was also its ability 63 to carry a heavy load, and in fact, the difference between bomber and transport was very small indeed. A plane built as a bomber could very easily be converted to haul passengers; Frederick Handley Page proved this at war's end when he placed rows
