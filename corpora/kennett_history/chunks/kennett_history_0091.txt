ce between bomber and transport was very small indeed. A plane built as a bomber could very easily be converted to haul passengers; Frederick Handley Page proved this at war's end when he placed rows of wicker seats in his 0/400 bombers and opened a passenger service between London and Paris. But convertibility worked two ways. Aircraft that the Germans had built as transports seemed to the Allied inspectors potential bomb- ers, and they seized them forthwith, despite the vigorous protest of their German builders and owners. So frequent were the seizures and the disputes that in 1922 the Allied authorities drew up a set of guide- lines, which they then imposed on the Germans. The Nine Rules, as they were called, classified as "military," and therefore illegal, any airplane with a speed of 170 kilometers (102 miles) an hour, a maxi- mum ceiling of 4,000 meters (13,000 feet) or more, or "a useful load of more than 600 kgs. [1,320 lbs.] including pilot, mechanic and instruments."6 So long as they were enforced, these rules effectively prevented Germany from building planes that could carry out aerial bombardment. Unfortunately, at the same time, they prevented Ger- many from building viable commercial aircraft. The Nine Rules, like so many other Allied regulations, ceased to be applied in the late 1920s. The rather arbitrary disarming of Germany was only the first step in what many hoped would be a worldwide movement to reduce arma- ments. The impetus in the postwar world was strong, producing a sig- nificant agreement on limiting naval armaments at the Washington Naval Conference of 1921-22. The Aviation Subcomittee of the con- ference explored the possibility of limiting military aircraft (Billy Mitchell was one of the American representatives). Air power did not lend itself to the sorts of limitations that could be placed on battle- ships. To begin with, the subcommittee could find no basis for alloting so many planes to one country and so many to another. Furthermo
