self to the sorts of limitations that could be placed on battle- ships. To begin with, the subcommittee could find no basis for alloting so many planes to one country and so many to another. Furthermore, it was impossible to put restrictions on bombers, either in number or in performance, without also imposing restrictions on commercial air- craft that could be converted into bombers. This, said the subcommit- tee, would "shut the door" on aviation progress. These special prob- lems were referred by the conference to the Commission of Jurists, which was to concern itself with "new agencies of warfare"-the air- plane and the radio. The Commission of Jurists met at The Hague from December 1922 until February 1923, when it issued a code of aerial warfare that came  BANNING THE BOMBER 64 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING to be known as the Hague Draft Rules. The legal experts were from six countries: the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands; they were assisted in their deliberations by mil- itary and naval experts. At the outset the panel decided not to try to set limitations on the aircraft themselves (for example, number or type) but only the way they were used in war. Moreover, they decided that there was no purpose in resurrecting the rules of the earlier Hague conferences and that therefore they would start afresh. The jurists did not conceal their feelings about aerial bombing as it had been practiced in the war: "The conscience of mankind revolts against this form of making war outside the actual theatre of military operations, and the feeling is universal that limitations ought to be imposed."7 They also acknowledged that they had an extremely diffi- cult task before them, and as it turned out, their views about what to do were very diverse. The Americans wanted to make a sharp distinc- tion between bombing in, and outside of, the "combat area" with the latter being severely restricted. The Japanese and the Dutch, whose countries
