l or psychological effect within the enemy country.' In a future war the bombers would be drawn inexorably to cities and industrial centers; as in the last war, they would find convenient "mil- itary" targets to aim for in both places, even though they would not be able to hit them. Here Spaight quoted a French pilot of the Great War: "In the war reports there are always passages which make one smile, such as the dropping of ten bombs from a height of 2000 meters [6,600 feet] upon 'military establishments.'"10 Yet, Spaight could not accept the idea that aerial warfare might degenerate into what he called "strong cave-man stuff." He felt that in the next war most long-distance bombing would be done by night, and he hoped that an understanding could be reached whereby the night bombers could come and strike the vital centers, both political  - BANNING THE BOMBER j A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING id economic, while the bulk of the population was not in them. The example that Spaight gave was the City of London. The day popula- tion of its 675 acres was over four hundred thousand people; at night that figure dropped to fourteen thousand. If arrangements could be made to lodge those fourteen thousand elsewhere, the City would become an area in which enemy bombers could do enormous material damage, but at the same time spare human life. "In brief," wrote Spaight, "I will give you property to destroy, if you will give me life to save."11 Spaight also found another reason for hope, one that perhaps only an Englishman could find. He dwelt at some length on the spirit of chivalry that had appeared in the various air services during the war. This might well be encouraged by requiring, for example, that an offi- cer be in command of each airplane. With gentlemen at the controls. bombing squadrons would better resist the caveman approach to their work. One of the American advisers at the Hague meeting was Capt. William C. Sherman, who was at the time an instructor in air tactics
