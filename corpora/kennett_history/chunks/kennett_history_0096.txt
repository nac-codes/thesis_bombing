bing squadrons would better resist the caveman approach to their work. One of the American advisers at the Hague meeting was Capt. William C. Sherman, who was at the time an instructor in air tactics at the Command and General Staff School, Fort Leavenworth. Sher- man held to the notion that considerations of fair play and humanity would mitigate the horrors of the next war in the air: "Among peoples in whom the spirit of sport has been strongly inculcated, it is peculiarly abhorrent to contemplate the waging of war on unarmed civilians of all ages and sexes."12 In a more practical vein, he felt that the fear of reprisal would keep the air war from degenerating into indiscriminate attacks on the cities. These restraints seemed to him more likely to be effective than the Hague rules. The skepticism that both Spaight and Sherman felt about the Hague rules was probably shared by a good many of the other tech- nical delegates. As the Draft Rules became known, the reaction to them in military and aviation circles was sometimes emphatically hos- tile. C. G. Grey, editor of the Aeroplane, wrote in the issue of July 11, 1923, that the only practical result of the bombing code would be to "cramp the style" of the RAF at the beginning of a war: "If we go bang into the next war all hair and teeth and blood, as the saying goes, free from any fetters of rules and regulations, we may achieve quite useful results at the start." Such considerations as these probably impressed the governments of the interwar period. In any event, there was no rush to ratify the Hague rules. By 1939 they still were draft rules only and not legally binding on any of the belligerents; still, in 67 the first months of the conflict they were voluntarily observed by those belligerents. The idea of a code of bombing rules had to vie with another concept that enjoyed considerable popularity in the interwar period, that of an international air force. In its inception, the idea was probably tracea- ble to the
