In its inception, the idea was probably tracea- ble to the French. At the end of the war, the French government put forward what came to be called the Bourgeois Plan, which would have placed at the disposal of the League of Nations a multinational peace- keeping force. (France was probably the most influential member of the League in its early years and regarded it as an agency for pre- serving and policing the Versailles settlement.)

Essentially, the scheme would concentrate either the bulk or the totality of air power into a peacekeeping force under an international agency that would also regulate and monitor commercial aviation throughout the world.

The French politician Edouard Herriot wanted to create a permanent international air force, while Adm. Robert Lawson of the Royal Navy proposed a "European Air Service" for police purposes.
