reserve. This air force would be composed of three thousand airplanes, the great bulk of them bombers. They were to be flown by men recruited between the ages of twenty-one and thirty, who signed up for ten years' service and, in doing so, gave up their national alle- giance. As a point of delicacy they would not be required to participate in hostilities against their country of origin. The strategic reserve would be commanded by a marshal who took his orders from the League. The headquarters of the reserve was to be in Tunisia, but it would also have advance bases in France and Poland; it could use the airspace of any country at will above the altitude of 10,000 feet. Charlton, too, offered a scenario to explain how the reserve would  68 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING BANNING THE BOMBER work: an Italian dictator named Rodolfo Pizzicato began an aggres- sive war against Egypt, only to sue for peace twenty-four hours later, after reserve bombers had shattered Italy's naval bases and pushed its population to mass panic with a publicly announced plan to devastate the country's urban centers one by one. Charlton was also a prominent participant in the sometimes noisy debate over air control in the British Empire, which frequently showed the bombing plane in a highly unfavorable light. Charlton went to serve with the RAF in Iraq in 1923. He soon discovered in a local hospital a number of victims of British bombs and learned that "an air bomb in Iraq was, more or less, the equivalent of a police trun- cheon at home."13 After seeing a score of women and children killed and wounded camels run in circles until they dropped, Charlton sent his superior a strong letter of protest and left Iraq. About the same time, Evelyn Waugh reported from South Africa that British airmen there spent their time harassing a local tribe because it refused to pay a tax on its dogs. RAF spokesmen did their best to defend air control, which they painted as eminently humane when compared to the tr
