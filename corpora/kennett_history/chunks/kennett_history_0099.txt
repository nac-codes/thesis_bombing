spent their time harassing a local tribe because it refused to pay a tax on its dogs. RAF spokesmen did their best to defend air control, which they painted as eminently humane when compared to the tra- ditional methods employed by the British army: "Some casualties are bound to occur to tribesmen and their animals, and some damage to property, but the main purpose is to bring about submission with the minimum of destruction and loss of life. Aircraft skilfully used without causing serious loss can produce a maximum of discomfort and wea- riness for an indefinite time."14 Such assurances did little to silence the critics, and the debate boiled on, fueled by questions in Parliament and indignant letters to the Times.

Rumors spread that the French pilots were bomb- ing mosques, and a clamor arose in the Chamber of Deputies. The affair took on international proportions when the press revealed that a band of American volunteers was flying with the French. At about the same time, the Spanish were trying out bombs against dissidents in their portion of Morocco. None of these episodes did much to enhance aerial bombing in the public eye. By the early 1930s, storm clouds were gathering again over Europe itself; the experts were painting appalling pictures of what the next war in the air would be like, and political leaders were accepting those pictures as accurate.

When Baldwin spoke, he and his audience had their minds on the Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, or Geneva Disarm- ament Conference, which was then beginning its deliberations.
