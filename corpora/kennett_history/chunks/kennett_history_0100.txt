The governments and peoples of Europe seem to have sensed this, for the effort they made was an exceptional one. The Geneva conference was billed as a "world" conference, and the representation was impressive; it included the United States and the Soviet Union, powers whose presence underlined the importance and the global scope of the disarmament problem. When the conference opened in February 1932, the delegations found before them a number of possible solutions. The Preparatory Commission had been working intermittently since 1926 to find ways to limit and regulate arma- ments; Subcommittee B, for example, had struggled with the almost insoluble problem of defining bombing planes and distinguishing them from transport craft. There seems little doubt that when the conference opened, most of the delegations were genuinely interested in reducing and limiting arms, particularly in the air. But each nation wanted the swords to be beaten into plowshares in a certain way, and this was the rock on which the conference ultimately foundered. The French saw disarm- ament as a consequence of security, which necessarily came first. The British were willing to try a ban on weapons such as bombing planes or a prohibition of bombing itself, with one exception: they wanted to retain the use of bombers for the "air control" of their empire.
