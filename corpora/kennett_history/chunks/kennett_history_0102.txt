d service" was fighting for its life. For a time, the British government seriously contemplated abolishing all or part of its military aviation if that was what it took to get an international agreement which would protect Britain from aerial attacks. The other two services supported this policy, assuring the gov- ernment that they would supply the nation's defense needs without the assistance of their upstart competitor. A Royal Navy spokesman added insult to injury when he endorsed a ban on bombers: "Only the Air Ministry want to retain these weapons for use against towns, a method of warfare which is revolting and un-English."15 At the same time, in French government discussions the senior services were mak- ing similar charges against the Arm√©e de l'Air. But there was no agreement at Geneva. If the negotiators shared a common goal, they could not find a common path to it. Then, in late January 1933, Hitler became chancellor and took the tiller of German foreign policy. His view on air power, as on armaments generally, was to play for time and rush Germany's rearmament so that he could speak and act from a position of strength. In October 1933 the Ger- man delegation left Geneva; Hitler's government announced it was withdrawing from the League of Nations. From time to time, Hitler would make sibylline pronouncements about negotiations on air arma- ments: in 1934 he was willing to maintain an air force half the size of that of France; in 1935 he said the air war might be limited gradually, beginning with a ban on bombing outside the battle zone. But the French and the British found it impossible to translate these utter- ances into firm agreements, and it is probable that by 1935, Hitler was determined to make no commitment that would interfere with Germany's rearmament. The rest of the delegations left Geneva in the spring of 1934. The French government announced that it would henceforth seek security through the "traditional" means. It would push its rearmament
