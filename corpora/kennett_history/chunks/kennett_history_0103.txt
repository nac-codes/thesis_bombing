nt. The rest of the delegations left Geneva in the spring of 1934. The French government announced that it would henceforth seek security through the "traditional" means. It would push its rearmament pro- grams, and it would shore up its military alliances. The French would still show an interest in schemes being devised on the other side of the Channel to regulate the air war, but only if those schemes strength- ened the security of France. Long after the Geneva conference became history the British gov- ernment persisted in its search for an answer to the air menace, a men- ace that it and the people it represented felt more keenly than anyone else. After the collapse of the Geneva conference the British pursued the idea of an "Air Locarno," an agreement by the major powers of Europe to abstain from aggressive air attacks and to turn their com- bined bomber forces on any transgressors. Hitler seemed interested briefly but then began to dwell on the difficulties; the French were interested too, but only if the British would sign a bilateral agreement spelling out how many RAF squadrons would come to the assistance of France if it were attacked. After 1936 the British shifted their effort. Since bombers could not be abolished and bombing could not be outlawed by international agreement, perhaps at least it could be regulated and limited. This was a return to the philosophy of the Hague conference of 1922-23. Here again the War Office and the Admiralty were in favor of restricting aerial bombardment, while the Air Ministry was opposed. That min- istry took a full year to draw up a plan for restricting warfare in the air. Then, in February 1938, Hitler made a speech before the Reichs- tag in which he threw cold water on any limitations scheme. The Brit- ish chiefs of staff, the chief of the air staff excepted, could think of only one other step. Britain might declare publicly that in the event of another war it would observe the Hague Draft Rules. Others might be enco
