f, the chief of the air staff excepted, could think of only one other step. Britain might declare publicly that in the event of another war it would observe the Hague Draft Rules. Others might be encouraged to follow its example. So ended a search for protection from the air menace that the historian Uri Bialer has portrayed as an obsession for those who ruled Britain in the thirties. But, even while they were searching, they were taking steps to create the most pow- erful strategic-bombing force Europe had ever seen.  72 THE RISE OF THE AIR FLEETS 73 CHAPTER 5 THE RISE OF THE AIR FLEETS IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING WORLD WAR I, France emerged as the greatest air power in Europe-indeed, in the world. In 1922 it and its allies in eastern Europe could muster 760 squadrons, about twice the air strength of all the rest of Europe combined. France's preeminence in the air was so great in the early 1920s that it became a concern for her neighbor across the Channel. At the time, there were policy dis- agreements between the two powers, and although the danger of war was a remote one, the British government found it had no way to counter a massive cross-Channel aerial assault. The RAF had been cut back drastically after the armistice, and much of its remaining strength was scattered throughout the British Empire. There were only five squadrons in England in 1922, so in August of that year the British cabinet ordered an increase in the RAF. Yet there was no real aerial arms race in the 1920s. While the victors of 1918 maintained a certain strength, there was little impetus to modernize. The French kept the Breguet 14 bomber in production until 1927, a full decade after its introduction. The RAF did not get a new bomber until 1923, followed by a new fighter in 1924. Devel- opment of new aircraft was leisurely-up to seven years from the issu- ance of government specifications for a new bomber to its introduction in the squadrons. For one thing, air budgets were tight and funds for de
