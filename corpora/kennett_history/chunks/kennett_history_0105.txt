aircraft was leisurely-up to seven years from the issu- ance of government specifications for a new bomber to its introduction in the squadrons. For one thing, air budgets were tight and funds for developmental work came only in driblets. But also, there seemed to be no hurry; in 1919 the British government adopted its "ten-year rule," which remained in force until 1932. Each year the cabinet renewed the rule, enjoining the armed services to make their plans and estimates on the assumption that there would be no major war for ten years. Such a rule is perfectly understandable in the context of the times. In the 1920s the British and French could see no major aggressor except each other, and even this threat disappeared when relations between the two countries improved after 1923. Germany was mani- festly unhappy over the outcome of the Great War, but it was dis- armed and friendless, as were its former allies. The Soviet Union was a genuinely troubling presence, but for the time being, it presented no serious danger in the air. In their early zeal, the Soviets denounced the warplane as a tool of imperialism and talked of converting aircraft factories to the manufacture of furniture. But they decided to retain their air arm, appropriately renamed the Peasants' and Workers' Air Fleet. By 1923 the new regime was promoting aviation with slogans like "Proletarians, take to the air!" Aerial rearmament required more than enthusiasm, and the Soviets found it a slow, demanding enterprise. For a decade, the Allies of 1918, and particularly the French, enjoyed military hegemony almost by default. The armaments and techniques dating from the Great War largely satisfied their needs. The chief enemies the British and French air forces had to contend with were Bedouins, Afghans, and Druses, all of whom could be intim- idated with vintage aircraft and bombs left over from 1918. Not sur- prisingly, military air fleets fell behind commercial ones in incorpo- rating improvements and
