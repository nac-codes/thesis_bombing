Druses, all of whom could be intim- idated with vintage aircraft and bombs left over from 1918. Not sur- prisingly, military air fleets fell behind commercial ones in incorpo- rating improvements and innovations. The picture changed radically in the thirties. The victors of 1918 and the peace they had imposed no longer seemed secure. The world economic crisis was accompanied by the emergence of totalitarian regimes with aggressive foreign policies. The military supremacy of the British and French came under challenge, nowhere quite so dra- matically as in the air. In 1931 the Italian Air Force put on an impres- sive display of its power, and a number of observers concluded that the Fascist regime was approaching air parity with France. In the spring of 1935, Hitler delivered a profound shock to the British gov- ernment when he told two of its envoys that his Luftwaffe was equal in strength to the RAF.  THE RISE OF THE AIR FLEETS 75 74 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING The thirties was a period of sometimes frantic activity as the air forces of Europe rushed to expand and modernize. Rearmament in the air was of course only part of rearmament in general. In each country the air service had to compete with sea and ground forces for a share of the defense budget. If the struggle was one common to all the air services, the result was not always the same. Britain's RAF was usu- ally able to obtain a hefty third of the defense allocation, and in some years, its appropriation far exceeded that of the British army. At the other end of the scale was Poland's air service, the Lotnistvo Wojsk- owe, which received only 3-4 percent of defense appropriations for the years 1936-39. Even when the funds were available, creating a bomber fleet was no easy task in the early thirties. An era of prolonged disarmament efforts and strong pacifist movements was not one receptive to devel- oping such a patently offensive weapon as the bomber. The Soviets were proclaiming that the more bombers a
