f prolonged disarmament efforts and strong pacifist movements was not one receptive to devel- oping such a patently offensive weapon as the bomber. The Soviets were proclaiming that the more bombers a country had, the more imperialistic it was. The very name bomber became an embarrass- ment. For a time in the thirties the French renamed their bomber force Heavy Defense Aviation, while the British referred to their bomber squadrons simply as Wessex Area. In America, Army Air Corps officials became uncomfortable whenever the press referred to the huge B-15 as a "superbomber." Design and development were considerably influenced by the international climate, and even by the ups and downs of the disarmament negotiations. The Germans cur- tailed work on their bomber needs in 1929 and 1930 in the belief that that type of aircraft would come under international regulation. The British delayed developing the heavy bomber partly because they believed for a time that they could convince the rest of Europe to adopt a weight limitation of three tons for bombing craft. The quest for identity and purpose common to all the air services of the thirties ended differently for each of them. The RAF perhaps came closest to Douhet's ideal of an independent service committed to its own strategic offensive. The Luftwaffe and the Arm√©e de l'Air were independent services also, but neither was oriented toward strategic operations divorced from the war on the ground. The U.S. Army Air Corps was an appendage of the army; nevertheless, it had a strong interest in strategic bombing. The Soviet air force, similarly depen- dent, did not share this strong interest. Italy's Regia Aeronautica had independence but no fixed views of its own function. Why were there so many different responses to the challenge of air power? In each country key personalities no doubt played a role. Dou- het's rigidity and thorniness of character probably helped assure that his ideas would not be adopted by the air service
