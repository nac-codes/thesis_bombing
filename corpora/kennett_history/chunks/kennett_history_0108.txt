ge of air power? In each country key personalities no doubt played a role. Dou- het's rigidity and thorniness of character probably helped assure that his ideas would not be adopted by the air service that he briefly headed. Hermann Goering's political standing and prestige certainly helped to secure the independence of the Luftwaffe, and there is also little doubt that it was Sir Hugh Trenchard who kept the RAF from losing its independent status in the interservice fighting of the early postwar period. It is tempting to look beyond the interplay of personalities to see if there are any meaningful patterns and parallels in the air power "for- mulas" devised in the various countries. The American historian Ber- nard Brodie has suggested that every air force that had "the admin- istrative and intellectual freedom" to do so was drawn to Douhetism.1 But many air services-those of Continental powers with a tradition- ally preponderant land army-were bound to that army because of its "tremendous prestige and insistent demands."2 The East German his- torian Olaf Groehler sees in strategic bombing a tool of imperialism, forged by a coalition of militarists and industrialists: Douhet and Cap- roni, Trenchard and Handley Page, Mitchell and William E. Boeing. The more powerful these Luftkriegsextremisten were in any given country, the more savagely destructive the bombing offensive they would devise.3 The proof of any theory is of course its applicability in specific cases; at this point, therefore, one should look at the combat doctrines and air fleets of the major powers as they emerged in the thirties. If there is a single document in which the raison d'Ãªtre of the RAF found expression, it is a memorandum that Sir Hugh Trenchard pre- pared in May 1928.4 Trenchard did not have a flair with words either in speaking or in writing, but in this instance-perhaps with the help of his aides-he put his case for air power very clearly: "The aim of the air force," he began, "is to bre
