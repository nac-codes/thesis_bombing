flair with words either in speaking or in writing, but in this instance-perhaps with the help of his aides-he put his case for air power very clearly: "The aim of the air force," he began, "is to break down the enemy's means of resis- tance by attacks on objectives selected as most likely to achieve this end." He then proceeded to prove that this policy was militarily sound, the best way to use aircraft in war, and not "contrary either to inter- national law or to the dictates of humanity." At the outset, the air force might contend with the enemy air fleet for air superiority, but this contest would be largely incidental to striking the key objectives, the enemy's "centers of production, transportation and communica- tion." Trenchard went on to describe the proper targets: production facilities for everything "from boots to battleships," rail systems,  76 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE RISE OF THE AIR FLEETS 77 docks and shipyards, wireless stations, and postal and telegraph systems. Trenchard went to some pains to explain that this sort of bombard- ment was neither illegal nor inhumane. The indiscriminate bombing of a city for the purpose of terrorizing its inhabitants was improper. but striking at legitimate military targets within that city and causing "incidental destruction of civilian life and property" was altogether acceptable. Trenchard argued that it was legitimate to frighten away workers in war industries, since their work was part of the enemy war effort. This "moral" effect was a sort of bonus to be added to the mate- rial destruction achieved, but in Trenchard's view, it might be of greater importance. Civilians were primarily vulnerable to assault on their state of mind: "They are not disciplined and it cannot be expected of them that they will stick stolidly to their lathes and benches under the recurring threat of air bombardment." He spoke of generating "a state of panic" and cited examples of work stoppages in Germany in 1918. To buttress h
