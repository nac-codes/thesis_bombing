ck stolidly to their lathes and benches under the recurring threat of air bombardment." He spoke of generating "a state of panic" and cited examples of work stoppages in Germany in 1918. To buttress his argument he quoted the prediction of Marshal Foch about the critical nature of the bomber. Trenchard retired from his post as chief of the air staff a year after he wrote the memorandum. The RAF entered the 1930s armed with his doctrines but not with an air fleet capable of carrying them out. In 1930 the fleet numbered about seven hundred planes, compared to eleven hundred in Mussolini's Regia Aeronautica and thirteen hundred in the French Air Force. The bombing craft of the early thir- ties were a kind of menagerie-Harts, Hinds, Wapitis, Wildebeests- bizarre in name and limited in performance. None of them had the ability to range over Europe with respectable bombloads, and in this sense they were inferior to the Handley Pages of 1918. Much of the explanation lies in the fact that the air war against a great power in Europe was only a theoretical possibility, while air control within the British Empire was a practical, everyday responsibility. Furthermore, in the troubled and disarmament-minded early thirties, it was proba- bly wise not to dwell on devastating raids against a neighboring coun- try's heartland. On the other hand, as policeman of the empire, the RAF could cast itself in a role somewhat more popular with both the British government and the public. A visiting Soviet aircraft designer saw the RAF's "image" displayed at the Hendon Air Show of 1936; "A big crowd of armed, dark-skinned people apparently personifying Arabs burst onto the airfield from some concealed hiding place. In white burnouses and headdresses they rushed at the stands, shouting and howling frightfully. But fighters appeared-strafed-bombs burst, machine guns rattled; the 'tribe' was wiped out to a single man."5 When Hitler came to power in 1933, the possibility of a major war increased a
