But fighters appeared-strafed-bombs burst, machine guns rattled; the 'tribe' was wiped out to a single man."5 When Hitler came to power in 1933, the possibility of a major war increased and the future antagonist began to take on shape and sub- stance. British air rearmament began seriously in 1934, with what was called Scheme A; once launched, it both accelerated and changed its objectives as the nation's military leaders reassessed their needs. By 1938 the schemes had run halfway through the alphabet with Scheme M, the purpose of which was to strengthen the fighter force. D. C. Watt has written that this and other measures to strengthen air defenses had to be achieved "in the teeth of the dominant British air force doctrine."6 True to Trenchard's views on the preeminence of the offensive, the air staff would have liked two bombers for each fighter, although it was unsure what proportion of those bombers should be for day use or which objectives would be the best. Not until 1937 did the British air staff seriously begin to study target possibilities in Ger- many. The results of that study, incorporated into the "Western Air Plans," were not encouraging. There were few easy, vulnerable tar- gets, particularly for the limited capabilities of Bomber Command. The rapid rise of the Luftwaffe further limited the possibilities for offensive action. Air strategists who had once spoken of aggressive bombing policies were now ready to limit their objectives sharply, striking none but obvious military targets in hopes that the Germans would do the same. This drastic shrinking of expectations was a humiliating experience for an air force that had made the strategic offensive its credo for two decades; but, in the long run, the effect was salutary. In 1936 the RAF chose the heavy four-engine bomber as its future weapon, and in 1938 it intensified its efforts to develop such planes. The Stirling, Halifax, and Lancaster heavy bombers that those efforts ultimately yiel
