the heavy four-engine bomber as its future weapon, and in 1938 it intensified its efforts to develop such planes. The Stirling, Halifax, and Lancaster heavy bombers that those efforts ultimately yielded began to weigh in the balance in 1942, the critical year of World War II. But, in 1939, Great Britain was to go to war with serious handicaps in the air. Radar and eight-gun fighters provided the "narrow margin" in the Battle of Britain, but Bomber Command suffered a series of failures in the first months of the war. Of its thirty-three operational squadrons, sixteen were equipped with aircraft incapable of mounting any sort of air offensive in the skies of Germany. The Bristol Blen- heim, a civilian design hastily adapted to military use, was no longer  78 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE RISE OF THE AIR FLEETS 79 the "wonder plane" it had been in 1936. And a third of Bomber Com- mand's squadrons flew the Fairey Battle, described by one of its pilots as "that gentle old tin swallow." Slow and underarmed, the Battles had become virtually obsolescent by 1939. In the campaign of 1940. Luftwaffe pilots would swat them out of the air with appalling ease. The British measured their own weakness by comparing it to the strength they saw in the Luftwaffe. But here there was a peculiar mir- ror effect. Sir Walter Raleigh had written of German air strategists during the Great War, "Their belief in frightfulness was a belief in fright. They judged others by themselves."7 In the years leading up to World War II, the British Air Council made this same judgment of the Luftwaffe. It assumed that German air strategy was similar to its own and found in the German bombing squadrons an enormous stra- tegic potential. At the outbreak of war in 1939, the British govern- ment stood braced for a massive aerial knockout blow that the Luft- waffe had neither the capability nor the intention of delivering. Understanding the air force that Hitler and Goering created has been a continuing pr
