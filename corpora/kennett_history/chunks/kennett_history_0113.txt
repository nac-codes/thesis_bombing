for a massive aerial knockout blow that the Luft- waffe had neither the capability nor the intention of delivering. Understanding the air force that Hitler and Goering created has been a continuing problem. British and American writers tend to draw the Luftwaffe larger than life, while German chroniclers are often severe in their judgments. The historian Karl-Heinz VÃ¶lker once wrote a whole chapter on the Schein und Sein ("appearance and real ity") of the Luftwaffe, in which he tried to dispel a number of persis- tent myths. One of the most enduring of these is that almost overnight the Nazis created an air force from nothing. Germany's masters inherited a fund of technical data and projections from the Technical Office of the Reichswehr, which had had for years a discreet but per- sistent interest in military aviation. The secret testing facilities that the Soviets provided at Lipetsk permitted experimentation with dive bombing years before Ernst Udet returned from the United States with his Curtiss Hawk dive-bomber. During the late twenties the Germans carefully followed develop- ments in neighboring countries and made plans for a future air force of their own. Initially, their interest was drawn to the multipurpose aircraft, but as early as 1927, they explored the possibilities of the long-range, four-engined bomber, a project concealed under the cover name Gronabo. An aerial rearmament scheme of 1932 called for building a 960-plane force by 1938, half of that force to consist of bombers. At first, the bombing plane fitted into the basically defensive strategy that was upheld for a considerable time after the Nazi tak- over. In 1935, for example, the Wehrmacht maneuvers had as their "problem" a combined invasion by France and Czechoslovakia. The bomber was to assist the defending ground forces both directly and indirectly with missions in the tactical and "operational" zones. Hitler and Goering did give considerable impetus to the develop- ment of bombers; they p
