the defending ground forces both directly and indirectly with missions in the tactical and "operational" zones. Hitler and Goering did give considerable impetus to the develop- ment of bombers; they pressed the Junkers 52 transport into service as a Behelfsbomber (auxiliary bomber), but by 1936 they were able to introduce into the bombing squadrons the modern and efficient Heinkel 111. Hitler's purpose in so doing was as much political as military, and he may well have been inspired by a memorandum of 1933 on the Risiko-Luftflotte, prepared by Dr. Robert Knauss, a vet- eran of the air battles of 1918 who had become a Lufthansa official. Knauss argued that an air force with significant offensive power would give pause to any of German's neighbors (France especially) who might be tempted to intervene and block the continued rearmament of the Reich. For Hitler, as for his predecessors, the greatest air threat came from the French heavy bomber force. The French bombers, especially the Amiot 143, were heavily armed and more difficult to contend with than the German fighter force had anticipated. In 1932, German planners proposed a mass bombing attack at the outbreak of war to surprise and destroy the Amiots on the ground. The Wehr- macht would subsequently incorporate this surprise air strike into a number of its campaign plans. After 1936, Hitler held enough cards to think in offensive terms, but none of the moves he contemplated seemed likely to produce a major conflagration. The Feindbild ("projected enemy") was France and its eastern alliance partners, notably Czechoslovakia. Until 1938 war with either Great Britain or the Soviet Union was not a major feature in German military planning. If war came, it would not be fought over a great distance, and if blitzkrieg tactics were successful, the campaign would not bog down into positional warfare but move to an early conclusion. For such conflicts a sizable force of medium bombers that could take a ton of bombs 300 miles
