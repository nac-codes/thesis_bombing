were successful, the campaign would not bog down into positional warfare but move to an early conclusion. For such conflicts a sizable force of medium bombers that could take a ton of bombs 300 miles beyond the frontiers of the Reich would be eminently satisfactory. The Luftwaffe had its believers in the large strategic bomber, and they kept the idea alive through the thirties. The Luftwaffe also had under sporadic development the Fernbomber ("long-range bomber"), a four-engined plane with strategic capabilities. The Fernbomber never came to much-but not because of the death of its partisan, General Walther Wever, as is often said. Strategic bombing appeared as one of the Luftwaffe's missions in the Luftkriegführung ("opera-  80 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE RISE OF THE AIR FLEETS 81 tions manual"): "An attack on the enemy's sources of strength can influence the course of the war decisively .. . . But often it is only grad- ual in its effect and it carries with it the danger of exerting influence on the land and sea contests too late."8 Creating a sizable force of strategic bombers might well have overtaxed Germany's productive capacity, as Völker points out; but perhaps more important, such a force had no place in the sort of war Germany planned to fight. By 1942, when the era of blitzkrieg was over, it was too late for Germany to restructure its air power. The progress of German rearmament was followed nowhere as closely as in Paris. The French probably understood the threat from the air more clearly than the British, and certainly they reacted to it more quickly. In April 1933, little over two months after Hitler came to power, a report from the Direction Générale de la Guerre raised the alarming possibility of a massive preemptive air strike by an Italo- German air fleet. If the Nazis converted transport planes to bombers they and the Italians would have the capacity to bring 540 tons of bombs 120 miles into France. The Armée de l'Air could retaliate with
