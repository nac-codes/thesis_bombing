n air fleet. If the Nazis converted transport planes to bombers they and the Italians would have the capacity to bring 540 tons of bombs 120 miles into France. The Armée de l'Air could retaliate with only 235 tons. So perilous did this imbalance seem that the report urged all French aircraft to be armed with bombs, whatever their orig- inal function. That same year, the French government began to rearm its air force according to Plan I, designed to add a thousand planes to the air fleet. This was followed by Plan II the next year and by a five-year plan in 1936; to these projects the government then added Plan III for air defense and Plan IV for increasing the fighter force. Despite all these efforts, by 1936 the Luftwaffe had probably grown stronger than the Armée de l'Air. Initially, the French relied heavily on their pre- ponderance of bombers, which were a clear threat to Germany's cities if that power moved against any of France's allies in eastern Europe. A strengthening of the bomber force was thus the first stage in rear- mament. There were two possibilities: either to develop new aircraft. ensuring a modern bomber force but with possibly costly delays, or to order models already tried and proven. In their haste, the French chose the latter course, and it proved disastrous. The Amiot 143s and Bloch 200s ordered in large number were designs dating from the late twenties-great angular machines with fixed undercarriages and unimpressive performance. (For example, the Bloch 200, the "Flying Flatiron," could not stay aloft if one of its two engines quit.) These orders were entrusted to an aircraft industry which had so atrophied between the wars that it could not complete delivery in four years. In the meantime, the Air Ministry launched an effort to modernize its fighter force and produce a second generation of bombers. When France declared war on September 3, 1939, its fighter squadrons had modern matériel and would receive even better aircraft in the near futu
