ghter force and produce a second generation of bombers. When France declared war on September 3, 1939, its fighter squadrons had modern matériel and would receive even better aircraft in the near future. A new bomber was also on the way-the LéO 45, comparable in performance to the German medium bombers-but there were only five LéO's operational at the beginning of the war and fewer than a hundred in service when the storm broke in May 1940. The bulk of the French bomber force was still so outmoded that it was under orders to fly no war missions in the daylight. The tactical manual for the French bomber force stipulated that it might operate in cooperation with the army or independently, as befit- ted its status as an independent service on equal footing with the army and navy. In point of fact, it was far from enjoying equal status (it calculated its share of the defense budget of 1935 as 12 percent) and had great difficulty asserting its independence from the army. In war- time the mobilization scheme placed the head of the Armée de l'Air under the generalissimo or supreme commander, who in the late thir- ties was Gen. Maurice Gamelin. Gen. Joseph Vuillemin, air force chief in that period, had to fight to retain even this arrangement. A plan put forward by the army in 1938 would have passed command of the Armée de l'Air to the generalissimo upon mobilization, with Vuillemin reduced to the role of adviser. France too had its Douhetists, although surprisingly many of them were not in the Armée de l'Air; Paul Vauthier, Douhet's most outspo- ken disciple, was an artillery officer in the entourage of Marshal Henri Pétain, while his most incisive critic was the marine engineer Camille Rougeron. They and others carried on a lively debate about air power all through the thirties. But their theories had little application for the Armée de l'Air. When the French bomber force made its brief and tragic appearances in the whirlwind campaign of 1940, it was usually in sacrifice
