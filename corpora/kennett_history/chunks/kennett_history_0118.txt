es. But their theories had little application for the Armée de l'Air. When the French bomber force made its brief and tragic appearances in the whirlwind campaign of 1940, it was usually in sacrifice missions to save the deteriorating situation on the ground. On May 14, 1940, the critical day on which the German Army gained a toehold across the Meuse at Sedan, the lumbering Amiots joined the RAF's equally antiquated Fairey Battles in a futile attempt to bomb the German positions. German flak and fighters accounted for thirty- two of the sixty-seven Battles. Of the thirteen Amiots, five went down  82 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE RISE OF THE AIR FLEETS 83 over Sedan and two crashed in French lines. The Germans held onto their pocket, as General Gamelin called it. Within a month, all of France fell into that pocket. The month of June 1940, which brought defeat to the Armée de l'Air, saw Italy enter World War II. Next to the RAF, the Regia Aeronautica was the oldest independent air force in Europe, having been established in 1923, five years before the Armée de l'Air. After its creation the service became the showpiece of the Fascist regime Italian planes and pilots garnered an impressive number of trophies and awards. In 1939 they held thirty-three of the eighty-four records in the categories fixed by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. And by 1939 no one could seriously debate air power without citing the works of the strategists Douhet and Mecozzi. The validity of Dou- het's doctrines and the power of the Regia Aeronautica both found confirmation in the air maneuvers of August and September 1931. probably the most grandiose display of air power between the wars. For over a week, nearly a thousand planes fought mock battles. For an entire day, waves of planes delivered attacks against Milan. At the end of the day, the umpires ruled the city destroyed by high explosives. its population decimated by poison gas, and its government compelled to sue for peace
