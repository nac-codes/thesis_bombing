s delivered attacks against Milan. At the end of the day, the umpires ruled the city destroyed by high explosives. its population decimated by poison gas, and its government compelled to sue for peace. The Regia Aeronautica did not formally adopt Douhet's ideas nor did it formally repudiate them. (The lessons learned in the 1931 maneuvers were never made public and the maneuvers were not repeated.) Beginning with the publication of a second edition of Dou- het's Command of the Air in 1927, a raging doctrinal quarrel erupted in the pages of the Rivista Aeronautica and other journals. Along with matters of air strategy, personalities became involved, and ultimately so did the vital interests of highly placed military and political figures. Although Douhet died in 1930 the dispute was kept alive. (Colonel Mecozzi, who was perhaps Douhet's most persistent opponent, pub- lished a final blast against Douhetism in 1965.) The unfortunate result of this quarrel was that it prevented the Italian Air Force from arriv- ing at "a basic air doctrine acceptable to all or even to a majority."9 For lack of any better foundation, the leaders of the Regia Aero- nautica designed it on the assumption that it would be used in a lim- ited war against an enemy with whom Italy shared a frontier, most likely France or Yugoslavia. This was probably a sound enough assumption in the 1920s, but not after Mussolini took Italy into the German orbit. Nevertheless, Italian aircraft continued to be designed on this premise. Bombers of limited range and carrying capacity could raid across the frontier without escort; fighters with even more limited range would defend Italy's airspace. Then, in 1940, the war spread across the Mediterranean, and Italy did not have the air strength to hit many vital targets. Raids on the Suez Canal were ineffectual, and those directed at the British petroleum facilities at Haifa were scarcely more successful. The Achilles heel of this air force was its mat√©riel. In Novem
