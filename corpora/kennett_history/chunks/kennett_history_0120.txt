Raids on the Suez Canal were ineffectual, and those directed at the British petroleum facilities at Haifa were scarcely more successful. The Achilles heel of this air force was its mat√©riel. In November 1939 the Regia Aeronautica had only 450 combat-ready "modern" bombers and 129 first-class fighters. There would have been more planes available had Mussolini not sent some seven hundred to the Falangists in Spain. Moreover, Italy was selling warplanes in order to obtain badly needed foreign exchange. From 1937 to 1943, it shipped 1,554 aircraft to thirty-nine countries. Italian aircraft, and especially Italian bombers, were all too often defective in design and mediocre in performance. Italian engineers could build superb racing engines of 2,500 horsepower, but they could not come up with a 1,000-horsepower in-line power plant suitable for mass production. Despite the lavishly equipped Guidonia Experimen- tal Center and some brilliantly conceived designs, Italian bombers were generally adaptations-and not wholly successful ones-of com- mercial models. The Savoia-Marchetti SM 79, which made up three- fourths of the bombing force early in the war, was a typical case, "inferior in speed, range, armament and equipment to foreign bomb- ers."10 Like most Italian bombers, the SM 79 was a trimotor craft. This design made it difficult to protect the airplane from frontal attacks and deprived the bombardier of his position in the nose of the craft and of ready communication with the pilot. To add to this, Ital- ian airmen went to war with a cumbersome and outmoded bombsight and had no bombs larger than 1,100 pounds. It is clear that one reason for this state of affairs was the preoccu- pation with highly specialized competition craft that could break rec- ords and generate headlines. The same impulse led the regime to invest heavily in noisy displays. Air Marshal Italo Balbo, who was air minister from 1929 to 1933, was a master showman. He led an armada of sixty-one flying bo
