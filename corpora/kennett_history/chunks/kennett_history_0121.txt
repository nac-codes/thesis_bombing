nes. The same impulse led the regime to invest heavily in noisy displays. Air Marshal Italo Balbo, who was air minister from 1929 to 1933, was a master showman. He led an armada of sixty-one flying boats on a seventeen-hundred-mile circuit of the western Mediterranean in 1928 and took a smaller fleet of twenty-four to the Chicago World's Fair in 1933. Mussolini also flew, always to the accompaniment of press releases. Both men helped give the Regia Aeronautica the appearance of a kind of sportsmen's club,  84 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE RISE OF THE AIR FLEETS and both used it as a public relations medium. In the process, they neglected it as an instrument of war. If Italy's air force was the most publicized in Europe, the Soviet Union's was probably the least well known. The country that had pro- duced the first multiengined bomber did not abandon the idea of long- range bombing after 1918, perhaps in part because the new regime inherited a number of IM's and found them extremely useful in the period of the civil war. When the Soviet air force reequipped itself in the late 1920s, one of its most important units was the Heavy Bombing Brigade with trimotor aircraft whose appearance betrayed their Ger- man inspiration. In 1929 the Soviets brought out a twin-engined bomber of native inspiration, the TB-1, and one year later they suc- cessfully flew their four-engined ANT-6, or TB-3. It was "unveiled" two years later when nine of the giant planes participated in the 1932 May Day flyby. Thereafter, massed formations of the TB-3s figured prominently in parades and displays. By the time production stopped in 1937, about eight hundred of the giant planes were in existence. They were formed into brigades of fifty-odd machines, and in 1936 they formed a special heavy-bomber corps known as the Special Pur- pose Air Arm, or AON. Although the Soviet Union probably possessed the most potent strategic bombing force in the world in the mid-1930s, its leaders showed little int
