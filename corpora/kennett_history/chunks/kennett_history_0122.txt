corps known as the Special Pur- pose Air Arm, or AON. Although the Soviet Union probably possessed the most potent strategic bombing force in the world in the mid-1930s, its leaders showed little interest in strategic warfare as Trenchard and Douhet understood the term. Soviet air strategists certainly were not ignorant of what was happening in the West. They wrote knowledgeably about the Briey air blockade and the lessons to be learned from it. In 1935. Douhet's Command of the Air appeared in Russian with an introduc- tion by V. V. Khripin, a leading air strategist soon afterward appointed to command the AON. Khripin was particularly interested in heavy bombers, as was A. N. Lapchinskii, professor of air tactics at Frunze Military Academy. They were the most prominent figures in a wide-ranging discussion of heavy-bomber strategy carried on in the military press of the late twenties and thirties. Western observers reported that it was more an exposition of views than a true debate. It seems to have been understood that the Soviet air force would remain organically a part of the Red Army. There were no clarion calls for "independence" such as Billy Mitchell was making in the United States. In the Soviet Union, as in Nazi Germany, no strong contrast was made between a "static" war on the ground and a "dynamic" air war. 85 The blitzkrieg had its Russian parallel in Marshal Tukhashevskii's concept of "deep battle," which seemed to offer to the air arm oppor- tunities unknown in positional warfare. Khripin and Lapchinskii both distinguished three different spheres of action for offensive aviation. The first was essentially tactical, involving participation and support in the land battle. The second was "operational," offering an indirect role in battle by striking behind the enemy front. The third, which Khripin called "strategic" and Lapchinskii "independent," were oper- ations such as the German bombing of London and the French air blockade of Briey. Direct participat
