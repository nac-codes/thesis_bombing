e enemy front. The third, which Khripin called "strategic" and Lapchinskii "independent," were oper- ations such as the German bombing of London and the French air blockade of Briey. Direct participation in the land battle very much interested Soviet strategists. They were familiar with the work of Mecozzi and Roug- eron, and in the thirties their practical and theoretical work in the field put them ahead of everyone except the Luftwaffe. "Operational" bombing was at least equally attractive, for it was in this type of oper- ation that the IM's had proved their value in the Great War: "War- time practice showed that bombing attacks on objectives in the oper- ational rear constituted the main mission of heavy aviation."11 Both Khripin and Lapchinskii cite as prime targets the depots, reserves, and transport facilities in the "deep rear." According to Lapchinskii, there was no limit in depth to operations of this sort, and no matter how far removed they were from the ground action, they were still made in relation to that action. The third type of offensive operations, in which the air arm essentially fights its own war, held no charms for Soviet theorists, who emphatically rejected the Douhetist notion that the bomber alone would win the war. Some said the theory might work against primitive peoples easily terrorized-no doubt a reference to the "air control" practices of the Western colonial powers-but Lap- chinskii put the Soviet point of view unequivocally: "We do not see how in reality this point of view could be carried out anywhere."12 The fortunes of Soviet "heavy aviation" declined in the late thirties. In part, this was because the TB-3s with their top speed of less than 200 miles an hour had grown obsolete and a satisfactory replacement was slow to appear. But, more than anything else, the heavy bombers suffered from the loss of their partisans and their chiefs. The Great Purge swept away Khripin and Lapchinskii, for reasons which remain obscure.
