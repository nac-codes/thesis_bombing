Both men had formerly been in the Czarist air service and maintained intellectual contacts with Western strategists or at least with their works-and in the atmosphere of the purge era, either transgression could lead a man to Lubianka prison and the firing  86 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE RISE OF THE AIR FLEETS 87 squad. There is also a theory that both men incurred Stalin's anger because of the poor performance of the Soviet bombers sent to the Spanish Loyalists. None of the theories has been satisfactorily proved. The heavy-bomber force survived, although it underwent another organizational change in 1940, becoming the DBA-GK, or Long- Range Bomber Arm of the Supreme Command. In June 1941 it con- sisted of eight hundred bombers, only a small proportion of the seven thousand or more aircraft available for operations against Germany Deployed well to the rear, the heavy-bomber units were largely spared in the devastating attacks that the Luftwaffe delivered against air installations at the beginning of Operation Barbarossa (some esti- mates put the Soviet losses at over fifteen hundred planes for the single day of June 22). With much of Soviet tactical aviation capability destroyed, the bombers of the DBA-GK took up the tactical role. striking at river crossings, rail junctions, and advancing panzer col umns. In that catastrophic summer, Stalin ordered the bombing of Berlin "at all costs." The hastily formed Special-Purpose Heavy- Bomber Regiment struck Berlin twice with a handful of planes, suf- fering heavy losses each time.13 Having permitted himself this gesture. the Soviet leader directed his bombers back to targets closer at hand. On those targets they would expend most of their energies for the rest of the war. There was a clearly observable basic continuity in Soviet
