eader directed his bombers back to targets closer at hand. On those targets they would expend most of their energies for the rest of the war. There was a clearly observable basic continuity in Soviet bomber doctrine from the First World War to the Second; and there is a sim- ilar thread of consistency running through American strategic thought, traceable all the way back to 1917 when Gen. H. H. ("Hap") Arnold recalled that "despite Billy Mitchell's eagerness to blow up Germany, we hadn't a single bomber."14 The bombing squadrons of the American air service made only the most modest contribution to victory, at least in statistical terms. They dropped a total of 138 tons of bombs, a figure so unimpressive that in the records it was converted to 275,000 pounds. The experience of the Great War was nonetheless valuable for the development of American military aviation; it provided the point of departure for air strategists and particularly for the men who formu- lated bomber doctrine between the wars. American exposure to the principle of strategic bombardment occurred in 1917 and 1918 and it "took." Actually, the exposure was a multiple one, so that it is impos- sible to tell which of the contacts might have been the crucial one. Billy Mitchell was a frequent visitor to the headquarters of Sir Hugh Trenchard, and he became a frank admirer both of the man and of his notions of aerial warfare. At the same time, other American air officers worked with the RNAS and so became familiar with the ideas of Viscount Tiverton and Spencer Grey on the value of precise strikes ~ on critical industrial objectives. In addition, in 1917, an American mil- itary delegation known as the Bolling mission visited Italy, where it heard Gianni Caproni describe the views on strategic bombing that he shared with his good friend Giulio Douhet. The American officers who brought these ideas back with them had to nurture them in a decidedly hostile climate. The U.S. Army Air Service (Air Corps after
