shared with his good friend Giulio Douhet. The American officers who brought these ideas back with them had to nurture them in a decidedly hostile climate. The U.S. Army Air Service (Air Corps after 1926) was an organic part of the army, which considered its role exclusively one of assistance to the land forces and had no intentions of allowing it to embark on campaigns of its own. - Beyond this, such a supremely offensive weapon as the strategic bomber had no attraction for a generation of Americans who hoped to stay out of foreign wars and would defend themselves only if directly attacked. Even so, the believers in air power, led by Billy Mitchell, waged a long and often noisy campaign for an independent air force with strategic capabilities. The struggle cost Mitchell his career and it did not produce independence for the air arm; still, by the early thirties it provided the fragile basis for a strategic air poten- tial. First of all, the army agreed to the creation of a "headquarters air force," a concentration of offensive elements into a compact mass for possible strategic development. Then, the Air Corps found an acceptable "defensive" role for the strategic bomber it sought. In 1931 an agreement between American military and naval high commands assigned to the army all land-based weapons for coastal defense. If the weapons had sufficient range, land-based aircraft could detect hostile warships long before they came in sight of the coasts, and what is more, they could sink them. Mitchell had proved this in his own spec- tacular way. Long-range bombers could be rapidly deployed on either coast and could rush their support to any threatened positions in the Pacific or the Caribbean. And finally, in 1935, the Air Corps found the bomber it had been looking for. In 1933 it had sought heavy-bomber designs from Amer- ican builders. They responded with a monster, the slow and ponderous XB15, but also with several other designs, including the XB17, which first took t
