933 it had sought heavy-bomber designs from Amer- ican builders. They responded with a monster, the slow and ponderous XB15, but also with several other designs, including the XB17, which first took the air in July 1935; within six months the Air Corps decided  CHAPTER 6 88 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING to place orders for sixty-five of the new aircraft, which it described as "the best bombardment aircraft in existence" prudently adding "par- ticularly for coastal defense."15 When war broke out in Europe in 1939 the GHQ Air Force had only thirteen B-17s, but a second bomber the B-24, was off the drawing board and in the air. At the time of Pearl Harbor, design work had been completed for the B-29, third and last of the "heavies" which would see the U.S. Army Air Forces through World War II. While the American strategic-bombing force was passing through its gestation period, strategists were refining the doctrine that would govern its use. Understandably, they carried on their discussions well out of earshot of the army general staff. Much of the theoretical work seems to have been done in the Air Corps Tactical School, which moved to Maxwell Field in 1931. In the preceding decade, the man- uals prepared by the school espoused area bombing of the enemy's interior by night and put considerable stress on the morale or "terror- izing" effect of such raids. But, in the thirties, the emphasis changed This may be in part because of studies made by Donald Wilson and other instructors at the school, which showed how the economic life of sections of the United States could be disrupted by the destruction of certain key facilities; this led Wilson to decide that "the real target is industry itself, not national morale."16 The evolution of the doctrine of precision bombing may owe some- thing to the dislike of the imprecise or indiscriminate bombing voiced at various times by American leaders and the American public. It has even been argued-and not altogether implausibly-that
