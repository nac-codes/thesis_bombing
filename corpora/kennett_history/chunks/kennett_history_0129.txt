e about the shortcomings of their air service as if it were alone in its lack of preparation. In fact, the phe- nomenon was a general one, and its basic causes were common to all the major belligerents. Many of these causes are already familiar and apply to the land and sea services as well: years of complacent thinking and austerity budgets, followed by a mood of crisis and a deluge of money pumped into hastily devised rearmament programs that would nevertheless "peak" after 1939. But the air arm had a particularly hard time of it for an additional reason. To a greater degree than the other services, it had been mobilized for a struggle that the great powers waged all through the thirties to influence, to deter, and to intimidate their 89  90 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING neighbors by presenting an enhanced image of their military strength. No weapon lent itself to this sort of campaign more readily than the airplane. As an arm in rapid evolution with a potential not yet fixed. it offered an ideal means to impress a probable enemy. As J. M Spaight observed, the warplane's mystery was half its power. The most extravagant claims might be made for it, and no one could really deny them. Here was a weapon to conjure with, and no one understood this better than Adolf Hitler. His first bombing force, his Risiko- Luftflotte, was little more than an imposing façade; the Junkers 52s that figured on its registers remained for the most part in the everyday transport service of Lufthansa, which made them available as auxil iary bombers. Later, when Hitler was extorting concessions from Pres- ident Emil Hacha of Czechoslovakia, he told him-among other things-that unless Germany got its way, the Luftwaffe would wipe Prague from the face of the earth.

In 1938 he and Goering were anxious to learn
