Luftwaffe could actually do this, but then he was only interested in making Hacha believe it. But the Führer too was susceptible to this sort of pressure. In 1938 he and Goering were anxious to learn more about the range of British bombers and what sort of danger they might pose to the towns of western Germany. And the British, of course, were doing what they could to make their squadrons of Blen- heims and Battles appear more formidable than they really were. Not surprisingly, each power tried to display its air weapons to best advantage. Every competition, every air show became a vehicle for propaganda. The Luftwaffe demonstrated aircraft that were delicate and specially engineered thoroughbreds capable of extraordinary per- formance and then announced that they were production-line war- planes. The British seriously considered going after speed records with a racing version of their Spitfire. The French showed up at an inter- national meet in 1939 with several samples of a new twin-engined bomber. The planes had had their serial numbers altered to give the impression there were several hundred in existence rather than the dozen the Armée de l'Air actually possessed. Unsubtle as their ploy was, the French were following what seemed a sensible rule: If an offensive weapon like the bomber is to serve as deterrent or instrument of intimidation, then it must be demonstrated to exist, and in impressive numbers. If necessary its ability to "reach" a potential enemy could be advertised with a carefully prepared long- distance flight-or "raid" as it was called in French-with appropri- ON THE EVE 91 ate press coverage. But numbers were essential. A force of six hundred twin-engined bombers weighed more heavily in the balance than half that number of four-engined craft. (Goering once told Field Marshal Albert Kesselring that he was building twin-engined bombers rather than four-engine ones because Hitler would ask him how many bomb- ers he had, not how many engines they ca
