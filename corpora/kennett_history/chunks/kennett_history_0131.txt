ng once told Field Marshal Albert Kesselring that he was building twin-engined bombers rather than four-engine ones because Hitler would ask him how many bomb- ers he had, not how many engines they carried.) This consideration, nonsensical as it may seem from the purely military perspective, nevertheless figured prominently in the creation of the air fleets of the thirties. Not only did the air force need to look redoubtable to a prospective foe, but it also had to project a reassuring image to the public, partic- ularly in the late thirties, when apocalyptic visions of the coming air war were common. The thousands who watched the carefully staged aerial derring-do at the Hendon Air Show or at one of the Regia Aeronautica's "air days" came away suitably impressed; and the American public was similarly reassured when B-17s flew far out into the Atlantic and successfully "intercepted" an Italian liner seven hundred miles or so from North America. There was also an image to be maintained within the halls of gov- ernment if the air force were to hold its own with the older services. Here the best course was to stress the capabilities of air power and to say little about its limitations. When the British Air Staff began in the late thirties to look closely at what damage Bomber Command could do within Germany, its studies showed the possibilities to be very lim- ited. A historian who has recently studied the records concluded, "Much of this seems to have been kept from the politicians by a ser- vice anxious not to undercut its own role."1 But then it is just as likely that while Royal Navy leaders spoke confidently in council about their ability to handle the German submarine menace, in private they were scratching their heads. Each air service also tended to stress the destructive capacities of its probable foe; to do otherwise would be playing into the hands of the enemies of air power itself, prominent among them the leaders of the land and sea services.
