The British Air Staff grossly overestimated the casualties the Luftwaffe would be able to inflict on London, although that is not to say they did so intentionally. General Albert Denain, French air minister in the early thirties, painted for the French Senate a harrowing picture of what the air fleets of Italy and Germany might do in a combined attack. Plausible or not, this pros-  ON THE EVE 93 92 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING pect helped win appropriations for the Arm√©e de l'Air, for the answer to the air menace from abroad was a powerful air fleet of one's own. After the Regia Aeronautica concluded its 1931 maneuvers, it show- ered Italian towns with leaflets. The mock attacks on the towns could have been real ones, and the moral drawn was clear: "Let us not forget that the enemy air offensive will be paralyzed and defeated only if we are powerful in the air and if we have a strong national air force."2 An air force designed to dissuade or to intimidate performs that essential function simply by existing. Only if it fails in its function will it actually be used. And a "shop window" force-as someone once described the RAF of the thirties-will of necessity be much con- cerned with how it looks, sometimes to the detriment of how it per- forms. Many airmen of World War II looked back on their prewar flying experience as a sterile routine that did not prepare them ade- quately for combat. Navigation, to take a single example, was insuf- ficiently taught in most air forces, as though wars were expected to be fought over familiar terrain and on cloudless days only. Flying at night and in bad weather posed formidable challenges to most military pilots of 1939. RAF pilots did not as a general rule fly over water, and they could even be reprimanded for taking a short cut across an estuar
