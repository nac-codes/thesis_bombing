bad weather posed formidable challenges to most military pilots of 1939. RAF pilots did not as a general rule fly over water, and they could even be reprimanded for taking a short cut across an estuary. Luftwaffe pilots were also unaccustomed to navigation over bodies of water. When they began to cross the North Sea and probe the British coastline in 1938, they sometimes missed their intended landfall by fifty miles. Sometimes these errors led to embarrassment, as when a flight of Italian bombers sent to aid Spain's Gen. Francisco Franco ended up in French North Africa. The men who led the air forces of Europe could certainly have done more to prepare those forces for the demands of war; but, in fairness to them, it must be said that they could only go so far in anticipating what the next war would be like. By 1938 the lessons of the Great War were twenty years old and of doubtful validity in many cases. Would the rules of combat at twenty-five thousand feet be the same as they had been at ten thousand? What effect would the higher speed of aircraft have on air battles? The French decided that fighter engagements would become so complex that a squadron commander in a special "command" plane would have to supervise the battle from a distance, directing the movements of his fighters by radio. Bombing squadrons also were eager to know what air combat would be like. Would the bombers' all-metal construction make them less vulnerable to fighter attacks, or would the generation of new fight- ers carrying eight machine guns or 20mm cannon take heavy toll? Each bomber design of 1939 represented a series of compromises, of critical decisions by designers obliged to choose between conflicting theories. There were many schools of thought on what the bomber should be, none of them confirmed by the test of war. Some argued the advantages of the multipurpose aircraft. This idea was called odnotipnost by the Russians and Mehrzweckflugzeug by the Germans; the French made several at
