confirmed by the test of war. Some argued the advantages of the multipurpose aircraft. This idea was called odnotipnost by the Russians and Mehrzweckflugzeug by the Germans; the French made several attempts to build a bombardment-combat- reconnaissance (BCR) plane. Others felt the bomber should be a highly specialized aircraft, distinguished above all by its ability to carry heavy loads over long distances. This avenue of thinking often led to gigantism, as in the B-15 and the Italian Caproni 90 P.B. One school of thinkers, including Douhet, believed the bomber should rely for protection on heavy armament. French bombers of the thirties were built on this principle; they bristled with machine guns so placed that every angle of attack was covered. The other school, and the more popular one in the late thirties, favored the Schnellbomber, the supe- rior speed of which would see it to its target and back. Designers of fast bombers strove for aerodynamically clean forms, so they created internal bays for bomb storage, thus ending the easy convertibility of transport plane to bomber. By flying higher and faster, bombers only complicated their own job of hitting and destroying their objective: there needed to be advances in bombardment too. Bombs with greater destructiveness and better ballistic prospects would be forthcoming, as well as improved aiming devices. The tachometric bombsight was under development in the thirties, but in 1939, bombing accuracy left much to be desired. The 1938 edition of the French bombing manual advised the bombardier of a Bloch 200 that if he aimed at a rectangle 825 feet by 660 feet-a factory-sized target-from an altitude of 10,000 feet he could expect to score a hit with about one bomb out of nine. The Luftwaffe could do no better. Its best bombing crews, working in opti- mum weather conditions from a height of 13,200 feet could put about 2 percent of their bombs into a target roughly the size of a football field. These mediocre results in
