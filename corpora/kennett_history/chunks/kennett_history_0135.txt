mbing crews, working in opti- mum weather conditions from a height of 13,200 feet could put about 2 percent of their bombs into a target roughly the size of a football field. These mediocre results in horizontal bombing encouraged the Germans to explore the Schrägangriff, a bombing run incorporating a shallow dive at about thirty degrees. Accuracy picked up appreciably with this technique. The basic fact remains that while the British,  94 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING ON THE EVE 95 French, and German air forces went to war pledged to hit "military targets only," most of their bombs would fall on whoever or whatever had the misfortune to be in the vicinity of those targets. The most pressing problem in the late thirties was air defense. This was particularly true for the British and French governments. Faced with a powerful Luftwaffe and the fading deterrent effect of their aging bombers, they reordered their priorities to renovate fighter squadrons and bolster long-neglected antiaircraft defenses. In the short term, the problem was nightmarish. In September 1938, when the Sudeten crisis brought Europe to the very edge of the precipice. the Allies calculated that they would be assailed by a force of twelve hundred German bombers. Fighter Command then had ninety-three eight-gun fighters capable of catching them, while the Armée de l'Air had perhaps twenty of the modern cannon-equipped Morane-Saulnier 406s. The high speed of the Schnellbomber not only relegated a whole generation of fighter craft to the scrap heap but also overwhelmed the traditional warning systems. It took such systems from twenty to fifty minutes to effect fighter interception of an attacking force of bombers. In such a space of time, bombers moving at 3.6 miles a minute could cross the Rhine toward Paris (or come in from the Channel to Lon- don), strike their target, and be well on the way home. From 1935 on. the great powers were pushing research in a dozen different directions in their quest fo
