aris (or come in from the Channel to Lon- don), strike their target, and be well on the way home. From 1935 on. the great powers were pushing research in a dozen different directions in their quest for a better detection system. In laboratories all over Europe, scientists were experimenting with infrared rays, ultrasensi- tive acoustical devices, and the cathode tube-the last of which would lead them to radar. As a rule, antiaircraft weapons suffered from great neglect in the interwar period. A historian of ground defenses described their state in 1939 as one of "catastrophic backwardness."3 Antiaircraft batteries had not done a very effective job of protecting European cities in the Great War, and after it was over, the ground defense systems were entrusted to any service that would take them. If the army took on this obligation, it tended to give it low priority, insisting that the fighter planes of the air force were a better line of defense. If the air force inherited ground defense, it too tended to neglect it in favor of aircraft. In Italy the service was confided to a Blackshirt militia, while in Britain it passed to the territorial army. Although the Luftwaffe took over responsibility for ground defense against air attack, it showed little interest in defending German cities until it was too late. In keeping with the dictum that an air force was the best defense against an air force, Goering announced in 1935 that his air fleet would be strong enough "to repel attack at any time."4 Much of the antiaircraft material of 1939 dated from 1918. Trials in the thirties demonstrated that the vintage searchlights could not find high-flying aircraft, and target predictors were overwhelmed by the higher speeds. In some cases, neither guns nor lights could be tra- versed fast enough to keep up with the fast-moving bombers. A hasty renovation was under way but would come too late to help belligerents such as France or Poland. The heavy flak gun of 1939, which most cities
