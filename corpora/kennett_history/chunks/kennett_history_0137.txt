st enough to keep up with the fast-moving bombers. A hasty renovation was under way but would come too late to help belligerents such as France or Poland. The heavy flak gun of 1939, which most cities relied upon for their defense from bombers, ranged in bore size from 75mm to 94mm and was designed for use at maximum ranges of 23,000-26,000 feet; thus, most bombers of 1939 could fly above the flak barrage. The Germans had the best cannon initially in their 88mm, designed for air defenses in the mid-1930s and subsequently adapted to ground use as well. The Soviets introduced new models in 1930 and 1939, while the French embarked on a crash program to produce 90mm cannon of a model devised back in 1922 but never put into production by the army. With the slender resources at hand, most of the belligerents con- centrated their efforts on the protection of their largest cities. In 1938 the British government assigned 181 guns to the protection of London, slightly more than half of those they had available to defend the entire country. At the outbreak of the war, Paris was guarded by 90mm guns on loan from the French Navy, the only such guns available. At the beginning of hostilities, Moscow was protected by an air defense perimeter with a radius of some twelve miles. It contained six zones, each with twenty-five batteries. Germany seemed to have a broader protective system with its Luftverteidigungszone West, a flak belt that Goering created along the western frontier, with great fanfare, in 1938. But like the Siegfried Line of which it was the aerial counter- part, it was more imposing in press releases than in reality. The greatest danger to the cities would come at night, when the modest effectiveness of the antiaircraft gun would decline even fur- ther. The only other defense was the night fighter, a plane that appeared in the Great War. But this weapon too had evolved little in two decades. The basic techniques were still those devised in 1914- 18. Fighters could wo
