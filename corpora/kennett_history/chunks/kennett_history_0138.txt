fense was the night fighter, a plane that appeared in the Great War. But this weapon too had evolved little in two decades. The basic techniques were still those devised in 1914- 18. Fighters could work in conjunction with searchlights, trying to  96 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING ON THE EVE 97 attack every plane that the light fixed in their beams; or they could use what the French called chasse obscure, in which the fighter pilot tried to find and attack his quarry in the dark. The Luftwaffe began trials with night fighters in 1936, and at about the same time, the French intensified their own researches. The French Air Force had two specialized night-fighter units at the beginning of the war, but these had little success. If all these handicaps and shortcomings in air defense are combined and then compared with the capabilities of the Schnellbomber, it is easy to see how the British Air Staff could advise the government that a German air offensive against England might produce sixty thousand casualties in the first week and that little or nothing could be done to prevent this. The British government was particularly alarmed by the threat from the air, but no government could be indifferent to it. In each country, the authorities had to decide how much they could tell their populations and how they could prepare them for the dangers ahead. Ordinary citizens had certainly not been kept in ignorance of the bomber and what it could do. Prognostications of what the next war would be like could be found in literature of every kind and level, most of it saying that the coming conflict would be of unparalleled butchery and that the bomber would have a more than modest role in making it so devastating. Experts like Liddell Hart and J. F. C. Fuller pro- vided forecasts for the military reader, and H. G. Wells passed on his vision to the more literary set. Writers with less talent but no less imagination wrote about the coming Armageddon in popular maga- zines and Sunday sup
