haos, the disorganization, and the dumb shock might resemble the situation in Japan immediately fol- lowing the earthquake of 1923. The panic produced by Orson Welles's "War of the Worlds" broadcast in 1938 seemed to others an indication of the hysteria a sudden air attack would generate. Some theorized that the vibrations of the bombs would overtax the human nervous system, and others believed the most deadly effect would be produced by "silent" attacks in which the bombers glided over the city with their engines off. But, to many writers, the worst weapon was the one that had never been used on cities-gas. A fleet of bombers equipped with aerial spray apparatus similar to that used for insecticides might glide over a city in the dead of night, releasing a "dew of death." No new weapons of terror made their appearance in the conflicts that dominated the headlines of the late thirties, but those already known seemed somehow more menacing. The photograph of a Chinese baby crying amidst the debris of a bomb-shattered city is arresting even today, while the attack on the Spanish town of Guer- nica generated a seismic wave of horror. The air aspects of the Spanish Civil War come in for close scrutiny for the hints they provide about the effectiveness of bombing. John Langdon-Davies, who witnessed the attacks on Barcelona early in 1938, felt that the excitable nature and incorrigible curiosity of the Spaniards would be their undoing: "They would not take shelter. They preferred instead to blacken every balcony so as to get a good view of the bursting shrapnel."7 Another observer, this one a British expert on civil defense, confirmed this impression: "There has been no stampede in mass of the whole of a nerve-wracked population. No wild and unreasoned panic. No terrible and uncontrolled hysteria and certainly no thought of beseeching the  98 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING government to seek an immediate and unconditional peace."8 Camille Rougeron concluded from the episod
