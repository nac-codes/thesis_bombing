Prowling mobs tear to pieces anyone they find in the uniform of the Arm√©e de l'Air. Looting breaks out, and in the poorer districts, crowds begin to erect barricades at the urging of Communist agita- tors. A second bombing attack completes the work of the first. A red flag flies over Paris, where the insurgents follow orders radioed from Moscow. Caught between ruin and revolution, the French government sues for peace. It was partly to counteract the effect of such appalling visions as this that many governments launched programs aimed at educating the public-but also at preparing it for the realities of air warfare, which were grim enough. This work had already been started in most ON THE EVE 99 countries by organizations-usually private ones-founded soon after the war.

In 1928, Frenchmen concerned about chem- ical warfare founded the League Against Chemical Warfare and for the Protection of the Civilian Population. Many of these organizations combined an interest in civil defense with a desire to have chemical warfare banned by international agreement. The first government to concern itself directly with civil defense was the Soviet regime, which seems to have been preoccupied with the dangers of chemical warfare as early as 1920. In 1924 it sponsored the Society of Friends of Chemical Defense and the Chemical Indus- try, which grew and combined with other groups to form Osoaviakhim (an acronym for Society for the Promotion of Aviation and Chemical Defense), whose province included both aviation and air defense.
