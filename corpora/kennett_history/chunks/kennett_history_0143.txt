ncluded both aviation and air defense. In the thirties, Osoaviakhim trained some 28 million Russians in civil defense. The British government created the Air Raids Precaution (ARP) Committee in 1924, but its approach was totally different. For ten years the committee led a sort of shadow existence, for fear its work might alarm the public. Not until 1934 did it begin to publish civil-defense materials. The thirties saw a considerable expansion of governmental activity in "passive defense," as it was called in many countries. At the same time, there appeared a new generation of air-defense organizations, such as the Union Nationale pour la Défense Aérienne in France and the Reichsluftschutzbund in Germany. These usually had official endorsement and quite often an air force general as president; not sur- prisingly, they preached both air defense and air power. A major development was the enactment of civil-defense legislation, such as the German law of June 26, 1935, and the British statute of 1937. Finally, civil-defense exercises became a feature of urban life. As early as 1935, air-raid drills took place in London, Vienna, Leningrad, Zurich, Berlin, Naples, Prague, and Tokyo. These efforts were not always well received. When the French authorities ordered trial blackouts in certain towns, antiwar protesters built bonfires in the streets. The British ARP Committee engaged in a running feud with a body calling itself the Cambridge Scientists' Anti-War Group. The scientists felt that many of the committee's rec- ommendations were unsound, so they published their own manual in 1937. They even detected a sinister purpose behind the official cam-  100 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING ON THE EVE 101 paign: "It is reasonable to conclude ... that the government under cover of protecting the public is planning a large-scale regimentation of the population and the sweeping away of civil liberty, protected as it is by law, as a preparatory step towards government by autocratic p
