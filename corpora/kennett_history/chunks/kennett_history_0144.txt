tecting the public is planning a large-scale regimentation of the population and the sweeping away of civil liberty, protected as it is by law, as a preparatory step towards government by autocratic power which they foresee some future eventuality may compel."10 In most cases, the government tried to combat the more apocalyptic and irresponsible stories. Poison gas probably caused the greatest fear. perhaps because it had already been used on the battlefields of the Great War. (Biological or germ warfare was a threat that did not have the same immediacy.) In their publications both British and French governments assured their populations that despite rumors to the con- trary, chemists had discovered no new and superdeadly gases since the armistice. (Neither government knew of the Tabun and Sarin nerve gases discovered in Germany in the mid-1930s.) Although they did not say so publicly, both governments knew from experiments that substances like mustard gas sprayed from aircraft did not present much of a danger to urban populations. Many civil-defense publications of the thirties dwelt at length on a disaster that occurred in Hamburg in 1928, because it in some ways mimicked the effect of a poison gas attack on a large city and at the same time showed those effects to be surprisingly limited. The acci dent was a explosion in a chemical works that released into the indus- trial quarter of Hamburg eleven tons of phosgene, the most deadly gas employed in World War I. The phosgene cloud passed through part of the town and into the countryside, where it dissipated. The casu- alties were eleven dead and two hundred hospitalized. The effect of high-explosive bombs on cities was to some degree already known, thanks to calculations made after the bombardments of 1914-18 and confirmed by the fragmentary evidence compiled dur- ing the Spanish Civil War. Casualties ran about fifty per ton of explo- sives, one-third of these being fatalities. And there was some evidence that the
