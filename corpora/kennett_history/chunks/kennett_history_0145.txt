rmed by the fragmentary evidence compiled dur- ing the Spanish Civil War. Casualties ran about fifty per ton of explo- sives, one-third of these being fatalities. And there was some evidence that the extrapolations often made from these figures were unjustified. That is to say, if a single one-ton bomb killed or wounded fifty Lon- doners, then a thousand such bombs would not necessarily kill or wound fifty thousand. Here again an industrial accident in Germany was instructive, and it seemed to point to a principle of diminishing returns as the tonnage increased. On September 21, 1921, at an Oppau chemical works, 4,500 tons of ammonium sulfonitrate exploded. The mammoth blast created a crater 250 feet in diameter and about fifty feet deep. The sound was heard nearly two hundred miles away, and property damage was massive in the town of Oppau, which bordered the plant; scarcely a window pane survived in the whole area. Yet, the majority of the 2,000 workers in the plant escaped serious injury. In Oppau proper, only fifty inhabitants lost their lives. Other than high explosives and gas, the great danger was fire. Here the experience of World War I was only of limited validity. In general, the incendiary bombs had been failures when used against the cities, but the early incendiaries were inefficient and were not used inten- sively. Sensationalist writers exploited this issue too. They described fires so intense that girders melted in buildings and the streets ran with rivers of molten steel. Once again the authorities were reassuring, but in the late thirties the danger of firebombing was the subject of some serious study. A British scientist with the National Physical Labora- tory at Teddington called the fire risk "practically an unknown fac- tor."11 Branddirektor Hans Rumpf was a German specialist who stud- ied the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, the Hamburg fire of 1846, and other urban conflagrations. He concluded that great fires were possible in big cities wit
