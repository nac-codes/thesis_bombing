umpf was a German specialist who stud- ied the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, the Hamburg fire of 1846, and other urban conflagrations. He concluded that great fires were possible in big cities with modern architecture if they were subjected to intensive attack. Rumpf would see in his own country a terrible confirmation of his conclusion. The "passive defense" publications of the thirties are an exotic sub- literature that a social historian should someday explore. The "what to do" air-raid manuals are a good example: a jolly, reassuring British writer declared that the only time a Londoner need fear a gas attack was after a heavy meal. A French manual given to soldiers being sep- arated from the service told them, "One morning thousands of air- planes will appear over Paris, over Lille, Lyons or Marseilles, and in twenty-four hours all their inhabitants may be asphyxiated and most of the houses in flames."12 An Italian manual of 1939 dwelt at length on methods of combating germ warfare and passed on the reassuring information that Italy was building bombing planes so rapid that no fighter plane could ever catch them.

An Italian firm supplied gas masks for dogs, while a Czech concern offered a gasproof perambulator with its own air pump. There was fireproof clothing and even ARP underwear. Wartime apparel for women
