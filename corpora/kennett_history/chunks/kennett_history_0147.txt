n Italian firm supplied gas masks for dogs, while a Czech concern offered a gasproof perambulator with its own air pump. There was fireproof clothing and even ARP underwear. Wartime apparel for women would include gas masks; protective boots, gloves, and goggles: and steel helmets. These items were recommended by a German civil- defense authority who also called for dresses cut like uniforms that would offer "mechanical protection for the breast and climatic protec- tion for the abdomen." He argued that such clothing "is not only becoming but also includes the advantage of giving some psychological support to the person who wears it."14 Other specialists designed bombproof and gasproof structures. There was the Consul individual shelter "for your key personnel," and Col. Alessandro Romani's cone- like structure that contained some 160 cubic yards of reinforced con- crete and could protect sixteen people. In Germany the Winkel Tower. in four sizes, was advertised, while a Swiss inventor introduced the Schindler stronghold. Russian engineers drew plans for whole cities redesigned to resist air attacks. Colonel Paul Vauthier proposed rehousing the population in "tower cities" along the lines of Le Cor- busier's designs. In wartime, the first five floors of the towers would be cleared in case of contamination by gas, while the top three floors. also evacuated, would absorb bomb hits. A pair of Paris architects put forward the most fantastic scheme of all: a tower almost seven thou- sand feet high equipped with three hundred guns. For all these lifesaving devices and schemes, the nations of Europe went to war in 1939 with scant protection for their great cities. The British government, always the most sensitive to air attack, was gravely concerned about the fate of its city dwellers; though the Soviet government had championed civil defense for two decades, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov pronounced it unsatisfactory. In most other coun- tries preparations were even less adva
