dwellers; though the Soviet government had championed civil defense for two decades, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov pronounced it unsatisfactory. In most other coun- tries preparations were even less advanced. For one thing, the practical problems of protecting large urban populations-as people understood those problems in 1939-seemed so immense as to defy solution. An international commission of experts that met in Rome in 1939 under 103 Red Cross auspices succeeded only in underscoring the difficulties. A German expert at the conference estimated that it would cost over 800 million gold francs to provide shelters for the population of a large city-a cost so staggering as to be prohibitive. Even the hermetically sealed ambulances that the Red Cross recommended for gas warfare were an added burden to a heavily encumbered defense budget. It was difficult to build or adapt shelters that would give protection against the three dangers of explosives, fire, and gas. The experts felt that adequate protection against gas would be extremely difficult to achieve for large urban populations. The discipline and the constant vigilance required seemed beyond the capacities of civilians. Most of the makeshift shelters available to the population in the event of air attacks-basements and subway stations, for example-would become death traps as the heavy and low-lying poison gases seeped into them. Governments could do little more than supply their popu- lations with gas masks, and in the late thirties these were being man- ufactured by the millions. Government planners were generally dis- trustful of mass shelters. Joseph Goebbels feared they would be breeding places for microbes and political decadence, while British planners feared mass panic. P. R. C. Groves offered a particularly ghastly scenario for what would happen if there were a power failure while the population was sheltered in the subway system. The sudden and complete darkness would produce mindless panic, and then the ho
