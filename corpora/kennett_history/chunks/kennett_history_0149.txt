tly scenario for what would happen if there were a power failure while the population was sheltered in the subway system. The sudden and complete darkness would produce mindless panic, and then the howling, struggling mass of humanity would suffocate from lack of ventilation. In psychological journals other experts speculated on the mental damage the bomber could do; there was much talk of mass neurosis, conversion hysteria, and exotic conditions like "bunker fever" and "deep-shelter mentality." If the great cities could not be rendered safe, at least the losses could be cut by evacuating a part of the population. During the Great War, sizable numbers of people had left the heavily bombarded cities, often on their own initiative and also at governmental direction. Most governments drew up contingency plans for evacuating various por- tions of their populations, particularly the children. The larger French cities had such plans, endorsed by Gen.

In Britain, by con- trast, the declaration of war triggered an exodus of 3 million people from the city of London alone.  104 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING War brought another, more discreet exodus. This was the rather general shift of military command posts outside the capitals so that they would not be paralyzed by the initial "knockout" blow the enemy was expected to deliver. The RAF's Fighter Command had chosen headquarters at Bentley Priory, north of London, while Bomber Com- mand was still awaiting completion of wartime headquarters at High Wycombe, which featured an underground operations room.
