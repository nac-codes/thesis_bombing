In general, the Luftwaffe was to make sure that the opening of the air war was not brought about by German actions. The British and French also went to considerable lengths to avoid provoking an all-out conflict in the air. They too accepted Roosevelt's appeal and steadfastly refused to launch any air offensive to help the beleaguered Poles.
