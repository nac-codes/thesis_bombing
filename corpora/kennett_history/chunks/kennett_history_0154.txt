But the essential point was that the peo- ple of Warsaw chose to fight and rejected several calls to lay down  108 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING TOWARD TOTAL WAR 109 their arms. Hitler was to say later that he had tried five times to get the city to surrender (including having the Luftwaffe drop leaflets demanding capitulation). The defenders wanted to send noncombatants out of the city under a flag of truce. Negotiations to that end failed, apparently because of mutual distrust and misunderstandings. For example, a column of ref- ugees trying to leave the city was fired on by German troops who had not yet received the order to let them pass. Thereafter, the Germans redoubled the air and ground bombardments, driven by the FÃ¼hrer's order to reduce the city before the end of the month. While the Luft waffe's bombers were trying to adhere to the injunction "military tar- gets only," they were having great problems with accuracy. Even the dive-bombing Stukas had trouble; they flew repeated missions against the city's bridges, but without destroying them. German airmen who participated in the raid of September 13, when 183 planes were over the city at the same time, spoke of bad timing, near collision, and virtual chaos over the target. Toward the end, when the city was hid- den under a pall of smoke, German bombers crisscrossed over it while their crews threw out incendiaries by the shovelful, stoking the mighty furnace ten thousand feet below. Under the incessant pounding, Warsaw's vital services began to fail. Telephones ceased to function over much of the city, followed by the failure of electric power generally. On September 29, with hundreds of fires raging throughout Warsaw, water pressure began to drop in the mains. The end had come. Two days later, Polish negoti- ators went out to arrange the surrender.
