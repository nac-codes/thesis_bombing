Warsaw had been struck by about five thousand tons of German bombs, one-fourth of the total amount the Luftwaffe used in the Polish campaign. About three thou- sand Polish soldiers fell victim to air and land bombardments, and about eight times that number of civilians. When Field Marshal Kesselring was in the dock at Nuremberg six years later, he defended the bombardment of the city in the following terms: "In the German view, Warsaw was a fortress, and moreover it had strong air defenses.

Hitler had staged the operation partly for the harvest of fright and dread it would yield, and his expectations were met fully. The showman and the extortionist in the FÃ¼hrer led him to give the spectacle the widest possible dissemination in such vehicles as the harrowing propaganda film Baptism by Fire. The film showed a Germany as terrible and inexorable in its might as Hitler imagined it.

Henceforth, British air policy wo
