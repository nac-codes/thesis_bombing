ons in Poland, the British Air Ministry decided it could no longer be bound by the Draft Rules it had pledged to observe or by its acceptance of Roose- velt's appeal. Henceforth, British air policy would be governed by expediency. There was no doubt that the generation of 1939 was stunned and horrified by the spectacle of Warsaw in flames. It seemed to fulfill perfectly the most dire predictions that Douhet and other military Cassandras had been making for years. Had contemporaries been less obsessed with the Götterdämmerung image, they might have read in the bombardment of Warsaw something quite different. In the space of four weeks, the city absorbed ten times the tonnage of bombs dropped on Great Britain in the four years of World War I. At the end of those four weeks, the city was badly punished, but far from obliterated-although some "experts" had written that 5,000 tons was sufficient to raze a city the size of Paris. Finally, despite the intensity of the bombardment, the inhabitants of Warsaw did not go into a blind panic. To be sure, the population was uneasy and a prey to rumor; but a recent study has shown that what they feared most from the Luftwaffe was that it might parachute spies and saboteurs into the city or drop "poisoned objects"-a curious revival of the "poisoned candy" stories of World War I.2 But there were no stampedes, no loot- ing, no assaults on the centers of authority-in short, none of the scenes of frenzy and terror so often described in the literature of the thirties.
