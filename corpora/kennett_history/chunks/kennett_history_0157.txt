ent had hopes of appealing directly to the German people; the leaflets were messages to them from Prime Minister  110 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING TOWARD TOTAL WAR 111 Neville Chamberlain. Even if that ploy proved unsuccessful, leaflet dropping served notice that German cities were vulnerable at night. yet was not an action sufficiently provocative to escalate the war to dangerous proportion. By the spring of 1940, the RAF had dropped 50 million leaflets over Germany, Austria, Poland, and Czechoslova- kia. There is no evidence that this mass of paper had any effect on the course of World War II, but the leaflet work gave Bomber Command invaluable experience in learning its way around in the night skies of central Europe. (Neither the French nor the Germans were so enthu- siastic about dropping leaflets, but their reconaissance flights some- times carried them.)
