me fleet, or at least a strike against the aircraft carrier Hermes, then riding at anchor at Sheerness. But Hitler refused: Ger- many was not going to initiate the air war. It was the RAF that did that on September 4 with surprise raids on German naval units at Wilhelmshaven and Brunnsb√ºttel. The Luftwaffe replied with a raid on elements of the British fleet off Great Fisher Bank on September 26, and another on October 16 into the Firth of Forth, where H.M.S Hood was reported at anchor. The Hood was there, but docked, or nearly so. The pilots of the Junkers 88s passed it up for fear they might put a bomb on the shore; they bombed smaller vessels, with indifferent results. By December 19 the Royal Navy could report fifteen separate air attacks on its ships. The Luftwaffe had damaged a cruiser and a destroyer, neither of them seriously. The RAF did not do much better. By the spring of 1940, it had made 861 sorties against enemy war- 1 ships, causing slight damage to the Emden and the Scheer. The cost was high-forty-one bombers lost. It was in these raids that Bomber Command began to realize just how vulnerable its bombers were to German air defenses. In forays across the North Sea on December 14 and again on December 18, small formations of Wellington bombers ran into intense fighter opposition. (German radar, which was just becoming operational along the North Sea coast, gave advance warn- ing of their approach.) Underarmed and without self-sealing gas tanks, the Wellingtons suffered 50 percent losses on each raid. In the meantime, confirmation came from France that the Fairey Battles were even more vulnerable. Ten squadrons were stationed in eastern France as an "advance air striking force" threatening German indus- try. But after September 30 it was difficult to pretend that the threat was a serious one. On that day a reconnaissance patrol of five Battles was set upon by a score of German fighters. Within minutes four Bat- tles were shot out of the sky; the fifth m
