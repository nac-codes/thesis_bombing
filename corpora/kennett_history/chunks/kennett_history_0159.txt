d that the threat was a serious one. On that day a reconnaissance patrol of five Battles was set upon by a score of German fighters. Within minutes four Bat- tles were shot out of the sky; the fifth made it back to base in extremis. Bomber Command thus had good reason to think its squadrons would suffer sizable losses if committed over enemy territory in day- light raids. Yet British agreements with the French called for the RAF to undertake day bombing, while the Arm√©e de l'Air would restrict bombing operations to nighttime until its new bombers were ready for service. Beyond that, Bomber Command felt that when the storm broke, its logical targets were the same Ruhr industrial centers the Independent Air Force had attacked in 1918-although it was also attracted to a somewhat more refined "oil plan," in which the destruction of carefully selected targets would make the German war machine literally run out of fuel in a short time. The French high command opposed both ideas. Extending bombing operations to Ger- man towns-what the British called "taking the gloves off"-would invite attacks on French towns, which were more vulnerable than Ger- man ones. Moreover, in General Gamelin's view, the function of bombing squadrons was to help tilt the balance in the land battle. The French too had held on to the ideas of 1918. These quarrels had not been resolved when the German armies burst across the frontiers on May 10, 1940. For those who had fol- lowed the Polish campaign, the development of the German air attack was familiar. The first massive strike made early on the morning of May 10 was at Allied airfields; it was largely unsuccessful, probably because of early morning mist. Thereafter, the German bomber squadrons turned increasingly to transport and communications tar-  112 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING TOWARD TOTAL WAR 113 gets, and when the bombers attacked urban centers, it was clearly those targets they were seeking. The most disturbing attack of the day was the
