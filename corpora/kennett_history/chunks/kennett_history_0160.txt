The most disturbing attack of the day was the one made on the German town of Freiburg, which produced scores of casualties among the townspeople and led to violent denun- ciations in the German press. What most concerned the Allies was that they knew their aircraft had not attacked the city, and they feared the Germans had engineered the incident in order to justify all- out attacks on British and French towns.
