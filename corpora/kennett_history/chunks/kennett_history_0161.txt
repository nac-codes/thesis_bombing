The German authorities in Rotterdam fired pink flares to warn the bombers away, but one wave of fifty Heinkels did not see the signal and dropped its bombs on tar- get. The explosions were followed by raging fires and much of the city was gutted. Allied wire services were soon reporting that thousands of people had lost their lives in an attack on a city that had already sur- rendered. The actual casualties were about a thousand killed, but some seventy-eight thousand people were left homeless.

On May 15 the British war cabinet made the perilous decision to cross the Rubicon-in this case, the Rhine-and Bomber Command prepared an attack for that night against oil and railway targets in the Ruhr. British leaders thought the attack east of the Rhine might well bring the Luftwaffe over British towns, and a warning to that effect went out to air-defense units. That night ninety-nine British bombers took off for Germany-the beginning of a strategic air offensive that would last for five years. The May 15 raid into the Ruhr did not provoke a particularly vio- lent reaction from the Germans; most important, no Heinkels crossed the Channel on reprisal missions. For the time being, the Luftwaffe continued to give its full attention to the Battle of France. Neverthe- less, the attack had made an impression. It was certainly in Hitler's mind when he issued his Directive No. 13 nine days later.
