It is to institute a crushing reprisal raid as response to the English attacks on the Ruhr area."5 Bomber Command's raids into Germany did bring a prompt and angry reaction from the French high command. With the Germans across the Meuse in force and a portion of his line disintegrating, Gen- eral Gamelin insisted that the air forces of both countries use all their energies to help stem the flow of panzers into France. Gamelin did not have his way completely, nor did Gen. Maxime Weygand, who took over from him on May 19. Bomber Command served two masters in those hectic days of May and early June. The bombing squadrons struck Germany (the only proper target for them, according to their leaders) whenever they could; they attacked airfields, crossroads, and rail centers behind the enemy armies when they had to. This "opera- tional" bombing in support of the land forces made at best a mediocre contribution. The bombers were flying at night, seeking fairly precise targets; the missions, hastily planned, were very imperfectly executed. The RAF was then experimenting with photographs of the target taken with the aid of flares, and these revealed more than once that not only was the specific objective nowhere in view, but the Hampdens and Wellingtons were releasing their bombs over the wrong town. On the other hand, it is easy to understand the exasperation of the French generals; with their front torn open and their armies reeling, it seemed hardly the time to sprinkle explosives over the Ruhr Valley.

On June 3 the Luftwaffe  114 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING TOWARD TOTAL WAR 115 executed Operation Paula, a massive raid in, and around, Paris. The attack had been planned for some time, and French intelligence knew it was coming, thanks to its i
