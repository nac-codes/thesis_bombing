s just the reverse: fresh from one triumph, it stood poised for the next campaign without any clear idea of how to use the impressive means at its dis- posal. The three Luftflotten that were ranged about England (Luft- flotte V in Norway, Luftflotte II in the Low Countries and northeast- ern France, and Luftflotte III along the French coast of the Channel) consisted of just under a thousand twin-engined bombers, an air armada that could deliver over England in a single day five times the tonnage of bombs dropped on it during all of World War I. But nearly two months elapsed between the fall of France and "Eagle Day"- August 13-the date on which Goering formally opened the air offen- sive against Great Britain. The delay was due in part to difficulties in working out strategy for the offensive. A sure and steady hand had guided the German air force through the Battle of France, but once the panzers reached the Channel the assurance disappeared. Faced with an island fortress that spurned the Führer's "appeal to reason" on July 19, Germany's leaders were not sure quite how to grasp the nettle. This is not to say that the Germans lost what has come to be called the Battle of Britain simply because they failed to adhere to a master plan while the British did. In the combat conditions prevailing over much of the British Isles, the advantage swung to the defensive for several reasons, chiefly technical ones. The radar warning system over- came the "lag time" in interception, enabling Fighter Command to organize prompt and effective resistance, while the Luftwaffe learned in the skies of England what the RAF had discovered a few months earlier in its raids across the North Sea: neither the bomber's speed  116 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING nor its armament could ensure its survival in daytime encounters with an enemy fighter force. It was also the turn of the Luftwaffe to dis- cover shortcomings in its matériel: the Stuka dive-bomber was very vulnerable to British fighter a
