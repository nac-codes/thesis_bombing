ival in daytime encounters with an enemy fighter force. It was also the turn of the Luftwaffe to dis- cover shortcomings in its mat√©riel: the Stuka dive-bomber was very vulnerable to British fighter attacks, and so was the twin-engined Mes- serschmitt 110, cast in the role of "heavy" fighter to escort the Ger- man bombers. Many other considerations colored the outcome of the Battle of Britain, such as morale; there was even a meteorological fac- tor, for bad weather helped to delay Eagle Day and gave the RAF a much needed respite in the second half of August. All in all, it seems clear that Luftwaffe planners did not seriously occupy themselves with the question of an air offensive against Great Britain until quite late. The first extensive study was made by Gen. Hellmuth Felmy late in 1938, and it offered little hope that the British could be brought to their knees by air action alone. Felmy fixed the most attractive targets as airfields and aircraft factories, the Royal Navy's ships and installations, and merchant shipping and port facil- ities. There were further studies in 1939, including Studie Blau-a kind of inventory of British industry something like the "Bomber's Baedeker," which the British Air Staff used in selecting targets in Germany. Studie Blau was followed closely by the Geisler report, which grouped bombing objectives into broad categories and priori- ties. What emerged from these studies were several distinct and often competing air strategies. First of all, there was the intriguing possi- bility that the British Isles might be starved out, or "strangled," the term used by "Beppo" Schmid, Luftwaffe intelligence chief and warm supporter of the plan. The scheme was esentially a new application of the blockade principle of World War I, although in the present case bomber and submarine would cooperate to close down Britain's life- line. Another strategy, which originated even before 1914, was to employ the Luftwaffe against the Royal Navy in the hope o
