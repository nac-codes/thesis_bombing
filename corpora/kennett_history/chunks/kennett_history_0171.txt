prerequisite for accomplishing the other tasks-was to beat down the British air defense system so that the German bombers could range freely. In the narrow sense, the Battle of Britain was a duel of sorts, a direct confrontation between two air forces. The Luftwaffe's chief goal was to shatter Fighter Command, to kill or exhaust its pilots, and to destroy its Spitfires and Hurricanes not only in the air but on the ground and even on the assembly lines. The British had to make this effort prohibitively expensive for the Ger- mans, and ultimately this is what they succeeded in doing. A battle of this sort could be fought only in daylight hours; it filled the long sum- mer days of August and September 1940 and culminated in the vast air battles on Sunday, September 15, which cost the Luftwaffe sixty aircraft and Fighter Command twenty-six. Thereafter, Goering was forced to take a long, sobering look at his bombing offensive; by the end of September it had cost the Germans over fifteen hundred air- craft and crews, with little evidence that Britain's air defenses had been seriously impaired. With September the great daylight raids came to an end. Henceforth, the German bombers would strike under cover of night. The abandonment of massive daylight raids meant also the end of precision bombing and consequently of the attacks on smaller targets. Initially the Luftwaffe set great store by two systems of radio guidance (the X-Geraet and Knickebein) in which the bombing planes would fly "on the beam" straight over the objective, releasing their bombs at the right moment in accordance with a signal. Elite crews were trained in the technique to form Kampfgruppe 100, whose purpose was to mark the target for the main bombing force that followed. But the British got wind of the system early in the summer and managed to interfere with its operation-the beginning of a "high-frequency war" involving increasingly sophisticated "black boxes" and elaborate jamming tech- niques.
