early in the summer and managed to interfere with its operation-the beginning of a "high-frequency war" involving increasingly sophisticated "black boxes" and elaborate jamming tech- niques. The short-term result was to deprive the Luftwaffe of its first radio-guidance navigational aids. (An exception was on the night of November 14, 1940, when the British failed to jam the X-Geraet that led German bombers to Coventry, resulting in a devastating raid on the city's center.) The switch to night bombing thus meant a change to broader def- initions of objectives and to area bombing, but this change worked no great hardship, for it coincided roughly with a change of emphasis in the whole bombing offensive. Even before the outcome of the battle  118 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING TOWARD TOTAL WAR 119 for air supremacy over England was clear, Germany's leadership was increasingly drawn to the idea of an attack on the cities, and on Lon- don particularly, in the hope that it could drive the British out of the war. Hitler especially seems to have regarded an all-out air assault on the British capital as a trump card to be held and then played at the most opportune moment. In his first war directive, dated August 31 1939, he reserved for himself the decision to attack London, and it was the only Allied city singled out in that way. He no doubt had London in mind when he told his military leaders that he was medi- tating an air offensive "against the heart of the British will-to-resist." It was important to Hitler for the British people to know that their cities were in grave danger, and he missed no opportunity to tell them so in his speeches that summer. English translations of the texts were usually dropped over England in leaflet form. Even in his July 19 speech to the Reichstag, the FÃ¼hrer mixed menace into his appeal for peace. He accused Churchill of having begun an air war against harm- less civilians in May and did not blush to cite the attack in Freiburg of May 10.
