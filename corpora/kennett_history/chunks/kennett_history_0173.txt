So far, Germany had not replied in kind, but its patience was nearing an end. The Luftwaffe stood ready to bring "dreadful sorrow and misfortune" to the people of England.7 By August 1940 the German leadership had received intelligence reports-inaccurate ones, as it turned out-indicating a significant slump in morale, particularly in London.
