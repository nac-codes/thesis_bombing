ital went out on August 31, and the attack itself took place on Sep- tember 7. But before the bombers struck, Hitler made another speech. He began by denouncing the "night pirates" of the RAF, who came to bomb villages, farms, and residential areas: "Wherever they see a light they drop a bomb." Henceforth, they would be paid back, night for night, bomb for bomb. "And if the British air force drops two or three or four thousand kilograms of bombs, then we will drop in a single night 150,000, 180,000, 230,000, 300,000, 400,000, a million kilograms.

When the last raiders had gone, 306 Londoners were dead and some thirteen hundred were wounded. At least a thousand fires broke out within the city, and several of the larger ones were still burning the following day. The Luftwaffe came again that evening, killing an additional 412 Londoners; still another raid on the night of September 9-10 added 370 more fatalities. The "Blitz" had begun in earnest, and for the time being, London came in for the worst of it. Not until early November did the city spend a night free from raids and alarms. Just what motives guided the German high command during the bombing offensive against Britain's cities is not altogether clear.
