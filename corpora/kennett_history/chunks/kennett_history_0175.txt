But as hopes faded in Berlin that the Luftwaffe would gain the air superiority needed for the invasion attempt, the idea of attacking Britain's cities became more attractive, particularly since they could be struck at night. Cer- tainly Hitler was still juggling with options at the beginning of Sep- tember, but he made a significant observation on the tenth of that month. German naval authorities were anxious for the Luftwaffe to  120 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING TOWARD TOTAL WAR 121 move on to bombing of the Channel ports, an operation crucial for the success of Sea Lion, but in conference with the Führer they did not press the point, because he told them the air assault on London might be critical.
