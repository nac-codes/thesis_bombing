they fired, they did not bring down many German bombers. At night their fire could be directed only by means of searchlights and sound-detection equip- ment, and neither of these devices worked very well at locating the high-flying and fast-moving bombers of the Luftwaffe. The only other technique was barrage fire, in which the batteries tried to put into the sky a curtain of projectiles into which, it was hoped, the enemy planes would fly. The solution to better accuracy lay in the use of radar to aim the guns, but promising as the idea was, it had not been realized in 1940. The night fighter, the other potential weapon against the nocturnal bomber, was in a very early stage of development in 1940, for in this instance the British had lagged behind both the Germans and the French. The hastily constituted night-fighter units of 1940 rarely found their targets, and although there were certainly prospects of improvement with airborne radar, actual improvements did not come until later. The incessant pounding of the antiaircraft guns was com- forting to Londoners, and both guns and night fighters added some- thing to the stress that German aircrews had to face, thus perhaps contributing to accidents, which in this period seem to have accounted for more German bomber losses than any other cause. But this was little recompense for the vast defensive efforts both on the ground and in the air. Gen. Sir Frederick Pile, who helped organize the air defenses of the London area, confessed, "We seemed as far as ever from solving the great problem of the night bomber."12 Largely undeterred, then, Luftflotten II and III continued their campaign against the British capital. Through September and Octo- ber the attacks went on, with a nightly average of 160 raiders. For the month of October the Luftwaffe released on the city 7,160 tons of high explosives and 4,735 canisters of incendiaries. In November came a shift of emphasis, with more attacks directed at other British cities. Cov
