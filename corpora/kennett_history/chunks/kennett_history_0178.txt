ober the Luftwaffe released on the city 7,160 tons of high explosives and 4,735 canisters of incendiaries. In November came a shift of emphasis, with more attacks directed at other British cities. Coventry lost much of the city center and five hundred of its citizens in the devastating raid of November 14, and Plymouth and the Mer- seyside area came in for repeated attacks. In December, raids upon the capital were spasmodic, partly because of bad weather. But the raid of December 8-9 was particularly heavy, and both Westminster Abbey and the House of Commons were hit. Then, on the night of  122 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING TOWARD TOTAL WAR 123 December 29, much of London's center was damaged by spectacular fires. The raid that night was not a particularly heavy one, but several factors combined to make it devastating. It was a Sunday night, and many buildings were locked, with no firewatch posted. When the thou- sands of incendiaries were released, many fires burned for a time undetected, fanned in some cases by a stiff wind. Fire fighters were further hindered in their work by ruptured water mains and very low water in the Thames. Much of the square mile that constituted the City of London was burned out. Saint Paul's was saved by the closest margin, but eight other Wren churches were consumed on that night. The pace of the German air offensive slackened for the first two months of 1941, once again because of bad weather and sodden air- fields in France (hard-surface runways were still uncommon). In March the tempo picked up again, and from March to May the Luft- flotten carried out some seventy major raids (those that killed fifty people or more). Of these, only eleven struck London; the rest were scattered among a score of cities, Plymouth, Hull, and Liverpool being the most frequently hit. The raids began to taper off, with a final heavy assault on London on May 10, 1941. The reason for the gradual slack ening of the offensive lay in Hitler's decision to attac
