g the most frequently hit. The raids began to taper off, with a final heavy assault on London on May 10, 1941. The reason for the gradual slack ening of the offensive lay in Hitler's decision to attack the Soviet Union. As early as April, 150 bombers were shifted to the Balkans and in the next month Luftflotte II also departed. By the time Oper- ation Barbarossa was unleashed on the Soviets on June 22, two-thirds of Germany's air strength was concentrated in the east. For the British the Blitz was over, except for the harassing attacks and minor raids that Hitler ordered continued throughout the war. Three years later, the British would have to face a second ordeal with attacks on London and the southeast of England by the two V-weap- ons: the V-1 flying bomb, of which perhaps 5,000 reached England in the summer of 1944, and the much more sophisticated V-2 rocket, of which about a thousand were fired at the island between September 1944 and March 1945. Challenging as both of these weapons were. they did not rival the bombers of 1940-41 in destructiveness. Of the sixty thousand Britons who lost their lives to air attacks (half of them Londoners), about forty thousand were killed in the Blitz. Of the esti- mated 71,000 metric tons of explosives and incendiaries the island absorbed, 57,000 were dropped by December 1941. What lessons could be drawn from this first extended bombing campaign of the war, which lasted some nine months? The campaign failed, of course, in its very first objective, which was to destroy the RAF. Here the analogy between sea and air warfare broke down, as some of the early theorists said it would. It proved far more difficult to drive the enemy fleets from the skies than to sweep them from the seas. Command of the air, as Douhet called it, proved a tenuous, elu- sive thing, not to be won against serious opposition in just a matter of weeks. And without air superiority there could be no Operation Sea Lion. The invasion was probably a last resourc
