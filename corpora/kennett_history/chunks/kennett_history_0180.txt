tenuous, elu- sive thing, not to be won against serious opposition in just a matter of weeks. And without air superiority there could be no Operation Sea Lion. The invasion was probably a last resource anyway, a chancy thing no one could approach without trepidation. Thus balked by an insular foe, the Germans turned to the bomber as the only weapon that could strike the enemy in its vitals. Hitler was certainly familiar with the idea of bringing an enemy to its knees by the destruction of key facilities; he boasted that with two hundred bombers capable of flying at 450 miles an hour, he could destroy all the power stations in a country and force it to capitulate within six months. But Germany had no such bombers in 1940, and those it did have were vulnerable if used in daylight raids on precision targets. The shift to nighttime operations was inevitably a shift to the larger target. While the spec- ified objective might be a factory or an arsenal, and the German peo- ple were assured that the Luftwaffe went after "military targets only," most of the bombs would go into the surrounding urban complex. If enough bombs went into enough cities, the British would come to terms. At bottom, this strategy was nothing more than arm twisting; but it had worked before, and the FÃ¼hrer held to it through thick and thin. The British learned a number of lessons during the Blitz, and many of those lessons would prove valid in other countries as well. The first and most heartening revelation was that under intense aerial bom- bardment the loss of life was far less widespread than anticipated, with perhaps five people killed for every ton of bombs dropped and three times that number injured. On the other hand, property damage was extensive and was much increased by fire losses. Rehousing proved a major problem. Some hazards had not been anticipated, such as get- ting about in the darkness of a blacked-out city or dealing with the large number of unexploded bombs; at one time London co
