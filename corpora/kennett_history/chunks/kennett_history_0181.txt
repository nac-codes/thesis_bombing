proved a major problem. Some hazards had not been anticipated, such as get- ting about in the darkness of a blacked-out city or dealing with the large number of unexploded bombs; at one time London contained several thousand such bombs, including a monster one-ton projectile that sank into the earth beside Saint Paul's. But, all in all, the cities proved remarkably able to absorb punishment, and this was particu- larly true of London. The German medium bombers of 1940 could not  124 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING deliver anywhere near the massive tonnages that would be used later in the war, and the very vastness of London-over seven hundred square miles-largely negated the limited effort the Luftwaffe mounted. The great unknown factor at the beginning of the Blitz was the reaction of the population. In the first few days, there were some rum- blings in London's East End, where the poorer districts near the Lon- don Docks suffered heavy damage, but they ended when the city came under more general attack and the fashionable West End began to receive its share of bombs. A Home Security report for September 25 could strike a reassuring note: "The German attack upon London has had no fundamental ill effect upon the capital or on the nation. Its first impact caused bewilderment and there was some ill-temper. this loss of temper . .. has almost completely vanished and a general equanimity prevails."13 There was no real evidence of panic, no chaotic stampede from the city when the first bombs fell, and no appearance of the feared "deep- shelter mentality." In fact, a survey in November 1940 indicated that the great majority of Londoners did not seek out the subway tubes or the public shelters when the sirens sounded; six out of every ten con- tinued to sleep in their homes. Much the same reassuring picture emerged in the provincial cities that came under attack, although there the authorities were somewhat concerned about the reappear- ance of "trekking," the phenomenon, n
