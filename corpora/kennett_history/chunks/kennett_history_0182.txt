ch the same reassuring picture emerged in the provincial cities that came under attack, although there the authorities were somewhat concerned about the reappear- ance of "trekking," the phenomenon, noticed in the previous war in some Italian cities, of an exodus into the countryside each evening either for greater safety or simply for an undisturbed night's sleep. So the Londoner and the Liverpudlian endured with "general equanimity" and went on with their lives as best they could. Their spirit would be fittingly praised in Churchillian prose. But the qualities they displayed were not exclusively British. In the following years, the bomber would bring the same threat to other cities and peoples, and they too would stand the test. CHAPTER 8 THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALLIED AIR OFFENSIVE THE LUFTWAFFE ASSAULT ON GREAT BRITAIN was an operation that began with great fanfare and then gradually and almost imperceptibly declined into little more than harassment raids. The campaign that Bomber Command waged against Germany developed in just the opposite way. It began almost unnoticed on the night of May 15, 1940, when fewer than a hundred Hampden bombers crossed the Rhine; it was carried out by fits and starts and then rose to a terrifying climax in the last months of World War II. Bomber Command emerged from the catastrophe of June 1940 with its share of losses. Scores of Fairey Battles had been lost, and the Blenheims of 2 Group, designated for use in conjunction with the army, had been badly mauled. But the workhorses of the bombing force of 1940-the seventeen squadrons of Hampdens, Wellingtons, and Whitleys-were largely intact. Among the chief casualties of those first months of war was the belief that a force of bombers could defend itself successfully against fighter attacks by means of close- formation flying and concentrated fire. And when that theory proved false, so did the concept of day bombardment. While brief penetra- tions into enemy airspace by daylight might s
