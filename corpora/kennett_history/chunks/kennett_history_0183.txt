by means of close- formation flying and concentrated fire. And when that theory proved false, so did the concept of day bombardment. While brief penetra- tions into enemy airspace by daylight might still be possible with fighter escort, any deep, massive thrust could be carried out only under cover of darkness. This lesson had been learned at considerable cost, 125  126 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALLIED AIR OFFENSIVE 127 and Bomber Command took it to heart: in the last four months of 1940, its planes made twenty nighttime sorties for each one flown by day. And two years later, when the American Eighth Air Force was preparing to send its Fortresses and Liberators into the daytime skies of Germany, the pessimism in Bomber Command was ill concealed. The conversion to night operations put severe limitations on bomb- ing. While the fighters and flak batteries of the Luftwaffe were much less of a problem, nature posed some formidable obstacles. First of all. the raid could not stretch much past the hours of darkness, or else the bombers could be intercepted on the way to the target as well as returning from it. In practical terms, this meant that in summer, with its shorter nights, a bombing force could not fly to Berlin, Leipzig, or Stettin and back. These cities thus became "winter" targets, at least for the time being. Darkness imposed still another restriction on bombing. During only a fourth of the nights each month would the moon be in correct phase-the "bomber's moon"-for sighting and identifying most objectives. (There were some exceptions, such as blast furnaces and targets that could be fixed by their relationship to bodies of water. these often being visible on darker nights.) Any cloudiness would com- plicate the bombardier's task even further. The towns in the Ruhr were notable for being partly shielded by the industrial haze that hung over the region. The search was on for better navigation aids and "blind bombing" devices, but for
