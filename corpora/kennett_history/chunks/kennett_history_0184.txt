urther. The towns in the Ruhr were notable for being partly shielded by the industrial haze that hung over the region. The search was on for better navigation aids and "blind bombing" devices, but for the time being, the success of a night bombing mission depended largely on the keenness of the human eye Assuming the British bombing force could reach and find its objec- tives, in 1940 it was severely limited in the amount of damage it could inflict. Just two years previously, Bomber Command had fixed on the type of aircraft it would need-one that could take a twelve-thousand- pound load of bombs to Berlin. The four-engined Lancasters, Hali faxes, and Stirlings, which could meet this requirement, would not begin to emerge from the production lines until 1941. In January 1942, Bomber Command had only 42 of these "heavies" available, and by the end of the year the figure stood at 261. Even these gains would not be painless. Crews had to be "converted" to the newer planes, a time-consuming process. The Lancaster proved to be by far the best of the new bombers. It alone could take aloft the twenty-two- thousand-pound "Grand Slam," the heaviest aerial bomb used in World War II. But the Lancaster had "teething" problems, which delayed its use. Not until early 1944 could Bomber Command boast a thousand planes, all of them "heavies" and more than half of them Lancasters. The British bombing force of 1940 was thus a weapon to be reforged, and at the same time, political and military leaders were asking themselves how it might best be used. In the perilous summer of 1940, the bomber, like every other weapon at Winston Churchill's disposal, was used first and foremost to parry the invasion threat. Bomber Command sent its planes against enemy ports, shipping facil- ities, and barge concentrations, and several squadrons were put to "gardening," a code name for the sowing of coastal mines. But it was Churchill who ordered the first raid against Berlin on August 25, 1940, and who s
