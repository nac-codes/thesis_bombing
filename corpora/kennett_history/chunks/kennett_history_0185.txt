concentrations, and several squadrons were put to "gardening," a code name for the sowing of coastal mines. But it was Churchill who ordered the first raid against Berlin on August 25, 1940, and who sanctioned further nocturnal raids into Germany. The RAF's night bombers could at least perform the eminently gratifying task of bringing the war home to the enemy, and some historians have concluded that the first two years of the British bombing offensive did more to bolster the morale of the British people than it did to harm their enemies. Those who believed in the strategic air offensive expected it to pro- duce more than satisfying headlines. Prewar planners had examined the potential target categories in the late thirties and had incorporated most of them into the various "Western air plans." Perhaps the most sophisticated approach called for an assault on a single branch of the German war economy, one that was both vulnerable and critical. The targets would be carefully selected and destroyed with deftness and precision. In the "Ruhr plan," the productivity of the entire complex could be brought to a standstill by smashing its power stations and its coking plants; in another variation the industrial complex would be "blockaded" by shattering rail and canal lines. Some saw the trans- portation network generally as the Achilles heel of Nazi Germany, although the oil plan still retained its partisans. For approximately a year and a half, down to the end of 1941, the bulk of the air staff's directives called for the bombers to strike precise targets figuring in one of the plans. It was impossible to carry out all the plans simultaneously, of course. The bombers were still of limited range and bomb-carrying capacity, and it was rare that more than a hundred of them ventured into the night skies over Germany. The Ruhr plan was not implemented because targets such as power sta- tions were particularly hard to locate and German air defenses were  128 A HISTORY OF STRATEG
