The Ruhr plan was not implemented because targets such as power sta- tions were particularly hard to locate and German air defenses were  128 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALLIED AIR OFFENSIVE 129 especially strong there. Sir Arthur Harris, named chief of Bomber Command early in 1942, recorded that his predecessors had "done nothing more than scratch at the Ruhr."1 The oil plan enjoyed consid- erable vogue in the first months, although directives from the highest authorities-the cabinet and the chiefs of staff-often diverted the bombers to other objectives-for example, to submarine construction facilities in September 1940 and again in March 1941. In the summer of 1941, the targets assigned to Bomber Command began to change. Attacks on oil facilities showed no signs of handi- capping the German war effort or, indeed, of slowing it down in the least. The transportation system of the Reich became the preferred target, with rail centers the most frequently designated objectives. The switch in targets masked a subtle but significant change in the ratio- nale of strategic bombing, for it brought to the surface the factor of morale. A specific campaign to break the enemy's will to resist did not figure among the sixteen Western air plans, but it was never com- pletely absent from discussion of air strategy. Even before the war, the air staff speculated that simply dropping notices of impending attacks on Ruhr towns might "cause great panic and seriously disorganize the industrial life of the Ruhr."2 Those who advocated "psychological warfare" against Germany made the profound mistake of assuming that the state of mind of the German people at the outset of World War II was similar to what it had been in 1918, and their view seems to have been confirmed by grossly inaccurate reports they received on German morale. In July 1941 the air staff claimed to have "many signs" that morale had declined in towns attacked by
