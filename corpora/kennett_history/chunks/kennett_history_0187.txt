ir view seems to have been confirmed by grossly inaccurate reports they received on German morale. In July 1941 the air staff claimed to have "many signs" that morale had declined in towns attacked by its bombers, and the attacks ordered on the communications system were designed to contribute to that decline. Sir Arthur Harris recalled, "The targets chosen were in con- gested industrial areas and were carefully picked so that bombs which overshot or undershot the actual railway centers under attack should fall on these areas, thereby affecting morale. This programme amounted to a halfway stage between area and precision bombing."3 At about the same time, bomber crews were instructed not to bring bombs back from Germany, even if they were unable to locate their objectives. The RAF's night raids over Germany in June and July 1941 were distinctive in that planes equipped with cameras took extensive night photographs of the bombing runs in an attempt to find out just how accurate night bombing was. The technique had been tried briefly dur- ing the Battle of France the year before, when it had yielded frag- mentary but disturbing evidence that British night bombers were very much off target. Even so, air-staff calculations continued to give aim- ing error in hundreds of yards; now the extensive photographic anal- ysis of the summer of 1941 would supply a more reliable indication of bombing accuracy, and as it turned out, a thoroughly disheartening one. The Butt Report, which incorporated the findings, put the pro- portion of bombers that placed their payloads within five miles of the target as about one-fifth. In the Ruhr, with its special challenges to the night bomber, perhaps seven planes in a hundred released their bombs anywhere within the most general neighborhood of the objective. The Butt Report made it quite clear that the RAF could no longer speak of night operations and precision bombing in the same breath. There was hope for improvement in bombing accuracy,
