the objective. The Butt Report made it quite clear that the RAF could no longer speak of night operations and precision bombing in the same breath. There was hope for improvement in bombing accuracy, for several new techniques were under study. (Two years later, Bomber Com- mand would claim that three-fifths of its crews put their payloads within three miles of the aiming point.) But for the time being a very disheartened air staff had to concede that the strategic-bombing pro- gram it had prescribed was incapable of execution. In November came orders to reduce the intensity of the air offensive over the Reich. In February 1942, Bomber Command embarked on a new offen- sive. The tempo of its attacks rose again, but now the air offensive had a new leader and a different thrust. A directive of February 11 set the new course: "It has been decided that the primary objective of your operations should now be focussed on the morale of the enemy civil population and in particular, of the industrial workers."4 Accompa- nying the directive was a list of targets, and leading the list were Essen, Duisburg, DÃ¼sseldorf, and Cologne. The Ruhr, then, was to be the primary target, with the intention of making life difficult and work impossible for its industrial labor force. (In that connection Churchill would speak of "dehousing" the German worker.) The concept of pre- cision bombing of key installations did not disappear completely, for Appendix B contained a list of power stations and synthetic oil and rubber plants. Bomber Command was to "consider the practicability" of attacking these if it could do so with sufficient accuracy. But the primary targets in the Ruhr were virtually the cities themselves, where the bombers were to strike at "transportation and general industries."  130 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALLIED AIR OFFENSIVE 131 One can read into these phrases a significant shift in British air strat- egy.
