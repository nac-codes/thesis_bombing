HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALLIED AIR OFFENSIVE 131 One can read into these phrases a significant shift in British air strat- egy. Britain's bombing force had not made a very effective rapier; now it would be used as a cudgel. Nine days after Bomber Command got its new orders, it got a new leader who would oversee its operations to the end of the war, Air Marshal Sir Arthur Harris. The official history of the British strategic air offensive described his leadership as "vigorous," and there is no reason to quarrel with this description.

Harris did not believe that the enemy's morale should be his chief target. In his view, the leaflet campaigns of the first months of the war had done nothing to change the outlook of the German people; they had only supplied their needs in toilet paper for the rest of the war Furthermore, bombs would not have the desired effect in a police state such as Hitler's; people might be demoralized, but they would be kept working all the same. Nor did the air marshal have any use for the precision bombing of key factories, which he called "panacea bomb- ing."

During the worst nights, he watched from the roof of the Air Ministry, and he vividly remembered Saint Paul's standing out in the middle of a sea of flames. The Blitz convinced Harris that "a bomber offensive of adequate weight and the right kind of bombs would, if continued for long enough, be something that no countr
