ut in the middle of a sea of flames. The Blitz convinced Harris that "a bomber offensive of adequate weight and the right kind of bombs would, if continued for long enough, be something that no country in the world could endure."5 Harris intended to attack Germany's industrial cities and the production units within them, weighing his success not in indi- vidual plants destroyed, but in acres of city devastated. The funda- mental goal was physical destruction. If morale were shattered in the process, so much the better; but Harris preferred to consider it an imponderable. Thus, the cities themselves were the targets. They were to Germany what ganglia are to a living body. If enough of them were destroyed, the body would succumb. Convinced that smashing the industrial cities of the Reich was the proper work of Bomber Command, Harris was loath to send his planes anywhere else. He was cool to the idea of attacking dams in the Ruhr Valley, for he considered them panacea targets and believed-rightly, as it turned out-that their destruction would have little lasting effect. He was particularly unhappy at having to divert his attention to objec- tives of naval importance: "I was required to attack targets of imme- diate strategic importance-a euphemism for targets chosen by the Navy."6 He regarded raids on the submarine pens at Saint-Nazaire and Lorient as a gross misuse of air power that devastated two French towns and had no effect on the submarine installations, sheathed as they were in thousands of cubic yards of reinforced concrete. (The submarine pens still stand to this day, the French having decided that it would not be worth the immense cost to undertake their demolition.) Harris even insisted on choosing targets within Germany himself. Unhappy at the results of the raids against the Ruhr cities, he shifted his bombers elsewhere; the Battle of the Ruhr would not take place until the following year. In the autumn of 1942, Harris successfully resisted pressure to und
