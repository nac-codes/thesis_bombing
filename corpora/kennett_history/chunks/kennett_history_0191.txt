ids against the Ruhr cities, he shifted his bombers elsewhere; the Battle of the Ruhr would not take place until the following year. In the autumn of 1942, Harris successfully resisted pressure to undertake a bombing campaign against Berlin, which Churchill thought might hearten the Russians. Harris had good reasons for declining. Throughout 1942 his force of heavy bombers remained very modest; at the time he was being urged to attack Ber- lin, he had fewer than a hundred Lancasters available. He also suf- fered something of a disappointment in the electronic navigation aid known as Gee, which was used for the first time operationally on the raid against Essen on the night of March 8, 1942. The Gee device carried by some of the bombers received radar impulses from England, enabling the navigator to "fix" the bomber's position, and some experts believed it would be sufficiently accurate to serve as a blind-bombing device-that is, one that could bring the bomber squarely over the target city and have it release its bombs at the right moment even though the bombardier could not actually see his objec- tive. As it turned out, Gee could help the bombers find their way to the vicinity of Essen, but it could not position them over their target. Nevertheless, the bombing campaign of 1942 was marked by con- siderable progress, first of all in testing the theory that the incendiary was the bomber's most effective weapon. The test was conducted on the city of Lübeck on the nights of March 25-29. Lübeck was at con- siderable range from England, far beyond the limits of Gee. But moonlit nights enabled the bomber crews to spot the city, thanks to its location on the Trave River. A total of 234 RAF bombers passed over in two waves, releasing some three hundred tons of bombs, nearly half of that weight in incendiaries. Lübeck was an old town with narrow  132 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALLIED AIR OFFENSIVE 133 streets and heavily timbered houses, so the fla
