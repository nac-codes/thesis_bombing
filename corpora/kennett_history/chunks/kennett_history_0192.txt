Lübeck was an old town with narrow  132 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALLIED AIR OFFENSIVE 133 streets and heavily timbered houses, so the flames destroyed much of it before they could be brought under control. The loss of life was far from negligible; for the first time, a German town had casualties in four figures. The earlier bombing attacks had been pinpricks, but this one stung. And hardly had the impact of the Lübeck attack sunk in than the RAF paid visits to the nearby Baltic port of Rostock on four successive nights. It too proved highly flammable. Harris estimated that in the two Baltic cities he had destroyed over seven hundred acres The Nazi leaders seem to have been particularly incensed that the RAF should have attacked Lübeck, a city they regarded as a cultural landmark. Goebbels was confident that the population could absorb its losses, for he judged the North Germans to be particularly tough. But he noted in his diary, "Stupendous works of art have fallen victim to the British craze for destruction."7 Hitler too dwelt at length on the cultural loss; he had ambitious plans for rebuilding the city and told his dinner guests that he would send artists to Ypres so that they could copy the marvelous hues on the roof tiles there.
