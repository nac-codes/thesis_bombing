German bombers attacked Canterbury on the night of March 31, and during April they struck at Exeter, Bath, York, and other historic towns.

He prepared leaflets that showed scenes of destruction in Lübeck and Rostock; these were accompanied by the text of Hitler's promise of reprisal. The Luftwaffe was to drop the leaflets over English towns, and Goebbels confided in his diary that he expected them to have considerable psychological impact.
