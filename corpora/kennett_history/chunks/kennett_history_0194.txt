remen. Bomber Command did not have anywhere near a thousand bombers operational in its squadrons; four hundred would have been more accurate. But by mobilizing air- craft and crews from the "rear," chiefly from training units, Harris was able to put into the air the magic number of a thousand bombers. Harris considered the attack on Cologne to be particularly successful. The city received fourteen hundred tons of bombs, about two-thirds of the tonnage being incendiaries. Air-reconnaissance photographs indi- cated six hundred acres razed. On the other hand, the June 1 raid on Essen was a severe disappointment. The night was cloudy and the Ruhr cities were shrouded by a ground haze. The bombers so scattered their loads that the German high command did not even recognize Essen as the objective; it simply reported widespread bombing in west- ern Germany. Weather also interfered with the attack on Bremen on the night of June 25-26. The "thousand" raids received great publicity, although it was of course not widely known that they were a makeshift effort which the RAF could not sustain. (Not until 1944 would Bomber Command again put a thousand planes over a single target.) For Air Marshal Harris they were extremely useful, since they enabled him to experi- ment with his ideas on massive and concentrated bombardment, a technique as yet unused in night operations. At the beginning of the war, both the Luftwaffe and the RAF used the night-bombardment techniques dating from 1918. The bombers were dispatched at inter- vals and arrived over the target either singly or in small detachments, so that a sizable raid could last many hours. This procedure of string- ing out attacks had a dual advantage: it prolonged the period of dan- ger for the enemy population in the target area, robbing people of sleep and wearing them down emotionally, and at the same time, com-  134 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALLIED AIR OFFENSIVE mitting the bombing planes in "penny pa
