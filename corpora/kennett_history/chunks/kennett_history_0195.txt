Harris thought the weaknesses of the system outweighed these advantages. First of all, the enemy's air defense system was presented with a succession of targets, rather like the ducks that pass by in a shooting gallery. The antiaircraft fire could be concentrated on each in turn. But if the bombers came over in great masses, the plethora of targets might overwhelm the defenses, and in any event the danger to each bomber would be reduced. Even more important to Harris's way of thinking was the prospect of overwhelming the civil-defense and fire-fighting teams in the target area. The air marshal felt that the Germans might have accomplished this in London, with catastrophic results for the British capital; instead, the showers of incendiaries spaced throughout the night had started a succession of fires that the efficient London fire brigades extinguished one after the other. But if much of a city could be blanketed with incendiaries so that many fires sprang up at once and if, at the same time, a deadly rain of high explo- sives kept the fire fighters from their task, then the fires might soon escape all control. With this deadly recipe the RAF could gut the cit- ies of the Reich one by one. But as a first step, Bomber Command had to demonstrate that it could achieve what Harris called "the principle of concentration in time and place," that it could form and take over the target masses of aircraft in close succession (what came to be called a "stream" of bombers). The "thousand" raids were the successful culmination of experiments the RAF had been carrying on for months, utilizing moonlit nights to concentrate its bomber formations. Over Cologne, H
