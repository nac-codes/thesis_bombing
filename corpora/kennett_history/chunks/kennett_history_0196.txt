of bombers). The "thousand" raids were the successful culmination of experiments the RAF had been carrying on for months, utilizing moonlit nights to concentrate its bomber formations. Over Cologne, Harris achieved the concentration he had been seeking; the raid, which would normally have lasted seven hours, was cut to two and a half. Despite the concentration, there had been no disastrous colli- sions, especially in the hectic period over the target. What is more, there was every indication that the attack had overwhelmed the ene- my's air defenses not only over the city itself but also on the western frontier of the Reich, with its belt of defenses known as the Kammhuber Line. Harris was ready to accept the loss of a hundred planes on the Cologne raid, but only thirty-nine failed to return. If there was any cause for disappointment over the raid, it was in its lack of destructive punch. The average bombload was under a ton and a 135 half, chiefly because most of the aircraft used were still twin-engine types with modest capacity. By the summer of 1942, then, Air Marshal Harris had the recipe for his bombing offensive. What he still lacked was the means to carry it out. He would need more "heavies," and they were coming off the production lines. He also needed a means to guide them to their tar- gets in any kind of weather, since a few weeks after the "thousand" raids the Germans began jamming Gee transmissions. In August 1942 an elite unit called the Pathfinder Force came into existence, with the task of finding and marking the target for the main force of bombers, which followed it. To aid in this work, British scientists soon had ready two new electronic aids. Oboe was a device that enabled a plane to fly along a radio beam until it reached a predetermined point, and while the principle was similar to that of Gee, Oboe was more accurate-so accurate, in fact, that it could be used for blind bombing. The second aid was H2S, an airborne radar set that could be used
