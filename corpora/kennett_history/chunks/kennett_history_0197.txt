d while the principle was similar to that of Gee, Oboe was more accurate-so accurate, in fact, that it could be used for blind bombing. The second aid was H2S, an airborne radar set that could be used to scan the earth below. Since different types of ground gave back different radio echoes, features such as rivers, coastlines, and built-up areas of cities made "prints" on the cathode tube, enabling the operator to locate the position of his bomber and sometimes that of the target. Oboe became operational in December 1942, and H2S, one month later. By early 1943, Air Marshal Harris had a daily average of five hundred bomb- ers available, the majority of them four-engined craft. "At long last," he wrote in his memoirs, "we were ready and equipped."11 In this new phase of the air offensive against Germany, Bomber Command would not be alone, for on January 27, 1943, B-17 and B- 24 bombers of the American Eighth Air Force penetrated Germany for the first time. It was little more than a token raid-ninety-one bombers were dispatched-but it was remarkable in two respects. The Americans struck in broad daylight, and they came without fighter escort, for their objective, the port city of Wilhelmshaven, was well beyond the operating range of any Allied fighter of the time. And, properly speaking, the Americans had not come to destroy the city itself but a number of precise targets in, and around, it, the foremost being the Marinewerft submarine construction yards. An American contribution to the bombing offensive against Ger- many had figured in prewar thinking and was incorporated with the Rainbow 5 plan, drawn up shortly before Pearl Harbor. Even so, Gen. Hap Arnold, who headed the U.S. Army Air Forces, found it a pain-  136 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALLIED AIR OFFENSIVE fully slow process to create a strategic bombing force in Europe. Unlike the RAF, the service he headed had very clear obligations to assist in the struggle both on land and at sea
