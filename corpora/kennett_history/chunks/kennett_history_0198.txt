LLIED AIR OFFENSIVE fully slow process to create a strategic bombing force in Europe. Unlike the RAF, the service he headed had very clear obligations to assist in the struggle both on land and at sea. Furthermore, the demands of the Pacific theater were intense in the first months of the war. The first contingent of B-17s were poised to cross the Atlantic early in June when an urgent directive sent them off to the West Coast. The Battle of Midway was shaping up and the bombers might be needed. As a result, when Maj. Gen. Carl Spaatz opened head- quarters of the Eighth Air Force on June 18, 1942, he did not have a single bomber in the British Isles. The first B-17 flew in on July 1, but the buildup of Brig. Gen. Ira Eaker's VIII Bomber Command was agonizingly slow, with many planes and crews siphoned off for Oper- ation Torch (the landings in North Africa), planned for November. By the end of the year, the Eighth Air Force had only a hundred heavy bombers operational on its fields in Huntingdonshire and East Anglia. The American bombers carried out their first mission on August 17, when a dozen Flying Fortresses struck the Rouen-Sotteville mar- shaling yards. Bombing accuracy was encouraging, and all the bomb- ers returned without mishap (or nearly so, for two crewmen in one of the B-17s were slightly injured when a pigeon crashed into the nose of their plane). Other missions followed, all of them confined to pre- cision targets in German-occupied France, Belgium, and the Nether- lands: railways, factories, and submarine pens. Although it was true that the bombers employed fighter escort on most of their missions. they did on occasion have sharp clashes with German fighters. The American bombers came off rather well in such encounters; the Flying Fortress, particularly, seemed likely to live up to its name. The more optimistic at Eighth Air Force headquarters felt that once they were available in sufficient numbers, Fortresses and Liberators would be able to venture
