seemed likely to live up to its name. The more optimistic at Eighth Air Force headquarters felt that once they were available in sufficient numbers, Fortresses and Liberators would be able to venture deep into Germany unescorted and return with losses of under 5 percent. General Eaker was confident that his planes could put 40 percent of their bombs within five hundred yards of the aiming point. His colleagues in the RAF were polite but dubious. British bombers still made occasional daytime forays into Germany and invariably showed that the game was not worth the candle. (A day- light raid on a diesel engine factory at Augsburg on April 17, 1942 cost Bomber Command seven of the twelve attacking Lancasters.) The leaders of the RAF were not impressed with the argument that what the American bombers sacrificed in bomb-carrying capacity, 137 they gained in ability to defend themselves; the British had given the early models of the Fortress and the Liberator limited trials and were not greatly impressed by either aircraft. The year 1943 would see the Americans' concept of strategic bombing put to the test and some of the misgivings of their British allies confirmed. The coming battles would work a significant change on the Luft- waffe. Whereas previously the Luftwaffe had been a weapon forged for offensive use, now it had to be set to the task of defending the Reich. Curiously, the initiative often came from below, for the highest leadership in Nazi Germany was slow to admit that defensive mea- sures were needed or even that the Reich was vulnerable to air assaults. Once the air offensive began in earnest, Germany's leaders, especially Hitler, could think of no way to combat it save massive reprisal. In reality, the solution was a straightforward one: the Luft- waffe had to make the enterprise so costly that the Allies would aban- don it; in the case of the British, German air defense systems had only to destroy seven of every one hundred bombers on each raid, for this
