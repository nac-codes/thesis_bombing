make the enterprise so costly that the Allies would aban- don it; in the case of the British, German air defense systems had only to destroy seven of every one hundred bombers on each raid, for this was a rate of loss that Bomber Command knew it could not sustain. Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering had taken control of every aspect of Germany's air defense, and there seems little doubt that it was he who bore chief reponsibility for its ultimate failure. Although the night fighter was to prove the most deadly enemy of the RAF bomber, the Reichsmarschall had proclaimed at the beginning of the war, "Night fighting will never happen."12 The Luftwaffe's prewar experiments with night interceptions had been dropped, but after the war broke out, pilots in several units continued the effort on their own initiative, and in April 1940 a Messerschmitt 110 operating from a field in Denmark made a nighttime interception of a British bomber. Other pilots reported successful contacts, and in July a pilot of Jagd- geschwader II succeeded in bringing down an RAF Whitley. By then the Luftwaffe leadership had become interested again, for in June 1940 it created the first night-fighter unit, Nachtjagdgeschwader I. Gen. Josef Kammhuber took command of night-fighter activities and embarked on a number of tests of both dunkel Jagd, literally "hunting in the dark," and helle Jagd, in which the night fighter found its target with the aid of a searchlight. These experiments led to a defensive belt, the Kammhuber Line. Initially Kammhuber had most success with a helle Jagd system that employed radar, fighters, and searchlights working together, with  138 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALLIED AIR OFFENSIVE a "team" of these covering a Raum, or "box" twenty-seven miles wide and twenty-one deep. Essentially the technique was as follows: a Freya early warning radar set would locate an incoming enemy bomber and "pass" it to a WÃ¼rzburg set, which had less range but greater accu-
