twenty-one deep. Essentially the technique was as follows: a Freya early warning radar set would locate an incoming enemy bomber and "pass" it to a Würzburg set, which had less range but greater accu- racy in fixing location; the Würzburg would guide the searchlight to the enemy aircraft, and then the light would reveal it to the patrolling fighter. By early 1941 there were eighteen of these boxes stretching from Hamburg to Liège, and subsequently, the line was extended by the addition of more boxes. Kammhuber added other improvements, including dunkel Jagd zones on either side of the helle Jagd belt. He experimented with kom- binierte Nachtjagd, using searchlights, night fighters, and antiaircraft guns all at once. This technique was tried over several German cities but was ultimately abandoned because the operators of the search- lights and cannon had difficulty distinguishing enemy craft from their own and sometimes shot down the latter. Another procedure, far more promising, retained the box principle but omitted the lights. The Freya radar still detected the oncoming bomber and passed it to a Würzburg operator; but now a second Würzburg followed the waiting intercep- tor, and with both aircraft represented on a plotting board, a ground controller could guide the fighter to its prey, or very near it. A final link in this radar interception system appeared early in 1942, when German night fighters began to carry telltale "antlers," the projecting antennae of onboard radar sets. With the Lichtenstein set, it was pos- sible for the radar operator in the night fighter to "see" his quarry on the cathode tube. Luckily, this new dunkel Jagd system had proved itself by the spring of 1942, for in May, Hitler ordered the Kammhuber Line stripped of its searchlights; they were moved to German cities, about which the Führer was increasingly concerned. In the aftermath of the Lübeck raid, he was chiefly anxious about historic towns such as Wei- mar and Nuremberg. "Factories c
