moved to German cities, about which the Führer was increasingly concerned. In the aftermath of the Lübeck raid, he was chiefly anxious about historic towns such as Wei- mar and Nuremberg. "Factories can be rebuilt," he told his entou- rage, "but works of art are irreplaceable."13 He spoke of giving every German village its own battery and searchlight detachment; blinded by a continuous sea of lights, the British pilots would not be able to see anything. Besides being ambitious in the extreme, Hitler's incli- nation to defend everything would thwart the development of Kammhuber's plans. The cities of the Reich were not to be denied; Berlin saw its complement of antiaircraft batteries doubled after the 139 RAF raids in the late summer and fall of 1940; by early 1941 it had its own line of boxes defending its western approaches. The gauleiters clamored for more protection for other towns, often with success. Hitler also intervened to put an end to a promising development in night-fighter tactics pioneered by the pilots of Nachtjagdgeschwader II. The aircraft used for night interceptor work were two-engined craft such as the Messerschmitt 110 and the Junkers 88, chosen initially because their greater endurance allowed more time to stalk an enemy than would be the case with the single-engined Messerschmitt 109. The considerable range of the Junkers 88 and the Dornier 17, which was also used for night operations, led some pilots to undertake what was called Fernnachtjagd-attacking the enemy bombers where they were most vulnerable, over England. It was an easy matter to locate the enemy bombers by their radio traffic as they formed for the out- bound flight or to follow them back and attack as they glided toward the haven of their home bases. In October 1941, Hitler ordered an end to Fernnachtjagd sorties. The kills made over England could not be verified; the planes that defended the Reich should do so in their own airspace, where their efforts could be seen and appreciat
