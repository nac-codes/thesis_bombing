end to Fernnachtjagd sorties. The kills made over England could not be verified; the planes that defended the Reich should do so in their own airspace, where their efforts could be seen and appreciated. Despite the Führer's order some night fighting of this sort continued, but it soon became the specialty of RAF Mosquitoes, whose "intruder" operations made them a menace around German air bases. The second major element in the German air-defense system was the Flakartillerie, with its batteries of guns and searchlights. In 1935 this service left the control of the German Army and became a part of the Luftwaffe, and it is quite probable that the transfer ultimately robbed the service of much of its potential. In order to head off a movement by the army to supply its own antiaircraft defenses in the field, Goering motorized a part of the Flakartillerie and sent it off to accompany the army of the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1939-41. These units, quickly grouped into two Flak Corps, won a good deal of praise for their participation in the land battles as well as for their success against enemy aircraft. But the elements that remained at home for air defense of the Reich had little chance to distinguish themselves in those first years of the war, when the RAF's attacks were no more than pinpricks. According to their historian, these units suffered from an "inferiority complex."14 Their morale was not improved by the scoldings they received from Goering when British bombers began to roam the night skies of Germany almost at will. The Reichsmarschall  140 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALLIED AIR OFFENSIVE 141 found the same shortcomings in his flak forces that he would later find in his fighter units: the failures were in the men, rather than in the matériel. At the start of war Germany possessed an antiaircraft artillery that compared favorably with that of any other belligerent. In the summer of 1939, the Flakartillerie numbered slightly over 100,000
