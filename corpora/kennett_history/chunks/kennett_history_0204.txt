l. At the start of war Germany possessed an antiaircraft artillery that compared favorably with that of any other belligerent. In the summer of 1939, the Flakartillerie numbered slightly over 100,000 officers and men, an important percentage of the 373,000 total in all branches of the Luftwaffe. The service possessed about 650 heavy flak batteries. the kind chiefly used in the air defense of the Reich. The cannon in use was the efficient 88mm, a 1918 design improved in 1936 and 1937 Its chief limitation was its range, the fire being effective to a height of about twenty thousand feet. This was considered quite adequate in 1939, for the early generation of British Wellingtons, Whitleys, and Hampdens bombed from altitudes that kept them well within range. But as the war progressed, bombing altitudes tended to increase; the B-17, for example, was designed for operations at 25,000 feet and could be taken to nearly 40,000. The Flakartillerie found an answer in the 88mm model 1941 cannon, a weapon of phenomenal ballistic qualities. Unfortunately, the new cannon required about a thousand more pounds of steel than the older model, and for reasons of economy its production was blocked until the spring of 1944. The Flakartillerie's mat√©riel needs never seem to have enjoyed high priority. Often equipment destined for it was siphoned off by the army and navy, which resolved to build their own flak defenses. At the end of 1941, the Flakartillerie decided on a heavier, 128mm gun, hoping to base it on a gun of that bore used by the German Navy; but the navy would give no help, so the Luftwaffe had to do its own research and development. As a result, by May 1944 there were only twenty- four of the 128mm units in operation. An even heavier gun, of 150mm bore, was under development by Krupp in 1939. The work was sus- pended on orders from above; the Flakartillerie did not get permission to pursue the project again until 1944, too late for the gun to see service. The most critical pro
