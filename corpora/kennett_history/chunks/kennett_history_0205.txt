upp in 1939. The work was sus- pended on orders from above; the Flakartillerie did not get permission to pursue the project again until 1944, too late for the gun to see service. The most critical problem German ground defenses faced in the first years of the war was achieving accurate fire at night. The Kom- mandogerät, or "predictor," used by the heavy batteries relied chiefly on visual contact with the target, therefore on the ability of the search- lights to find and hold an enemy aircraft at night-not always an easy task. The ideal solution was to link the fire-control system to a radar set, a scheme the Telefunken Company was working on in 1939. But the first available radar sets, the Würzburgs, were routed to other uses, on the grounds that they were not sufficiently accurate for gun- laying. Yet, when improved radar more suitable to this purpose appeared, it too was allocated to competing services. Ultimately, the heavy flak batteries got updated Würzburg radar equipment, but even this was slow in coming. By the end of 1941, a great many heavy-flak batteries lacked any kind of electronic fire-control system for night work. By the beginning of 1943, German flak units were in a considerably better state, and so for that matter was the whole air-defense system, all of which was under the command of a Luftwaffe general carrying the title Luftwaffebefehlshaber Mitte. The flak units would help defend the cities both day and night. The Kammhuber Line offered a formidable obstacle to the night intrusions of the RAF. Finally, there was the threat of heavy daylight raids from the Americans, although at the end of 1942, this danger was no more than a cloud on the hori- zon. Most of the Luftwaffe's day-fighter units were on the fighting fronts; as late as 1941 there were only two hundred day fighters cov- ering the Reich frontier from Denmark to eastern France. These improvements in Germany's air defenses had not gone unde- tected by Allied intelligence, but in London t
