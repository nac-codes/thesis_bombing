These improvements in Germany's air defenses had not gone unde- tected by Allied intelligence, but in London the view prevailed that the tide had begun to swing in favor of Allied forces, bringing an all- out bombing offensive close to reality. The British chiefs of staff said as much in a report dated the very last day of 1942: "We have gained a lead in quality over the German defenses, and we do not believe that they will be able to develop countermeasures sufficient to offset our advantage."15 The chiefs of staff went on to prescribe day and night attacks on Germany, which would have as their goal "the progressive destruction and dislocation of the enemy's war industrial and eco- nomic system, and the undermining of his morale to a point where his capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened."16 This phrase reappeared virtually without alteration in the Casablanca Directive, approved by Churchill, Roosevelt, and their respective chiefs of staff early in 1943. The RAF and the U.S. Army Air Forces had their orders for a strategic-bombing offensive of unparalleled scope and intensity.  142 THE BATTLE OF GERMANY CHAPTER 9 THE BATTLE OF GERMANY ON THE EVENING OF MARCH 5, 1943, thirty aircraft from Bomber Com- mand's Pathfinder Force took off for Germany, followed by a main force of 442 bombers. Their destination was Essen and it d its vast Krupp works, the most important manufacturing complex in the Ruhr. A full year had elapsed since Air Marshal Harris ordered his first, disap- pointing strike at Essen; now he expected far better results. For one thing, he had available an average striking force of between seven and eight hundred bombers; and to guide them he had a new electronic device known as Oboe. This navigation and blind-bombing method relied on impulses sent by radar-equipped transmitters in an aircraft and at two ground locations in England; the radar sets permitted
