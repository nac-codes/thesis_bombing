ic device known as Oboe. This navigation and blind-bombing method relied on impulses sent by radar-equipped transmitters in an aircraft and at two ground locations in England; the radar sets permitted extremely accurate measurements of the aircraft's position and bomb- release point, limited only by the fact that the impulses did not follow the earth's curvature and so could be used only to a range of about 250 miles for bombers flying at twenty-eight thousand feet. Most of the Ruhr fell within easy reach, although targets like Berlin were far out of Oboe's range. The raid on Essen on the night of March 5-6, 1943, met Harris's highest expectations. The Oboe-guided Mosquitoes placed their red marker bombs precisely, providing an aiming point in the center of Essen for the craft that followed. Photographs taken during and after the raid showed heavy damage to the center of the city and to the Krupp works in central Essen. What is more, losses were very light on 143 the raid, with only fourteen bombers failing to return. The mission against Essen was part of a bombing effort that continued until July 1943 and is frequently referred to as the Battle of the Ruhr. In those five months Bomber Command staged forty-three major raids, and while the Ruhr cities were frequent targets, the night bombers also struck Berlin, Munich, and Nuremberg. All of the raids were not as well executed as the first attack on Essen, nor did the bomber force always escape so lightly. Still, the offensive seemed to be producing impressive results. No one knew this so well as Adolf Hitler. After the first Essen raid, he had an angry scene with Goering; the Reichsmarschall was not at hand when Hitler learned of the Nuremberg raid a few nights later, so the FÃ¼hrer had the Luftwaffe's Gen. Karl Bodenschatz pulled from his bed and gave the hapless general an early morning lecture on air power. That same March, Hitler confided to Goebbels that it was the air war that was keeping him up at night. Goebbe
