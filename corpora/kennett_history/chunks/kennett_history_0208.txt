tz pulled from his bed and gave the hapless general an early morning lecture on air power. That same March, Hitler confided to Goebbels that it was the air war that was keeping him up at night. Goebbels was able to see for himself the impact of the new bombing offensive when he visited Essen shortly after the third big raid, which occurred on April 3. He was appalled at the extent of the destruction. He noted in his diary, "Now at last I have a real picture of what English air warfare means."1 Hitler and Goebbels agreed that the only proper response was a savage reprisal on the cities of Britain, particularly on the "pluto- cratic" quarters of London. Unfortunately, the Luftwaffe was not then capable of delivering the retribution the Führer wanted, and for that he held Goering chiefly responsible. But Hitler also railed against Marshal Hugo Sperrle, who, he claimed, had grown sybaritic in the easy life in occupied France, while the pilots of his Luftflotte III had forgotten the way to London.2 Although the Führer breathed fire and vengeance and would talk only of Vergeltungswaffen, or "reprisal weapons," the renewed bomb- ing offensive obliged Germany's leaders to look to their air defenses and to take further civil-defense measures. General Kammhuber tried to adjust his defensive line to the concentrated bomber streams now coming over the Reich and experimented with a system in which a single controller on the ground could direct several intercepting night fighters. In the summer of 1943, a Luftwaffe pilot named Hajo Her- mann developed a new night-fighting technique known as the wilde  144 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BATTLE OF GERMANY 145 Sau, or "wild boar" method. This involved the use of high-flying sin- gle-engined fighters whose pilots would try to spot enemy bombers sil- houetted against the glow of searchlights or fires burning in the target area. That same summer the Luftwaffe high command ordered the withdrawal of fighter units from the various fro
