That same summer the Luftwaffe high command ordered the withdrawal of fighter units from the various fronts and occupied coun- tries-two Jagdgeschwader from the eastern front, one from France and parts of several Geschwader from Italy. The units were rapidly integrated into the air defense system. Flak units also multiplied in 1943 and now used radar both for gunlaying and for directing searchlights. There were not enough heavy flak guns for the units now being created, so they used captured weap- ons, including sizable numbers of Russian and Czech models. Begin- ning in 1943, the flak units began to draw on the Reich Labor Service for personnel; over a hundred thousand women worked in the antiair craft batteries, where they were joined by Hitler Youth, Croatian and Italian laborers, and Russian prisoners of war. Goering joked that his flak units were like the League of Nations, while Goebbels worried about "miscegenation" in the batteries. The German civil-defense system had already been shaken out of its complacency in 1942, following the raids on Lübeck, Rostock, and Cologne. (The German press gave considerable coverage to the raid as Terrorangriffe, or "terror attacks," but carefully avoided indicating the loss of life or the extent of the destruction.) The distinct danger that fire seemed to present was now recognized, and there was a shake-up in the Amtsgruppe Feuerwehr, the office in the German Air Ministry concerned with fire fighting.
