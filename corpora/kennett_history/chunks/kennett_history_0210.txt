The new cycle of raids was an obvious incentive, but if the inhabitants of Germany's cities needed any further reminder, it was supplied in the leaflets that Air Marshal Harris was having dropped. After the RAF visited Frankfurt one night in 1943, the city's inhabi- tants found the streets littered with a message from the head of Bomber Command: "Adolf Hitler has led you into this hurricane What you experienced this past night was like the first raindrops which announce a coming storm. For the moment they are light, but they will beat down upon you ever more heavily and more destruc- tively until you can no longer resist the hurricane's force. Take heed!"3 In another of his leaflet messages, Harris told the German people that shortly the bombing offensive would be intensified by the arrival of the Americans. He described for them the vast Ford works at Wil- low Run, where every two hours the workers completed a new bomber that could deliver four tons of explosives to any city in Germany. "Soon," he promised, "we will be coming every day and every night, through rain or storm or snow-we and the Americans."4 This particular threat was some time in materializing, for the buildup of the American bombing force proceeded with painful slow- ness during the spring of 1943. Much was still being diverted to the North African theater of operations, and even when bombers began to arrive in sizable numbers, the ground crews that were to maintain them were held up by a shortage of ocean transport.
