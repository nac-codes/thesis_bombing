suffi- ciently large formations. They needed a base force of about seven hundred bombers and a raiding force of three hundred in order to give their theory a fair chance. Until they had sufficient planes and crews, they could only conduct probing experimental attacks, "nibbling the edges" of the Reich. Several of these experimental raids in the spring of 1943 seemed to confirm the view that small forces of American bombers were vulnerable to German fighters. An attack on Hamm in March led to the loss of four of the fourteen Fortresses that partici- pated; a bombing mission against the Focke-Wulf factory in Bremen by 115 American bombers cost the attackers 1 plane in 10. The Combined Bomber Offensive, prescribed at Casablanca, did not officially get under way until mid-1943, with the issuance of the "Pointblank" directive of June 10, which was to guide the operations of the two bombing fleets. Since the American offensive was based on the precision-bombing principle, the directive listed in order of priority specific target groups, beginning with aircraft production facilities, then the ball-bearing industry, then petroleum installations, and so forth. These were of course many of the same panacea targets that the RAF had considered three years previously. Not surprisingly, the RAF's commitment to the Pointblank program was only limited. While the U.S. Army Air Forces would go after specific industrial objectives by day, Bomber Command would attack the cities "asso- ciated" with those objectives by night; but the British were to hit the Pointblank target categories only "as far as practicable." In fact, Air  146 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BATTLE OF GERMANY Marshal Harris retained a rather free hand over his operations. The associated cities were in most cases targeted for destruction anyway. and both air forces were in agreement that the German fighter was their most dangerous enemy and deserved high priority. So, through a concurrence of interests rather th
