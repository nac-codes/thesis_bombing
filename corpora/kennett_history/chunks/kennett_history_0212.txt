rgeted for destruction anyway. and both air forces were in agreement that the German fighter was their most dangerous enemy and deserved high priority. So, through a concurrence of interests rather than a closely integrated campaign, the Combined Bombing Offensive began in mid-1943. The most spectacular raids of that summer were without question those directed at the city of Hamburg; the attacks were known collec- tively as the Battle of Hamburg. Air Marshal Harris had targeted the city as early as May, when he estimated it would take 10,000 tons of bombs to destroy it (and that was the word he used). He planned to deliver this tonnage in several successive raids, and to improve the chances for success, he timed the raid to coincide with the first use of "Window," strips of paper ten and a half inches long, coated with aluminum. Discharged into the air in large quantities, these strips would effectively cloud or jam the WÃ¼rzburg radar that the Germans were using both for gunlaying and for directing their night fighters. (The British had held back the use of this particular jamming tech- nique for fear the Germans would use it in turn and wreck their own radar detection system; only in July 1943 did the government agree to its use.) Bomber Command's first raid took place on the night of July 24- 25; the bombing force was composed of 791 planes, all but 73 of them four-engined bombers. The Pathfinders put down their markers not far from the aiming point, the center of the city. The main force sowed a path of destruction across the northwest section of Hamburg. The raid was heavy but hardly crushing, akin to the strikes already made against the Ruhr cities. Some of the fires had not been extinguished two days later, and perhaps fifteen hundred inhabitants lost their lives. Among the casualties was the house in which Johannes Brahms com- posed his "Lullaby" and the municipal zoo. (The bombing liberated a number of monkeys, which took to the city's trees.) As the British
