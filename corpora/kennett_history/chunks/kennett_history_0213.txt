Among the casualties was the house in which Johannes Brahms com- posed his "Lullaby" and the municipal zoo. (The bombing liberated a number of monkeys, which took to the city's trees.) As the British anticipated, the German air-defense system had been hopelessly con- fused by the use of Window. Few night fighters appeared and ground fire was very inaccurate; searchlights probed the skies in vain. Only twelve British bombers failed to return. On the twenty-fifth and again on the twenty-sixth, American B-17s made daytime appearances. Their participation in the Battle of Ham- burg was modest and so were their accomplishments. Only 252 Amer- ican bombers attacked the city. They were after precision targets: a 147 submarine yard and an aircraft engine factory. Both objectives were either obscure or completely hidden by smoke, part of it generated for that purpose by the Germans, but much of it coming from fires ignited by the British raid. The Americans bombed as best they could and scored some hits, but the tonnage dropped was small and the damage soon made good. (The American bombardments accounted for only about 1 percent of the casualties Hamburg suffered during the battle.) The Anglo-American cooperation over Hamburg would be much touted in the Allied press, but for the U.S. Army Air Forces, it was a far from satisfying experience. On the night of July 27-28 the RAF struck Hamburg again in what was to be one of the most memorable actions of the war. This time the bomber stream contained 787 bombers with an increased weight of incendiaries, some twelve hundred tons of them. They were preceded by Pathfinders that put down clear, well-grouped marker bombs, but about two miles east of their aiming point, the city center. The main force bombed on the markers with unusual concentration, with the result that veritable showers of four-pound incendiaries clat- tered down on the eastern section of Hamburg, most of it heavily built- up residential areas with buildings five or
