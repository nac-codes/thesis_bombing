r. On July 25, a few hours after the first attack on Hamburg, Benito Mussolini fell dramatically from power and became a prisoner of the new gov- ernment of Pietro Badoglio. When Hitler greeted Badoglio's emissary on July 30 he told him straightaway of the recent bombings of Ham- burg and the Ruhr and then added characteristically, "The day will come, maybe three hundred years from now, when we will be able to avenge ourselves."5 Italy offered an interesting interlude in the bombing war during that summer of 1943. The political crisis there threatened to expose the whole southern flank of Hitler's Europe, and the Allies, of course, did what they could to bring about Italy's defection from the Axis. Winston Churchill had believed from the outset that Fascist Italy was the weak link in the Axis, and in the perilous summer of 1940 he had sent RAF bombers to harass Italian cities. In the fall of 1942, the British bombers hit Turin and Milan several times. The Alps proved to be the chief obstacle the raiders encountered, for Italian air defenses were far weaker than those in Germany. Mussolini had asked Hitler for flak guns as soon as Italy entered the war, and although some help was forthcoming, in 1942, the Duce could do little more than call the British "brutes, barbarians."6 Churchill was as much encouraged by the raids as the Duce was discomfited. In December 1942 he decided that "the heat should be turned on Italy,"1 and instructions to that effect went to Bomber Command. The cities of the industrial north were clearly the most promising targets; hence, in February 1943 the RAF struck Turin, Milan, and the Italian naval base at La Spezia. As the authors of the official Strategic Air Offensive acknowledge, "the Italian diversion did not amount to much."8 Air Marshal Harris was husbanding his forces for the coming Battle of the Ruhr; unenthusiastic about any operations that kept his bombers from their proper work in Germany, Harris made only a minimal commitment: fou
