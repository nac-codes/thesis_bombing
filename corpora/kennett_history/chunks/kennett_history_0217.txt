ris was husbanding his forces for the coming Battle of the Ruhr; unenthusiastic about any operations that kept his bombers from their proper work in Germany, Harris made only a minimal commitment: four separate attacks in 1942, with 336 sorties in all. Within a few months, the buildup of Allied air power in the Med- iterranean presented a new opportunity to "turn on the heat." Part of the buildup was the creation of the Northwest African Strategic Air Force (NASAF). NASAF bombers performed a notable feat in reducing Pantelleria, a 47-square-mile island that stood between the Allies in Tunisia and their next major target, Sicily. From May 14 to June 10, Allied bombers pounded Pantelleria with 6,200 tons of bombs, with such effect that the island's garrison surrendered before the invasion forces could get ashore. As early as April, American bombers had begun to hit targets on the Italian mainland, chiefly air bases in the southern half of the peninsula. Rome was within reach and an increasingly inviting target. The British were much in favor of bombing it, and the Americans less so, perhaps because Franklin Delano Roosevelt had sizable Catholic and Italian constituencies, while Winston Churchill had neither. In any event, the official histo- rians of the Army Air Forces make it obvious that bombing Rome was an action fraught with political risks, including the possibility of unfavorable reaction from the Roman Catholic Church, as well as from many artists, architects, historians, and others throughout the  150 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BATTLE OF GERMANY world. Yet on the edge of the Eternal City were legitimate military targets, two of which were very tempting: the Littorio and San Lor- enzo marshaling yards, which handled almost all of Italy's north- south railway traffic. Moreover there was the possibility of a great dividend in demoralization of the enemy; the Allies hoped an attack "might even drive a strong wedge between Mussolini and the bulk of the Ita
