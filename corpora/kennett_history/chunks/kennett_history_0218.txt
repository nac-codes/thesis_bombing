ay traffic. Moreover there was the possibility of a great dividend in demoralization of the enemy; the Allies hoped an attack "might even drive a strong wedge between Mussolini and the bulk of the Italian people."9 If the attack were to be carried out, the Americans could cut the risks with a precision daylight raid that would restrict the damage to legitimate targets and at the same time emphatically demonstrate Allied air might to all of Rome. By the second half of July, the Amer- ican bombing forces were no longer needed for the conquest of Sicily which was proceeding apace. Consequently, on July 19 a force of more than five hundred planes attacked objectives on the outskirts of Rome chiefly rail yards and airfields. The attack had been meticulously planned and executed, and when the Allied command issued its ver- sion of the attack, it could claim that damage to nonmilitary targets was minimal. (Some seven hundred Italians were killed in the raid, and another fifteen hundred were wounded; the Church of San Lor- enzo, which was in the middle of the target area, was heavily damaged.) The attack probably did deliver a shock to the inhabitants of Italy's capital. Most of them believed with the king of Italy that "the Pope is our best antiaircraft battery"10 and that the city's religious and cul- tural role would ensure its being spared from air attacks, as in the previous war. Pope Pius XII protested and sought to get Rome declared an open, demilitarized city, but the only other strong objec- tions to reach Washington came from Spanish bishops. Six days after the bombing of Rome, Mussolini fell from power. The Allies began long and tedious negotiations with the new Italian regime, which, find- ing itself between the hammer and the anvil, was at the same time trying to propitiate Hitler. The Allies were torn between giving the new government a breathing space and trying to push it into an armi- stice by bombing its cities. A second raid on Rome was planned for August
