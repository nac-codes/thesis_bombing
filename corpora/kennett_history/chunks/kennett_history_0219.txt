ropitiate Hitler. The Allies were torn between giving the new government a breathing space and trying to push it into an armi- stice by bombing its cities. A second raid on Rome was planned for August 4, but it was canceled on orders from Gen. George Marshall President Roosevelt was still troubled over bombing the city and inclined to accept the papal idea of declaring the city "open." Churchill was opposed, and it was no doubt on his urging that the American bombers returned to Rome on August 13, hitting rail tar- 151 gets and airfields, demolishing one church, and badly damaging another. Pope Pius went immediately to comfort the latest victims and returned to the Vatican with his cassock stained with their blood. The following day the Italian government proclaimed Rome an open and undefended city, whereupon a British spokesman announced the dec- laration was not binding on the Allies. But when the American planes flew over Rome again on August 20, they dropped only leaflets. Since the Badoglio government seemed to be dragging its feet in armistice negotiations, the British war cabinet was inclined to increase the pressure, or to use the expression of Harold Macmillan, "turn on the rough stuff."11 This could be done by Bomber Command, fresh from its triumph over Hamburg. On August 8, 13, 15, and 16, RAF bombers carried out night attacks on Milan, and on August 8, 13, and 15 they struck Turin. Milan was particularly hard hit, receiving 2,600 tons of bombs, including 380,000 incendiaries. There was no fire storm as at Hamburg, but damage was extensive. After the August raids, 60 percent of the buildings in Milan had to be repaired or totally rebuilt. The loss of life was heavy, with a thousand people killed in the heavy attack of August 13. The inhabitants of Italy's northern industrial cities could not understand why they were being attacked: "Mussolini is no longer here, we've torn up our party cards, we're throwing away our badges, so why are we being bombed?"12 M
