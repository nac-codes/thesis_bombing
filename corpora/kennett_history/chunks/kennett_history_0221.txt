m. In truth, they prob- ably did no more than exacerbate preexisting problems, so that in the political and diplomatic climate of 1943 they were more catalyst than cause. At the time, however, this was not clear, and it was easy to see in the bomber a very useful instrument for "turning on the heat." This was probably a consideration when the Combined Chiefs of Staff sent Allied bombers to attack Sofia in November 1943, but the Bulgarians did not sign an armistice until eleven months later. It was just as well that the Allied strategic-bombing forces claimed a share of the credit in Italy, for in the second half of 1943 their offen- sive against Germany reached something of a impasse. First of all they were making no apparent headway in the primary goal of the Point- blank directive, which was to reduce the strength of the German air force. Bomber Command was devoting only part of its energies to this effort. (Neither the spectacular raids against Hamburg nor the Battle of Berlin later in the year contributed very much to weakening the Luftwaffe.) The American air force, which adhered to the directive much more rigorously, was not having an easy time of it. Precision raids on aircraft factories were limited by periods of bad weather and by the fact that many of the more important installations were deep inside Germany. To help the Eighth Air Force in this work on distant targets, the American high command mobilized its air resources in the Mediterranean; but the Fifteenth Air Force, based in Italy, did not come into existence until November 1943; before then, U.S. bombers from the Mediterranean had made only a few tentative strikes at air- craft plants in southeastern Germany and Austria. It was not simply that the targets were a long way off; the skies in which the Fortresses and Liberators had to fly were becoming increas- ingly dangerous. The German day-fighter forces were growing in numbers and perfecting their tactics. The deeper the penetration the American bo
