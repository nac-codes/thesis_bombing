tresses and Liberators had to fly were becoming increas- ingly dangerous. The German day-fighter forces were growing in numbers and perfecting their tactics. The deeper the penetration the American bombers carried out, the more they exposed themselves to danger. 153 Even before midsummer there were some doubts in the American camp that heavy bombers could successfully defend themselves and battle their way to a distant target without prohibitive losses, and events in July and August showed that these fears were only too well grounded. On July 28, thirty-nine B-17s attacked an aircraft factory at Oschersleben, ninety miles south of Berlin; fifteen of them did not come back. Four days later, a force of 147 Liberators flew from North African bases to the Rumanian oil refinery at Ploesti, where they made a low-line attack into heavy antiaircraft fire; 54 Liberators failed to return. Then, on August 17, 376 B-17s left England to hit two separate targets, both of them deep inside the Reich: the ball- bearing facilities at Schweinfurt and the Messerschmitt factory at Regensburg. The air battles over Germany were particularly severe that day. Some sixty Fortresses went down, a loss of 16 percent of the attacking force. For the next five weeks the American bombers struck targets nearer at hand; then, in the week from October 9 to October 14- "Black Week," as it came to be known-the Eighth Air Force made four deep penetrations of German airspace. The last mission of the four, that against Schweinfurt, was something of a milestone. A total of 291 B-17s headed for Schweinfurt in two groups, the Allied fighter escort turned back over Aachen, and from that point on, the bombers were continuously assailed by waves of German fighters, as aggressive as they were numerous. They made attacks with rockets and explosive cannon shells and attempted to bomb the Fortresses. The American bombers made it doggedly to their target and placed their bombs accurately-but they paid a staggering co
