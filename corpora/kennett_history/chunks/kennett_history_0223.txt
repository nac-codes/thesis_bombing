cks with rockets and explosive cannon shells and attempted to bomb the Fortresses. The American bombers made it doggedly to their target and placed their bombs accurately-but they paid a staggering cost. Sixty Fortresses, or one bomber in five, fell to German fighters and flak. The toll for the four missions of Black Week was more staggering still: 148 Fortresses lost. For the rest of the year, the Eighth Air Force made no more such raids into the Reich. The official historians of the U.S. Army Air Forces acknowledged that after the Schweinfurt raid "the Eighth Air Force had for the time being lost air superiority over Germany."14 In a word, Pointblank's objective was not achieved. German air defenses seemed if anything stronger at the beginning of 1944 than they had been twelve months before: some sixteen hundred fighters of all types guarded Germany and the western front, five hundred more than were available in early 1943. This was partly because the Ger- man fighters in the air were able to protect those still on the assembly  154 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BATTLE OF GERMANY lines, and whatever damage was done to the German aircraft industry was soon set aright. Under the skilled direction of Albert Speer, Ger- man fighter production continued to increase well into 1944. The failure to destroy the German fighter force caused considerable concern to the Allied planners, who were now preparing Operation Overlord, the cross-Channel invasion of France. It was also disturbing to the leaders of the RAF, whose night-bombing missions into Ger- many were turning up evidence of a renaissance in the German night- fighter force. The Luftwaffe's air-defense system recovered rapidly from the confusion created by Window, and the rigid Kammhuber Line gave way increasingly to a new method in which ground con- trollers directed swarms of night fighters to the bomber stream; at the same time, improved airborne radar gave the fighter a better chance of finding its quarry.
