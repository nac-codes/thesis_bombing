o a new method in which ground con- trollers directed swarms of night fighters to the bomber stream; at the same time, improved airborne radar gave the fighter a better chance of finding its quarry. As the German night fighters improved, Bomber Command's losses began to rise. For the last quarter of 1943 they crept over the 5 percent mark; in three raids on Berlin in late August and early September the rate rose to 7 percent. The attacks on the German capital were in fact the opening rounds of the Battle of Berlin, for Air Marshal Harris had chosen the city for his next major effort. The battle got under way in earnest in Novem- ber, and by the end of the year, the city had received 14,000 tons of bombs. The campaign against Berlin continued until March 1944. with sixteen major assaults over a four-month period. At the outset, Harris was very optimistic. "We can wreck Berlin from end to end," he told Churchill, "if the U.S.A.A.F. will come in to it. It will cost us 400-500 aircraft. It will cost Germany the war."15 The damage done to Berlin was certainly great. Goebbels, who saw it at firsthand, was much worried. "Issue no denials of the English claim to have killed a million in Berlin," he instructed officials in the Propaganda Ministry. "The sooner the English believe there's no life in Berlin, the better for us."16 Yet the attacks on Berlin produced none of the spectacular results seen in Hamburg. The city was more modern and more open in its construction. Although the raid of November 22-23 produced serious conflagrations, there was no fire storm. Moreover, the British bom- bardiers found it hard to place their bombloads where they wanted them. Berlin was far beyond Oboe range and often so obscured by clouds that H2S radar had to be used; unfortunately for the British, the various features of the city did not show up well on the radar tube. Moreover, the air defenses of Berlin were particularly well developed. 155 Goebbels had overall charge of the system and su
