sh, the various features of the city did not show up well on the radar tube. Moreover, the air defenses of Berlin were particularly well developed. 155 Goebbels had overall charge of the system and sufficient authority to commandeer what he needed for the city's defense, including mobile flak units, the fire brigades of other cities, and night-fighter forces from as far away as France and Denmark. Furthermore, Berlin was at the other end of the Reich; in reaching it, British bombers ran a long and deadly gauntlet that contributed much to their general loss rate of 5 percent. The final attack of the campaign, which took place on the night of March 23-24, 1944, cost over 9 percent. Air Marshal Harris acknowledged that when compared to the Hamburg raids, the Battle of Berlin "did not appear to be an overwhelming success."17 Other writers do not hesitate to call the bombing effort of late 1943 and early 1944 against Berlin and other cities a clear defeat. With the coming of 1944, the Allied strategic air forces began a new bombing program in preparation for the Normandy invasion; the demands of Overlord began to supersede those of Pointblank, and in April the strategic-bombing forces passed under the control of Gen. Dwight Eisenhower. Many of the targets were in German-occupied western Europe, particularly in France; attacking them inevitably car- ried the risk of injury or death to populations the Allies were pledged to liberate, and when the bombing intensified in the late spring of 1944, it produced something of a crisis in the Allied camp. The British had faced the issue early in 1942, deciding that area attacks would not be used in France except on the French Atlantic ports, where German battleships and submarine pens were priority targets. Bomber Command wrecked both Lorient and Saint-Nazaire so thoroughly that Admiral Karl Doenitz reported, "No dog or cat is left in these towns. Nothing but the submarine shelters remain."18 The Royal Navy wanted Air Marshal Harri
