The area around the rail complex was still thickly popu- lated, and a number of bombs went into residential quarters, produc- ing over a hundred casualties and the first ripples of protest. During 1943 the problem came up again, with the Americans most often the subjects of complaints and protests from both the French resistance and the French government in exile. The problem may have come in part from Allied propaganda, which pictured American bombing accuracy as far greater than it really was. Sometimes the Americans were just unlucky.
