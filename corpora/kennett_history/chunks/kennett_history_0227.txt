a ball-bearing works in Annecy in November, planes from the Fifteenth Air Force in Italy overshot the target, and their bombs fell into the town, where, the resistance reported, they did terrible damage. The French were not the only victims. An American raid on Antwerp in April produced sizable civilian casualties and a protest from the Belgian ambassador in Washington. The Germans saw immediately the propaganda value of the incident. They accorded a public funeral to the victims, and Goebbels hoped the Allies would bomb other cities, thus giving him more grist for his propaganda mill. This was inevitably what happened in April, May, and June of 1944 as British and American bombers struck at rail and industrial targets in France.

Marshal Henri Philippe PÃ©tain visited the capital at the end of the month to commiserate with its inhabitants, the trip being facilitated by the Ger- man authorities. The British war cabinet monitored the situation care- fully. Churchill wrote Roosevelt early in May that the cabinet was "very much concerned." Earlier studies had shown that the bombing operations might result in eighty thousand casualties to French civil- ians, including twenty thousand dead. Now Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder was saying that "about 10,000 killed, apart from wounded, will probably do the job."19 The protests continued to mount, chiefly on the grounds that the attacks were haphazard and that those who ordered them and carried them out were indifferent to the fate of the population. A telegram from a French official one day after D Day summed up the feeling: "The population understands the necessity of bombing military and industrial objectives and accepts the risks, but it is showing serious discontent over attacks which seem unjustified and carried out almost by chance."20 Within France, resistance leaders were saying that they could destroy the obj
