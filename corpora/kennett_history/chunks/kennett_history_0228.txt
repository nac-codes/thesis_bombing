There was even some feeling that the resistance should stop furnishing information on prospective targets. Beyond that, Churchill feared the bombing might alienate the French people and have serious political consequences after the war. But the bombing continued, for "the logic of military necessity in a total war proved unanswerable."21 Once the actual liberation of France began, the level of protests seems to have declined; in any event, by September the Allied strategic-bombing forces were once again training their sights on Germany. A return to full-scale air assaults on the Reich meant renewed reck- oning with the day- and night-fighter forces of the Luftwaffe, which seemed to grow in strength despite all Allied efforts to reduce them. Even after "Big Week," an intensive bombing effort in February 1944 that put ten thousand tons of bombs into German aircraft production facilities, the Messerschmitts and Focke-Wulfs seemed more numer- ous and more aggressive than ever. In April, Air Marshal Harris framed a request for night fighters to help protect his squadrons over Germany. Yet the scales in the air war over the Reich were about to tilt in favor of the Allies, and this time they would hold the advantage to the end of the war.
