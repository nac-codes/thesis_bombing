equipped with auxiliary gas tanks. As Anthony Verrier has written, "the humble drop-tank saved the day."22 In March 1944 the first Mustangs appeared over Berlin, showing that they could provide a greater measure of security for Allied bombing missions into the farthest corners of Germany. But there were other developments, among them the growing disproportion of forces as the Allies, and especially the Americans, drew upon seemingly endless resources. By June 1944, Bomber Command had a thousand "heavies" in its squad- rons. The Eighth Air Force had two thousand and two crews for each bomber. The U.S. Fifteenth Air Force, which became operational late in 1943 at Foggia, Italy, had twelve hundred heavy bombers, and by the end of 1944, it too had the luxury of two crews for each plane.  THE BATTLE OF GERMANY 158 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING With a total force of over four thousand heavy bombers, it was pos- sible to mount raids in endless varieties and combinations, to pummel Germany in several places at once. Then there were other forces whose incursions into Germany fur- ther taxed its air-defense system. There was the RAF's Light Night Striking Force, which was equipped with elusive Mosquitoes and spe- cialized in harassing and diversionary raids; and there was the U.S Ninth Air Force, which shifted its base of operations to the Continent in the late summer of 1944. The Ninth was essentially a tactical force. but the advances of the Allied armies brought western Germany within easy reach of its medium bombers and even its fighters, whose forays into Germany complemented the destruction being carried out by the strategic air forces. The forward movement of the Allied armies paid another indirect dividend in the air war, for the Allies were soon able to destroy the Luftwaffe's early-warning radar system. First, the installations along the French coast were lost, then those in Belgium and the Nether- lands. And as the German network shrank, that of the Allies expande
