waffe's early-warning radar system. First, the installations along the French coast were lost, then those in Belgium and the Nether- lands. And as the German network shrank, that of the Allies expanded. New Oboe installations on the Continent extended the range of this accurate blind-bombing device. But the Germans were losing the high-frequency war in other respects, because Allied tech- nology pulled ahead with ever more sophisticated spoofing and jam- ming techniques. The RAF's 100 Group, activated in December 1943 flew planes crammed with electronic equipment designed to interfere with German radar and radio. This it did with increasing effectiveness. blinding and baffling the German night fighters. On the night of Feb- ruary 13, 1945, when the RAF staged its terrible night raid on Dres- den, only twenty-seven German night fighters rose to meet the attack- ers; all the others were kept on the ground, their communications blotted out in a blizzard of man-made static. The day fighters of the Luftwaffe probably suffered irremediable losses in the air battles of 1944. While the machines could be replaced. seasoned pilots could not, and this loss of personnel may have been the critical factor in the Luftwaffe's decline. That the loss was accelerat- ing seems clear: from June 1941 to June 1944, the German air force lost thirty-one thousand flying personnel; in the five-month period from June to October 1944, the loss stood at thirteen thousand. Replacements were hastily and imperfectly trained and rushed into 159 operational squadrons, where their inexperience was sometimes obvious even to the enemy. From the spring of 1944 on, the Luftwaffe no longer mounted the maximum effort to block each and every Allied raid; it chose its oppor- tunities like a combatant husbanding his strength; but when the Ger- man fighters did come up to meet the intruders, they fought with cour- age and determination. Sometimes they fought with makeshift and expedient; they occasionally ramme
