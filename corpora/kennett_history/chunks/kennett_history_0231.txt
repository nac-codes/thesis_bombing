is strength; but when the Ger- man fighters did come up to meet the intruders, they fought with cour- age and determination. Sometimes they fought with makeshift and expedient; they occasionally rammed Allied bombers, and from 1943 on, Allied flyers reported seeing during day battles German aircraft with the telltale black paint and radar antlers of the night fighters. Sometimes the Luftwaffe even sprang ahead in technology; the Mes- serschmitt 262 jet fighter might well have tilted the balance once again, had it been committed sooner and in larger numbers to the air battles over the Reich. German flak also remained dangerous to the end, switching gradually to larger guns with greater ranges. In the last year of the war, American bombers considered flak a more trouble- some enemy than the fighter. German science never matched the American proximity fuse, which greatly improved the efficiency of antiaircraft guns by ensuring that the shell would explode as it passed close to an aircraft; but at the end of the war, the Germans were far along in the development of the "Schmetterling" rocket, a thousand- pound missile capable of homing in on an enemy bomber. Other sur- prises were in preparation when the war ended, so the Allies were wise to regard the air superiority that they finally acquired as a fragile asset to be assiduously guarded. The summer of 1944 did not see any sudden or dramatic shift in the operations of the Allied strategic air forces. Until September they remained under Eisenhower's control, and they were sometimes called in support of the land battles long after that date. To their lingering obligation to Overlord could be added their Crossbow missions-those flown against V-1 and V-2 missile installations. Into August, Bomber Command made more raids on France and Belgium than on Ger- many, although in that month Harris got authorization for twelve area attacks on German cities. General Eisenhower and his deputy, Air Marshal Arthur Tedder, favored a cam
