General Eisenhower and his deputy, Air Marshal Arthur Tedder, favored a campaign against German trans- portation facilities. General Spaatz, now head of the U.S. Strategic Air Forces, wanted to unleash the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces against oil targets and sought the aid of Bomber Command. The head  160 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BATTLE OF GERMANY 161 of that force, having successfully met challenges to his leadership within the RAF, wanted to get on with his own version of the air war. These various views produced a compromise of sorts that gave first priority to oil targets and second place to transportation objectives. leaving considerable latitude to each of the Allied air forces. Although the strategic air offensive in the last year of the war was not a carefully coordinated effort, it nonetheless stands apart from all the bombing campaigns that preceded it. First of all, in its scope and intensity it dwarfed anything seen before. In the last ten months of the war-from July 1, 1944 to May 8, 1945-the Allies hit Germany with almost three times the tonnage of bombs they had dropped in all their preceding campaigns against it. In 1943 most "major" raids still involved less than a thousand tons of bombs; in 1944 and 1945, from 1,000 to 4,000 tons were common for such an operation. It was in this latter period that fifty of Germany's great cities were reduced to rub- ble and ashes. By the spring of 1945, both Allied air forces were hav- ing a difficult time finding targets worthy of their destructive power.
