ished 1,100 tons on Hitler's mountain retreat at Berchtesgaden. Other differences separate the last phase of the bombing war from the earlier campaigns. The American strategic-bombing force moved gradually away from its doctrine of precision bombing and came to adopt a policy not very dissimilar to that of Bomber Command. In part, the change was required by the U.S. Army Air Forces' obligation to assist in the land struggle. As Allied armies began to penetrate into Germany, American bombers pounded the towns and cities that lay in their path, trying to destroy centers of resistance and speed the Allied advance. But beyond this, the Americans had to adjust their policy to European weather conditions, which often shrouded the tar- get from view. Blind bombing was the only solution if the U.S. Army Air Forces was to keep up its tempo of operations; for this purpose the Americans adopted H2X, a version of the British radar device. The first experimental missions took place at the end of 1943, but by the last quarter of 1944, about 80 percent of Eighth Air Force missions involved blind bombing with radar aids. At the beginning of 1945, the circular error with this method was about two miles; the official his- tory of the U.S. Army Air Forces is frank to acknowledge that such attacks "depended for effectiveness upon drenching an area with bombs."23 The shift in American bombing techniques may well be linked to another phenomenon in the latter stage of the war-an increased interest in attacks directed specifically at the German people. Both Allies advanced schemes and projects for such attacks with the avowed intention of "breaking" German morale and hastening the end of the war. The British favored razing a "sample" area in a way that would send a shock through Germany: "Operation Thunderclap" would obliterate Berlin, while "Hurricane I" would sow destruction through the entire Ruhr. The Americans proposed unleashing on Ger- many "war-weary" B-17 bombers packed with twent
