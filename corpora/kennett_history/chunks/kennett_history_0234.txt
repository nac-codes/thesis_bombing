ation Thunderclap" would obliterate Berlin, while "Hurricane I" would sow destruction through the entire Ruhr. The Americans proposed unleashing on Ger- many "war-weary" B-17 bombers packed with twenty thousand pounds of explosives and controlled by radio; General Arnold thought this might have significant psychological effect. Another American scheme was the "Jeb Stuart" plan; later elaborated as "Operation Clarion," it called for fighter and bomber raids throughout Germany, seeking out transportation targets in the smaller German towns and villages where the populations had so far been spared. It was expected to produce "a stupefying effect on morale."24 How can we account for the vogue of these schemes toward the end of the war? They probably represent a casting about for options in that frustrating period of the conflict when the ultimate victory was assured but the road to that victory was long and any shortcut tempt- ing-all the more tempting since the enemy no longer had the possi- bility of replying in kind. It is significant that the British opposed the American scheme for B-17 "flying bombs" on the grounds that the Germans could use similar weapons against the British Isles. There are a number of indications that whatever inspired this policy trend, the Allies were moving toward an air war clearly waged against the enemy population. Within the U.S. Army Air Forces, resistance to area bombing declined, and in February 1945, both air forces carried out Clarion (although with indifferent results). On February 3 the Eighth Air Force carried out a devastating raid on Berlin that may have taken as many as twenty-five thousand lives. Ten nights later, the RAF put the torch to Dresden, an old and vulnerable city jammed with refugees. The inferno that resulted was as terrible as the Ham- burg fire storm. The total number of dead will never be known; esti- mates have ranged between twenty-five thousand and a half million.  162 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING The Germ
