These invitations to the German people to lynch downed flyers became more explicit in 1945, and in the final days of the Third Reich, there was even talk of renouncing the Geneva convention and meting out summary justice in the prisoner of war camps. Fortunately, the fighting ended in Europe before these threats could be carried out or the air war further envenomed. But in the Far East the struggle went on: three weeks after the destruction of Dres- den, American bombers dealt Tokyo and its people a staggering blow, opening a bombing campaign of unparalleled violence and destructiveness.
