olittle raid was more symbolic than anything else, like so many of the operations that opened the bombing war in Europe. It would give the Japanese pause, but more than anything else, it would provide welcome relief from the grim headlines that American news- papers were carrying in those first disastrous months of the war in the 163  JAPAN: ORDEAL BY FIRE 164 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING Pacific. This may have been what initially attracted President Roo- sevelt to the scheme and to others like it as early as January 1942. The idea of a bombing war against Japan antedated Pearl Harbor by many years. A number of American officers, among them Billy Mitchell, had come to believe that an armed confrontation with the Japanese was inevitable. In 1924, Mitchell penned a report based on his visit to Japan in which he called attention to the vulnerability of its congested and flammable cities. The terrible proof of that vulner- ability had been the earthquake and fire of 1923, which took an esti- mated hundred thousand lives. This consideration was also in the minds of the Committee of Operations Analysts, a panel created in December 1942 to study possible targets for strategic-bombing offen- sives against Germany and Japan. In its report to General Arnold eleven months later, the committee listed as the most rewarding tar- gets merchant shipping, aircraft plants, steel production, the ball- bearing and electronics industries, and "urban industrial areas," which they judged particularly susceptible to incendiary attacks.1 Six cities were prime candidates: Tokyo, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Nagoya, Kobe, and Osaka. By the time the various target systems had been studied and cate- gorized, American military planners had found a way to bring those targets within range of the U.S. Army Air Forces' bombers. The plan carried the code name "Operation Matterhorn" and had as its goal the "early sustained bombing of Japan"; in conception, it was a refine- ment of schemes proposed early in 1
