r Forces' bombers. The plan carried the code name "Operation Matterhorn" and had as its goal the "early sustained bombing of Japan"; in conception, it was a refine- ment of schemes proposed early in 1942 calling for a bomber force operating from India and "staging" through bases in China. In the spring of 1944, the vehicle for this operation came into existence as the Twentieth Air Force, specializing in long-range strategic bombing and designed to operate under the direct orders of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, through General Arnold as their agent. And finally, for this new venture there would be a new bomber-the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. Since the B-29 was used exclusively in the Pacific theater, it is easy to assume that it was designed for the peculiar needs of that area, but this was not the case. Initially, it had been slated for use in the Euro- pean theater of operations, with units earmarked for such places as England and Egypt. The decision to commit the B-29 in the Pacific was motivated first of all by the fact that it became available in appre- ciable numbers after the second half of 1944. (By then the strategic- bombing offensive against Germany had hit its stride with the bomber 165 types already available.) Second, strategic air operations in the Pacific required a bomber of exceptional range and the B-29 fulfilled this requirement. The B-29 took shape on the drawing board in 1940 and first flew in September 1942; it was conceived in the heyday of the American theory of daylight precision bombardment. It was exceptional in any number of ways, the first of which was its size. From wingtip to wing- tip, it measured just over 141 feet, or half the length of a football field. Its basic weight was 74,500 pounds (roughly twice that of the B-17), but fully armed it could weigh 135,000 pounds, or 67.5 tons. Its four 2,200-horsepower engines drove propellers 16.5 feet in diameter. The plane was enormous, but it was no monster. Aerodynamically, it
