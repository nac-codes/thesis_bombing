t fully armed it could weigh 135,000 pounds, or 67.5 tons. Its four 2,200-horsepower engines drove propellers 16.5 feet in diameter. The plane was enormous, but it was no monster. Aerodynamically, it was an extraordinarily clean aircraft. Its skin was flush riveted and had no camouflage paint to cover its brilliant silver finish. In addition the plane was a stable platform for the Norden bombsight. It could also deliver-in theory, at least-a 10-ton payload at a distance of 1,500 miles. It could cruise in excess of 300 mph and at 30,000 feet and above. If its speed and ceiling could not ensure its safety, its twelve .50-caliber machine guns and one 20mm cannon would. While this formidable weapon was being readied, the Japanese gov- ernment was doing relatively little to strengthen its air defenses. In November 1941, Premier Hideki Tojo reviewed the air defenses and found them satisfactory. Three hundred planes were available for defense of the home islands, along with seven hundred antiaircraft guns. The aircraft were of the obsolescent Type 97 fighter variety and would be flown by personnel drawn mostly from flight schools on the islands. The antiaircraft guns were 75mm cannon, capable of reaching no higher than twenty-five thousand feet. Yet, modest as these weap- ons were, they were sufficient. The primary defense Japan could rely on was its great distance from its enemies. Since it had limited resources and could not be strong everywhere, it felt that priority should go to the fighting fronts. Tojo conceded that the Allies might from time to time succeed in breaching the outer defensive perimeter and send bombers over the home islands-the Doolittle raid was not unexpected. But Japanese aircraft could generally keep enemy carriers at a distance and could be counted on to neutralize any air bases the enemy might try to estab- lish in China or possibly in the Soviet Union. Thus, only tip-and-run raids seemed likely, and they would be few and of minor concern. For mu
