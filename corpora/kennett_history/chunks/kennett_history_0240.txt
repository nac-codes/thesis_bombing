to neutralize any air bases the enemy might try to estab- lish in China or possibly in the Soviet Union. Thus, only tip-and-run raids seemed likely, and they would be few and of minor concern. For much of the Pacific war, this was true; the Doolittle raid had no sequel  JAPAN: ORDEAL BY FIRE 167 166 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING for two years. Nevertheless, the Imperial Japanese Army, which had chief responsibility for air defense, pushed for improvement in two directions in the aftermath of the Doolittle raid. The first was the quest to produce better antiaircraft guns, notably the 120mm with its greater range; the second was perfection of the radar system, in which Japan was woefully behind. For the first two years of the war, fighter defense remained a makeshift, with outmoded aircraft and pilots "bor- rowed" from training establishments. But by the spring of 1943, Jap- anese intelligence had some knowledge of the new American bomber, which it expected to begin operations that fall. The high service ceiling seemed its most dangerous characteristic. Japanese authorities thus pushed the production of the 120mm gun and began searching for new types of fighters that could take greater firepower into the higher alti- tudes. But they had not completed their search when the first B-29s flew over Japan in June 1944. The debut of the Superfortresses was a surprisingly modest one This was partly because there was only a small number of B-29s avail- able that summer and partly because they were operating under an incredibly complex logistical arrangement. The planes had as their home base a series of airfields around Kharagpur, India, not far from Calcutta, but to strike at targets in Japan or Japanese-held Manchu- ria, they had first to fly "over the Hump" to advance, or "staging," airfields around Chengtu, China-a distance of some twelve hundred miles. At Chengtu they refueled and flew on to their objectives, per- haps another twelve hundred miles. They had to stage at
