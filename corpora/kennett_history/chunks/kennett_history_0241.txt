aging," airfields around Chengtu, China-a distance of some twelve hundred miles. At Chengtu they refueled and flew on to their objectives, per- haps another twelve hundred miles. They had to stage at Chengtu on their return, so that each mission involved nearly five thousand miles and more than twenty hours of flying time. This was a demanding schedule even in the best of circumstances. Perhaps only the Americans would have made such a lavish com- mitment of resources in order to operate a sophisticated weapon in adverse conditions. The B-29 needed runways of extraordinary length-1.5 miles-and these were built. Its four engines consumed enormous quantities of aviation gasoline-six thousand gallons for a twelve-hundred-mile flight. The fuel with which the bombers filled their tanks at Chengtu had to be brought over the Hump by air, and the transports sometimes consumed twelve gallons to deliver one gal- lon. Chengtu offered nothing but the barest necessities to crews stag- ing there. The historian of XX Bomber Command complained that "full colonels walked two miles to their airplanes."2 By the end of May a full complement of 112 B-29s had reached Twentieth Bomber Command's Fifty-Eighth Wing and were poised for action on its bases around Kharagpur. On June 5, ninety-eight of them took off for a "practice" raid on Bangkok. Then, on the night of June 15-16 they carried out their first attack on Japan. The target chosen was the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at Yawata, which pro- duced a quarter of Japan's steel; the B-29s came away virtually unscathed, but reconnaissance photos revealed that the Imperial Iron and Steel Works had also escaped undamaged. Steel plants, and particularly coking ovens, were at the top of the target list, so in July the B-29s also went after the Showa Steel Works in Manchuria; they struck it a second time, as they did the steel plant at Yawata. They flew both by day and by night, and at various alti- tudes; they bombed visually when the weather
