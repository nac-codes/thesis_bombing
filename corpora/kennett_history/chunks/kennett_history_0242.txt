owa Steel Works in Manchuria; they struck it a second time, as they did the steel plant at Yawata. They flew both by day and by night, and at various alti- tudes; they bombed visually when the weather permitted and with radar when it did not. They struck at an aircraft plant at Okayama by day and then tried a night incendiary raid on Nagasaki (with neg- ligible results). In all, the Twentieth Bomber Command flew forty- nine missions up to March 31, 1945, when it was deactivated. It dropped about 11,000 tons of bombs, but only 800 tons fell on the Japanese home islands. Considering the effort expended to bring Japan within bombing range, the record was modest indeed. Twen- tieth Bomber Command never activated more than one wing of B-29s, the Fifty-Eighth, and even the operations of that limited force were severely hobbled by logistical problems. As early as March 1944, it was clear to the American Joint Chiefs of Staff that the big bombers would need a less precarious base; to that end, they ordered the taking of the Marianas, only twelve hundred miles from Tokyo. On June 15, the same day the B-29s invaded Japanese airspace, U.S. Marines stormed ashore at Saipan. Even before the island was secure, Seabees had begun work on the enormous runways. (Guam and Tinian would have airfields as well.) On October 12 the first B-29 touched down on Saipan's Isley Field. Six weeks later a force of 110 Superfortresses lifted off that same field bound for Tokyo. The pilots who flew the first B-29s from Saipan took with them a valuable fund of knowledge about what their bombers could do and could not do in the skies of Japan, and that knowledge had been amassed-sometimes very painfully-by the men who had flown the big bombers out of Chengtu and Kharagpur. First of all, the bombers  168 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING JAPAN: ORDEAL BY FIRE could be operated both by day and by night without serious loss; rarely did the loss rate exceed 5 percent, and for all B-29 operations during the w
