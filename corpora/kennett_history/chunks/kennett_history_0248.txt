caught off guard by the new tactics, over a hundred firemen lost their lives in the confla- gration, and nearly that number of fire trucks were consumed by the flames. Worst of all, that night the Akakaze, or "Red Wind," was blowing across Tokyo, and it took the flames with it. There was no true fire storm over Tokyo that night. Martin Caidin has written, "Because of the wind, the potential fire storm was transformed into an even deadlier force-the sweep conflagration."3 A tidal wave of fire moved across the city, the flames preceded by superheated vapors that felled anyone who breathed them. . Forty-eight hours after their attack on Tokyo, the B-29s struck Nagoya and then moved on to Osaka and Kobe. Within a ten-day period beginning March 9 the bombers dropped 9,373 tons of bombs and burned out 31 square miles of city. LeMay pushed the firebomb- ing with such energy that by the end of March his depots began to run low on incendiary bombs, and the shortage was not overcome until June. City burning was becoming something of a science, as LeMay's men tried various weapons and techniques. The M50 thermite incen- diary used in Europe had "excessive" penetration. It would often pass entirely through a Japanese structure and ignite in the earth beneath it, occasionally perforating water mains. The best weapon was the  172 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES JAPAN: ORDEAL BY FIRE M69, a small incendiary bomb, many of which were dropped in a sin- gle casing: "Each of these clusters, arranged to explode at 2500 feet altitude, was constructed to release thirty-eight incendiary bombs, made to fall in a random pattern, this arrangement furnishing the basis for the big bombing success to come. The orderly design or dis- tribution from one bomber with an intervalometer setting, or spaced fall, of one bomb every fifty feet, could burn about sixteen acres, as each Superfort had a full bomb load of 16,000 pounds." The basic procedure, concludes this passage,
