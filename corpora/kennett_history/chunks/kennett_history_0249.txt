rvalometer setting, or spaced fall, of one bomb every fifty feet, could burn about sixteen acres, as each Superfort had a full bomb load of 16,000 pounds." The basic procedure, concludes this passage, "was like throwing many matches on a floor covered with sawdust."4 As these descriptions indicate, the destruction was most effective if carried out systematically. With "impressionistic" bombing-that is, with each bombardier trying to place his bombs where they would extend the damage-the ultimate yield was less than if there was a general pattern. In some cases radar bombing was more effective than visual aiming. Two hundred and fifty tons of bombs per square mile, adequately distributed, virtually guaranteed total destruction of the area. Everything combustible would be consumed, and the fierce tem- peratures generated would ensure that by radiant heat alone the con- flagration would cross streets and canals. In some cases the heat would soften the asphalt in the streets, so that fire equipment mired down and was lost to the flames. Water sprayed on the fire would simply vaporize; glass panes would soften and drip from metal window frames. Here and there, incredibly, concrete melted. No living thing could survive in such an atmosphere. Every major city in Japan was slated for this sort of destruction save one; the historic town of Kyoto. Each target city was divided up into zones, or "urban areas," and these bore the designations UA/1, UA/2, and so on. As the B-29s destroyed each of these, they would be checked off. When enough of them had been razed, the city was removed from the target list. By the end of May, Tokyo had lost 56 square miles to the flames and was no longer considered a priority target. For a time, Yokohama seemed to be spared; rumor had it in Japan that the Americans were saving it because they planned to land there. In fact, Yokohama UA/1 had a B rating on the target list, rel- egating it to the "second phase." But Yokohama's turn came on May 29,
