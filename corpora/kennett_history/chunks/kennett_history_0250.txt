t the Americans were saving it because they planned to land there. In fact, Yokohama UA/1 had a B rating on the target list, rel- egating it to the "second phase." But Yokohama's turn came on May 29, when 454 Superfortresses came over in a high-altitude daylight raid and rained down twenty-five hundred tons of incendiaries. Yoko- hama UA/1 went up in flames, as did much of the rest of the city- nearly seven square miles. The inhabitants of Osaka clung to the belief 173 that the rest of their badly damaged city would be spared. There were, it was said, "connections" between the Americans and important com- mercial families of Osaka, "the Manchester of the Orient." But the B-29s came on June 1 and finished the city off. There was very little that the Japanese government could do, short of capitulation, to prevent the incineration of its great cities one after another. The menace from the Marianas was growing every day. By June, General LeMay was mounting raids with five hundred Super- fortresses, and by September he would have a thousand at his disposal. In March, American P-51 fighters began to move to bases on Iwo Jima, and by April they were appearing over Japan. From February on, the attacks from LeMay's B-29s were supplemented by those from carrier-based planes, which periodically appeared to harass the home islands. Japan's early-warning network had begun to disintegrate, like that of Germany. The increasingly mighty American navy had destroyed Japanese picket ships or driven them toward the shelter of the home islands. The type-B radar, with its range limited to 150 miles or so, was an inadequate substitute. The Japanese fighter force probably made its heaviest impact on the raids in January 1945, when B-29 losses rose to 5.7 percent; thereafter, the Japanese fighters had less success, although the pilots were plucky and aggressive to the end. The Tenth Air Division held the Kanto Sector, covering the highest-prior- ity targets, Tokyo and Yokohama. On the night
