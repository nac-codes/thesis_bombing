to challenge every air attack, but to husband their strength for the big bomber incursions. Japanese intelligence tried to "read" American radio traffic and predict when and where attacks might take place. The flak forces, woefully insufficient, were moved about according to the readings; at one point, nearly a third of Japan's flak units were being shifted about between potential targets. The Japanese authorities did what they could in the way of passive defense. Beginning in June 1944, they began evacuating young chil- dren from urban areas and ultimately other groups as well. Although Japan was losing much of its industrial capacity with the burning of its cities, the authorities did not order dispersal and relocation of crit- ical industries until the spring of 1945. They probably delayed because they knew that war production, already slumping in late 1944, would dip further as the firms shifted their operations to new localities. Within each Japanese city, the local authorities tried to prepare for fire attacks, filling water reservoirs and cutting firebreaks, often by demolishing whole blocks; municipal authorities made agreements to lend fire-fighting apparatus back and forth between threatened cities. These measures were completely justified in light of the way the American bombing offensive was growing in intensity. In March, LeMay's bombers had released 13,000 tons of bombs on Japan; in July the figure was 42,000, and by the end of the summer it was expected to exceed 100,000 tons per month. By the middle of June, the Superfortresses had burned out all the largest cities in Japan, so they began on the lesser cities in a campaign that lasted two months. Now the raids were "multiple-target" missions, in which four wings of B-29s took off, each wing hitting a different city. Yet LeMay never completely abandoned the strategic-bombing concept. Whenever the weather was favorable, the bombers took high explosives to precise targets; when it was not, they hauled i
