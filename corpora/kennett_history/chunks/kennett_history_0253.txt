ferent city. Yet LeMay never completely abandoned the strategic-bombing concept. Whenever the weather was favorable, the bombers took high explosives to precise targets; when it was not, they hauled incendiaries to another city. The B-29s also found time to sow some twelve thousand naval mines and to scatter 4.5 million leaflets. There was never any doubt that the towns and cities of Japan were the prime target. Of the 135,000 tons of bombs the B-29s dropped in 175 the last months of the war, 104,000 went to urban areas. By July the bombers were attacking cities with populations of 100,000-200,000; the last cities attacked in August had fewer than 50,000 inhabitants. Toyama, with a population of 127,000, was deluged with 1,500 tons of bombs, which destroyed 99.5 percent of its built-up area. In the final weeks of the war against Japan, the bombers seemed to be having the same difficulty they had experienced over Germany: they were running out of targets worthy of their powers of destructiveness. There was another parallel with the final phase of the air war in Europe, and an ominous one: the fire attacks on the cities of Japan were part of a general intensification and escalation of the conflict. On the Japanese side, there was no hope for new weapons of enhanced destructiveness, but shortcomings here could be offset by a higher level of human commitment. The Japanese high command ordered an extravagant yet calculated expenditure of lives. Kamikaze aircraft attacks began in the fall of 1944; by the following April, they had become such a serious menace that LeMay's B-29s turned from their customary targets and tried to neutralize the Kyushu airfields from which the suicide planes set out. April was also the month in which the Americans landed on Okinawa, and the mighty Japanese battle- ship Yamato steamed toward that strategic island on a kamikaze mis- sion of its own, only to be sunk by American planes long before it reached its destination. On Okinawa, as on Iwo J
