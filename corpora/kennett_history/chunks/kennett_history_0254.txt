Japanese battle- ship Yamato steamed toward that strategic island on a kamikaze mis- sion of its own, only to be sunk by American planes long before it reached its destination. On Okinawa, as on Iwo Jima two months before, the invaders encountered garrisons that fought with utmost determination. The Americans paid a heavy price for both islands, but they could expect the toll to be higher still on the beaches of Honshu and Kyushu: the Japanese government began the formation of the Peoples Volunteer Corps, a sort of lev√©e en masse that would commit the bulk of Japan's adult population-men and women-to the defense of the homeland. While those in power in Tokyo were making plans to offer up the Japanese people wholesale to stave off defeat, political and military planners in Washington were looking for ways to consummate the vic- tory they saw ahead with a minimum investment of American lives. Not surprisingly, they mobilized technology in order to spare men. At the tactical level, napalm made its debut in the fall of 1944; delivered by air, it proved an efficient way to "burn out" pockets of resistance. Confronted with sobering losses at Okinawa and Iwo Jima, the Amer- ican Joint Chiefs of Staff discussed going a step further and using poison gas, but in the end they decided against it. Meanwhile, the air  ANI LIMBIA UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES JAPAN: ORDEAL BY FIRE 177 176 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING offensive against the home islands swelled in intensity, preparing the way for the invasion that most American leaders believed would be necessary. The attacks had the dual function of reducing the enemy's ability to resist both materially and psychologically. The fire raids were presumably doing both, but after May they were supplemented by air attacks from Okinawa. While the B-29s brought destruction to the inhabitants of Japan's cities, Okinawa-based fighters and medium bombers brought it to hamlet and countryside. They ranged over Japan as they had ranged over the expiri
