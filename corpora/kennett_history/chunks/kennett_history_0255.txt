-29s brought destruction to the inhabitants of Japan's cities, Okinawa-based fighters and medium bombers brought it to hamlet and countryside. They ranged over Japan as they had ranged over the expiring Reich, attacking trains. bridges, and whatever targets of opportunity presented themselves- missions described at the time as "general hell-raising." Their opera- tions blurred further the distinction between military and civilian objectives. At least twice, returning fighter pilots reported they had strafed groups of civilians in the fields and along the roads. A spokes- man for the Fifth Air Force offered a rationale for such attacks: since the Japanese government was mobilizing the people generally to resist the invasion, it followed that "the entire population of Japan is a proper military target."5 It was in such a climate that the ultimate air weapon of the war made its debut. When the first atomic bomb was being readied, a group of scientists involved in its development proposed that it first be used in a harmless demonstration that would be given the widest pub- licity. But the panel of civilians who advised President Truman on atomic affairs recommended that the bomb be used on a Japanese target and without any prior warning about its nature. So it was that Col. Paul Tibbetts took the Enola Gay and its bomb over Hiroshima on the morning of August 6, 1945. A second nuclear bomb struck Nagasaki three days later, as the inner council of the Japanese gov- ernment was considering Allied peace proposals-which it accepted on August 14. Both Hiroshima and Nagasaki were dual targets, con- taining installations of military value and sizable civilian populations; as such, they were no different from other cities that B-29s had del- uged with incendiaries. And in their immediately perceptible results, the nuclear attacks resembled the conventional fire raids-so much so that some survivors felt they had experienced just such a raid. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs were
