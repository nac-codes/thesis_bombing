diately perceptible results, the nuclear attacks resembled the conventional fire raids-so much so that some survivors felt they had experienced just such a raid. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs were only the second and third nuclear devices exploded, and by modern standards they were puny indeed. Bombing experts estimated shortly after the war that they could have produced the same level of death and destruction with 2,100 tons of conventional bombs, about half of them incendiaries. This tonnage was well within the capacity of the B-29 fleet. So while the bomb itself was new and extraordinary, no new or extraordinary use was made of it. Nuclear fission replaced incendi- aries and high explosives in an ongoing, escalating air offensive. To many partisans of strategic bombing, the mushroom cloud was like the fire storm, a milestone in the realization of a doctrine a half-cen- tury old. And to those partisans, the surrender of Japan while its shores were still inviolate brought triumphant affirmation of the doc- trine and the dream. The air weapon had become the supreme weapon-or so it seemed.  . 178 ---- V LIDDADICO THE BOMBING WAR IN RETROSPECT CHAPTER 11 THE BOMBING WAR IN RETROSPECT "ITS MYSTERY IS HALF ITS POWER."1 J. M. Spaight once described the bomber this way, and perhaps no other phrase captures quite so well the peculiar ambiance in which this weapon was conceived and devel- oped. The aura of mystery and power surrounded aerial bombing when it was still only an idea; by the 1930s the strategic air weapon had become an awesome, overshadowing presence that preoccupied men quite as much as nuclear arsenals do today. While the bomber worked on the imagination of the Sunday-supplement writer and the public who read his expos√©s, at the same time it affected the men who flew it and knew its powers at firsthand. The history of aviation in general is the story of machines and of men, but also of a kind of interaction between the two. To men like Mitchell and Douhet,
