ho flew it and knew its powers at firsthand. The history of aviation in general is the story of machines and of men, but also of a kind of interaction between the two. To men like Mitchell and Douhet, the power of the air weapon came with the force of revelation. They believed and then they became evangelists. The bomber was an idea long before it was a reality, and this dis- crepancy, if one may call it that, has remained a feature of its history. The realization would always lag behind the conception; performance never quite caught up with expectations. "The potential of the stra- tegic air offensive was greater than its achievement"2-this was the judgment that Bomber Command's official historians rendered on its 179 operations against Germany, but the same words might serve as epi- taph for almost any strategic-bombing campaign in either world war. Perhaps it was not until the Enola Gay appeared over Hiroshima that strategic bombing met and exceeded the expectations of those who placed their faith in it. From the very beginning, the partisans of air power expected too much of the bomber. They were dazzled by the offensive possibilities it offered. Its "penetrativeness," as Spaight called it, brought the ene- my's factories, arsenals, and towns within sight for the first time; and what the bomber could see, it could of course destroy. "From above one can see well and from above one can strike easily,"3 Douhet, writ- ing in 1910, put it simply. The early theorists also accorded to aerial bombardment a special efficacy. Somehow, by a process they never quite explained, fifty pounds of explosives coming to earth in the form of an aerial bomb would wreak more havoc than a similar weight of explosives delivered by more conventional means. And the damage was not merely physical; it was psychological as well. A rain of bombs was less bearable to human beings than a salvo of artillery. These notions were virtually articles of faith by 1914, and they would linger to color
