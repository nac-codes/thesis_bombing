ical; it was psychological as well. A rain of bombs was less bearable to human beings than a salvo of artillery. These notions were virtually articles of faith by 1914, and they would linger to color the thought of later generations of strategists. The unique potential for destruction that made the bomber a prom- ising weapon also made it a dangerous one. Any number or people saw the danger before 1914: aerial bombing could extend death and destruction far beyond the customary parameters of warfare, erasing "the distinction between combatant and civilian, between war zone and hinterland. At the Hague conference of 1907 the nations involved chose to permit aerial bombing of military objectives. In doing so, they virtually assured that the practice would spread and intensify, for the threshold to "illegal" bombing was not clearly marked. The air weapon might conceivably have been banned altogether while still in embryo; what helped save it was the argument that actually it repre- sented "progress" in warfare, a means to bring speed and precision to military operations and thus make wars less bloody. This notion too would linger. In the 1920s, Mitchell and Douhet argued that a war decided in the air would be a merciful substitute for the hell of the trenches. And arguments about the economy and the humanity of the air war continued to be heard into World War II. Initially, much of the talk was about the fabled knockout blow, which would stun a bel- ligerent in the first hours of conflict, delivering him up to the will of  180 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES THE BOMBING WAR IN RETROSPECT the attacker with a saving of lives and property all around; later, when the war was well under way, advocates of the strategic-bombing offen- sive put forth a more modest claim: it would save lives on "our" side The Great War scarcely gave the strategic bomber a chance to do more than try its wings; at the close of the conflict, it was a weapon imperfectly
