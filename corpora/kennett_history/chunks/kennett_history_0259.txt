more modest claim: it would save lives on "our" side The Great War scarcely gave the strategic bomber a chance to do more than try its wings; at the close of the conflict, it was a weapon imperfectly tested, but with a potential all the more inviting now that traditional methods of warfare had come into discredit. If there was a single episode in the war that served to demonstrate that potential it was the German air offensive against England, culminating in the cycle of raids on London in the summer and fall of 1917. No one grasped the lesson quite so well as those on the receiving end of the offensive; it was at the height of the attacks that the British cabinet took the key decisions that committed the country to a strategic air force of its own. And the episode made a strong impression on foreign observers, perhaps because Britain's cities had so long been inviolable. Long after the war, air power advocates invoked as their final argu- ment the peril and the panic London had known. But after the war the pendulum swung again. What had been a weapon for victory in 1918 became a menace to European civilization and the object of countless disarmament efforts. For the bomber to survive in the 1930s, it had to lend itself to new uses and appear to serve other causes-and sometimes it even had to change its name. Although it was a supremely offensive weapon, its proponents claimed that it would serve the cause of defense, that it no longer threatened attack, but only promised retaliation. With an unrivaled ability to erase distance, it served to promote a kind of isolationism, insulating the belligerent nation from too close contact with the horrors of war. Bomber Command offered the British a means to fight the enemy at arm's length, striking it from the security of their island. The Amer- ican Flying Fortress would meet and turn back hostile forces that were still hundreds of miles offshore; and there were any number of arm- chair strategists in America who spoke of a
