island. The Amer- ican Flying Fortress would meet and turn back hostile forces that were still hundreds of miles offshore; and there were any number of arm- chair strategists in America who spoke of a "superbomber" that could strike across the Atlantic. Of all the belligerents of World War II only Great Britain and the United States had made a strong commitment to the strategic air offensive before the conflict started, and only they were able to mount and sustain such offensives once the war began. In the end, this seems to have been more than anything else a result of priorities and resources. A strategic-bombing fleet of any size was a rich nation's 181 weapon, and that nation had to be rich not only in money but in men and technology as well. It is doubtful that Japan could have found the wherewithal to construct such a fleet, and it is questionable whether Germany could have found the fuel to keep such a fleet in the air. Air Marshal Harris dreamed of a force of four thousand heavy bombers, but British industry could not give them to him if it was to continue meeting the needs of the land and sea services. As it was, the bomber offensive may at times have absorbed a third of the British war effort. Britain could not find the aircrews that Bomber Command required without drawing heavily on the Commonwealth. Only the Americans could afford to offer themselves a bomber like the B-29, which cost over $800,000-a staggering sum for the era-and gulped six thou- sand gallons of aviation gasoline on a single mission. And only the Americans could build them by the thousands and maintain them in style. In the summer of 1944, XX Bomber Command had fifty B-29s operational-and twenty thousand men working to keep them that way. In 1939, as in 1914, the bombing war developed slowly; for the first few months, the Germans and the Allies scrupulously respected each other's cities and populations. Even after these restrictions disap- peared, the impact of bombing was far less than
