y; for the first few months, the Germans and the Allies scrupulously respected each other's cities and populations. Even after these restrictions disap- peared, the impact of bombing was far less than expected. The stra- tegic offensives of 1940-41, both German and British, revealed the bomber to be vulnerable and its destructive capacities disappointing. The British and the Americans persisted with this form of the air war; they had made a heavy commitment, so their bombing fleets were under clear imperative to produce results. Bomber Command had to reequip with better aircraft; since it could not strike precision targets by day, it had to attack larger ones by night. If the Americans could not see Stuttgart through their Norden bombsights, they would have to locate it with radar and bomb it through clouds. These things the two Allies did, and monthly tonnages rose accordingly. Yet the story of the Allied bombing offensive is hardly one of smooth acceleration. In the skies over Germany, the advantage shifted several times between offensive and defensive forces; not until the last months of the conflict could the Allies enjoy anything approaching the fabled "command of the air." For most of the war, each mission was like a roll of the dice, its outcome dependent upon weather, enemy dispositions, sheer chance, and a host of other factors that could not be controlled. So it must have seemed to those who flew in the big  182 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING _ -***** DIA UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES THE BOMBING WAR IN RETROSPECT 183 bombers. They knew only that if they played the game long enough they were certain to lose. Martin Middlebrook has calculated that in 1943 only about a third of Bomber Command's crews made it through a first tour of thirty missions; one crew in six survived a second tour of twenty missions. Whenever the bombers had a particularly bad run of luck, as did the British in the Ruhr and the Americans over Schweinfurt, morale would drop perceptibly. It was a
