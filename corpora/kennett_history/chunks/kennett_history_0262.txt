ed a second tour of twenty missions. Whenever the bombers had a particularly bad run of luck, as did the British in the Ruhr and the Americans over Schweinfurt, morale would drop perceptibly. It was a measure of the men that the bombers continued to fly. Statistically, the most striking feature of the strategic air offensives against both Germany and Japan was their incremental nature. The great weight of bombs to descend on Germany came in the last year of war; in the case of Japan, 90 percent of the bombs were dropped in the final five months. The figures on physical destruction are eloquent: 7.5 million Germans and over 8 million Japanese homeless at the end of the war. This was "dehousing" on a grand scale indeed. Fire proved to be the greatest agent of destruction, with the incendiary bomb about five times more effective than high explosives. But aerial bomb- ing was not an efficient way to take human life. It took three tons of bombs to kill a German, a ton and a half to kill a Japanese, with dif- ferences in building construction and population density accounting for the variation. These figures and many others were meticulously compiled by research teams after the war and incorporated into the British and American strategic-bombing surveys. Much of the data collected there served later to buttress the arguments presented in the massive official histories: the four-volume Strategic Air Offensive Against Ger- many, which chronicles the efforts of Bomber Command, and the seven-volume Army Air Forces in World War II. The claims made for strategic bombing are, on the whole, not extravagant. Bomber Com- mand "made a contribution to victory which was decisive."4 The Americans also employed the word decisive, and they too perceived the bomber as just part of a larger effort. But in the postmortem of the Pacific campaign, they put forward an interesting argument: Even if there had been no atomic bomb and no Soviet declaration of war against the Japanese, "air suprema
