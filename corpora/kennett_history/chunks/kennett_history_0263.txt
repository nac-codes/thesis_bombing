fort. But in the postmortem of the Pacific campaign, they put forward an interesting argument: Even if there had been no atomic bomb and no Soviet declaration of war against the Japanese, "air supremacy over Japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion."5 Unfortunately, historical questions and hypotheses that begin with if cannot be resolved. But in the way the campaigns actually worked out, the supreme hope placed in the strategic air offensive by some of its partisans in the 1930s, and indeed in the early years of World War II, was not realized: the strategic bomber did not win the war by itself. It was used along with a variety of other weapons and its role has been called variously "decisive," "important" or "relatively modest" by different historians sifting through the same evidence. But to determine how really worthwhile strategic bombing was to the Allied war effort, one would need to know if the vast resources committed to that effort would have counted for more if invested in tactical aviation, armored divisions, or-as one historian has suggested-landing craft. This is another if question. There is nevertheless a good deal to be learned from the Allied air offensives, for they put to the ultimate test strategic recipes that were refined and debated for decades-and a number of those recipes failed. One that did not was the American doctrine of precision bomb- ing directed at the points sensibles. Complex industrial societies can be hamstrung by a judicious pattern of destruction. The assaults that the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces mounted on Germany's trans- portation and fuel installations in the last year of the war proved to be stunning successes; this was confirmed by Albert Speer, who was in an excellent position to judge. But the postwar surveys showed that this type of warfare might have been far more productive than it was: the Americans should have concentrated on these tar
