who was in an excellent position to judge. But the postwar surveys showed that this type of warfare might have been far more productive than it was: the Americans should have concentrated on these targets sooner, should have struck German power stations (in retrospect, an even more rewarding target) and should have given more attention to the Japanese railway system. The British got somewhat lower marks from Speer. Although the damage they did was more widespread, it was less critical. The cities that they made their objectives proved surprisingly able to absorb pun- ishment; with half the streetcars out of commission and the homeless crowding in with friends or relatives, life went on, and so did work. As the city was tenacious of life, so was the production center. Often the building was destroyed, but the tools and machinery saved, so that production lines soon opened again in makeshift quarters and some- times simply in the open air. Both air forces discovered they had "underbombed." Targets thought to have been obliterated would have to be hit again and again or somehow they would come back to life; the German synthetic-fuel works at Leuna were a notorious case in point. And sometimes what had seemed to be an ideal target system proved not to be. The costly raids on the ball-bearing works at Schweinfurt did not slow down the German war machine. The British  184 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES THE BOMBING WAR IN RETROSPECT went to considerable effort to burn out DÃ¼sseldorf because it contained the headquarters of many German industries located elsewhere. But once rid of their head offices, those industries seem to have operated at an even higher pitch. All of this was learned later, of course. During the war, the Allies were fundamentally handicapped by not knowing what effect their raids were having. Photographic intelligence could not tell them all they needed to know, and stories coming from enemy countries had to be heavily disco
