y handicapped by not knowing what effect their raids were having. Photographic intelligence could not tell them all they needed to know, and stories coming from enemy countries had to be heavily discounted. In this sense, both Allies were bombing blind. There was an even more fundamental shortcoming in intelligence: failure to perceive the excess capacity, the unused resources, and the "fat" that characterized the German econ- omy well into the war. When Allied bombers began serious efforts to apply the brakes to German production in 1943, Albert Speer was just moving it into high gear. Well into 1944, his efforts effectively coun- teracted theirs. All of the bombing offensives of the war, including that which the Luftwaffe waged against England in 1940-41, seem to have been launched with the expectations of quick and tangible results; when those results did not come, the bombers were directed against another target system and then another. But probably no target proved so frus- trating, so elusive as morale. At some point, the offensive came to include this target, and at times, the chief objective of the raid was to demoralize the enemy civilian, to panic him, or, if necessary, to kill him. The punishment administered could be extremely severe: as a result of American bombing on dual targets, Japan suffered more casualties among its civilian population than among its armed forces on the fighting front. From Goering's Operation Seaside at the begin- ning of the war to Clarion and Thunderclap toward its end, there were innumerable schemes to produce a massive and debilitating shock to the enemy's population. The bombing of Rome was carried out largely for its shock value, as was the nuclear attack on Hiroshima. In these cases a shock certainly was produced, but it added to pressures already building on the Italian and Japanese governments, so its exact role is impossible to determine. On the other hand, the Blitz was a total fail- ure psychologically, as was the Bat
