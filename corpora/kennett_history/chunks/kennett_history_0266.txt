to pressures already building on the Italian and Japanese governments, so its exact role is impossible to determine. On the other hand, the Blitz was a total fail- ure psychologically, as was the Battle of Berlin in the winter of 1943-44. Here and there, the air war against the cities triggered panics and stampedes, but these were exceptional. In March 1943, 197 London- ers were killed when a crowd rushing to shelter in a subway found its 185 progress blocked. Seven months later, a similar crush in Milan cost the lives of 354 people; but this sort of tragedy can be produced any- where excited crowds encounter unexpected obstacles-at soccer games and at rock concerts, for example. Perhaps the nearest thing to massive and spontaneous flight came in the immediate aftermath of the two nuclear attacks, both of which came virtually without warn- ing. But within hours many of the inhabitants of Hiroshima and Nagasaki returned and rescue efforts were being organized. Almost universally, morale bombing was a disappointment; the evi- dence that the bombing surveys offered to the contrary is not convinc- ing. Some students of human behavior have argued that the bombing of the cities would have had a far greater psychological yield if it had been an all-out effort from the start, rather than one that built slowly in intensity, allowing urban populations to adjust to it. Be that as it may, when a city came under repeated attack and the air-raid siren became a familiar sound, the civilian at home proved as adaptable and as capable of living with danger as the soldier at the front. Indeed, embattled city dwellers often thought of themselves as combatants in the struggle against the bomber, even though their weapons were nothing more than sand buckets and blackout curtains. To be sure, in London, Essen, and Turin, the bombs exacted a price beyond the deaths and injuries they provoked. Bed-wetting increased among chil- dren, women had greater menstrual difficulties, and coronary oc
