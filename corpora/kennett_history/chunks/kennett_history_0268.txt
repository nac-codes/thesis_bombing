wer, "It was hell on earth. It was obvious that Hitler had to be destroyed, but did it have to be done this way?"8 The question is a fair one. The strategic-bombing offensive has been criticized for its fundamental inefficiency, but it has been more roundly condemned for its no less fundamental savagery. The plain fact is that most people have had difficulty in accepting the argument that since the entire nation now makes war, any part of that nation may justifiably be attacked. Despite the bitterness of the conflict they fought, the gen- eration of 1939-45 generally observed the distinction between soldier and civilian. Few Americans or Britons of that era would agree that a toddler of three or a widow on pension was a proper target for mil- itary operations, yet the Anglo-American air offensive destroyed thou- sands of such targets. Since the hallmark of strategic air forces is their close control by the supreme military and political leadership, that is where some his- torians have sought the explanation for this discrepancy-and the cul- prits. Some would lay the blame at the door of the military-Britain's "bomber barons," for example, who got their way by a variety of ques- tionable means, including deception. An American historian has recently argued that the leaders of the U.S. Army Air Forces carried the war to German civilians through similar means: "Official policy against indiscriminate bombing was so badly interpreted and so fre- quently breached as to become almost meaningless. . . . In the end, both the policy and the apparent ethical support for it among AAF leaders turn out to be myths; while they contain elements of truth, they are substantially false or misleading."9 Others point the finger at the political leadership; the author of a recent book on the British bomber offensive maintains that "from beginning to end of the war, ministers prevaricated-indeed, lied flatly again and again-about the nature of the bomber offensive."10 Another has painted
