British bomber offensive maintains that "from beginning to end of the war, ministers prevaricated-indeed, lied flatly again and again-about the nature of the bomber offensive."10 Another has painted a cover-up of sorts involving cabinet ministers, the air staff, and the media: "In some ways, area bombing was a three-year period of deceit practiced on the British public."11 None of the belligerents began the war with plans for an air assault against civilian populations-and this includes Nazi Germany. They were in fact all anxious to avoid such an air war, often because they were unsure how their own populations would stand up. And for the first few months of the conflict, they were able to limit the air war to clearly defined and isolated military targets, such as ships at sea. But this was insufficient employment for the bombing fleets, so they went after "legitimate" targets on land as well. Once this step was taken, escalation of the air war was inevitable, if for no other reason than the bomber's inaccuracy. An error or accident bred a reprisal, which in turn became a provocation. And when a nation's cities came under attack and its leaders proved unable to prevent those attacks, the lead- ers offered their beleaguered populations the next best thing-the spectacle of the enemy's cities even more savagely punished. But beyond this, there was always the possiblity that morale bombing might work, a possibility all the more alluring because the other bombing programs were not giving results. Thus drawn or driven by a variety of pressures, those who con- trolled the bombers gradually unleashed them on the enemy popula- tions. Many leaders did so unwillingly or with misgivings; the resis- tance in the U. S. Army Air Forces was notably strong. The escalation of the air war was made easier by the fact that those who directed the bombing offensives and those who carried them out remained curi- ously insulated and detached from the consequences of their work.
