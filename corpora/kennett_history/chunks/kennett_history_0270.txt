r was made easier by the fact that those who directed the bombing offensives and those who carried them out remained curi- ously insulated and detached from the consequences of their work. Photographs taken at thirty thousand feet gave no clue to the human effects of a raid, nor did other sources. In this vacuum, imagination and extrapolation could picture the population of an enemy town deprived of its homes but not of life and limb or public transport reduced by 50 percent and belief in victory by the same amount. Ano- dyne, antiseptic phrases such as "dual target" and "area attack" fur- ther served to mask the fact that human lives were being destroyed. If there was deception, there was also self-deception; and if there was a conspiracy to deceive, then the public, or at least the thinking portion of it, was party to that deception. In both Britain and America a few voices of protest could be heard. In March 1944, twenty-eight American clergymen drew up a letter of protest that was cited in the front pages of the New York Times. In the House of Lords, George Bell, Bishop of Chichester, spoke up, while a Labour member of Par- liament named Richard Stokes asked endless and disconcerting ques- tions about area bombing. But they found no echo.

In the final year of the war, the sheer inten- sity of the bombing resulted in attacks so great in their destructiveness that they aroused concern within minds and consciences in the Allied camps. The burning of Dresden certainly had this effect. Churchill, who had no small part in bringing the attack about, decided it was time to review "the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing terror, though under other pretexts."12 An Asso- ciated Press report
