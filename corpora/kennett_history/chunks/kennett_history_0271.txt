ringing the attack about, decided it was time to review "the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing terror, though under other pretexts."12 An Asso- ciated Press report on Allied terror bombing created a sensation a few days after the attacks on Dresden and gave General Arnold's chief of information grave cause for concern: "This is certain to have a nation- wide serious effect on the Air Force as we have steadfastly preached the gospel of precision bombing against military and industrial tar- gets."13 In England, Bomber Command soon became the object of vague disapprobation. Air Marshal Harris's men were denied their campaign medal, and Harris himself was left out of the shower of titles and distinctions that followed victory. Utterly unrepentant, Har- ris wrote a ringing defense of his work from first to last. The crisis of conscience over Dresden, he felt, could best be explained by a psy- chologist: "It is connected with German bands and Dresden shepherdesses."14 NOTES There was no such dramatic turn of events in the United States, but after Germany and Japan were occupied and the enormity of the destruction became apparent, it produced a certain uneasiness. That uneasiness has lingered; it can be stirred in many Americans whenever Hiroshima is mentioned. The National Air and Space Museum receives a steady trickle of letters protesting the presence in its collec- tions of the Enola Gay, and each year the flow increases around August 6. But there is another flow of inquiries asking why the most famous bomber in history is not put on public display. In the mean- time, the Enola Gay remains in storage outside Washington and there it is likely to stay. Asked if the plane would ever be exhibited, a cura- tor replied diplomatically, "It's too big for the museum."  ANISIMARIA UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES CHAPTER 1 A WEAPON IS BORN 1.
