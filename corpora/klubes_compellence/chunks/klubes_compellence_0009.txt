These determinants focus on interests, risk manipulation, and bargaining technique (i.e. clarity of objectives)." In his second edition, George, et al., discarded a factor included in the first edition, a usable military option. O f course, they were concentrating on coercive diplomacy, in which military force plays a lesser role. Consequently, the military situation is not as significant as in cases with more exte
