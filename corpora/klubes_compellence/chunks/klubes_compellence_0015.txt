ly exerted through indirect means. For example, the objective of all three primary strategies used by ground forces, attrition, maneuver, and blitzkrieg (a specialized form of maneuver warfare), is to destroy the enemy’s armed forces. The primary way to induce compellent pressure is with a bloody ground war of attrition (or guerilla warfare) to sap the population’s will to resist. For centuries naval doctrine has focused on control of the sea."’ ' The concentric circle model is based on the Five Strategic Ring diagram created by Col. John Warden, USAF. In Warden’s diagram each ring is roughly equivalent to a center of gravity. But another use of the term "strategic" would be too confusing. Therefore, I discarded strategic and inserted center of gravity to identify each ring. Actually, this is now just changing as evidenced by the U.S. Navy’s new doctrine entitled "...From the Sea", which emphasizes the potentialities o f naval power’s effects on activities and processes ashore. O f course, this shift occurred primarily because with the collapse of the Soviet Union the U.S. Navy’s control of the sea is only contested in littoral waters in a few areas. The primary sea power now has unquestioned control of the open seas. The new doctrine may not a permanent shift but more o f a reflection o f the current situation and a justification for continued expenditures. 12  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 25 --- While compellent leverage can be gained through blockades, there is considerably less flexibility in strategies for blockades than in aerial bombing. My interest in comparing strategies leads me to air power. Strategic bombing has the potential to hit each center of gravity directly due to its ability to overfly defenses which can halt ground forces and has a much greater ability to hit inland targets than naval forces. Air power’s ability to deliver pressure right to the enemy is a powerful lure for its use as a compellent tool. Moreover, air power generally
