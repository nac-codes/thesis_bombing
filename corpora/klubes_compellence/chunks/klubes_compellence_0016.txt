greater ability to hit inland targets than naval forces. Air power’s ability to deliver pressure right to the enemy is a powerful lure for its use as a compellent tool. Moreover, air power generally poses fewer political risks for the bombing state as considerably fewer men are exposed to enemy fire. Bombing has also proven to be less of a provocation than sending troops into the same territory. Therefore, a number of states have used air power, most often with strategic bombing, as the ‘schwerpunkt’  of their strategy to achieve political objectives. The reasoning is often straightforward; aircraft could rain explosives down on the enemy, forcing any rational state to capitulate under the onslaught. Despite the surface plausibility o f such an approach, in practice, it has proven considerably more difficult to achieve compellence through air power. Aerial bombing can apply pressure on the ability and/or will to resist via attacks on a wide variety of targets. Ways to reduce the resistance capability include striking munitions and weapon production factories, disrupting the transportation network that supports the war effort, or destroying petroleum stocks. The most common method of decreasing the will to resist is through area bombings o f cities to demoralize the civilian population. The destruction of cities can also 13  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 26 --- adversely affeet industrial production. With the diversity of options facing a commander, it would not be far-fetched to assume that how the strategic bombing campaign is conducted could have a dramatic effect on whether the compellent attempt succeeds. Indeed, an early air power theorist, Guilo Douhet, noted that the targeting was the aerial commander’s most difficult, yet most important, task.'® The primary experts on the operational how-to’s of military forces are military personnel. Obviously, the military spends much of its time developing the best ways to "win" wars. Ironically, this is the
