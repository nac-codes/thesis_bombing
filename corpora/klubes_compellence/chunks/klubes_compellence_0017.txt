primary experts on the operational how-to’s of military forces are military personnel. Obviously, the military spends much of its time developing the best ways to "win" wars. Ironically, this is the crux o f the problem. Military science often develops the best way to accomplish military, not political, objectives. However, successful compellence is measured by the attainment o f political — not military—  objectives." This is a critical difference. The political and military objectives of a war are not necessarily the same. In fact, they are often dissimilar. The achievement of one may not even be contingent on achieving the other." " Actually, in the United States military there is a growing understanding that winning a war is not merely a matter of putting the most steel on target. In other words, there is greater emphasis on not just the operational level of analysis, but tying in larger strategic issues to the use of military force. Indeed, the Air Force’s latest Basic Doctrine Manual specifically states that success is war is measured by political and not military achievements. Nonetheless, the emphasis remains winning battles and defeating the opposing armed force. This is not an incorrect emphasis, per se, for the military’s primary job is to win battles. “ History provides two extremes of this phenomenon. The Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese allegedly never won a battle with American forces in Vietnam, yet they won the war. Conversely, Hannibal never lost a battle to the Romans during the Second Punic War (and inflicted a defeat of epic proportions at Cannae), yet he lost the war. 14  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 27 --- Therefore, it is important to develop the best way for military forces to achieve political objectives. As I noted above, there is little social science work concentrating on the relation o f particular military strategies and compellence. However, one political scientist, Robert Pape, Jr. has looked at how military strategie
