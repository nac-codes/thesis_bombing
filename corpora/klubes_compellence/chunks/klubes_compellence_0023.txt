ory is lacking. In 1992, Harold Winton, a professor o f Military History and Theory in the School of Advanced Airpower Studies (SAAS) at the United States Air Force Air University, wrote that he, "...became painfully aware in his efforts to construct a course in the military theory for the newly formed SAAS at the Air University: there simply does not exist any body of codified, systematic thought that can purport to be called a comprehensive theory o f air power."’ A comprehensive theory of air power would cover numerous topics ranging from the grand strategic to tactical level, from air superiority to power projection and including circumstances such as nuclear warfare and operations short o f war."* This dissertation will not be that comprehensive theory because it will focus solely on strategic bombing as a political instrument. Nonetheless, this dissertation was prompted in part by a lack o f a comprehensive air power theory.® ®  Admittedly, I do not address the debate over whether it is even possible to construct such a theory. 21  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 34 --- The development o f air power theory regarding strategic bombing has mirrored the ups and downs of such bombing over the last eighty years. Much of the work was done before or during World War II. Two sources of theory emerged during this time, operational commanders who generated theory "on-the-job" during both the First and Second World Wars, and more formal theorists working during the inter-war years. During and after World War I, there was hope that the air plane was a deliverance from the horrors of trench warfare. The limited results of World War I aviation were offset by a marked progression of airplane technology and increasing knowledge and skills concerning airplane employment. The first generation of theorists, exemplified by William Mitchell, Sir Hugh Trenchard, Guilo Douhet, Alexander De Seversky, were all vehement proponents of air power; so much so that they are often
