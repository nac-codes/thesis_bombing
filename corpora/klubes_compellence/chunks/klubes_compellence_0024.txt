The first generation of theorists, exemplified by William Mitchell, Sir Hugh Trenchard, Guilo Douhet, Alexander De Seversky, were all vehement proponents of air power; so much so that they are often considered to be more prophets than objective theorists. Nonetheless, they had some meaningful ideas which remain relevant. World War II disappointed air power’s most ardent supporters for strategic bombing’s ability to influence the course of the conflict was more limited than they had hoped. The subsequent development of nuclear weapons substantially modified thoughts and theory regarding air power. During this time strategic bombing became synonymous with nuclear warfare. The study o f air power theory languished even as the United States relied heavily on aerial bombing during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. It should not be too surprising that America’s use of air power as a compellent tool in these wars met with mixed results. 22  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 35 --- With the realization that nuclear warfare had not superseded conventional warfare, the need for air power theory re-emerged. But so far, the amount and depth of theory is still limited.® Yet all is not lost: the United States Air Foree recently established the School of Advanced Airpower Studies in an effort, among other things, to deal with the grand military-political issues regarding air power. The Birth of Strategic Bombing - World War I The first use of strategic bombing during World War I provided more o f a glimpse of air power’s potential rather than demonstrating an ability to influence the political realm. More than anything else, technical limitations mitigated strategic bombing’s effectiveness as a compellent tool. Despite the publicity and fear generated by the German bombing of Britain, during the four years of the war, Germany only launched some 100 raids, dropping 280 tons of bombs.® In contrast, during roughly the same time span in World War II, the United States Anny Air For
