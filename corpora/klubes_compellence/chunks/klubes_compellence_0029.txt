Other noteworthy theorists include: Edgar Gorrell, an American Army officer who, as one of the first air power thinkers, contributed incisive and enlightening analysis during World War I; John Slessor, a British officer who, as Trenchard’s protege, helped develop British air power strategy during the inter-war period; Basil Liddell Hart, although better known for his theories on the indirect approach of warfare, dabbled with air power in his book Paris, or the Future o f War (1925), in which he sweepingly proclaimed that because air power could leap over the battlefield to strike the heart o f a state, it would someday become predominant military branch; and numerous others who toiled in anonymity at the Air Corps Tactical School. However, Trenchard, Mitchell, and Douhet provide a representative group and cover the major theoretical tenets and positions. 27  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 40 --- for a few pamphlets late in his life. On the other hand, Mitchell and Douhet both wrote well known books and attracted attention through flam boyance.Ironically, while Douhet and Mitchell both owed a good deal of their education to Trenchard, Douhet and Mitchell’s influence on each other’s thoughts was probably minimal. Mitchell claimed never to have read Douhet and Douhet’s writings had little effect on the United States Army Air Corps thinking in the inter-war years.” While the three differed on details, they all foresaw strategic bombing as becoming one of the, if not the, dominant method to deliver military power. These men, especially Douhet and Mitchell, have been criticized for their exaggerated predictions of the efficacy of air power and the role air forces would play vis-a-vis the other military branches in future wars.*^ Consequently, their writings have often been readily dismissed. Yet it is wrong to discard their beliefs without detailed examination. While their writings included some very obvious errors, they had some remarkably prescient thoughts.
