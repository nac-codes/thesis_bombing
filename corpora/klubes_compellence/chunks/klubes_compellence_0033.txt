Most importantly, their ideas on strategic bombing added a new dimension to the traditional military doctrine that victory is obtained through the destruction of the enemy’s military forces.

Mitchell believed the opponent’s army was a "false objective" and the vital centers were the "real objectives".” In addition, Douhet had an interesting observation; the most difficult aspect o f strategic bombing was targeting. His discussion of the problem was brief and limited by the fact he offered no solutions other than pulverizing entire cities. Nevertheless, it holds extreme relevance to this dissertation. Douhet contended that. Objectives vary eonsiderably in war, and the choice of them depends chiefly upon the aim sought, whether the command of the air, paralyzing the enemy’s army and navy, or shattering the morale of civilians behind the lines.
