It is just here, in grasping these imponderables, in choosing enemy targets, the future commanders o f Independent Air Forces will show their ability.” For a man who overestimated the efficacy o f bombing so much, this admission is somewhat surprising, but quite accurate.

Parameters and conditions outside the confines o f strictly military considerations play an important role in the formulation of military strategy. Instead o f a single prescriptive strategy, Douhet recognized the need for adaptation. 32  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 45 --- One impact of these initial theorists is the continuing debate over whether strategic bombing should aim for punishing the opponent or negating his military capability. In general, Douhet and Trenchard advocated punishment, while Mitehell posited that capability would be a better target. To carry out their strategies, Trenchard and Douhet wanted strategic bombers to pulverize the opponent’s cities.
