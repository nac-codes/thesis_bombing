I will reserve precision bombing for the later "smart" weapons. 37  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 50 --- force was deemed superfluous. In addition, the Luftwaffe did not possess a codified doctrine on strategic bombing. When the Luftwaffe eventually turned to strategic bombing, it utilized a punishment method that was not terribly effective.
