Anyway, simply destroying industries in general was not enough. Area bombing failed to concentrate on the specific industries which were critical to the German war economy.®' The American Operation The American bombing strategy in World War II was heavily influenced by William Mitchell and was a result of the pre-war work at the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS). The ACTS was established in 1920 and became the think-tank for the Air Corps strategic bombing advocates. The doctrine and personnel emerging from the ACTS laid the foundation for the Army Air Force (AAF) strategy in 44  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 57 --- World War II. The doctrine was based on the belief that airplanes could reach deep into enemy land and strike the exposed vital centers. The destruction o f these vital centers could bring about the defeat of a modern, industrialized nation. Thus, air power should target the industries which support the enemy’s military to undermine the enemy’s capability and will to resist.®^ Area bombing to attack civilian morale was regarded as ineffective and a measure only o f last resort.® ® In mid-1941, President Roosevelt ordered the military to seriously plan for America’s military requirements if it entered the war.

The bombing offensive intended to debilitate Germany’s ability and will to resist and to support a probable invasion of Europe. The three primary targets of AWPD-1 were, 1) the electrical power system, 2) the transportation system (railroads, highways, and canals) and, 3) oil and petroleum system (both natural and synthetic). The neutralization o f the German air force was considered an overriding objective.®'* Although the German civilian
