The neutralization o f the German air force was considered an overriding objective.®'* Although the German civilian morale was also included, the AWPD-1 authors were not convinced o f the efficacy of morale attacks.®® Therefore, the AW PD-1  called for a concentrated effort to crush morale only after it had been substantially weakened by other military actions.®® Post-war analysis would show the AWPD-1’s target selection was phenomenally accurate in choosing what was vital and vulnerable in the German war economy. 45  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 58 --- Unfortunately, by the time AWPD-1 reached the operational stage it had been substantially modified in a torturous process. The first changes resulted in AWPD-42 (1942), in which the destruction of Germany’s aircraft industry to gain air superiority became the top priority. Also added to the target list were submarine yards, aluminum plants, and synthetic rubber plants.®’ The AWPD-42 was later modified at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, then by the Committee of Operations Analysis (COA), and finally the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO) Planning Team before significant operations occurred. The Combined Bomber Offensive Planning Team settled on six targets for the bombing campaign, in order o f priority, 1) aircraft production, 2) submarine yards, 3) ball bearings, 4) petroleum, 5) synthetic rubber and, 6) military transportation (the vehicles but not the system).®® Operations The first big effort by the American Army Air Force was bombing the ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt in August and October 1943." Ball-bearings are a vital component of all sophisticated machinery and the Germans had few ball­ bearing plants and only a limited stockpile. The destruction of the ball-bearing plants would indirectly neutralize a vital center of Germany, the industrial sector. ” A long-term, concentrated attack on the submar
