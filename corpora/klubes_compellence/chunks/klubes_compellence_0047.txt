and only a limited stockpile. The destruction of the ball-bearing plants would indirectly neutralize a vital center of Germany, the industrial sector. ” A long-term, concentrated attack on the submarine yards never materialized because the submarine crisis in the Atlantic passed before a significant bomber force was operational. 46  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 59 --- These attacks failed to destroy the German ball-bearing produetion capacity. The Army Air Force did not press the assault and the Germans were able to disperse and rebuild enough of the industry to prevent disruption of the ball-bearing supply.®" The attempt to disable the war economy by choosing a vulnerable "choke point" had failed. Due to heavy losses, the Army Air Force then deemed that establishing air superiority should be the top priority. Therefore, the bombers went after the German aircraft manufacturing industry in early 1944. While the bombers damaged this industry, again German resourcefulness made up for the losses. In fact, the Germans increased aircraft production.®" Air superiority was eventually achieved not through destruction o f industry, but by attriting the Luftwaffe in the air. The aerial defeat o f the Luftwaffe was a direct result o f the introduction of the P-51 fighter in early 1944. The P-51’s long range allowed it to fly throughout Germany, and its superior technical attributes meant it could outfly nearly all German fighters.®' During the spring and summer o f 1944, much o f the strategic bombing effort (both American and British) was diverted to support the Normandy invasion. Nonetheless, American bombers did launch some attacks on Germany’s petroleum system in May and June 1944. Unfortunately, the AAF were not able to concentrate on the oil system until after the Normandy breakout in August 1944. After this, the strategic bombing campaign hit its stride. The petroleum industry felt the full impact o f the bombers and suffered accordingly. Additionally, star
