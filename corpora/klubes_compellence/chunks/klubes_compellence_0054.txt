bombings is the indirect cost to the German war effort. Germany was forced to divert large amounts of increasingly scarce resources, armaments, and men to defend against the bombings and rebuild after the bombings. For example, some 20,000 of Germany’s fearsome 88mm guns were used for anti-aircraft work against strategic bombers.*® If not so utilized, they could have wreaked havoc with Allied and Soviet tanks. Without the diversion, more production in other critical areas would have occurred. Moreover, Germany’s air defence system was manned by a million men, who obviously could have been used elsewhere. Additionally, the Allied air superiority over France for D-Day was partially due to the Luftwaffe withdrawal to protect Germany from bombing. Although the Allies also had to devote considerable resources to the strategic bombing campaign, they had much more than Germany to spare. Consequently, the overall draining affect was a major accomplishment for strategic bombing. These contributions have often been ignored because they are indirect and difficult to quantify and assess.*" Indeed, the indirect benefits are rarely discussed or analyzed in bombing campaigns during any conflict. This, however, is a mistake and the Allied bombing of Germany is an example of the potential effects of draining resources. 54  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 67 --- Upon closer examination it becomes apparent that the Allied strategic bombing campaign could have been more effective. If the attack on the petroleum and transportation systems had begun earlier, the Germany war effort would probably have collapsed sooner,"” The independent compellence failure cannot be solely attributed to an inherent weakness o f strategic bombing; the misapplication of strategic bombing also played a role. In the final assessment, even if the bombing did not independently win the war, without a doubt it contributed to the victory. Most importantly, the United States Army Air Force concluded stra
