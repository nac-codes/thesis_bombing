the Army Air Force planned to conduct a selective strategic bombing campaign similar to the one in Europe.'™ The AAF hoped that the bombings could force a surrender, demonstrating the efficacy o f air power. Due to the need to build enough bombers (the new B-29 was the only bomber with sufficient range) and suitable airbases, the strategic bombing campaign did not get underway until June 1944. The first bombing raids were conducting from bases in China, which simply could not logistically support the heavy bombers. These raids did little damage and after the war were determined not to have even been worth the effort.'”' 58  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 71 --- Accordingly, the AAF concentrated on developing operations from the Marianas Islands. The first Marianas-based raid on Japan was launched in November 1944. The objectives of the campaign were to 1) cripple the Japanese air force through selective bombing, 2) destroy the war-making industry by selectively hitting targets and systems which were vital to the war effort, 3) destroy and undermine the social and economic structure o f the Japanese state by using selective bombing to attack those systems which are vital to the functioning of the Japanese state. The use of incendiary urban attacks was only to be considered as a last resort. There were also plans for attacking shipping, mainly via aerial dropped sea-mines.'”’ The selective bombing campaign did not go well. The B-29s first went after the aircraft manufacturing industry in late 1944 and early 1945. Teething problems with the B-29s and the new bases in the Marianas, in conjunction with high winds and bad weather which wreaked havoc with bombing accuracy, prevented the bombers from inflicting significant damage.'”®  Rather than continue selective bombing, the Army Air Force leadership decided to shift to urban area firebombing.’  The AAF was under pressure from the military and political leadership in Washington to show more results and incend
