Thermonuclear weapons were exponentially more powerful than the original fission devices and could destroy much o f the civilized world in a marmer of hours. These weapons challenged Clausewitz’s basic maxim on the nature of war. No longer could the ultimate end o f war be political objectives as nuclear warfare was too destructive.
