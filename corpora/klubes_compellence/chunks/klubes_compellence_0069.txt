h like a human body. Warden created a model to show the critical components of the system. This model had five strategic rings, the outermost shell being military forces, then population, infrastructure, organic essentials (Warden’s term for the economic targets such as key production facilities and the materials they produce, petroleum, and power plants) and the innermost circle being the military and civil leadership.'^® Warden, like Mitchell, believed that targeting the centers of gravity, especially organic essentials/key production, is the key to strategic bombing’s success. Indicative o f his military background. Warden stressed attacks on the military capability over more nebulous attempts at manipulating the morale and will to fight. He believed that military capability could be significantly degraded by air power’s unique ability to simultaneously and directly strike all five rings. Because o f this, air power should not focus on the fielded military forces, which tend to be 70  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 83 --- difficult targets for bombing to have a significant widespread affect (they are mobile, small, numerous, and designed to be hard to destroy). Anyway, the fielded military forces primary role is to protect the more important inner rings. Instead, airpower should attack the system as a whole, especially emphasizing the critical inner rings of leadership and key production. Warden recognized that the leadership ring is most critical. And not only because it runs the enemy’s military forces, but that it is the component that can concede/surrender, the key to compellence. However, he is wary of relying on direct bombing attacks due to the increasing difficulties in locating and eliminating enemy leaders. Applying sufficient indirect pressure to force the leadership to rationally choose to concede is often a better choice. To do so, devastating the organic essentials is the best way to exert compellent leverage because it would. I) lead to
