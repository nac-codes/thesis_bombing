due to its lack o f emphasis on attacking Iraqi ground forces in Kuwait.'""' Nevertheless, he did ask for Warden’s deputies to stay in Saudi Arabia to develop a strategic plan; they were the only ones who had any viable plan in August 1990. Thus, Warden’s theoretical concept of strategic bombing eventually played a critical role in Desert Storm. The Rise of the Civilian Intellectuals ‘  Warden’s concept has also been called "parallel warfare". Unlike sequential warfare, in which each of Warden’s rings are attacked in turn, parallel warfare calls for simultaneous attacks on each ring. Parallel warfare is not a new concept, but Warden’s theories demonstrate how air power effectively execute parallel warfare. See Col. Richard Szafranski, "Parallel War: Promise, Problems," Proceedings 121, no. 8 (August 1995): 57-61. 72  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 85 --- After World War II, national security studies and miliary strategy theory were no longer the sole domain of military personnel.'"" A diverse group of civilian academicians and analysts, mainly political scientists and historians (but with contributions from economists and "hard" scientists, especially physicists) became involved in strategic studies. In fact, civilians seem to have supplanted the military in the theoretical aspect of using military force. In the years immediately following World War II, nuclear warfare theory dominated the civilian literature. Much is not of particular interest because it examines such subjects as the value o f nuclear weapons in international relations, coercion and deterrence with nuclear weapons (which, as previously noted, is substantially different from coercion and deterrence with conventional weapons), escalation, and whether nuclear wars can be limited. Nevertheless, there was some pertinent theoretical development regarding how to use military force. Nuclear weapons presented a fundamental challenge to the presumption that the object of war is to achieve a polit
