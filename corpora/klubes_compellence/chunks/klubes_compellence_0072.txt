there was some pertinent theoretical development regarding how to use military force. Nuclear weapons presented a fundamental challenge to the presumption that the object of war is to achieve a political objective. A high- volume nuclear exchange would be far too destructive. Even a limited exchange would wreak catastrophic damage which could only be worthwhile if the stakes were extremely high. Therefore, nuclear weapons could not used in the same general manner as conventional weapons, in other words, the more the better. The ascendancy of nuclear weapons forced a wholesale assessment o f how military conflict fit into the dynamics of inter-state interaction. Previous military analysis almost without exception concentrated on the battlefield. But thinking shifted to 73  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 86 --- wider military-political concepts such as how valuable were nuclear weapons, how valuable was nuclear-armed military force, and crisis management. Bargaining and Coercion This outburst of new ideas inevitably spilled over into the conventional weapon aspect o f war. The ever-increasing number of civilians, with diverse intellectual backgrounds, infused a wealth o f new ideas and approaches into the study of war. Although nearly all the literature was limited to either coercion or crises, it had two relevant contributions.* *  The first was the codification o f theory concerning the use o f military force as a bargaining tool. This clarified and created a more formal theoretical structure for a previously vague and ambiguous conceptual approach to using force. Secondly, there was discussion and identification o f causal factors involved in bargaining and coercion. An important part o f this new diversity was Thomas Schellingâ€™s belief that most conflicts between states are essentially bargaining situations. Consequently, conflict analysis could be reduced to a study o f bargaining factors. " Crisis behavior examines the period of time of heightened te
