er strategies, deterrence and coercion. Generally, but not always, compellence and deterrence are the converse o f each other, one offensive and one defensive. Coercion can include both compellent and deterrent aspects.'"*® Although my definition of compellence is more expansive than Schelling’s, its origins lies in Schelling’s writings. It is important to remember punishment can be inflicted in a variety o f ways and is often a secondary affect of targeting capability. For example, striking the enemy’s military facilities weakens his military capability, but delivers punishment as well. Pulverizing the enemy’s economic infrastructure can undermine his ability to support its military and it can decrease civilian morale. But it also is a clear form of punishment. 75  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 88 --- Schelling’s seminal works spawned countless other research efforts into bargaining’s role in conflict. Development o f the bargaining process was important because it identified causal factors which set up the political contextual parameters for conflicts. Furthermore, these factors have been used in attempts to explain and/or predict coercion success and failure. Although every author seems to use slightly different terminology, examination o f a number of works, especially Schelling’s and Glenn Synder and Paul Diesing’s Conflict Among Nations sheds light on the bargaining causal factors.'"*"* The most commonly used factors are interests, values, risk, resolve, and commitment. Unfortunately, not only are these factors closely related but authors tend to use only some of them, combine them, and/or have different meanings for the same term, creating a semantic headache. Rather than attempt to untangle all the variations, I will simply integrate them into interests and resolve." It is important not to get bogged down in specific categorizations between what should be considered interests or resolve or whether commitment and risk should be separate elements.
