cluded coercive diplomacy is highly contextual and surmised that its complexity rendered it difficult to operationalize and execute successfully. Nevertheless, they discovered a set of conditions which favor successful coercive diplomacy: 1) strength of motivation of compelling state, 2) asymmetry of motivation favoring compelling state, 3) clarity of objectives, 4) sense of urgency to achieve objectives, 5) adequate domestic support, 6) usable military option, 7) opponent’s fear o f unacceptable escalation, 8) clarity concerning precise terms of settlement, 9) international support, 10) strong leadership.'"*^ Nearly all of the conditions fall under the rubric o f bargaining factors, such as balance of interest and resolve and manipulation o f risks.

A good deal of the coercion/bargaining inquiry simplifies governmental decision-making.^ The opposing state’s government always seems to be a rational, unitary actor who decisions are based solely on a careful, calculated cost-to-benefit evaluation of external factors. These assumptions greatly ease analysis and discussion, especially quantitative analysis o f conflict management.
