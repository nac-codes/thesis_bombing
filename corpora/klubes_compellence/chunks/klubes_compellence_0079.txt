(via its most common application, strategic bombing) is to employ a strategy o f military denial by exploiting the targeted state’s military vulnerability. Accordingly, if the victim state can be denied the military capability to secure the territory at issue (the most common expression of political objectives) coercion can be achieved. ^  Pape uses coercion so I decided to adhere to his terminology for this section. But his coercion is more limited than my compellence. Pape’s coercion attempts to achieve political objectives before a complete military victory. My compellence strives to achieve political objectives regardless of military outcome. 80  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 93 --- Pape believed that the traditional explanations of coercion are inadequate, those being balance of interest, balance of resolve, balance o f military forces, and risk o f punishment.'®® Successful coercion rests on being able to increase costs so they outweigh benefits. To increase the cost one must exploit vulnerabilities of the opposing state. The two most prominent vulnerabilities of a state are the civilian (which apparently includes the economic system in addition to the civilian population) and military sectors. Nuclear coercion rests on its ability to inflict punishment on an apocalyptic scale to the civilian sector. Conventional weapons cannot cause that much destruction and states are willing to endure quite a bit of punishment. Therefore, punishment strategies which exploit "civilian" vulnerability with conventional weapons are not very effective. Instead, their coercive capability lies in exploiting the opponent’s military vulnerability and negating his military capability. To make his case, Pape identifies three strategies that a coercer can undertake with strategic bombing. Two o f them, figuratively named Douhet and Schelling (or punishment and risk), exploit civilian vulnerability. The Douhet strategy calls for a massive blow aimed at the civilians, basica
