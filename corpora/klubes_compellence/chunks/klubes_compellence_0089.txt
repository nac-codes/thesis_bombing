for all scenarios. The strategy has less affect when the targeted state is not industrial nor conducting an intense, mechanized military operation. As Rolling Thunder during the Vietnam War perfectly illustrated, this strategy is not very effective when the targeted state is agrarian and using only an infantry force. Additionally, the political situation may not allow for widespread destruction within the opposing state. To be effective the economic infrastructure strategy must inflict considerable damage. This damage may not be commensurate with limited political objectives. Finally, the destruction of the economic infrastructure may not necessarily help to achieve the desired military objectives (especially if they are limited and can be attained quickly). The economic infrastructure strategy is most appropriate for, and effective in, long-term, high intensity, mechanized conflicts 92  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 105 --- where considerable interests are at stake. Obviously, not all conflicts are of this nature. Parallel Warfare John Warden used his five-ring model to create a theory o f strategic bombing that is essentially parallel warfare strategy. It has only been used in modified form during the Gulf War, which complicates analytical efforts. However, being similar to Mitchell’s economic infrastructure, this strategy appears to face many o f the same difficulties. Most importantly, it seems to be intended more for larger conflicts than smaller ones as it calls for widespread attacks. The problem o f objective overkill was demonstrated during its only application. The U.S. struck a wide range of targets within Iraq whose affect on the battlefield situation in Kuwait/southern Iraq was probably not that great. For example, wrecking bridges in Baghdad probably did not add much to the ability o f the U.S. to retake Kuwait or destroy the Republican Guard. Again, it may not be politically feasible to thoroughly degrade a state’s ability to function in
