n o f targets in the civilian sector, i.e. economic infrastructure, may simply be written off as a casualty of war. Governments may be more swayed by attacks on the military sector because if sufficient destruction occurs the targeted state will not be able to achieve its objective. Shock Strategy Like the punishment strategy, the shock strategy suffers from the unpredictability of people. It is difficult to assess when a civilian population and/or its leadership will be susceptible to a shock strategy. They are often more resilient than anticipated. And like the punishment strategy, it is hard to determine what targets will have sufficient psychological effect. Therefore, it has had mixed 96  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 109 --- results. The bombing o f Dresden did not hasten the German surrender, but the bombing of Rome contributed to the fall o f Mussolini and hence the Italian surrender. Worse, the shock strategy’s failure are quite recognizable and dramatic. These problems probably have pushed most analysts away from focusing on this strategy. S m art W eapons The problem in analyzing the smart weapon (also known as precision-guided munitions) based strategies is limited usage. Although Germany first used guided munitions during World War II (in very small numbers), these weapons have only seen widespread use in two conflicts, the Vietnam War (specifically, the 1972 Linebacker campaigns) and the Gulf War. A few smart weapons were expended other in conflicts such as the 1986 United States bombing of Libya and the Iran- Iraq War. Obviously, precision-guided munitions enhance the compelling state’s bombing capability, destroying far more in significantly less time and with far less expenditure of resources and planes. More importantly, they may eventually provide new strategies and methods of applying strategic bombing. Ultimately, however, they may simply increase the efficiency o f the old strategies. Although it is still early to assess their full
