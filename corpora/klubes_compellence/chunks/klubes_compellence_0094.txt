provide new strategies and methods of applying strategic bombing. Ultimately, however, they may simply increase the efficiency o f the old strategies. Although it is still early to assess their full impact with much certainty, I will draw some preliminary conclusions later in the text. 97  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 110 --- Military Denial Pape’s theory that the most effective way to exert coercive leverage is by exploiting military vulnerability is essentially correct. Nonetheless, Pape’s analysis, and therefore theory, is too narrow. A figurative "step back" from the military versus civilian vulnerability debate would be most illuminating. It is important to look for why things occur in a more general sense. Pape concludes that denying military capability is the most effective way to exploit military vulnerability and hence to facilitate coercion. Therefore, Pape believes the military aspect is the most important and vulnerable aspect o f a state at war. But the vulnerability concept has some problems. First of all, strategic bombing has not totally failed to have an impact on the civilian population. It has had some effect in states where the war was already extremely unpopular and/or when the population perceives utter defenseless. Both in England during World War I and Italy during World War II, the population’s adverse reaction to the bombing influenced their respective governments. Britain was able to withstand the pressure, but it most likely hastened the Italian surrender. Nor are all authoritative governments oblivious to civilian misery; the destruction of Japan’s cities affected some segments of the Japanese government. The problem is determining when there is sufficient civilian discontent to make population susceptible to pressure via aerial bombardment.
