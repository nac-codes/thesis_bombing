Nonetheless, their destruction also has enormous effect on the standard of living of the population and the economic system of the targeted state. This creates an indirect mechanism o f punishment against the civilian sector. Even if unintended, the United States strategic bombing operation resulted in both the decimation of Iraqâ€™s military potential and inflicting considerable punishment on the Iraqi state and society. Finally, attributing the actions o f a government to one factor, be it either military impotence or inability to endure more punishment, can be overly simplistic. Successful compellence rests on a decision by the opposing government to capitulate. Although complete military defeats and subsequent territorial occupation can make the decision relatively easy (really more of an acceptance of reality), these rarely occur. More often than not, decisions are much more difficult to make. Governments, as well as people, rarely make decisions based on a single causality. Few governments have a single decision making actor, instead having a number of influential actors (both people and organizations). One factor may predominate the reasoning for a decision, but there might well be a whole host o f lesser reasons that also play persuasive roles.^ Simply because punishment is not the key reason for a decision does not mean it did not play an important role. Additionally, it can be extremely difficult to assess how significant each factor plays in a decision. Punishment may be an important underlying cause for decision, but because it is not as overt or dramatic as loss of capability it may be too hastily pushed to the wayside. 100  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 113 --- The Bargaining Side One of the problems with the air power theories is the
