War is an extension of politics, yet the aforementioned air power strategists tend to ignore the political situation (Pape being an exception).

Military force may affect the situation, but the objectives are political and success rests on a favorable decision by the targeted stateâ€™s government (an inherently political act).

A detailed examination and testing of the bargaining factors is a substantially different research effort. I will continue the use o f these factors for two reasons; 1) many esteemed scholars have conc
