detailed examination and testing of the bargaining factors is a substantially different research effort. I will continue the use o f these factors for two reasons; 1) many esteemed scholars have concluded they have significant explanatory ability, and 2) they are extremely pertinent to my discussion. What Am 1 Seeking? First of all, I want to show that the military situation can affect the outcome of compellence. A state without a usable military option would be hard pressed to execute a successful compellence operation. However, as I am not limiting myself to strictly coercive diplomacy, my initial belief is that this is not surprising. As a policy becomes more of coercion and even the traditional military strategy, the military aspect will grow in importance. Consequently, the significance o f selecting the best military strategy should also increase. I merely wish to demonstrate this is happening and, if possible, show that even in coercive diplomacy selecting the proper military strategy is important. ^  That research would be a dissertation unto itself. Robert Pape demonstrated that the bargaining factors, specifically balance of interest, risk, and forces, are poor singular predictors o f coercion. O f course, this is a simplification as nearly all of literature combines two or more of the bargaining factors (for example see George, et alâ€™s, work on coercive diplomacy). While the bargaining factors are limited individually, in combination, they may be more effective predictors. 102  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 115 --- I then want to focus on the operational side o f strategic bombing. Douhet, Trenchard, Mitchell, and Pape were all attempting to determine the best way to conduct strategic bombing. Each o f them posited that by striking a certain aspect of a state, objectives (either military or political) could be achieved. The differences in their respective arguments stem from what each thinks is most important to a state during a conflict, and
