the amount of equipment committed to the operation. It is not always rewarding to compare failures based on mistaken strategy with those due to qualitative inferiority.®® This causes a bias toward post-World War II cases, which tend to feature qualitatively superior air forces, but I discussed World War II and other prior examples in the previous chapter. Moreover, the Iran-Iraq War is included as a specific example of how failure to utilize fully the equipment on hand can severely limit an otherwise sound strategy. ®  I readily admit that strategy and operations are not mutually exclusive and can significantly affect each other. Strategy, however, is the core o f this dissertation and I want to focus on that as much as possible. ®  An example of this issue is the difference between the failure of the German strategic bombing in World War I and the failure of the Allied effort against Germany in World War II. The objectives of the two campaigns were similar, but the German effort in World War I was simply not capable o f significantly disrupting British industrial production or wreaking sufficient damage to enough cities to demoralize the entire population. The Allied bombers in World War II eventually crippled the Germany economy, but strategic bombing could have had more of impact if used differently. I am much more interested in the failure in World War II, which could be ascribed to strategy rather than in World War I, in which perfect strategy probably could not have been able to overcome the primitive air power. 106  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 119 --- Using these criteria a pool of cases was created, which are as follows (discounting World War I & II which I have already discussed): 1) United States bombing in Korean War, 1950-1953 2) United States bombing of North Vietnam, 1965-1968 (the Rolling Thunder campaign) 3) United States bombing of North Vietnam, 1972 (the Linebacker II campaign) 4) Israel’s bombing of Egypt during the War of Attrition
