y denial, and economic infrastructure strategies. Furthermore, the Vietnam conflict aptly demonstrates the limitations of air power, while concurrently showing when it can be effective.

Therefore, 1 decided to include an appendix to briefly summarize the Korean War, the Lebanon raid, and the Persian Gulf War. These cases will add even more data to my conclusions. For example, the Lebanon strike aptly demonstrates how not to conduct a shock strategy. The appendix will also demonstrate the validity o f my conclusions across a wider spectrum of historical examples. Questions As per the focused case comparison method, it is critical to construct a set o f questions to apply to each example. One of the problems with the early efforts in this field was the tendency to analyze either the political or the military. Instead, it is important to examine the military and political situations independently and then analyze they affected each other.
