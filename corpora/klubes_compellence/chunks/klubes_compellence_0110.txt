eep strikes in April 1970. During the final phase o f the war, from April to August 1970, Israel still hoped to compel Egypt to end the war. However, the air war took on a more tactical character as the fighting focused on air control over the Suez Canal area between Israeli planes and Egyptian/Soviet air defense units. The lAF found itself in an attritional war against air defense units with a seemingly endless supply of Soviet missiles. Facing unacceptable losses and pressure from the United States, in late July of 1970 the Israeli government decided to accept a U.S. ceasefire proposal. Egypt had already agreed to the proposal mainly because it had achieved enough its goals and was taking a fearsome pounding. The War of Attrition ended on 8 August 1970.

For all the damage it wreaked on Egypt, air power failed to compel a swift end to the war. The deep strikes even caused more harm than good by bringing the Soviet Union into the conflict. Eventually, air power did contribute to the ceasefire because Egypt wanted to end the severe costs o f the bombing in order to prepare for its cross-Canal attack. Although Israel was able to partially exploit the vulnerability o f the Egyptian state to aerial bombardment, it was unable to exploit any one part of the state sufficiently to exert enough compellent leverage to achieve its objectives.
