he Suez Canal would also neutralize Israel’s qualitative superiority by preventing a maneuver war unless Israel wanted to mount a large scale crossing of the Canal. Such an invasion of Egypt would be a major escalation and would most likely draw a severe reaction from the Soviets, something Israel hoped to avoid. Egypt’s operational plan delineated a four stage operation. The first stage would be attrition, a six to eight week period of massive shelling to destroy large parts of the Bar Lev Line and infliet heavy casualties." Limited commando raids would follow to complete the destruction of the Bar Lev Line. The third stage " Not surprisingly, at the time, Henry Kissinger, the U.S. National Security Advisor, was convinced that the Soviets supported continued fighting in the Middle East to further its interests. Recent scholarship overwhelmingly indicates this was not the case. The Soviets simply did not get into public fights with their clients over policy as much as the United States so it seemed as if the Soviets fully supported Egypt’s War of Attrition. " The Bar Lev line was Israel’s response to the Egyptian threat along the Suez Canal. The line was series of 30 small fortifications placed approximately 10 kilometers apart along the east bank of the Canal. Each was designed to protect some 20 soldiers from even heavy artillery fire. They would act as outposts and with associated earthen works provide the first line of, and foundation for, a mobile defense in depth of the Sinai. It was by no means a replica of the Maginot Line as it was not intended to stop an Egyptian crossing. While the forts provided the Egyptians with easy targets, they provided very effective protection from artillery and mortar fire. 124  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 137 --- would feature larger units conducting deeper raids into the Sinai. The final stage was the major cross-Canal assault. It is important to note that Egypt did not plan for a static war of attrition, instead
