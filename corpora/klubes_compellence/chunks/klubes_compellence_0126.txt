and the cross-Canal assault was postponed indefinitely. Therefore, Egypt shifted from a tactic o f attrition as a prelude to the cross-Canal assault to a strategy of eontinual attrition.®* Egypt’s primary method o f applying pressure on Israel by inflicting casualties was not working well either. The lA F’s attacks on Egypt’s artillery neutralized its most effective attrition weapon. Instead of being on the offense, Egypt was forced into a defensive war in which it had no defense against Israel’s primary weapon. Yet, Nasser decided not to end the conflict. Egypt had three basic options, stop the war, accept the Rogers Plan (a ceasefire proposal by the United States), or continue the war. Nasser rejected the first two options, eonsidering them to be 132  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 145 --- tantamount to a humiliating defeat.®" Although the Rogers Plan was closer to Egypt’s demands than Israel’s, Nasser believed that because Egypt was still in an inferior position vis-a-vis Israel the Rogers Plan would be a surrender to an imposed settlement.®" Moreover, there were indications that the Egyptian military would not tolerate another defeat with the attendant loss o f face.®' Consequently, Egypt continued the attritional warfare. After the lAF neutralized their artillery, the Egyptians turned to mortars and small arms. Being more mobile, easier to conceal, and requiring less manpower and logistical support, it was nearly impossible for aerial bombing to fully stop these weapons. In fact, October 1969, during the height o f the lAF campaign, had the greatest number of shooting incidents initiated by Egypt of any month in 1969.®’ However, these arms were not as effective as artillery in producing Israeli casualties. Then the number o f incidents initiated by Egypt dropped sharply in November and December 1969.®’ The intense lAF bombing was beginning to affect Egypt’s ability to use even smaller arms. In addition, Nasser attempted to relieve the pressure on Eg
