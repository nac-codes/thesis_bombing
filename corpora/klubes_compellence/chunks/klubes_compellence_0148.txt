replenished their client’s ravaged military anyway. In addition, Israel suffered more political losses as a result of superpower pressure than Egypt. 155  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 168 --- Analysis of A ir Power Clearly, air power failed to deliver a political victory for Israel. But the failure might be due more to the Israeli leadership rather than a definitive failure of aerial bombing. The Israeli government’s inability to translate a military success within the bounds o f a limited war into a political victory was the crucial problem. The search for the elusive decisive triumph that would force Egypt to accept Israel’s strategic superiority was self-defeating as constraints prevented such a victory. It is important to understand that Israel may not have perceived their demands to be decisive, but Nasser did. This perception made a political settlement on Israel’s terms a highly difficult accomplishment. Israel failed to develop a strategy that would compel Egypt to end the war on Israel’s terms. With diplomacy totally unproductive, Israel relied on military force as its main compellent tool. The continual desire to keep this conflict as limited as possible and reduce its costs and commitment led Israel to turn to air power. But the same desires also precluded such bombing strategies as pulverizing cities or devastating the economic infrastructure. Nearly every Egyptian target within range of Israeli planes was vulnerable, but this did not mean the civilian, military, and leadership vulnerabilities could be exploited. Finally, the bombing was generally limited to attacking only one center o f gravity, fielded military forces. Except for the in-depth strikes, the lAF confined the bombings to within 50 km or so of the Suez Canal.
