military, especially the Air Force, for a traditional strategic bombing operation based on their World War II experience. The bombing would eliminate the North’s capability to support the war by destroying the economic infrastructure o f North Vietnam. Moreover, the impact of the destruction o f North Vietnam’s industrial sector, power production facilities, and key transportation nodes (i.e., ports) would shatter its will to fight.® An economic infrastructure strategy aimed to both affect the battlefield situation and persuade the North Vietnamese to change its behavior by delivering pain. Conceptually, this 168  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 181 --- strategy fell between interdiction and punishment, but entailed a much wider bombing campaign than the other strategies. The concepts o f severing North Vietnam’s ability to supply the southern war and inflicting so much punishment that North Vietnam would eventually grow tired of the war were crucial factors in the planning o f the entire Rolling Thunder campaign. Although the Air Force pushed hard for the economic infrastructure strategy, it was initially deferred. When Rolling Thunder yielded few positive results, the economic infrastructure strategy became more prominent. But Johnson never made a decisive shift to an economic infrastructure strategy. He instead adopted a "slow squeeze" that gradually bombed more targets. Nonetheless, the U.S. eventually bombed most of North Vietnam’s facilities that were associated with a modern economy. O f course, there was also the issue o f determining which targets to bomb. The interdiction and economic infrastructure strategies are easy to translate into operational plans; the transportation system and the industrial base, communication systems, power production, petroleum stockpiles, etc, respectively. However, it is more difficult to construct a plan that aims to inflict pain as its primary goal. Targets o f military value may not be of significant value to the
