Targets o f military value may not be of significant value to the state as a whole. So it was necessary to determine what was considered valuable by the North Vietnamese, especially the North Vietnamese government. Many people in the U.S. government and military believed Hanoi considered the North’s industrial sector to 169  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 182 --- be o f vital importance. Thus, much of U.S.’ effort to deliver pain to North Vietnam revolved around bombing its industry. In addition, there was the question o f how quickly to hit these targets. A swift attack would be more sound militarily. Yet, the theory underpirming the punishment strategy calls for a gradual attack to allow for greater flexibility in bargaining. In operation. North Vietnam would see the obvious progression of Rolling Thunder and negotiate before total destruction. Furthermore, the U.S. government worried about the problem of "killing the hostage." If Rolling Thunder quickly destroyed all of the seemingly important targets in North Vietnam and it did not enter negotiations, the U.S. would face the dilemma o f what to do next. Thus, a gradual destruction of high-value targets would let the U.S. use the threat of future bombings to help compel North Vietnam.^ The possibility of negative reactions both domestically and internationally also played an important role in determining target selection and contributed to the policy of gradual escalation. The U.S. government wanted to avoid provoking a major Soviet and/or Chinese reaction. The possibility o f a Chinese or Soviet intervention led the U.S. to generally avoid bombing in North Vietnam’s two most important cities, Hanoi and Haiphong, and close to the Chinese border. It also led the U.S. to initially curb strikes on high-profile targets such as North Vietnam’s industrial and power production
