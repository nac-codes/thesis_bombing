punishment strategies. The military denial concept was thwarted by its inability to exert leverage in this war of attrition. Traditional attacks on the transportation system and the economic infrastructure could not disrupt the Communists’  war effort. The punishment strategy was emasculated by 174  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 187 --- the lack of high value targets in the DRV and the North Vietnamese’s extreme resolve. Bombing was simply not suited to pressuring North Vietnam during this period. Moreover, the lack o f success in the ground war contributed to the failed compellent effort. Rolling Thunder was only intended to be one part o f the overall operation and would have been bolstered by a more successive ground war. For example, the interdiction campaign was weakened by the lack of continual pressure on Viet Cong/North Vietnamese Army (VC/NVA) forces in the south. Without sufficient pressure, these units needed fewer supplies, which could be handled by North Vietnam’s beleaguered transportation system. The more supplies needed, the easier it is for interdiction to be effective. Nor was the counterinsurgency endeavor overly successful. In sum, during the Rolling Thunder campaign, the U.S. and South Vietnam were never able to convince North Vietnam it was about to lose the war. Consequently, North Vietnam had little need to negotiate a settlement short of victory. This case shows that a viable military option is vital to compellence. Simply having military superiority does not automatically mean a military option exists. Without question the U.S. had a more powerful military than North Vietnam. But the U.S. was unable to wield this tool in a successful manner in a limited, compellent war. The U.S. never developed a useful strategy which would achieve its desired compellence. 175  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 188 --- Prelude to Rolling Thunder The United States involvement in Southeast Asia had been growing since the end of World War
