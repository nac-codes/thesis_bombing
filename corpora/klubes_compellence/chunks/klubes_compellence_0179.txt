st. North Vietnam’s leadership, and a poor estimate o f their resolve. 188  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 201 --- The U.S. government clearly underestimated its opponent’s resolve. The DRV was very motivated and was willing to endure considerable sacrifice to unify Vietnam. Many of the North’s leaders had been fighting for unification for over twenty years, first against the French, then South Vietnam, and finally the U.S. Their lives were devoted to this cause and by 1965 they had fully committed the DRV to fighting in the South. Changing their fundamental policy objective was not going to be easy.^’  Most o f the U.S. government decision-makers failed to recognize the highly nationalistic force driving Hanoi, instead believing this was just another battle in the effort to contain communism. These same U.S. officials also believed they understood North Vietnam’s decision-making calculations of costs-versus-benefits. Consequently, they concluded the North Vietnamese would be willing to give up their objective under the threat of painful bombings.^^ However, the North’s leaders viewed unification as an absolute value, not a relative one simply to be bargained away at the first sign o f trouble.®^ This basic fact would plague U.S. efforts throughout the entire Vietnam conflict. But this alone does not explain the failure o f Rolling Thunder. Some authors point to some of the seemingly incoherent actions and the lack of coordination between military and political moves.'^'* O f course, some chaos is to be expected whenever a government as large and complex as the U.S.’  attempts anything. Moreover, it is always difficult to make sure your opponent accurately perceives your intended signals. But Johnson and his advisers should have been aware o f the difficulties of orchestrating such a subtle operation and taken pains to 189  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 202 --- insure that their signals were being sent and perceived as accurately as possible.
