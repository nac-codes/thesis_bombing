Like the Germans at Verdun, the U.S. hoped to bleed its enemy white.™ Concurrently, the role of Rolling Thunder shifted more toward an interdiction campaign aimed at North Vietnam’s transportation and logistical infrastructure. This would complement the strategy o f attrition as the bombing would deprive the VC/NVA units of support as the fighting heated up. Therefore, Rolling Thunder’s emphasis as the primary military force in the compellent effort dwindled. The bombing shifted from coercive diplomacy to being a part of the more general attempt at compellence via a broad application of military power.’® However, not everyone agreed with keeping Rolling Thunder as an interdiction campaign. Since 1964, the Air Force had advocated striking the list of 94 "strategic" targets in North Vietnam that were considered the key components of its war-making capacity such as industrial, power production, and key transportation nodes.They  also recommended attacking the POL (petroleum, oil, and lubricants) storage system. The Air Force was convinced that destroying North Vietnam’s small economic infrastructure and oil supplies, while also cutting o ff international support, would deprive the DRV of its ability to wage war.
