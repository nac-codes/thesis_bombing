were prohibited.*® Additionally, McNamara permitted only a few strikes in the highly populated northeast quadrant of North Vietnam.®® Most of the lucrative targets on the Air Force’s list were in these areas, including North Vietnam’s industrial sector and important transportation junctions. Moreover, the port facilities of Haiphong, the major port for importing supplies from the Soviet Union and China, were neither bombed nor mined. Not only was the interdiction operation hampered by these restrictions, but the concept of a strategic bombing campaign was emasculated and the amount of punishment the U.S. could inflict was significantly limited. Rolling Thunder was an interdiction campaign with some elements o f an economic infrastructure strategy, all underpinned by the punishment strategy. The Bombing Pause in the Winter of 1965-1966 During the rest o f 1965, Washington discovered that Rolling Thunder functioned poorly in its interdiction role. For example, U.S. intelligence discovered that by November 1965 North Vietnam had infiltrated far more troops than predicted.®’ The inherent resistance of North Vietnam’s transportation network to 197  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 210 --- disruption via bombing, in concert with the typically low intensity of the fighting and the increasingly large supply efforts by the Soviets and Chinese, made it very difficult for Rolling Thunder to have a significant effect as an interdiction operation. By late 1965, some o f Johnson’s advisers, led by McNamara, convinced him of the need for a bombing pause.*® This was clearly part of the punishment strategy as a pause has no purpose in an economic infrastructure or interdiction strategy. The debate over whether to pause Rolling Thunder was particularly contentious. The Joint Chiefs of Staff argued against any pause, not wanting to reduce the pressure on North Vietnam.®^ In fact, they wanted to dramatically escalate Rolling Thunder into an economic infrastructure campaign to
