its oil at only thirteen sites, meaning it was extremely vulnerable to a swift bombing operation. Finally, the most important targets were within the previous sanctuary boundaries o f Hanoi and Haiphong. Bombing within these arbitrary lines would signal a strengthening of U.S. resolve.'®’ Due to its many advantages the POL system became the target o f consensus. By April, Johnson decided to allow limited bombings of POL storage sites and other high value targets (including bridges and a cement plant previously off 201  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 214 --- limits). However, political turmoil in South Vietnam and a concerted, though unsuccessful, effort by the international community to bring the U.S. and the DRV to the negotiating table postponed begirming o f the POL operation until 24 June 1966.'®® The operation lasted only two months and concentrated on the POL storage sites. It did not attempt to close the ports through which Soviet oil was transported, meaning oil could still be brought into the DRV. The operation seemed successful initially. Within three weeks almost 60 percent of North Vietnam’s original POL storage was destroyed and by the end o f July approximately 70 percent was destroyed.'®® After July, the operation wound down as the largest, most lucrative concentrations had been struck and the remaining POL was stored in small, dispersed sites. These storage areas were simply too costly to attack as they were protected by increasingly heavy air defenses and were very difficult to find and bomb with high-performance jets. But even the destruction of 70 percent of the POL did not significantly decrease North Vietnam’s ability to support the war in the south. The needs o f the fighting forces were so little and the surplus in the supply system so much that that even this high level o f destruction was not effective. Nor did this operation inflict sufficient pain through disruption of its economy that Hanoi decided to negotiate. The POL bombin
