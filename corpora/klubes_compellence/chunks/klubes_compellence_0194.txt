Unfortunately, the VC/NVA had superior tactical mobility and could repeatedly avoid intense combat. The sheer size o f the American operations, combined with poor security, meant that the VC/NVA almost always knew when and where they would take place. And whenever American forces won a battle and inflicted heavy casualties, the VC/NVA melted into the dense, underpopulated jungles of South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia to replenish and rebuild.

As the VC/NVA could control their casualty figures. ’ Although this strategy has received much criticism, he did not have many alternatives. Westmoreland was not able to take the war to the enemy, at their bases in Laos, Cambodia and North Vietnam, to force and win a decisive battle of annihilation as per standard Army doctrine and his own military experience.
