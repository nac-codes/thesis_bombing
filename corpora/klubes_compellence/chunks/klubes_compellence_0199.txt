ent. Regardless, they apparently believed the escalation was a specific attempt by the U.S. to bully them.™ ® Interestingly, the U.S. government had placed so much faith in being able to signal Hanoi o f its intentions and threats in 1965, yet in 1966 failed to appreciate Hanoi’s perception of Rolling Thunder. The bombing had succeeded in becoming a signaling device, just not with message the U.S. intended. By the end of 1967, the North Vietnamese were convinced the U.S. escalated Rolling Thunder whenever the DRV showed any interest in negotiations. Apparently, Hanoi believed the U.S. considered a desire to talk as a weakness and wanted to exploit it with increased bombings.™' This demonstrated the difficulties in signaling with military force and coordinating diplomatic and military actions. There was probably not a concerted effort to sabotage the negotiations in December 1966, just a lack of cooperation and awareness of what other government departments were doing.™’ Early 1967 saw diplomatic efforts to begin serious negotiations through the British, the Soviets and even a personal letter exchange between Johnson and Ho Chi Minh. However, all these ventures came to naught and served to disillusion both the U.S. and the DRV.
