simple and labor-intensive transportation that was inefficient but flexible. Most o f the transportation infrastructure consisted o f dirt roads and trails which were essentially impossible to destroy with aerial bombing. There were few large, lucrative, groupings of mobile targets (trucks, trains, boats, bicycles, etc.) and also few valuable fixed targets, i.e., bridges and railroads, and even the bridges proved difficult to destroy (until the advent o f laser-guided bombs in 1972).'®® Hanoi mobilized its primary resource, people, to use brute manpower to move supplies southward, rebuild any damage, and expand the existing system.'®" The interdiction campaign was not a total failure. It did increase the cost of moving supplies considerably. Besides destruction o f supplies, the most noticeable cost was manpower diversion. U.S. estimates range up to somewhere between 1 and 1.5 million North Vietnamese being forced to work (many only part-time) on the war effort, primarily to repair the transportation system and for air defenses.'"" These people could not work on farms and able-bodied young men were sidetracked from military duty. Although the diversion factor was not unimportant, it never became a critical problem.'"' There were enough men in North Vietnam to meet military needs because most of the fighting was done by the Viet Cong. The 228  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 241 --- interdiction campaign also drained away resources that could be used much better elsewhere. Rolling Thunder did inflict some $600 million worth o f damage on North Vietnam. But North Vietnam received approximately $2 billion in foreign aid, more than offsetting the bombings’ destruction.'"’ The U.S. soon realized the limitations o f interdiction as a mechanism of military denial. This led to the partial adoption o f an economic infrastructure strategy that intended to destroy North Vietnam’s capability to wage war. The traditional targets of such a campaign, the industrial syst
