allowed North Vietnam to develop countermeasures. For example, North Vietnam was able to disperse enough oil before the POL campaign began in 1966 to avoid a critical lack of oil. But even if the dispersal had not happened, it is questionable whether the loss of even a greater percentage of oil would have made a substantial differenee. North Vietnam’s oil needs were so small that anything less than nearly 100 percent destruction would not have had much more than a temporary affect. Nor would have quicker destruction o f the industrial sector made much difference in terms of military denial. It would have limited North Vietnam’s ability to disperse major facilities into small workshops and stockpile materials and products. Nevertheless, the industrial sector was not critical to the war effort. Anyway, China and the Soviet Union could easily have provided their aid faster. 234  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 247 --- Gradualism probably did not make much difference because nearly everything associated with an industrial economy was eventually hit but with little effect. Possibly more significant were the constraints on Rolling Thunder. Two of the more important prohibited target sets were the dams and dikes, and the major ports facilities (especially Haiphong) and railroads coming from China. The destruction of the dams and dikes may have seriously hurt North Vietnam due to loss o f rice production. Nonethelee, the U.S. never seriously considered the dikes as targets due to the moral and political ramifications of bombing the food supply. This was never an option. However, the U.S. considered closing down North Vietnam’s ports and railroads leading to China. This may have yielded some positive results. Rolling Thunder never vigorously attempted to cut off materials from entering North Vietnam. Instead, the bombing had to accomplish the more difficult task of locating and destroying dispersed materials already in the DRV. A blockade would be easier to achiev
