that U.S. air power could prevent North Vietnam from a military conquest o f South Vietnam. For the first time, air power had achieved military denial in Vietnam. Military denial also played a role in the compellent leverage gained by Linebacker II. But this operation was not designed to wipe out North Vietnam’s ability to wage war. Instead, Linebacker II was supposed to display vividly the power of U.S. aerial bombing. While Linebacker II mainly struck military support installations, the real target was the will of North Vietnam’s leadership. Ironically, the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam began in April 1965 and ended in December 1972 with exercises in coercive diplomacy. Unlike the first attempt, the second one succeeded.

But before one concludes Linebacker II bombed the North Viemamese into whimpering submission, one should remember that Hanoi conceded little in the January 1973 discussions. Hanoi simply decided to sign a treaty it had earlier accepted in principle after some minor modifications. Linebacker II compelled North Vietnam to expedite the treaty signing, but it did not achieve any concessions comparable to Linebacker I. During Linebacker II the U.S. executed the shock or deathblow strategy similar to what was used by the Western Allies in Italy and Germany during World War II. Although aimed at military targets, the massive bombings were obviously intended to affect the will o f the North Vietnamese leadership. The psychological effect o f the heavy bombings would convince Hanoi that a return to negotiations was the best option. While the damage to North Vietnam’s military capability was not insignificant, the primary compellent leverage apparently resulted from the shock of the bombings. This case
