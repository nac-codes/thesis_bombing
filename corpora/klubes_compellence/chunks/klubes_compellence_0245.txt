Cambodia via a coup and closed the port o f Sihanoukville to the Communists. Since the mid 1960s, North Vietnam had used this port to supply the VC/NVA units in Cambodia and southern South Vietnam.®* North Vietnam responded by launching the NVA/VC in Cambodia against the new government.®® In April, Nixon ordered U.S. ground units (along with substantial South Vietnamese forces) to attack NVA/VC base camps inside Cambodia along the South Vietnamese border.®® There were a number o f reasons for the Cambodian incursion. First, Nixon was frustrated with North Vietnam and Communist aggression and he wanted to retaliate somehow.®' Moreover, the offensive targeted large NVA/VC sanctuaries 259  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 272 --- which included supply bases, barracks and other support facilities, and headquarters. Thus, their destruction would disrupt NVA/VC operations in Cambodia and South Vietnam.®’ Hopefully, this would thwart the very real threat to the Cambodian government’s survival. The survival of this regime would ensure Sihanoukville would remain closed, further weakening NVA/VC forces in Cambodia and southern South Vietnam. A weakened also NVA/VC posed less of a threat to U.S. and South Vietnamese military forces, thereby aiding Vietnamization and gradual withdrawal.®’ Finally, the offensive was part of the larger strategy of applying military pressure even while the U.S. withdrew. It would demonstrate the DRV could not win with a continued U.S. presence and the U.S. was not leaving so easily. It would also send a message the U.S. was willing to escalate to match the DRV’s actions and to achieve its withdrawal conditions.®® This might exert enough compellent leverage to move the negotiations along. However, like the bombings of Cambodia, the ground attack into Cambodia did not lead to any breakthrough in the negotiations. The Cambodia bombings and incursion were decidedly inconclusive as compellent leverage. Undoubtedly, they inflicted some damage
