determination to prevail. A bombing strike would also force the Soviets hand, either for or against increased U.S. military pressure.*’ There was considerable concern in Washington over possible repercussions from bombing the North on the May summit between Nixon and Premier Brezhnev.*® Yet Nixon and Kissinger gambled that the Soviets would not jeopardize the summit over the Vietnam War. On 16 April, Nixon decided to send B-52s to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong. The primary target was petroleum, oil, and lubricant (POL) storage facilities, but airfields and warehouses were also hit. From a military standpoint, the strikes were successful, destroying up to half of the known POL storage facilities in North Vietnam. Yet there would be no impact on the fighting in South Vietnam; the NVA had stockpiled enough POL in Laos and 271  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 284 --- southern DRV to support its operations.™ The real target was in the political arena where the U.S. hoped to influence both North Vietnam and the Soviet Union.

Even though U.S. planes accidently struck four Soviet freighters in Haiphong, the Soviets protest was very mild (as was China’s). A few days later, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. confirmed the summit was still on.*®  Detente had succeeded.

But diplomatic matters had to be cleared up first. In late April Kissinger traveled to Moscow to lay the groundwork for Nixon’s upcoming summit and to discuss Vietnam. Above all, Kissinger wanted to separate Hanoi from its primary ally, the Soviet Union.*’®  In Moscow, Kissinger linked the situation in Vietnam to the U.S.-Soviet relation
