As opposed to the 1968 Tet Offensive there were many more suitable targets for tactical air power, including tanks, heavy artillery, large 276  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 289 --- supply columns, and massed infantry units. Some estimates that up to 50% of all NVA casualties were caused by tactical bombing."' Regardless of exact figures, it can be said that without U.S. tactical bombing, South Vietnam probably would have fallen in 1972. Interestingly, Linebacker I probably did not have that much effect on the immediate battlefield situation in May of 1972. The NVA had stockpiled enough supplies in Laos, Cambodia, and southern North Vietnam to provide for the Easter Offensive which mitigated Linebacker I’s interdiction operations."’ Finally, the NVA’s poor strategy and tactics also contributed to the collapse of the Easter Offensive. Although the NVA used tanks in large numbers, it clearly had not mastered armored warfare and conducting combined tank and infantry attacks. The North Vietnamese overestimated their ability to fight a mobile, conventional war against U.S. firepower. Moreover, the NVA focused too much on seizing cities than relying on their newly developed mobility to bypass strongholds and strike deep into South Vietnam. Laying siege to cities such as An Loc nullifying the effectiveness of tanks and the massed NVA units were easy targets for U.S. tactical bombing.
