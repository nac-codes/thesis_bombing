the changing nature o f the ground war and the use of guided munitions. Although often overlooked in discussing compellence, in this instance, tactical bombing was a critical factor in the compellent operation. Compellence hinged on the ability o f the U.S. to demonstrate North Vietnam could not win militarily. Tactical bombing was instrumental in turning back the Easter Offensive. There was no reason to believe the U.S./South Vietnamese performance o f 1972 could not be repeated. The amount of compellence leverage obtained by tactical bombing should not be underestimated. It was a very dramatic showing o f just how effective U.S. air power could be. Ironically, Linebacker I probably had little influence on the critical first three months of the Easter Offensive. North Vietnam had enough supplies stockpiled in the south to negate the initial interdiction affects o f Linebacker I.'™ In fact. Linebacker I’s interdiction effect within North Vietnam may be overemphasized. While the bombing inflicted substantial bombing on the railroad system, it had less effect on the road system. Throughout Linebacker 1, North 282  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 295 --- Vietnam was able to move large amounts of equipment and supplies by truck, albeit with some increase in cost and difficulty.” ® Instead, Linebacker I applied compellent leverage by showing it could be a long-term problem to North Vietnam’s military capability. Linebacker 1  was very effective in limiting the amount of supplies entering North Vietnam. North Vietnam’s seaborne imports o f over 250,000 tons per month ceased almost completely, meaning that critically needed Soviet equipment would have to travel through erratic China.” *  In the chaotic situation caused by the Cultural Revolution and fear of Soviet influence in North Vietnam, the Chinese prevented some Soviet shipments from reaching North Vietnam.” ®  Although heavily bombed, the land route from China was never fully broken and a ground line from
