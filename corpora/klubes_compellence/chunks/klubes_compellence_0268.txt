ort limited the NVA’s overall capability. Likewise, the economic infrastructure attacks that had failed in Rolling Thunder because its destruction had little impact on the war in the South now were more effective. With the shift to more conventional warfare. North Vietnam had a greater need for its limited industrial and power supply infrastructure to function. Both Linebacker I and the tactical bombing were greatly enhanced by the wide-spread use of smart weapons. This was the first time the U.S. used guided munitions, especially laser-guided bombs, in large numbers. These weapons significantly increased the destructive power of each plane. Moreover, guided bombs facilitated the destruction of targets that previously had proved extremely difficult to hit and destroy. For example, a North Vietnamese bridge which had defied destruction from hundreds of bombing sorties during Rolling Thunder was totally destroyed by 16 aircraft dropping 24 guided bombs and 48 unguided 284  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 297 --- bombs.'™ Furthermore, tactical air strikes could now easily hit individual tanks and trucks.'®‘ *  Guided bombs did not change the bombing strategy, it simply hastened and increased the overall amount of destruction wrought on the NVA and North Vietnam.
