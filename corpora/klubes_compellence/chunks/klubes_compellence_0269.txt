Vietnam’s decreasing superpower support increased its need to remove the U.S. from South Vietnam. The last, and possibly most important, contributing factor to this compellent success was the change in U.S. objectives. In 1972, the U.S.’ objectives were significantly less the 1965 goals o f creating a stable, viable South Vietnam free from DRV aggression. Thus, Rolling Thunder had to convince a determined Hanoi to give up its most cherished goal. But military denial could not disrupt the Communists’ military activities and Hanoi was seemingly oblivious to the pain of the bombing. In fall 1972, all the U.S. wanted was a military ceasefire to allow a completion of the U.S. withdrawal while keeping Thieu in power, and had even dropped its demand for mutual withdrawal o f U.S. and NVA forces. To convince Hanoi to accept such terms, the U.S. needed to prove it could preclude North 285  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 298 --- Vietnam from taking South Vietnam. And in 1972 military denial could seriously hamper North Vietnam’s ability to conquer South Vietnam. Air power may not have been able to win the war, but in 1972 it could prevent North Vietnam from winning. And that was all that was necessary. But one should not conclude Linebacker I brought victory to the U.S. and South Vietnam. The October agreement was very favorable to North Vietnam because it did not force an NVA withdrawal from South Vietnam. It was obvious that even with a signed treaty North Vietnam would merely wait until the Americans left before resuming the war. The agreement did not reduce North Vietnam’s strategic military superiority in any way. Consequently, the removal of the U.S. without a similar reduction in North Vietnam’s military capability was beneficial only to North Vietnam. It is easy to denigrate North Vietnam’s concession to separate the military and political issues as a mere acceptance of reality, or as just a quick way to get the U.S. to leave. Both o f these conclusions ma
