litary force intended not to cripple North Vietnam’s ability to wage war but to be a reminder American air power’s ability to influence the military situation and to demonstrate the U.S.’  willingness to use military force.

They hoped the B-52s bombing Hanoi and Haiphong would force North Vietnam to agree again to the October settlement. Simultaneously, they wanted this impressive use of bombing to convince Thieu that the U.S. was committed to South Vietnam. In other words, the message would be sent that the U.S. air power would react forcefully to a future North Vietnamese offensive. Furthermore, Linebacker II would show both parties that Nixon was willing to disregard criticism to achieve what he wanted. Linebacker II implemented a shock strategy; a massive use o f bombing aimed at affecting Hanoi’s will to continue and Saigon’s will to stall. Nevertheless, the U.S. did not strike what would normally be considered countervalue targets, such as industries. Instead, the planes dropped bombs on the infrastructure which supported North Vietnam’s ability to wage war. The most heavily bombed target set was railroad yards, closely followed by storage facilities (both logistical and weapons). U.S. planes also struck smaller targets, including radio communication facilities, electric power plants, and air defenses (both airfields and SAM sites). But the campaign was simply not prolonged enough to inflict widespread, lasting damage throughout North Vietnam. This leads to the conclusion that the intent was not so much to eliminate North Vietnam’s ability to wage war as to demonstrate the U.S.’ capability to do so. To increase the psychological affect.
