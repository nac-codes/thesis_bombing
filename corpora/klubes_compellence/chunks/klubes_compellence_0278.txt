Linebacker I had already severely disrupted the rail system throughout the coimtry, forcing North Vietnam to switch most of its transportation 294  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 307 --- requirements to trucks and the road system.'®® In addition, the bombing decreased electrical power production by 75 percent and petroleum reserves by at least one fourth as it destroyed 3 million gallons o f POL.'®® But North Vietnam had suffered this amount o f damage before and had survived. The other major counterforce damage was to North Vietnam’s air defense system. During Linebacker II, North Vietnam became increasingly vulnerable due to a rapidly declining supply of SAMs and neutralization o f its MiG force. While North Vietnam initially had some successes, especially against the lumbering B-52s, an effective U.S. counter-response and a dwindling supply o f SAMs soon diminished North Vietnam’s defenses. North Vietnam could only get SAMs from the Soviet Union and the closure of Haiphong limited the amount that could reach North Vietnam quickly. Furthermore, U.S. bombs destroyed North Vietnam’s primary SAM assembly depot (needed to unpack the SAMs) on 26 December.'®’ Over the past few years. North Vietnam had developed what seemed to be a very strong air defense capability. It must have been some shock to the DRV that the U.S. had been able to neutralize it in only 11 days. Concern over future bombings probably generated a good deal o f Linebacker II’s compellent leverage. The devastation o f North Vietnam’s air defenses meant the U.S. could hit whatever they wanted with impunity. With fewer planes being shot down, Hanoi’s ability to gain valuable POWs had diminished as well. Nixon had now committed B-52s against Hanoi, and had weathered the storm. Just as importantly, the U.S. bombers were using laser guided bombs to great affect a
