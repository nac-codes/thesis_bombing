single raid. In fact, although future strikes were considered a possibility, there was not a coherent, accepted plan for an extended or continuous campaign. Thus, the U.S. adopted a shock strategy. 312  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 325 --- Even though the U.S. Air Force and Navy aircrews executed the complex operation admirably, the long flight by the F-Ills  and strict rules o f engagement diminished the material damage. Nonetheless, the raid achieved its political objective; Libyan support for, and use of, terrorism decreased after the attack. Somewhat surprisingly, one raid with but 33 bombers compelled a state to modify its behavior. This change was not the result of crippling a capability. Although it was temporarily disrupted, Libya’s capability to support terrorism was by no means eliminated. Instead, compellence was gained by affecting Qaddafi’s will to continue the policy unabated. Because detailed, reliable information concerning his decision-making is difficult to obtain, the reasoning behind the change is somewhat speculative. One possibility is that the personalization of the compellence message may have sufficiently unnerved Qaddafi. U.S. bombers struck Qaddafi’s primary command center and residence, the Aziziyah Barracks (it also was an important part o f the terrorist support infrastructure). Although Qaddafi may not have even been at the complex at the time, the demonstration of the power and reach of American air power was unmistakable. Regardless of specific reasoning, the bombing raid exploited a leadership vulnerability to precipitate a desired behavior modification. While terrorism did not stop, which no single raid could hope to achieve, Qaddafi’s support and use of terrorism declined. Air power, acting as the main military force, succeeded in achieving the United States’  political objectives. 313  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 326 --- This case fits Alexander George, et al.’s, definition o f coercive diplomacy.“ The
