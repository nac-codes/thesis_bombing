was the potential for a massive hostage situation involving the 1,500 Americans still working in Libya. Thus, Reagan called for the immediate withdrawal of American workers. The "Line of D eath" By early 1986, tensions between Libya and the United States increased. The Reagan administration had placed its prestige on the line by confronting Qaddafi. Coercive diplomacy without using military force was apparently not applying much compellent leverage. Therefore, Reagan was preparing to take direct military action to exert more compellent pressure on Libya. Two primary plans were contemplated. The first option called for the Navy to conduct Freedom of Navigation exercises in the Gulf of Sidra (still claimed by Qaddafi as territorial waters). The second option was air strikes on Libya, which would include F-111 328  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 341 --- bombers based in England. The first option was considered better for it was ostensibly a legal operation; there would only be a fight if Qaddafi started one. Consequently, the naval exercises were chosen to be the first option and the air strikes would follow if a sufficient provocation materialized. Indeed, most everyone in Washington hoped that Qaddafi would start something during the naval exercises so the Navy could "teach him a lesson".®® In January and February, the U.S. Navy conducted exercises near Libya, but not in the Gulf o f Sidra. In response, Qaddafi called the line demarcating the entrance to the Gulf of Sidra as the "Line o f Death" and boasted that all American forces crossing the line would be destroyed. Seeing no indications that Qaddafi was reducing his support of terrorism, Reagan then authorized naval exercises in the Gulf of Sidra.

This would then, hopefully, spur on anti-Qaddafi forces in the milit
