Eventually, Admiral Crowe, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acceded to the Aziziyah and Jamahiriyah Barracks under the realization that the need to take the message directly to Qaddafi was paramount.®* George Shultz, the Secretary of State, also argued against bombing the Aziziyah Barracks.
