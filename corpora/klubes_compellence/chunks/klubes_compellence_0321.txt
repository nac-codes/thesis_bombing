The Navy A-6s were given two targets in the Benghazi area, seven A-6s were to hit the Jamahiriyah Barracks, one of Qaddafi’s alternate command and control centers, which also housed terrorists, some o f Qaddafi’s counter-coup forces, and a number of MiG jets in storage. Finally eight A-6s were to bomb the Benina Military Airfield to prevent any MiGs from intercepting the strike force.*^ Even before the planes left their respective bases the raid ran into a significant difficulty as France and Spain refused overflight permission for the F- 111s from England. This forced the planes to detour around the European continent and extended their round-trip to over 5,500 miles. On the evening o f 14 April, the first planes took off from England. Defense suppression began at 0154 hours 15 April (Libyan time) and the bombs began to fall at 0200. In a remarkable feat of planning and execution, after flying some 2,700 miles the F-11  Is still arrived exactly on time over Libya. The bombers were given strict Rules o f Engagement in an attempt to reduce collateral damage and were also limited to one pass to lessen the probability of losses. Because of these restrictions a number of planes did not drop their bombs.** Six F-llls  and three A-6s aborted due to equipment and navigation problems.*® Libya anti-aircraft and SAM fire was heavy although inaccurate. One plane was lost, an F-111, either to pilot error or, possibly, Libyan fire.™ 340  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 353 --- The F-llls’  results were somewhat disappointing. Only two o f the planned nine F-llls  dropped ordnance on the Aziziyah Barracks, although they still inflicted serious damage to some structures. The other F-111 strikes fared somewhat better, damaging the Sidi Bilal training site and d
