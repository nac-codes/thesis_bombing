ceasefire after the cumulative strain of the war became too heavy to bear. The use of air power in this conflict is best described as reluctance and incompetence coupled with missed opportunities that yielded only limited success. Neither Iran nor Iraq exploited fully the vulnerabilities of the other to achieve decisive results. The foremost example was that both were highly dependent on the oil export revenues. And both states could have inflicted serious damage on the other’s oil production and export facilities. If Iraq decided to systematically attack Iran’s oil infrastructure, it may well have exerted sufficient compellent leverage to force a cease-fire. Buoyed by aid from wealthy Persian Gulf states, Iraq probably could have survived the Iranian counterattacks. Indeed, Iraq’s aerial attacks in 1986 and 1987 forced Iran to shuttle oil from Kharg Island to the mouth of the Persian Gulf, discount its oil, and spent hundreds of millions of dollars to repair facilities.' 353  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 366 --- Although Iran was hurting, Iraq failed to maintain the pressure and Iran was able to continue its war effort.

Some targets that directly supported military activity were hit and tactical bombing was intense at times. Yet, there was little of the sustained commitment to deep interdiction strikes or bombardment o f military- related industries required to achieve military denial. Part of this may be due to a lack of doctrinal emphasis on, and operational experience with, strategic military denial in Iraq or Iran. Leaders in both states believed the air force’s role was to provide support for the army and to maintain itself as a strategic deterrent attacking an opponent’s economic infrastructure if needed.® The major compellent operations began after Iran invaded Iraq in 1982 and Iraq wanted to pressure Iran to end the war. Subsequently, Ir
