d on a sustained basis, quality intelligence gathering to identify targets, and a willingness to accept losses to achieve the mission. These traits, all indicative of a professional force, were in short supply during much of the war. Interestingly, ground-to-ground ballistic missiles had an important impact on the war.

This conflict is an example o f why it is just as important to be able to execute, not just possess, a suitable military option. During the war, there were military strategies that could exert significant compellent leverage on each side. However, neither state executed such a strategy effectively. The foremost example was the failure of Iraq and Iran to exploit the oil revenue vulnerability to the fullest extent. Iraq had more capability to implement its military option, but never pressed its advantage to yield the maximum pressure. Consequently, this case shows t
