Iraq had failed to achieve compellence because it had underestimated the resolve of Iran, the Iranian government’s ability to rally the people, and the characteristics o f a revolutionary government.

Finally, Khomeini saw the war as a fight for the survival o f his revolution and even Islam itself.®* This was an important point because Hussein failed to understand that Khomeini would see the war through his highly religious view. More importantly, Khomeini convinced his revolutionary minions and the Iranian people of this as well.
