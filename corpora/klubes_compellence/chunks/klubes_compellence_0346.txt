1980, Kharg Island was still vulnerable to attack as were important oil pumping stations on the mainland. Iraq could also attack the tankers at sea to interdict the oil exports.^ In addition, Iraqi planes could always strike more traditional economic targets, such as industrial facilities, electrical power plants and systems, and railroads.”  The Iranian economic infrastructure was not large or diverse and a concerted campaign could have seriously disrupted it. Iraq could also exert pressure through undermining domestic will and morale. Economic warfare would weaken will and morale indirectly, but Iraq could also use strategic bombing as a direct method to target population centers. Yet Iraq had several persuasive reasons against using strategic bombing at this point. First, an escalation on Iraq’s part would undoubtedly lead to similar reaction by Iran and the IIAF counterattack in September alarmed the Iraqis.^* ®  The very small Iraqi Navy was bottled up in its ports at the mouth o f the Persian Gulf and was never a factor in the war. 367  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 380 --- Iraq was just as vulnerable to economic warfare as Iran, with oil generating 87% of government revenues in 1980.”  Preserving existing economic infrastructure was initially more important than compelling Iran. Moreover, Iraq was concerned that an Iranian retaliation might widen the war, dragging in the other Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that were supporting Iraq monetarily (which would soon reach tens o f billions of dollars). A strategic bombing campaign that provoked Iran to retaliate would clearly antagonize Iraq’s badly needed supporters.^’ Another factor precluding strategic bombing was the Iraq Air Force’s (IQAF) limited capability, attitude toward strategic bombing, and its role in the Iraqi armed forces. In 1980, the Iraqi Air Force’s (IQAF) was not a formidable strategic bombing force, with most of its attack aircraft having short range and light payload
