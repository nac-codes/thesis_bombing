to use their Super Etendard aircraft armed with Exocet guided missiles against shipping. During this year Iraq would attack approximately 53 ships.®" But this number o f attacks was simply too few to make a major impact. Hussein apparently was still wedded to the idea Iraq could convince Iran to accept a ceasefire merely by inflicting some pain with the clear threat to do more, in conjunction with halting Iran’s ground offensives. Iraq made numerous calls for ceasefires and negotiations during 1984. Iran rebuffed them all.® * Iraq stopped Iran’s ground forces, but the pain of the Tanker War was still meager. Iraq only averaged two or three attacks a month, even though about 20 tankers used Kharg Island per month. Moreover, few of the ships were sunk or damaged seriously enough to be unrepairable.** Iran’s oil exports did drop in response to Iraq’s attacks in July, but by November the exports were back to normal.®’ Iran realized the vulnerability o f Kharg Island and began to set up a shuttle service. In March 1985, Iran chartered six small tankers to shuttle oil from Kharg to Sirri Island, 340 miles farther south (and further away from Iraqi airfields) and developed other loading sites.** This reduced Iran’s dependence on Kharg Island and likewise reduced Iraq’s ability to interfere with Iran’s oil exports. The slow escalation had given Iran enough time to find alternatives to Kharg Island. But the Iraqi pressure was not enough to compel a ceasefire £ind instead of massive counterattacks, Iran settled for a tit-for-tat strategy. The initial tit-for-tat 384  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 397 --- was probably due to an inability to sustain operations as well as concern for the international repercussions. For example, the U.S. made clear that it regarded closure o f the Straits as a threat to its vital interests.®* Iran’s constrained reaction proved correct as none of the Western powers intervened at this point. However, even the limited Iranian reprisals
