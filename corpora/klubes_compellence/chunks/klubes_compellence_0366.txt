The radicals in Iran’s government, buoyed by the ground war successes and the Gulf states’ pro-Iraq leanings, pushed for more attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf. This eventually led to international intervention. Meanwhile, Iran’s oil revenues were hurt by the increased number o f Iraqi strikes and a precipitous drop in oil prices. Iran’s heavy losses and deepening financial problem began to sap the Iranians’  morale. Consequently, 1986 would prove to be the beginning of the end for Iran. The year opened with a small Iraqi ground offensive, followed by a dramatic Iranian ground attack on the southernmost A1 Paw Peninsula in February.
