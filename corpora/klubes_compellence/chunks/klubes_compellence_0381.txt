, these missile attacks had a major impact on Tehran’s civilian population. Indeed, the missiles’ damage was not that extensive, but the psychological effect on a demoralized, war-weary population was substantial. For example, from one-quarter to one-half of Tehran’s population fled the city.” ’ The reasons for the dramatic effect in this case, while other bombing operations against civilian morale have failed is not fully clear. Unlike during the previous missile exchanges, the Iranian people were much less supportive o f the war. After suffering over a million casualties, enthusiasm for the war and their revolutionary zeal was waning. Iran’s civilians had become vulnerable to exploitation. The missiles caused some casualties, probably about 40 per missile, and their descent and impact of each was audible over a wide area.” ®  Iraq continued the daily deluge of missiles, about 3 a day, for 50 days, for which Iran had no active defense. The missiles created a prolonged anxiety among the civilians, who also feared that Iraq would use chemical warheads.” * The effect of latest episode o f the War of the Cities rippled throughout the Iranian war effort. Iran leaders in the capital city of Tehran could not fail to see the population’s flagging morale: the population’s flight disrupted government activities repeatedly as employees failed to show up for work.” ®  And this morale was critical to maintaining the ground forces’ strength and capability on the battlefield. Eschewing modem weapons, Iran based its war effort on high morale of its soldiers and the willingness to endure heavy casualties. The declining support 404  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 417 --- was already apparent by 1987 when Iran was forced to turn to conscription. The missile episode in 1988 further depressed enthusiasm for the war in Iran’s largest city and showed the leadership just how restless the populace was. It is critical to remember that the war and the Revolution were intertwined.
