amage to their state. In addition, strategic bombing has generally inflicted pain on the state as a whole rather than specifically delivering punishment that will pressure the leadership significantly. Yet this method of pressure should not be disregarded because it has generated compellent pressure by causing stresses in societies. Thus, the most appropriate situation to use strategic bombing is when seizing or holding an area of land (or possibly sea) would lead to compellence. Simply, launching a successful invasion or preventing one is the best way to achieve compellence. The best approach to using strategic bombing is military denial to disrupt the enemy’s capability to seize or retain territory. For example, the U.S.’ primary objective during Rolling Thunder, getting North Vietnam to cease its support of the fighting in South Vietnam, was not linked to control o f territory. However, during Linebacker I, the U.S. sought to prevent North Vietnam from overrunning South Vietnam. Strategic bombing was much better suited for the latter situation than the former and generated much more compellent pressure. It is more enigmatic to incorporate pain into a bombing strategy. The effect o f pain on a state can vary dramatically, and unpredictably, and is not contingent on the number of bombs dropped and cities destroyed. While it can increase compellent leverage, there are moral and legal prohibitions on directly attacking civilians or civilian targets. It would be best for a compelling state to focus more on military denial when dealing with territorial issues and simply realize it will inflict pain as a secondary result of the general destruction. 423  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 436 --- Although the best situation for using strategic bombing is when territory is at issue, territorial control, however, is not always the compeller’s objectives or pertinent to all compellent issues. Air power is often called upon to compel surrender or to modify a behavior
