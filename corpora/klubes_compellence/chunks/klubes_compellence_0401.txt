many other factors which can influence the course o f a conflict and whether compellence will be successful. Alexander George, et al., developed a set of factors that helps indicate when coercive diplomacy success is likely or unlikely. These factors are powerful explainers and predictors. The issue o f whether a military option exists and is properly executed does not contradict George, et al.’s analysis. Indeed, the development of the military option and strategy is often influenced by the other factors. For example, without significant domestic support, it is difficult to launch a powerful military strike. Even without considering the military option, George, et al.’s analysis is a very good indicator of whether coercive diplomacy will succeed. Analysis o f the military option adds another factor rather than contradicting the existing analysis and decision-making process of compellent operations.'’  Too Actually, I cannot test the military option for statistical significance because 1 include cases in my discussion of compellence that George, et al., would not consider coercive diplomacy due to their extensive use of military force. George, et al., specifically distinguishes coercive diplomacy from compellence on the basis of how much force is used. Coercive diplomacy only includes defensive operations while compellence includes defensive and offensive operations. Admittedly, I have emphasized cases with significant uses of military force and thus, my conclusions are not surprising. Among the social scientists, Pape and George, et al., come closest to what I am studying— the operationalization of strategies to achieve coercion/compellence. John Mersheimer’s work on conventional deterrence is similar in terms of focusing on strategy as a mechanism of success or failure of deterrence. But deterrence is a different issue than compellence. 425  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 438 --- often, social scientists gloss over the details of military action and st
