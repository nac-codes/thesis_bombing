t effective way to win a war. They saw the will and resolve to continue fighting as an important target for strategic bombing. As modern v/ar tends to involve the entire society, undermining the resolve to fight should contribute significantly to compellent success. They called for indiscriminate urban bombing to inflict large numbers of civilian casualties and severely weaken civilian morale. This in turn, they argued, would reduce the will of the people to continue fighting. Indeed the entire framework of a state’s resistance would collapse as its cities were obliterated because their destruction would also severely impair the targeted state’s military capability. Actual bombing operations soon proved Douhet and Trenchard’s ideas erroneous. During the Spanish Civil War, World War II, and subsequent conflicts, the morale o f populations being bombed have been far more resilient than Douhet or Trenchard predicted. In addition, Douhet and Trenchard overestimated the effects of city-busting on the targeted state’s military capability. The damage bombers could inflict on cities, while impressive, did not destroy the economic sources o f a state’s military power. Although it was very disruptive and forced the diversion o f considerable resources, the damage simply was too generalized to paralyze the targeted state’s military. A more selective bombing pattern would 430  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 443 --- undoubtedly be a more effective method of crippling a state’s war-making capability. Consequently, this strategy has not been successful in achieving compellence. Another issue mitigating against the pulverization strategy’s widespread use in compellence is its extensive destruction. The pulverization strategy is often overkill for the desired compellent objectives. Furthermore, indiscriminate attacks against urban areas have been outlawed.^ Although Russia apparently used the pulverization strategy in its offensive against Chechnya in late 1994 and early
