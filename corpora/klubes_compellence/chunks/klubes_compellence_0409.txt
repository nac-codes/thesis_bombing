inflicted on their state (or sometimes, even deeply care). They may believe the state can survive the damage wrought by more attacks and continue the conflict, regardless o f the actual damage. Leaders also tend to misperceive events and actions just as often as accurately perceiving them.^ Worse still, for this strategy to be effective leaders must perceive that their costs of continuing, not necessarily the cost to the state, outweigh the costs o f conceding. A radical change in policy may be hazardous to the longevity of a leader’s political career. Domestic opposition to concessions may force a leader to refrain from altering a policy except under the most extreme conditions. Moreover, delivering punishment usually does not actually prevent the policy from being pursued. The punishment caused by strategic bombing by both direct attacks on civilians and indirect affects by the destruction of the economic sector and/or heavy military casualties may also lead to a severe decrease or even collapse o f civilian morale. This has been effective on occasion to develop indirect compellent pressure, but some societies have been able to absorb a tremendous amount of destruction without folding. To succeed, the compeller must cross the opponent’s threshold of tolerance. However, estimating how much a society can endure is very 433  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 446 --- difficult. And more importantly, determining how to inflict the pain is also difficult. For example, simply bombing more does not necessarily continue to reduce morale. Instead, bombing can often reach a point o f diminishing returns where incessant, heavy bombardment is not significantly more effective than infrequent bombing.* Morale is another nebulous concept to measure that can often be pushed very far before collapsing and thus leaders may believe their civilian population can endure just a little more. Anyway, leaders, in conjunction with security and military forces, often can squelch any
