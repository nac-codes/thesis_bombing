o many o f the theoretical precepts of the punishment strategy. For example, instead of attempting complete interdiction immediately, Iraq opted for some interdiction to inflict some pain, with the threat of greater future bombing. This strategy did play an important role in Iraq’s eventual compellent success because it inflicted considerable pain on Iran, contributed to the decline in morale and resolve in Iran, and eventually forced Iran to discard its prolonged attrition strategy. But it could not exert sufficient compellent leverage to achieve success by itself. The Iranian leadership’s resolve was so high that it could only he compelled to give up its political objectives when the very survival of the Islamic Revolution was at stake. A punishment strategy could create severe problems but could not actually force the Revolution to the brink of collapse. A less recognized variant of the punishment strategy is to deliver pain by attacking fielded military forces. This may influence the targeted state in two ways. First, the steady attrition of the armed forces is costly in terms of manpower and sheer monetary value o f replacing lost equipment and trained personnel. Second, a constant stream o f casualties can sap civilian morale. Indeed, a military defeat 435  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 448 --- lowers the morale of the losing state and a string o f defeats can deplete the will to fight. However, punishment via attacking fielded military forces has not fared well in practice. Israel attempted to use this strategy to achieve compellence against Egypt during the War o f Attrition. Israel hoped that Nasser would believe the heavy pounding the lAF delivered to the Egyptian Army was too costly and the Egyptian people would rebel against the constant defeats and inability of the military to protect them. These pressures would either undermine Nasser’s rule and/or force an end to the war. Israel was unable to deliver enough punishment to the Egyptian Army
