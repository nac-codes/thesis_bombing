h the attacks and pressured the government to act. Even in World War II, when strategic bombing has been accused of failing, the civilian morale in Germany and especially Japan was affected by the bombing. The effect was not enough to yield compellence, but it certainly helped the Allies’ war effort. These historical examples, however, provide little predictive value, mainly due to human nature. Sometimes a civilian population is susceptible to pressure via bombing, sometimes it is not. More specifically, each targeted state’s population has its own set o f characteristics that make the compeller’s assessment of the civilian’s susceptibility pressure with bombing based more on wishful thinking rather than solid analysis. Possibly, the key to undermining morale is to have the population direct its hostility toward its own government rather than the bombing 438  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 451 --- State. While the lack of defenses and inability to respond generally leads to resentment o f their own government, it is difficult to determine when a population will turn on its government.’ There is too much uncertainty to rely on this form of pressure as a consistent way to achieve compellence. But pain can still play an important role and should not be dismissed. No government can remain immune or indifferent to the effects of significant damage to the economy. Iraq’s Tanker War was an effort to exert compellent leverage by increasing Iran’s costs of continuing the war. Because Iran’s economy was so dependent on revenue generated by oil exports, besides the pain inflicted by a faltering economy, a drop below a certain level o f oil revenue would make Iran’s prosecution of the war untenable. Iraq never fully exploited this vulnerability, but the most intense part of the interdiction campaign did push Iran to the economic limit. (Although Iraq’s operation was aided by an unrelated steep decline in the world-wide price of oil.) Iran was forced to react with a
