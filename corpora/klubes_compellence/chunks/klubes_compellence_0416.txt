pain and lowers morale of the entire state. A decision to concede often arises from a combination of factors. Admittedly, in most of those cases in which the deliverance o f pain influenced the compellent success, there were other critical factors also contributing to the success. For example, the bombing would not have led to the fall of Mussolini without the decisive military defeats Italy suffered. The military situation may be the most significant reason, but that does not mean it is the only reason. And considering the complexity and difficulty in achieving compellence, every bit of pressure helps. It is important to note that anytime bombs fall, pain is inflicted on the targeted state regardless of whether the compeller is using a punishment strategy. In other words, even attacks on fielded military forces for expressly and truly 440  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 453 --- military purposes also cause pain. Guerrilla warfare often aims for primarily military targets, but it relies on this secondary effect to be successful. However, in regard to strategic bombing this secondary effect is often not acknowledged. Again, besides being difficult to quantify, both political and military leaders can be reluctant to admit explicitly that they want to inflict pain and therefore shy away from including it in their motivations and/or objectives. Yet this pain can be a factor in compelling a victim state. The true damage caused by conflict is never simply limited to the monetary value of lost equipment and the dry statistics of casualty lists. An important problem with punishment strategies is the failure to implement this inherently difficult strategy well enough to achieve success. Too often, theorists and strategic bombing users assume that pain inflicted on the state must also pressure the leadership. This not always correct. Instead, it is important to inflict pain directly on the leaders, inflict damage on aspects o f the state the leaders believe are hi
