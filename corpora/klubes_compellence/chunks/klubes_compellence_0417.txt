e state must also pressure the leadership. This not always correct. Instead, it is important to inflict pain directly on the leaders, inflict damage on aspects o f the state the leaders believe are highly valuable, or bomb aspects which generate substantial indirect pressure on the leaders. Inflicting pain on the wrong target partially explains the failures of the punishment strategy. The problem may not lie with the strategy as much with the policy-makers and planners who develop the compellent operations. O f course, the punishment strategy’s weakness is that it is difficult to determine what will be perceived as painful by the opposing leadership. And worse still, strategic bombing is a very blunt weapon to inflict pain, so it may not be precise enough to wreak the specific pain necessary. 441  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 454 --- The value o f pain had often been played down in recent analysis of air power. Indeed, as a primary compellent mechanism attempting to have dramatic influence on the course of a conflict it has not been overly successful. Yet as an adjunct to military denial or in a limited objective compellent operation, it can play an important role in achieving compellence. Smart Weapons and Pain Any conclusions based upon past experiences regarding the pulverization and punishment strategies may prove premature. "Smart" weapons, also known as precision-guided munitions, increase the amount of damage an air force can inflict.® These weapons harken Douhet with their ability to wreak havoc on the state, but unlike the pulverization strategy, do not inflict indiscriminate, widespread damage to entire urban areas. Precision guided munitions can hit targets with an extremely high degree of accuracy, decreasing the amount of ordnance needed to neutralize a target. A small group of planes armed with precision-guided munitions can easily destroy vital choke points, such as bridges, and disable complex industrial systems such as electrical power
