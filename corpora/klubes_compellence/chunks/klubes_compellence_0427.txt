On the other hand, guerrilla warfare usually does not have strict territorial control or large-scale destruction of enemy military forces as primary objectives. 451  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 464 --- political objectives which are not tied to territorial control.

The U.S. political objective in Vietnam in 1972 was to preserve South Vietnam while American forces withdrew. To achieve compellence, the U.S. had to prevent a North Vietnamese conquest and demonstrate that the North Vietnamese Army could not seize South Vietnam with the U.S. still involved.

However, during Rolling Thunder, the U.S.â€™ political objective was not tied to territorial control, instead it was to compel North Vietnam to end its involvement in the conflict.^ Therefore, strategic bombing was ill-suited for gaining compellent leverage through military denial and, as I already stated, the punishment strategy could not exert much compellent leverage. In sum, the military and political objectives should be as closely related as possible to facilitate compellent success using military denial.*' Strategic bombing is most effective against a mechanized army.
