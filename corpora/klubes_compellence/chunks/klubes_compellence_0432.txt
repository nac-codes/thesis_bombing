For example, it may be too destructive for limited compellent objectives. Political considerations, such as those present during the War of Attrition or the Vietnam War, may preclude attacks on some (or many) targets. Furthermore, parallel warfare is best suited for longer conflicts; it takes time for destruction behind the lines to affect the battlefield. Parallel warfare’s foundation, the center of gravity concept, provides greater flexibility while honing the focus o f strategic bombing. Parallel warfare entails striking a state’s centers o f gravity more or less simultaneously with emphasis on the heart o f the opposing state.” But a compellent operation based more on examining whether each CoG should be attacked is more adaptable to the many contextual factors, especially the targeted state’s strengths and weaknesses, in each conflict. In addition, the center of gravity concept pays greater attention to tactical bombing. Parallel warfare as envisioned by John Warden seems to downplay tactical bombing. However, this use o f bombing can play an important role in compellence because it can have a powerful affect on controlling territory. Clearly, tactical air power was a critical factor in preventing the fall o f South Vietnam 457  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 470 --- during the 1972 Easter Offensive and significantly aided the Coalition’s recapture of Kuwait in 1991.' O f course, relying on CoG analysis may lead to the conclusion that the parallel warfare strategy is warranted because it has the greatest potential to disrupt an enemy’s military capability. But a compelling state should always recognize that the particular conditions, be they military or political, can dramatically affect its operation. Thus, it is better not to approach every military denial situation with one blanket strategy, but wi
