rse of action. In other words, a nearly de facto acceptance of the military situation as opposed to the more ambiguous measure of victory and defeat when inflicting pain. Even with a lesser defeat, concession is often the best option. As Pape noted, further conflict simply adds pain with relatively little to gain.’®  A close correspondence between the military and political objectives tends to increase the chances o f compellent success. Military objectives are generally expressed in terms of territorial occupation, and much less frequently in degrees o f pain and damage inflicted on the opposition. If the military objectives are attained and the political objectives are very similar or can be reached through success in the military dimension, the attainment o f the political objectives often follows. For example. Linebacker I and tactical bombing demonstrated that the North Vietnamese could not conquer South Vietnam with the U.S. still involved. Although the North Vietnamese despised having to sign an agreement with the U.S., 461  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 474 --- they did so when they recognized and accepted the military situation. North Vietnam was not compelled by the amount of punishment delivered via strategic bombing. Indeed, it had absorbed more damage during Rolling Thunder without conceding: the North Vietnamese were so resolved to win that a devastated economic infrastructure was an acceptable price for victory. Even the very high numbers of total casualties did not sway the North Vietnamese leaders. But Linebacker I and the tactical bombing demonstrated that large scale territorial conquest could not come without a U.S. withdrawal. Therefore, bombing was able to exert sufficient compellent leverage. What makes bombing so effective in exploiting military vulnerability is that successful compellence is not dependent on achieving total victory. As I previously stated, air power may not be able to win a war, but it can influence the course of
