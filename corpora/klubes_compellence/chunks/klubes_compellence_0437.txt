ng military vulnerability is that successful compellence is not dependent on achieving total victory. As I previously stated, air power may not be able to win a war, but it can influence the course of a conflict. Because successful compellence is a function o f altering the opponent’s cost-to-benefit assessment scale, bombing is suited to changing the equation prior to complete territorial conquest. In other words, compellence often simply requires a modification in the situation, not a complete transformation. Consequently, the North Vietnamese could be convinced to sign a treaty without succumbing to an U.S. invasion because air power could prevent them from conquering South Vietnam. On the other hand. Rolling Thunder never had much of an effect on the military situation and thus was unable to compel North Vietnam. 462  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 475 --- The Importance of the Targeted State Factors social scientists have identified as being part o f the coercion subject, such as interests and resolve, also play a role in strategic bombing and compellence. Interest and resolve may increase the morale, and hence fighting ability, and decrease the willingness to concede, thus making it more difficult for territory to be held or seized. These factors should never be dismissed when executing a compellent operation. Obviously, the lower an opponent’s interest and resolve, the easier it is for compellence to succeed. O f course, the reverse is true as well. This can affect the ability o f strategic bombing to achieve compellence, albeit for different reasons for offensive and defensive compellence. In regard to offensive compellence (in other words, seizing territory), an opponent’s extremely high resolve to hold a piece a territory can increase the difficulty with which a state with low resolve can take that territory. Moreover, if interests and resolve are sufficient, compellence may only be achieved with the seizure o f most, if not all, of the land in
