with which a state with low resolve can take that territory. Moreover, if interests and resolve are sufficient, compellence may only be achieved with the seizure o f most, if not all, of the land in question. Remember, strategic bombing can significantly reduce a state’s ability to hold territory, but it cannot take the territory." If the opponent’s highly values the territory in question, bombing should " Strategic bombing can facilitate the seizure o f territory by friendly ground forces, such as during the Persian Gulf War. This an important, yet often overlooked, aspect of strategic bombing. Too often success is measured in terms of which branch o f the armed service led the victory instead of how the branches worked together to achieve victory. 463  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 476 --- be used with other forms o f military force. This is because the target state may not concede prior to the actual loss o f territory. When undertaking defensive compellence, interests and resolve are less important. Attempts to seize territory outside the homeland tend to lessen the interests and resolve o f the attacking state.^' A well-executed strategic bombing campaign can thwart an enemy attack. O f course, strategic bombing is best suited for stopping a large offensive; it cannot necessarily compel the attacking state to forgo future attacks. Admittedly, defeat is a bitter pill which often can modify a state’s behavior. However, when the attacking state’s interests and resolve are sufficiently high, a compelling state will find it difficult to dissuade from future offensives or continuing a lower intensity conflict. Thus, strategic bombing’s ability to achieve lasting compellence can be limited by resolve and interests of the attacking state. Nonetheless, the advantage of military denial is that it tends to mitigate the effects of interest and resolve more than the other strategies. As Robert Pape showed, simply weighing a balance o f interests and resolve is
