the military denial strategy. 470  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 483 --- equivocal measures o f success and uncertainty over the degree to which strategic bombing played in the success. Other theorists have not addressed the shock strategy in-depth. George, et al., touch on it because coercive diplomacy often relies upon small, discrete applications of military power to demonstrate resolve and the ability to use force without destroying military capability or wreaking massive destruction on cities. Yet, not being military theorists and less interested in the military situation, they do not fully explain the shock strategy. Other authors ignore it. This may be in part because they do not view the shock strategy as a separate strategy, but instead merely a lesser punishment campaign. Moreover, its ambiguous charaeter and results do not lend themselves to tidy analysis. In fact, the shock strategy has, on occasion, been one part of a larger compellent operation and its effect is often overshadowed by other factors which may extenuate the shock strategy. For example, this strategy provided compellent leverage that significantly contributed to the fall of Mussolini and the subsequent surrender of Italy. However, this was not the only source of compellent leverage. The Allies seizure of Sicily and the imminent threat to the Italian mainland played key and very conspicuous roles in the compellent success. The collapse o f Italian morale and inability to defend the homeland meant inevitable surrender. But the bombing surely expedited the surrender, which is the whole point o f compellence. Nonetheless, the military vulnerability aspect gamers more attention and credit for the surrender.^^ Similar examples are the Linebacker II operation against North 471  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 484 --- Vietnam in 1972 and the Iraqi missile campaign in 1988 against Iran. Finally, the shock strategy has failed to produce compellent success in some very dramatic
