Finally, the shock strategy has failed to produce compellent success in some very dramatic cases. The Allied bombing o f Dresden in 1945 eould not induce a German surrender. And the U.S. bombing attack in Lebanon in 1983 was a complete failure. The easily recognized failures may have led other authors to shy away from this strategy. How Does it Work? The shock strategy can effectively influence the opposing leaders via bombing a wide variety of targets. Besides military targets, such as fielded armed forces, the shock strategy can strike the leadership itself, important economic installations, or even target the civilian morale and will with indiscriminate urban attacks. The key is to determine what targets the leadership finds to be highly valuable or can indirectly pressure the leaders, and/or how the leadership will perceive the bombing as being highly threatening enough to force a modification in policy. That task, however, is very difficult and does lend itself to neat formulas, statements, and predictions. Indeed, there is no single operationalization o f the shock strategy that leads to success. Instead, it is better to explain some things that can affect the success or failure of the shock strategy and describe some tendencies o f successful operations. A successful operationalization is highly dependent on many of the contextual variables also working in coercive diplomacy. As George, et al., 472  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 485 --- showed, coercive diplomacy is highly dependent on the geo-political environment in which it is operating. And just as importantly, the compelling state must be able to integrate and tailor its political, diplomatic, and military activities to match its coercion objectives.’ ’ In fact, it is very important to coordinate the diplomatic and military actions precisely than when using military denial because its
