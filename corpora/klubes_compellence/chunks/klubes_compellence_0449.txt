of vulnerability in the leadership and this probably helped Linebacker II achieve its goals. Additionally, the shock strategy can vividly demonstrate to the leaders how vulnerable their state is to future bombings which could cause even more damage. Civilians actually seem more affected by shock bombing than wider, more intense punishment campaigns. While this result is by no means certain, it has happened on a number of occasions. The amount of damage inflieted does not even have to be that extensive. The results are possibly due to the unexpected and unanticipated nature of some shock operations as well as their ability to affect large urban populations. It also helps if the state is unable to defend itself effectively or respond in kind.^"* The shock strategy used the susceptibility of civilian morale to limited bombing as a means of exploiting the leadership vulnerability on numerous occasions. The most prominent examples of this result are the German bombing of Britain in WWI, the Allied bombing of Italy, the Iraqi missiles attacks on Iran and Israel during the Iran-Iraq War and Gulf War respectively. O f course, this strategy has also failed (i.e. the Allied attack on Dresden), which shows that the shock 475  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 488 --- strategy targeting the civilian morale will not always be effective. Indeed, its effectiveness ean be difficult to predict.'* Successful shock strategies demonstrate strength and military ability. Dramatically illuminating military inferiority simply adds to the psychological jolt of being bombed. Small, pinprick strikes against fielded military forces without threatening the overall military capability have provided little compellent leverage. If attacking ostensibly tactical targets, the compeller probably would be more successful by inflicting damage that indicates the compeller could threaten the other sideâ€™s ability to hold territory.
