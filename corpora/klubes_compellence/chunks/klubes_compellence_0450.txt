would be more successful by inflicting damage that indicates the compeller could threaten the other side’s ability to hold territory. The 1983 U.S. bombing in Lebanon and the scattered NATO attacks against Serbian tanks and artillery pieces in Bosnia during 1994 and 1995 are examples of weak executions which also failed to threaten territorial control (or much of anything). It also helps to show the will and ability to strike again. In a sense, this is exploiting military vulnerability by demonstrating superiority without specifically raising the issue of denying the ability to control territory.

Therefore, I would never recommend direct attacks on civilians, regardless of the potential for successful compellence. And one should be very careful with applying indirect pressure. Bombing the economic infrastructure to "bring the war home" to the enemy’s civilian population may be legal under the current laws of war by justifying the operation as attacks against the enemy’s ability to support military activities. Nevertheless, a compeller should question seriously whether its political objectives are really worth pressuring civilians. While I must recognize its influence, one should be aware of the legal and moral ramifications of this method of employing air power. 476  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 489 --- It is important to remember that shock strategy successes are not as large in degree as compellent successes based on military denial. The shock strategy cannot dramatically change the military or political situation. Although it has expedited a surrender, it has not been the primary cause for capitulation. Linebacker II’s limited compellent leverage and success should never be confused with the vastly more potent and successful Linebacker I. Compellent objectives should be
