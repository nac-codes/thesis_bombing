by the compelling state’s air power. In every case o f failure, there were few indications that the targeted state’s leaders perceiving much pressure. This is applicable to other forms o f compellent leverage, such as economic embargoes. The second point is that compellent success seems to be facilitated by military and political objectives coinciding as much as possible. Clausewitz may have stated that war is an extension of politics, but applications of military force tend to wield the most influence over the military situation. This dissertation has shown that political objectives that are widely divergent from the military objectives are frequently difficult to achieve. Too often, strategic bombing has been called on to accomplish political goals far removed from the immediate military ends. And it has failed. The fault lies not so much with the military force, but the with leadership that failed to use it properly. 479  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 492 --- APPENDIX I have added the appendix to glean important information from other examples of strategic bombing to further demonstrate the validity of my conclusions. It was particularly significant to include the Lebanon bombing raid to illustrate a failed one-strike shock strategy and the Persian Gulf War to discuss John Warden’s parallel warfare theories. The inclusion o f the Korean War further butresses my conclusions regarding the link between territorial objectives and strategic bombing effectiveness. A single strike raid like the Libya operation, the U.S. bombing of Lebanon nevertheless was the antithesis of the Libya raid. Nearly everything that contributed to the success in Libya was not present in the Lebanon operation. It is a perfect example of how not to execute a one-strike shock strategy. I believe the appendix highlights the differences between the two sufficiently. The Persian Gulf War provides much insight into the effectiveness of Warden’s theories in addition to the value of smar
