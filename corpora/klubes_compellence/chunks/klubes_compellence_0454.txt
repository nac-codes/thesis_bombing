I believe the appendix highlights the differences between the two sufficiently. The Persian Gulf War provides much insight into the effectiveness of Warden’s theories in addition to the value of smart weapons. Thus, I felt it was important to include it in this study. Yet upon more detailed analysis, I concluded it was not a pure case of compellence, that is the U.S. government was not keen on accomplishing its political objectives prior to completion of its military goals. Thus, it does not fit my criteria for the main body examples. Furthermore, the souree material is still limited. It would be beneficial to wait a few years for more 480  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 493 --- scholarly historical literature that will likely add considerably to our understanding of this conflict.

Like Vietnam, in Korea the U.S. used strategic bombing first for interdiction with some economic infrastructure attacks to deny military capability and deliver pain. But the Communist’s need for few supplies during the static attrition war of the last two years as well as Chinese and Soviet support stymied the American bombing. And like the Vietnam War, in Korea a shock strategy at the end of the war seemed to provide some compellent leverage. Besides giving more evidence to support my conclusion, including the Korean War also helps show that how air power fared in the Vietnam War was no fluke. The Korean War, 1950-1953 The U.S.’ first strategic bombing experience on the Asian mainland faced many problems that restricted its effectiveness. Eventually, it provided some compellent leverage at the very end of the war, but overall its influence was limited. Unfortunately, the U.S. did not pay enough attention to the lessons of this conflict before executing Rolling Thunder during the Vietnam War.
