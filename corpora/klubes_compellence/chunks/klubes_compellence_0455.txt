U.S. did not pay enough attention to the lessons of this conflict before executing Rolling Thunder during the Vietnam War. The U.S. use o f air power in the Korean War that merits discussion can be divided into five phases: 1) tactical interdiction and bombing during the North Korean invasion; the UN counterattack and the early Chinese offensives; 2) initial strategic bombing from July to September 1950; 3) the interdiction campaign known as Operation 481  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 494 --- Strangle during 1951; 4) the air pressure campaign of 1952; and 5) the attacks on the irrigation dams in May and June 1953.

Faced with the collapse of an ally/client state to a communist regime, the U.S. decided to intervene under the auspices of the United Nations.^ North Korea overrun much of the South, but U.S. reinforcements eventually stopped the Communist advance by the end of July.'

The heavily armed North Koreans, outfitted with tanks and artillery, needed large amounts of supplies to maintain effectiveness. As the North Koreans drove further southward, the American planes made it increasingly difficult to get sufficient reinforcements and supplies to the front lines. The U.S. also began to widen its interdiction operations to include the transportation network (i.e., railroads, highways, and bridges) in North Korea.^ The tactical and interdiction effort continued as the UN pursued the retreating North Koreans after the Inchon invasion in September 1950. However, it was less effective after the Chinese attacked in late 1950 and early 1951, mainly because the Chinese had exclusively infantry forces that were much better at ®  Like the Persian Gulf War, although it was an UN operation, the U.S. was
