The U.S. was unable to prevent 483  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 496 --- imports from these states, so North Korea could replace anything it lost and continue the w ar/ Attempting military denial via the economic infrastructure strategy was not a bad choice as the conflict hinged on territorial control of South Korea. It did have some effect on the North Korean Army. Nonetheless, the economic infrastructure strategy was not successful because it could not fully deny the resources needed to support the war due to Chinese and Soviet support. Of course, the other options would not have fared any better. A punishment campaign against North Korea would have been even less effective as it could have not slowed the Communist advance at all. And a pulverization/shock strategy aimed at fire-boming North Korean cities may have slowed or stopped the North Koreans, but it also would have been a political catastrophe for the U.S. and probably brought China into the war earlier (and maybe even the Soviet Union).

After driving south past the original border at the 38th Parallel, by the spring of 1951, the UN had counterattacked and stabilized the front line just north o f 38th Parallel. The U.S. decided that re-unifying Korea under South Korean government was not worth the heavy cost required to defeat the numerically superior Chinese.
