to Rolling Thunder o f the Vietnam War; a mainly interdiction effort to deny military capability and deliver punishment to the Communists. The most ardent supporters o f air power believed that Operation Strangle could compel the Communists to pull back their forces or make concessions during the armistice talks. However, due to the skepticism o f air power achieving compellence, most o f the U.S. military commanders emphasized the denial objective." Although Operation Strangle undoubtedly caused problems for the Communists, it was probably not a success. Because China’s intentions are still not known precisely. Operation Strangle may have forestalled a Chinese offensive. More likely though, China had no plans for launching a major offensive. Operation Strangle made the Communists’ task of supplying the front lines more difficult and soaked up scarce resources. But the Communists supply requirements were so small that their large amount o f available manpower could keep sufficient supplies moving. Moreover, the fighting in North Korea was supported by resources sent from China and the Soviet Union, which Operation Strangle could not attack directly. Even worse, the Americans lacked sufficient planes to cover North Korea fully and had only limited night-time ability (allowing the Communists to move at night). The U.S. eventually realized Operation Strangle had failed to interdict a sufficient amount o f supplies to make the decisive difference and the cost in airplanes and pilots was too high to justify continued attacks against the remaining low-value targets. By 1952, the U.S. de-emphasized strategic interdiction.'^ 486  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 499 --- This is another example of the weak leverage gained by military denial during attrition warfare. Territorial control was not a significant issue at this stage o f the war and the low level o f military activity meant the Communists’  front-line troops needed little support. And this support is what
