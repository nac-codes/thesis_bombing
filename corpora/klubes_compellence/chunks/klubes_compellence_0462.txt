mpellent leverage the bombing operation gained.** This division in the ranks undermined the apperance o f UN cohesiveness. The problem with this execution was the failure to deliver the pain where it really mattered. China and the Soviet Union were the primary decision-makers and the bombings did not inflict sufficient pain to the Soviet Union, and especially China, to induce any concessions. O f course, the U.S. was limited in the ability to inflict pain on the Soviet Union and China.

The destruction o f the dams would also flood the surrounding local areas, which included some important transportation routes. This operation intended to inflict pain by disrupting food production and to show there was a cost for continuing the war. The military benefit was that Korean rice fed the communist soldiers that China or the Soviet Uni
