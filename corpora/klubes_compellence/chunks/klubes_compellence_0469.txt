ization screwed up the orders so the pilots took off without a proper briefing or even fully prepared planes. The raid itself used outmoded tactics that exposed the American planes to stiff defenses for 496  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 509 --- too long. During the operation two planes were shot down, killing one pilot and allowing the capture of his bombardier/navigator. Surprisingly, the remaining U.S. planes hit their targets, a testament to the ability o f the Naval aviators.^- However, the destruction of these targets made no difference. They were insignificant to the Syrians and the poor execution robbed the U.S. o f any credibility or compellent leverage. The Syrian leader, Hafez Assad, gave no indication of being impressed or intimidated and certainly did not change his state’s behavior. Instead, the bombing operation demonstrated vividly the untenable situation in Lebanon and led to the Marine withdrawal in early 1984. Thus, the aerial attack achieved nothing positive for the U.S. The shock strategy relies on bombing something o f the leaders consider valuable, stunning the bombed state’s leaders, and/or to creating indirect pressure on the leadership. Yet, the American planes struck meaningless tactical targets far removed from Syria’s military or political leaders. And the shootdown o f two planes and the capture of an aviator wrecked the demonstration o f American military prowess and eliminated any stun effect. There was no indirect pressure, such as civilian unrest, on Assad. Finally, the bombing operation did not generate any pressure from military denial as it did not threaten Syria’s territorial control over Lebanon. In short, the bombing operation provided no compellent leverage for the U.S. and thus must be considered a failure. 497  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 510 --- The Persian Gulf War, 1991 The Persian Gulf is a highly interesting case, but there was less room for compellence than commonly thought because the U.S.’
