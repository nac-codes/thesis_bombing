raq’s air defense system, and systematically destroying Iraq’s air fields. Then, over the next five weeks American air power savaged Iraq’s military industry, logistical and supply facilities, power production plants and oil facilities, command and control installations, communications, and transportation system.*’ ”  While many planes were diverted to hunt for Iraqi SCUD missiles, the campaign against the Iraqi fielded military forces actually consumed the vast majority of aerial sorties.^^ Smart weapons played a critical role by vastly decreasing the number of bombing sorties needed to destroy each target and reducing the amount o f collateral damage. Consequently, the U.S. could wreck Iraq’s economic infrastructure that supporting its war machine without devastating the surrounding urban areas. Smart weapons also facilitated the success o f the F-117 stealth light-bomber, as the astounding bombing accuracy overcame the plane’s limited payload (only two weapons) and number (only 44 were deployed). Clearly, smart weapons increased the destructive power and overall influence of aerial bombing. Yet it is still undetermined if they will change the theoretical foundations for employing strategic bombing; smart weapons may simply accentuate the strategic bombing’s potency. ^  Iraq’s nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons industries were also bombed. But post-war inspections determined that the U.S. underestimated the size o f these Iraqi industries significantly. The American planes hit what they were told to, but a lack of intelligence limited the effect on Iraq’s NBC program. 502  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 515 --- For example, Warden’s parallel warfare is not predicated on smart weapons, but it is much more effective with them. Saddam Apparently Blinks Just prior to the start o f the ground war, the Soviet Union attempted to broker a diplomatic solution. This effort had the most potential for a settlement because Iraq apparently was backing off its
