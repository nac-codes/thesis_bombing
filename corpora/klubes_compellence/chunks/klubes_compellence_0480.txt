er the war over the Patriots’ accuracy and efficacy. Clearly, they were not the wonder weapons the U.S. military portrayed them to be. This, however, is missing the point. The SCUDs were psychological, not military, weapons. Therefore, the only worthwhile measurement o f the Patriots’ effectiveness was whether they reduced the anxiety of the Israeli people. They did this, so the Patriot deployment was successful. Ironically, the Patriots did not have to actually work to be effective. For a criticism o f the Patriot see Theodore Postol, "Lessons o f the Gulf War Experience with Patriot," International Security 16, no. 3 (Winter 1991/92): 118-171. 508  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 521 --- Saudi government’s tight control over the news, these SCUD attacks did not make any significant impact on the war. This use o f the shock strategy with missiles again illustrated the susceptibility o f civilians to pressure via air power. The compellent leverage gained by the missiles again far outweighed the material damage inflicted or military effectiveness.

The shock strategy failed in this case. 509  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 522 --- REFERENCES Chapter One -  Introduction 1.
