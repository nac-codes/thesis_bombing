George's methodological developments are also of great relevance.  George was concerned with the increasingly wide gap between social science theory and policy formulation and the increasing inability to integrate history into formalistic social science research. Therefore, he developed the structured, focused comparison method as a way to extract information from historical examples as part of a rigorous social science study. For a complete discussion of this methodology see: Alexander George, "Case Studies and Theory Development: The Method of Structured, Focused Comparison,"  in Diplomacy,  ed. Paul Lauren (New York: The Free Press, 1979), 43-68; Harry Eckstein, "Case Study and Theory in Political Science", in Handbook of Political Science. Vol. 7: Strategies of Inquiry,  ed.

Chapter Four -  The Israeli-Egyptian War of Attrition 1969- 1970 1. The lack of interest in this war has resulted in only a sparse collection of English langauge sources. By far the best source for the history of the War of Attrition and how air power affected it is Yaacov Bar-Siman-Tov, The Israeli-Egyptian War of Attrition. 1969-1970 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1980). Bar-Siman-Tov used a wide range of English and Hebrew sources from published documents and Israeli archives in addition to interviewing high level Israeli policy-makers. He provides the best perspective for the Israeli government's motivations and objectives. Avi Shlaim
