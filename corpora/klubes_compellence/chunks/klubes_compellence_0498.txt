The Vietnam conflict provides, by far, the most literature. Briefly, Clodfelter's book is the best history of Rolling Thunder. Another good account of the air war is Earl Tilford, Crosswinds (College Station, TX: Texas A&M University Press, 1993). Two of the best sources for the U.S. government's decision-making during this era includes. The Pentagon Papers: The Defense Department Historv of United States Decisionmaking on Vietnam.  Senator Gravel Edition, Volumes III & IV, (Boston: Beacon Press, 1971); and Leslie Gelb and Richard Betts, The Ironv of Vietnam: The System Worked (Washington, D.C.:  The Brookings Institution, 1979) .  For sources that emphasize the U.S.' coercion efforts see 530  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 543 --- Wallace Thies, When Governments Collide (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1980); and Alexander George and William Simons, eds.. The Limits of Coercive Diplomacy,  2nd ed. (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1994) . Unfortuantely, sources regarding North Vietnam's decision­ making are sparse, see Douglas Pike's War. Peace and the Viet Cong (Cambridge, MA: The M.I.T. Press, 1969); and Viet Cong (Cambridge, MA: The M.I.T. Press, 1966). 2.
