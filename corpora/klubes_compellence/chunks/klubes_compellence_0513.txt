I have tried to combine the sources to provide a broad range of thought while condensing the complexity of a state's foreign policy into a few paragraphs. The best discussion of Libya's foreign policy under Gaddafi is St. John's Gaddafi's World Design, passim. Also of value and from diverse points of view are Davis, 20-21; Simons, 245-291; and Lillian Harris, Libva - Gadhafi's Revolution and the Modern State (Boulder, CG: Westview Press, 1986), 83-106. 6.
