The traditional explanation is that China's government only decided to move in after the U.S. had crossed the 38th Parallel after the Inchon invasion. Recent scholarship, based on newly opened Chinese and Soviet archives, provides two more interpretations that contend China's decision to intervene was set in motion before the U.S. crossed the 3 8th Parallel. However, the first holds China reluctantly entered the war due to the U.S. threat and Soviet prodding, the second argues China's government decided to intervene shortly after the war began to drive the U.S. (and other foreign forces) from the Korean Peninsula. For the foremost example of the traditional explanation see Alan Whiting, China Crosses the Yalu (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1960). The first recent explanation is found in Goncharov, Lewis, and Litai, 13 0-225; and the second in Chen Jian, China's Road to the Korean War (New York: Columbia University Press,  1994). 7.

The military history literature does not discuss the stalemated last two years as much as the more active first year. For example, about 900 of Clay Blair's 976 pages of text deal with the first year. For some information regarding this period, also see
