of 9-10 March 1945. Many people think that Dresden and Hamburg were the most destroyed cities in Germany. But the British and U.S. bombing surveys prepared after World War II tell us that Wesel, a city of 25,000 inhabi- tants, Wuppertal-Elberfeld with over 400,000 inhabitants, and Würzburg with 107,000 inhabitants, were 97 percent, 94 per- cent, and 89 percent destroyed, respectively.

Few books explain why strategic bombing was often used as response to other forms of warfare, such as naval blockade or as retaliation for perceived enemy transgressions. In the endeavor to trace the political, economic, and military background of strategic bombing and its distasteful offspring, area bombing, one cannot find a conclusive published reason- ing. The British historian Geoffrey Best laments the fact and asks how much longer one must wait for an appraisal of the origins and development of strategic bombing.1 To come to terms with the subject of strategic and area bombing we need a debate. Books such as Ronald Schaffer's Wings of Judgment, which covers the American bombing in World War II, form a partial basis, although the author says his presentations are bound to stir controversy.2 An international conference was held at the Militärgeschichtliches Forschungsamt (Institute of Military History), Freiburg, Germany in 1988 at which many renowned historians presented papers on "The Conduct of the Air War in the Second World War." Strategic and area bombing were extensively covered. The head of the institute expressed hope that the
