ny renowned historians presented papers on "The Conduct of the Air War in the Second World War." Strategic and area bombing were extensively covered. The head of the institute expressed hope that the publication of the proceed- ings would contribute to an objective analysis.3 One wonders whether it could, because many prominent authors/historians were not present.
