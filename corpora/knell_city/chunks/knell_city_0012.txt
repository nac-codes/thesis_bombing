my hometown I felt that the leaders responsible for the bombing war should also be made accountable. I decided then and there that I would dig into this bombing. I knew little about it then and all its implications but I was going to study it, and as his- tory is normally written by the victors, I as a vanquished would put down what I thought about it. I planned to write the facts, that the Luftwaffe had bombed Warsaw, Rotterdam, cities in Britain, Belgrade, Stalingrad, and many other places; that the RAF and the USAAF had flattened my hometown when there was no more military necessity for it.

Not until the mid-1980s did books appear, albeit most of them still written by the "victors," that threw a more critical light on the bombing subject. There were books by Germans which ca
