There were books by Germans which castigated the Luftwaffe for what it had done, but in typical German self-flagellation, were easy on the bombing of 11 Dresden and Hamburg. The worst air raid ever, in March 1945 on Tokyo, I only learned about one year before writing these lines. More books have appeared since 1980, but still there are gaps of knowledge. Some of these gaps can be covered when more closed files at the Public Record Office at Richmond out- side of London will be available; others, when scholars have the time and money to study now available Soviet archives. It became clear to me with the study of available literature that I was facing a number of problems: Despite the multitude of books published in the last fifty years and the masses of doc- uments available in archives, there is still much research needed to gain an objective view; composing something as a "van- quished," as I had thought of in 1945, would be unfair and not objective; many books have been written on the subject, but most seem to be in essence either praising the wisdom and results of area bombing or condemning them; interpretations can be rather biased and many books leave out facts which would not support the biased view (similarly, I found that quot- ed documents have been interpreted to suit the authors' views which brought me to the conclusion that I may have to look up some documents myself and then arrive at my own interpreta- tion); few authors went into the background of area bombing- the political, economic, and military implications as to why this disaster culminated in World War II; and that I could contribute personal experience and detailed knowledge of one of the worst examples of area bombing. These thoughts went through my mind and my attitude toward the subject changed. In the more than fifty years since
