not think that Bomber Harris should be condemned. His decision in the morning hours of 16 March 1945 to send Mosquitos and Lancasters of No. 5 Bomber Group over Würzburg that night has affected me among thousands of oth- ers. His decision caused me personal loss and pain. In the years immediately after 1945 I was ready to prove that there was a war criminal who got away. But as the years have passed, so has my pain and the loss has passed into history. So has Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris. I now want to know why it all happened. What were the reasons behind it?

What led to the destruction of Würzburg?

The first one happened during the night of 21-22 February 1942, when a seemingly lost RAF bomber dropped its load. The last one occurred on 31 March 1945 when the U.S. Army Air Force flew bombers and fighters over the city for about seven hours. Yet the raid that caused the overwhelming damage and which as such was one of the more effective ones of the Allied bomber campaign against Germany, occurred during the night of 16-17 March 1945. Mosquitos and Lancasters of the RAF Bomber Command unloaded tons of incendiary and high- explosive bombs that night. The results in pure ice-cold statis- tics were: 89 percent of the city was destroyed, an estimated 5,000 civilians were dead, 90,000 people had lost t
