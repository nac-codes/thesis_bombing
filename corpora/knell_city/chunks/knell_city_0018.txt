ts course. To me personally, present during all but one raid visited upon the city, there seemed at the end of World War II no logic in the destruction and killing. And today, after years of reading and studies, I still do not under- stand why Würzburg was destroyed. STRATEGIC AND NON-STRATEGIC ASSETS OF WÜRZBURG Studying a map one cannot escape the observation that Würzburg was and is a city of importance for German infra- structure. Rail lines from east to west cross with lines from northeast to southwest and from northwest to southeast. Long before World War II there also existed a net of first-class roads which intersected at Würzburg. Also the Main River, on which Würzburg is situated, is an important inland waterway. King Ludwig I of Bavaria had the Main-Donau Canal dug in the nineteenth century to allow small barge traffic from Rotterdam to Bucharest. Between 1933 and 1939 dams with large locks were constructed along the Main upstream as far as Würzburg. These structures with their Rhine barge-size locks allow the transport of mass goods. Today, thanks to a new canal, the Rhine connects to the Donau via the Main. The dams or Stauwerke, as they are called in Germany, also generate electric power. They all have turbines which have been feeding into the superbly laid out and operated German national electric power grid. In addition to the strategic assets which nature had given Würzburg and which industry, commerce, and government had developed over the years, there were, in World War II, a number of installations which could not be denied a certain war potential. As part of the German national electric grid there was (and still is) a large transformer station in the north- western outskirts. There also was a small steampower station  To DESTROY A CITY 20 WÜRZBURG AS TARGET in the inner city which supplied outmoded DC current at 110 Volt. Because the city was a rail center there were and are rail- way installations: A central station for passenger traffic north
