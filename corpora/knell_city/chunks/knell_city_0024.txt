Why would such a city of small strate- gic value and with few facilities to support the German war effort be the target of a bomber fleet? Rumors had gone around before the big raid-and everybody believed them and passed them on-that Churchill had studied at Würzburg University, and that the city had been declared a "hospital town." It was thought that any one of these facts would save us from being visited by the Allied bombers. Then, after the raid, other rumors were circulating to explain why it had happened after all.

Many historians have since clearly established that the "gauleiter story" was a myth. There were no such communications between the enemies. In early March 1945 the U.S. Army advanced in western Germany toward the Rhine. It crossed the Rhine by a daring strike which gave it the bridge at Remagen intact on 7 March 1945 and another bridge at Oppenheim, due west of Würzburg, on 21 March.

It was an ominous sign of things to come. That raises the question whether Würzburg was attacked as a tactical target in advance of the approaching U.S. forces. If the main raid of 16 March and any o
