It was an ominous sign of things to come. That raises the question whether Würzburg was attacked as a tactical target in advance of the approaching U.S. forces. If the main raid of 16 March and any of the others had been tac- tical ones, i.e. in support of ground troops, the judgment on these raids and the thousands of similar ones on other cities would have been and would be to this day that they were fully justifiable and legal military operations. But as the documents at the Public Record Office, the 25 National Archives at College Park near Washington, D.C., and other archives show, the Royal Air Force Bomber Command and the U.S. Army Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces operated independently from SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force under General Eisenhower). Shortly after the war we were told that the RAF had orders to destroy all German cities with more than 100,000 inhabi- tants. Since Würzburg had at the beginning of the war only 107,000 people we were at the end of the list, after such cities as Hamburg and Munich, and, therefore, our moment finally arrived toward the end of the war. But as one can gather from literature and documents in the respective archives there is no truth in that. However, one fact is clear. Arthur Harris, the RAF Bomber Command chief, and Carl Spaatz, commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces stationed in Britain and Italy, had run out of worthwhile targets by early 1945.3 Target categories had been worked out in Britain before and during the war by the Ministry of Economic Warfare and in the United States, before it entered the conflict, by the USAAF in AWDP-1 (Air War Defence Plan 1). The detail tar- gets came eventually from the Allied Target Committee. Its rec- ommendations were passed on to the commanders of the respective bomber fleets. Much research went into producing statistics, from numbers of inhabitants to distances from bomber bases, significance for the German war effort, and all intelligence which had an i
