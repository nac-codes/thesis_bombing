as officially termed, was "to burn and destroy an enemy industrial centre"7 its base of information was limited and the question must be asked was it worth the risks, costs, and effort to send 225 bombers off into the hostile night. Last but not least as seen from the Allied side, was it worth the loss of the one bomber shot down by a Luftwaffe nightfighter dur- ing the raid over the city. And worse still, was it worth the loss of its crew of seven. Six killed in action and one shot deliber- ately two days later by an SS police officer after the RAF man had been flushed out of his hiding place.8 When one studies the statistics published by the city administration one can easily see that Würzburg had some strategic importance.º But the question remains, of course, was the destruction justified at the time, when the Third Reich was in its last fatal convulsions. The last statistics available for river transport show in a published report for 1943 the following: The Old Harbour (Staatshafen): Turn-over of goods: 306,737 t 801 barges came in with 153,834 tons 861 barges left with 152,903 tons The New Harbour (Neuer Hafen): Turn-over of goods: 682,862 t 1,214 barges came in with 563,174 tons 995 barges left with 119,688 tons Total turnover in the harbor installations was close to a mil- lion metric tons in 1943 and one can assume that in 1944 the tonnage was probably the same. The goods transhipped were coal, ores, grain, building materials, and bulk food. As Würzburg was at the end of the river transport system these goods and materials were loaded onto or from freight trains in the adjacent marshalling yard. There are no records of the Reichsbahn, the German state railway, for these periods, but the magnitude of the operation can be assessed when one consid- ers the capacity of the marshalling yard. It was at the time two thousand cars per day. The largest German marshalling yard was at Hamm and had a capacity of ten thousand cars per day. When one transposes the above
