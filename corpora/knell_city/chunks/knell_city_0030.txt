ds and we saw and heard the armadas flying in and out of this target area. One U.S. bomber even crashed into W端rzburg without killing anybody on the ground. But the first signs of change happened in mid-1944. One night, long after the air-raid sirens had howled, there was engine noise in the air and suddenly flares were dropped. The city was bathed in artificial daylight. I remember the details of noise and light, because I was standing, foolishly and ignorant of the possible consequences, in the front door of our building; albeit ready to run down to the air-raid shelter in the basement at the first sign of trouble. What I do not remember is the date. Nothing happened and after a while the flares burned out and the city was in darkness again. Nobody understood what had happened and even today, after much research at the Public 29 Record Office, I cannot say whether we were photographed or whether the fireworks were one of Bomber Command's spoof exercises to mislead the German defenses. But around that time we were photographed as the pictures in the Public Record Office show. The irony of these photographs is that despite all the camouflaging the authorities of W端rzburg had gone into, the city was clearly identifiable in every detail. One of the RAF photos even has marked on it the locations of the town hall and the Nazi headquarters. We did not know and could not possi- bly guess the implications of this visit; but Bomber Command was getting its file updated. Yet W端rzburg was still not a priority target. With the entry of the United States into the war and the posting of a huge bomber fleet to Britain the target selection had been given to the Combined Target Committee. On 31 January 1945 it hand- ed out a revised list based on instructions from the Air Ministry identifying categories of targets.12 In the third and fourth category one could with some justification include W端rzburg, because these categories included transport centers and jet fighter airfields.
