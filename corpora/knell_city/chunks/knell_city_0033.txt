But their bombs were loosened a few seconds too late and they all fell on a purely res- idential area killing forty-two civilians. Most of the dead had not gone to the air-raid shelters because nothing had happened before during the ceaseless alarms to which the population had been exposed and had become accustomed. From the USAAF files at the Albert F.

Three were dispatched, but one was lost prior to the raid. The attack is termed an experi- mental raid in the Bomber Command Intelligence Narratives on Operations.6 They dropped 3.6 tons of high explosive bombs and stayed about seventeen minutes over the target.

I remember the attack very well. It was a Sunday evening at around 8 P.M. We were sitting around the dinner table when suddenly a sound came into the a
