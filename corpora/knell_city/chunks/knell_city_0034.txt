and whatever was needed to plan a major attack. I remember the attack very well. It was a Sunday evening at around 8 P.M. We were sitting around the dinner table when suddenly a sound came into the air as if one of the jet fighters stationed at the Luftwaffe base was coming in low for landing. But a split second later there was a loud explosion nearby and, although I had never experienced a bombing, there was no doubt what had happened.
