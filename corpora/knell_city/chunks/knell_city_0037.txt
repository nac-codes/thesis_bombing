The routine for selection of targets for each night started with a morning meet- ing at High Wycombe, the Bomber Command headquarters west of London. Target lists were consulted and assessed, meteorological reports submitted, and then Harris would make a decision. Air Marshal Saundby, his deputy, would send out telegrams to the Group commanders outlining arming and fueling requirements and indicating the targets.

But before Bomber Command appeared again in our skies at night we experienced what the U.S. Army Air Force could do. For months the gleaming bomber formations with their vapor trails had passed over us during the days. The Voice of America had told us that American bombers would only attack military targets.
