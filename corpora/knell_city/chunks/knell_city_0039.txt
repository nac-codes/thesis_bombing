zburg still was not on it.9 The thirty-seven aircraft in this raid belonged to Bomber Groups 305 A, B and C and were to attack Bayreuth, but bad visibility prevented that attack and Würzburg, given as a secondary target, was bombed instead.10 Next, it was the turn of the RAF again. At around 8:30 P.M. on 3 March 1945, thirty-one Mosquitos appeared over Würzburg, marked the city with skymarkers, and dropped forty-seven tons of high explosives into the defined area. Time over target (ToT) as it is referred to in Bomber Command reports, was fifteen minutes. The bombs came down all over 37 the city, in the center and in outlying areas. One hit the old power station in the inner city and blacked out the area which was supplied with DC power from that source. This was the only target of strategic value. The rest were residential areas, open fields, and the monastery of the Franciscans. That bomb made a complete shambles in the other business my father had, the printing/bookbinding shop. Based on past experience and on the police radio announcements, which had warned of the approaching armada, most people had been in their shel- ters when the bombs started to fall. Despite these precautions eighty-six civilians were killed. As before, fires started from blown over furnaces and before long the sky over the city turned crimson. My own experience of the raid was different this time. After the daylight raid on the railway station my father decid- ed that the danger was getting worse and that he and I (my mother had died in 1941) needed sleep. We had spent the nights during the last months mostly either fully dressed in the flat waiting for the noise of approaching bombers or, as often happened, we were in the shelter because there were planes flying over us for hours. During the day it was similar and dur- ing the short periods of no alarms we had to work hard to sal- vage from the businesses what there could be salvaged. We owned a little garden cottage about five kilometers
