After a while there was a roaring noise of aircraft engines and before long we could see through  40 TO DESTROY A CITY THE RAIDS BEGIN the closed shutters that the sky was red. We dressew, step outside and knew at once that the hour had come. The sky w full of markers, Christmas trees as we called them. Our prop- erty was southwest of the city, outside of the marked area.
