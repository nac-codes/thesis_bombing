marking and call for corrections with further target indicators of a different color. His instructions were quite explicit and left no doubt that the 43 area foreseen for destruction was properly marked.14 Four min- utes before H-hour, the designated start of the raid, the marking and illumination of the city was to be complete and the bombers were to start coming up. The purpose of the raid was "to burn and destroy an enemy industrial centre." When one plots the marking coordinates on a city map of Würzburg, one finds, however, that the target area left out the industrial sections, the infrastructure installations, and all mil- itary establishments. The only strategic targets in the defined area were the small relocated ball-bearing factory and the area of the main railway station. The latter was already a pile of twisted steel and rubble. The rest of the "industrial centre" as marked was the baroque/rococo town with its treasures and the dwellings of its citizens. The area slated for destruction went beyond the inner city and included residential subdivi- sions outside the city center. The H-hour for Würzburg was to be 21:00 Central Euro- pean Time. But something must have gone wrong because it was not before 21:20 that the bombing started. It lasted seven- teen minutes. There are several books that describe what hap- pened in detail.15 They are based not only on reports of eyewit- nesses, but are the results of extensive research in British and German archives. The books make gruesome reading. What they cannot impart are the suffocating and pungent smells of a burning city and the stench of decomposing and seared human and animal flesh. The books show how innocent and also some not so innocent citizens were sucked into the maelstrom of World War II. Many lost their lives, many more were wound- ed, and the majority lost all their belongings. The statistics of this raid are in cold figures: No. 5 Bomber Group dispatched 225 Lancasters and 11 Mosquitos. 13 Lancaste
