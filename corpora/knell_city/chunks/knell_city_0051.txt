We dived through the small windows back into the basement and survived. Even the horse and cart miraculously survived. Two days later, on 20 March fighter bombers returned and raked the suburb of Heidingsfeld. Because it had been incor- porated into the city of Würzburg and supposedly as such showed on the Bomber Command target list, it had been 80 percent destroyed during the 16 March raid. Now four days later twenty more bombs fell, killing eleven people.

The primary assigned target had been the Giebelstadt Luftwaffe base, south of Würzburg. But when 445 Bombardment Group was to release its bombs another group intersected its course at a lower level and the Giebelstadt target was scrubbed.22 The next day, 23 March, fighter bombers came over the city and strafed what seemed worth attacking, but effected little damage. 47 There followed a lull of three days in which we only saw the planes and their contrails over us without being attacked.

They dropped 110 bombs of 500 lbs. each, all of which missed and fell on Unterdürrbach, a purely residential village north of Würzburg. The bombers, although,
