s works and the repaired railway station. They dropped 110 bombs of 500 lbs. each, all of which missed and fell on Unterd端rrbach, a purely residential village north of W端rzburg. The bombers, although, claimed to have hit the target.23 The orders for the bombers were originally to attack the bitumi- nous gasoline works at Zeitz. Bad weather prevented that attack and the bombers turned to the secondary target of Plauen. Not all aircraft could attack that city and therefore the rest turned to Meiningen. But over that target ranged confu- sion and eleven bombers turned away to raid W端rzburg. More attacks occurred later in the day when Bomber Groups 322, 344, 386, and 391 of the Ninth USTAAF attacked the marshalling yard at Zell at 3 P.M. About 130 twin-engine bombers dropped 260 tons of high-explosive bombs and caused considerable damage in the yard. The raid was flown at the request of the advancing U.S. Army, which feared that the Wehrmacht was going to stage a counterattack from W端rzburg using the railway facilities to bring in the troops.24 The final blows came as the U.S. Army approached the city. On 31 March, at the request of the 12th Armoured and 45th Infantry Divisions, two hundred bombers of the Ninth USTAAF dropped 275 tons of bombs on the marshalling yard, the adjacent military warehouses, and the army barracks northwest of the city. The master bomber of Bomber Group 409, one of the six groups attacking, misidentified his assigned target and directed the bombs of his group on the Koenig and Bauer Factory adjacent to the marshalling yard, destroying it completely. The factory was not an assigned target. The ware- houses escaped damage but the yard was plowed over some more.25 In addition, fighter bombers raked the city for about seven hours intermittently, shooting at anything that moved. One of the persons who moved in the city was myself. I will never forget this raid. I was in the city when it start- ed. No alarm could be heard, because there were no more
