ey, and other sources all agree that it was the worst or sec- ond worst destroyed German city of more than 100,000 inhab- itants. In the narrative of the official history of the RAF bomber campaign against Germany, Würzburg is not mentioned. It only figures in a reproduced list of the British Bombing Survey.27 Apparently the military effort was not big enough to merit mention in the official history. That it was one of the most efficient ones appeared not to have mattered.

It was not long before the military latched on to this invention, using it to carry explosives over enemy territory to drop on selected targets. The real flyer came with the Wright brothers invention. The first heavier-than-air machine took flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on 17 December 1903. The Wright brothers submitted their design to the U.S. government for military use in scouting and message transmittal. The U.S. government showed no interest.

Governments and wealthy individuals acquired samples of this new contraption and flying clubs were founded. Even in provincial Würzburg the latest airplanes were demonstrated on what eventually became Der Flugplatz (the aerodrome) on the hill east of
