Even in provincial WÃ¼rzburg the latest airplanes were demonstrated on what eventually became Der Flugplatz (the aerodrome) on the hill east of the city in 1910. By that time the Wright broth- ers had formed companies with local partners in France and 51  52 To DESTROY A CITY THE ROAD TO AREA BOMBING Germany. The German industrial enterprises AEG and Krupp had formed Flugmaschine Wright GmbH, a limited company, to build planes for, among others, the Italians.

The Turks claimed that one of the planes dropped an explosive on a Turkish field hospital. If that is true, it was the beginning of aerial bombing. Tactical bombing means destroying a military object to permit ones soldiers to advance; i. e. tactical bombing happens on the battlefield. Strategic bombing means one attacks far behind the battlefield to destroy military targets, which can be anything from a munitions dump to a weapons factory to a railway station; anything that will enhance and support the enemy's war effort. If one cannot find them or hit them and some bombs fall on civilians-well there the tragedy starts. Yet if to the list of strategic targets is added the morale of the enemy population, the limit of chivalry and fairness in human combat has been exceeded. We are back to medieval times when the rape of civilian populations was the norm.
