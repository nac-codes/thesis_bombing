and goats held in trenches while bombs were exploded nearby. The tests were performed in the Salisbury Plains in October 1939 at the instigation of the Ministry of Home Security.18 The ministry wanted an assess- ment of how people would suffer and should react, if still capa- ble, after a bomb had exploded near their air-raid shelter. Lord Zuckerman himself was in one of the trenches, slightly farther away from the exploding bombs than the apes and goats, and he recorded that he suffered no discomfort. His final report stat- ed that there was no visible effect on the animals. (In this connection, I should mention that the civil defense authorities in Germany advised us not to sit upright with our heads against the wall in the air-raid shelter during an attack. The pressure wave would cause our heads to bash against the wall, and the upright position would expose our lungs. We were advised to lie flat on the floor when and if bombs came down in the vicinity.) In further studies, Zuckerman found that the German 50-kg bomb was more effective in killing people than heavier bombs of 250 or 1,000 kg. Lord Zuckerman suggested to Lord Cherwell that in order to arrive at recommendations for the deployment of Bomber Command, a study should be used which he had made for the Ministry of Home Security of the bombing of Hull and Birmingham in 1940 and 1941 by the Luftwaffe. Costs and results of the operation of Bomber Command were questioned in Parliament and in military cir- cles at the time. A clear policy had to be developed. The findings of the Hull/Birmingham Study as published in Lord Zuckerman's book in Appendix 2 indicate: MODEL  64 TO DESTROY A CITY THE ROAD TO AREA BOMBING One ton of bombs kills four people. Thirty-five people are bombed out for every person killed. Dwelling houses are destroyed by high explosives and not by fire. Factories are more seriously damaged by fire than by explo- sives. There was no breakdown of morale in either city. These were only the most
