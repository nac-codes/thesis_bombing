Air Ministry and Luftwaffe files were either purposely destroyed by the Germans or lost when the Potsdam Heeresarchiv (Army Archives) were lost in one of the last Bomber Command air raids at the end of World War II. Field Marshal Hindenburg, General Ludendorff, and General HÃ¶ppner were the German bomber practitioners in World War I. There was no deeply considered theory behind their decisions to bomb enemy cities. The idea was to retaliate against the Hunger Blockade and thus to bring the war into enemy territory. These raids were to be against military targets only, so these military men protested. In actual fact, they admitted that civilians would also suffer. Paul von Hindenburg was born at what is today Poznan, Poland, in 1847. He was a product of the Prussian Junker Class. became an army officer, fought in the Prussian-Austrian War and the Franco-Prussian War, and retired in 1911. The Kaiser called him back for active duty to stem the Russian tide which had entered East Prussia in the early months of World War I He routed the Russians at Tannenberg and soon thereafter was appointed chief of staff. After the war a memorial was erected at Tannenberg, and when Hindenburg died in 1934 he was buried there. As per the Versailles Treaty he was to be indicted by an international court for war crimes. That part of the treaty. like a few other provisions, fell by the wayside. A German court at Leipzig was to treat the case, but never did. By 1925 Hindenburg was elected president of the Weimar Republic and in January 1933 he made Hitler chancellor. If Hindenburg had been accused of war crimes they would have included his bombing orders. This could have had a salutary impact on the large-scale bombing in World War II. Eric Ludendorff was the brain behind the Army General Staff and, more so than Hindenburg, must be held responsible for the bombings in World War I. He lived from 1865 to 1937. His biggest feat was that he realized when it was time to quit. In October 1918 he
