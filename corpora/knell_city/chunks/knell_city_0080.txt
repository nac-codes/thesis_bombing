and, more so than Hindenburg, must be held responsible for the bombings in World War I. He lived from 1865 to 1937. His biggest feat was that he realized when it was time to quit. In October 1918 he requested the German government ask for an armistice in accordance with President Wilson's Fourteen Points. Although the Central Powers's structure was coming apart with increasing speed at that time, his request was con- sidered treason and he had to flee to neutral Sweden.

Höppner sent off his machines with orders to aim at military and/or strategic installations, although he admitted that this did not always happen and that civilians were killed.º But he showed no qualms because the French had continued to raid German cities, such a
