ohn Salmond's operations in Iraq a brilliant example of RAF activities.11 Salmond's influence was felt in the decision-making councils of the Air Ministry until well into World War II. Yet Salmond never came under severe criticism in Parliament or in public as compared with other British bomber practitioners. RAF pacifying practices were also conducted in the Aden Protectorate, where in 1934 Lord Portal of Hungerford, as he called himself later, became the officer commanding the British forces. Charles Portal was born in 1893. When World War I broke out, he volunteered and before long joined the Royal Flying Corps. He came to the attention of Trenchard and it was he who after the war, when many a military man was out of the service, saw the value of Portal and had him go through the RAF Staff College, the Naval College at Greenwich, and even- tually the Imperial Defence College. By 1929 Portal not only had combat experience but had also received an academic training which qualified him for the highest military positions. In 1940 he was in charge of Bomber Command. It was in this position that he experienced the technical shortcomings of aerial bombing and was later instrumental in finding the solu- tions. Portal has been quoted as saying that by bombing a large area, some strategic target will be destroyed and no bombs would be wasted.12 It seemed again a matter of economics to bomb civilians.

He had tremendous responsibilities when one considers what Fighter Command, Coastal Command, and the squadrons sta- tioned outside the United Kingdom did to fight the Axis pow- ers. He not only had to hold up the purely military end of the RAF but also
