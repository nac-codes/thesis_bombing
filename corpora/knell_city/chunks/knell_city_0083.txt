what Fighter Command, Coastal Command, and the squadrons sta- tioned outside the United Kingdom did to fight the Axis pow- ers. He not only had to hold up the purely military end of the RAF but also be involved in the politics and economics of the war. He was made a viscount after the war and upon retire- ment could look back on a successful military career. That area bombing became the major effort of the RAF was not his doing alone.

If it had not been for the help of the church custodian, I would never have found it.14 Seen in the proper perspective, Portal deserved better. The marshal of the Royal Air Force had died at his home in West Ashling on 23 April 1971.
