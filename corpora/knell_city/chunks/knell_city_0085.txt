soon. Four reports were produced and by 1936, based on an "Appreciation of the Situation in the Event of War against Germany in 1939," the government approved the creation of a strategic bomber force. The interesting part of the report is that it foresaw that bombing alone could not win a war against Germany. The army had to eventually conquer the enemy's lands. Considering that Harris put his name to this report and, taking into account his later unshakable conviction that the bomber alone could force Germany to its knees, it is interesting to note how Harris changed from area bomber after his exploits in the mandates and colonies to strategic bomber in mid-career and then back to full-force area bomber again after 1941. Of course, in 1936 until May 1940 the British government and the public considered killing civilians with bombs as unac- 77 ceptable. Killing civilia ilians by the proven method of starvation through naval blockade was acceptable because it had been done a few times before. Nobody wanted to be as bad as the Huns had been in World War I when they bombed Britain. The report clearly states that area bombing was to be adopted only after the Germans had started it. It was to be a matter of retal- iation, which in accordance with the Hague Conventions was perfectly legal. There remains of course the nagging doubt about what the disciples of Trenchard really thought consider- ing their master's doctrine, i.e. area bombing. 'In 1938 Harris took command of No. 4 Bomber Group. Before long he was sent to the United States to oversee the pur- chase of military aircraft for the RAF. Later in 1938 he took up the post of air officer commanding in Palestine and Transjordan. In his book Bomber Offensive, Harris describes how the air force cooperated with the army by circling the rebellious areas to prevent anybody from escaping until the army or police could arrive and solve the problem.16 There was no bombing of villages as in other Empire trouble spots.
