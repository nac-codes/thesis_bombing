ort of a body count, he could have attacked small, undefended cities only. The risk would have been smaller and the results even more spectacu- lar. That in the end defenseless cities such as WÃ¼rzburg were raided and efficiently destroyed is, of course, proof that the military machine works like a bulldozer. There was no stop- ping Harris from taking his campaign and his theories to the very end. It is his ordering the bombing beyond reason and the call of duty that made his name anathema to many people after the war. He showed no concern for the suffering the attack on morale was causing. Yet, when it came to his own life, he is quoted as being delighted that he did not have to leave his family in an area of Britain, which at the time was still being bombed by the Luftwaffe, when in June 1941 he was sent on a second mission to the United States.19 It must have crossed his mind that a bomb could make his loved ones suffer.

He was convinced his method would work better and, above all, he finally had all the men, machinery, bombs, and materials at his disposal to prove it. Last but not least, his past exploits, like the first "Thousand 79 Bomber Raid," o
