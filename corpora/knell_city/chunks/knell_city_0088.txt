work better and, above all, he finally had all the men, machinery, bombs, and materials at his disposal to prove it. Last but not least, his past exploits, like the first "Thousand 79 Bomber Raid," on Cologne shortly after he had taken over Bomber Command, had been approved by all. He was even made a Knight Commander of the Order of Bath for that feat on 10 June 1942. Further proof for Harris that he was right must have been that Churchill was in favor of the area-bombing campaign. It was the prime minister and not the Air Staff or Bomber Command who early in the war wanted the attack on German morale.23 It must also have occurred to him that his predeces- sor in Bomber Command, Air Marshal Sir Richard Peirse, was less than eighteen months at that post before he was shifted to a far less important command in India and Southeast Asia. Had this man failed to fulfill, the expectations placed in him and Bomber Command? In the end Harris, like Portal, was convinced that the bomber offensive against Germany had been a huge success. Without its stubborn prosecution, in his opinion, the Allies would not have won the war. He took this conviction with him to his grave when he died at his home in Goring-on-Thames at age ninety-one in 1984. He is buried in an unassuming grave on the hill east of Goring. As with Portal one would expect a more honorable place for a man who commanded the biggest and longest campaign of World War II. Whether he was right or wrong cannot be the question. He followed instructions, gave orders and over fifty thousand RAF airmen lost their lives. Their exploits and memories alone require respect, which with a measure of judgment must be extended to their com- mander. Yet after Harris resigned his command on 28 August 1945, after there was no more fighting, not even in the Far East, he came under neverending criticism, which to this date has not ended. He was not honored as were other great commanders by the Labor government. His biographer, Saward, bl
