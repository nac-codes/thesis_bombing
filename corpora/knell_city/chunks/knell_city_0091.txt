He was born on 29 June 1891 at Boyertown, Pennsylvania, went to West Point, and in 1914 joined the U.S. Army Signal Corps.

But most of the conventional bombing and damage in Japan had already been done. He and most other U.S. army and air force generals were opposed to the dropping of the atomic bombs. After the war and after the U.S. Air Force had become an independent service, equal in rank- ing
