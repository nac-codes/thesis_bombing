, but he kept his own councils. Only after Spaatz over- ruled his objections were nine hundred U.S. bombers sent to Berlin as part of Operation Thunderclap on 3 February 1945. The toll: 25,000 dead Berliners.39 Of all the prominent bomber commanders of World War II Doolittle served the longest time. He retired on 28 February 1959 and died on 27 September 1993. All USAAF bomber practitioners were very anxious to be seen by the general public as chivalrous soldiers doing only what soldiers would do. They saw to it that historians, even the ones chosen by them for their favorable view toward the bombers, were given only restricted access to documents. The result was that accounts on World War II USAAF aerial opera- tions are long on heroic and technical details, but short on the sadder aspects.40 In contrast, one finds that the exploits of the RAF written by British historians are very comprehensive and openly relate the good and the bad aspects of bombing. When one turns to the German bomber practitioners of World War II one finds that there were no Luftwaffe leaders as outspoken and determined as Portal, Harris, and LeMay. When German bombers dropped their deadly loads on the cities of the British Isles, the commanders behind these raids were the field marshals in charge of the air fleets based in Western Europe. Under GÃ¶ring, the supreme commander of the Luftwaffe, there were Hugo Sperrle, commanding Luft- flotte 3, and Albert Kesselring, commanding Luftflotte 2. The German air fleets had units attached to them as the military requirements dictated; i.e. they had fighter squadrons, dive- bombers, horizontal bombers, and reconnaissance units.

When it was called upon by Hitler after his famous "eraser" speech in September 1940 to terrorize Britain, it proved "barely adequate for the purpose," according to Air Marshal Harris.41 Sperrle was
