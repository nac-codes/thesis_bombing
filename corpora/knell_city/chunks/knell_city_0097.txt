When it was called upon by Hitler after his famous "eraser" speech in September 1940 to terrorize Britain, it proved "barely adequate for the purpose," according to Air Marshal Harris.41 Sperrle was born at Ludwigsburg on 7 February 1885. He became a commissioned infantry officer in 1904, but changed to the Fliegertruppe in World War I. Discharged after the war he was called back in 1935 and made a general of the Luftwaffe. He commanded the Condor Legion in 1936 and 1937 and in 1939 was put in charge of Luftflotte 3. After the fall of France in 1940, he was promoted to field marshal and con- tinued to command Luftflotte 3, which participated in the bat- tle of Britain, the Blitz, and the Baedeker Raids. But he failed to stem the tide of the Allied bomber fleets raiding the Continent For this failure Hitler dismissed him from active service in late 1944. In 1948 he was tried for war crimes and declared inno- cent. He died at Landsberg on 2 April 1953.42 The other German bomber commander was Albert Kesselring. He was born at Marktsteft, a dozen miles south of WÃ¼rzburg, on 31 November 1885. His roots were solidly plant- ed in southern Germany.43 In 1904 he became a commissioned officer in an artillery regiment at Metz, which was then German territory. After the war he stayed with the army until 1933 when he was transferred to the Luftwaffe. He became chief of staff and helped build up that service. When World War II broke out he took over command of Luftflotte 1, which participated in the Polish campaign, and as such he was involved in the bombing of Warsaw. In 1940 he was put in command of Luftflotte 2, which, together with Sperrle's Luft- flotte 3 and the smaller Luftflotte 5 based in Norway, attacked Britain. Between them the German air fleets had 875 service- able bombers.44 Kesselring is quoted as believing that Britain could have been defeated with air power alone.45 After the fall of France, Kesselring was promoted to field marshal and in 1942 took over command
