bers.44 Kesselring is quoted as believing that Britain could have been defeated with air power alone.45 After the fall of France, Kesselring was promoted to field marshal and in 1942 took over command of all Axis forces in the Mediter- ranean. Erwin Rommel, the Desert Fox, fought in North Africa under his command. They had many differences of opinion.
