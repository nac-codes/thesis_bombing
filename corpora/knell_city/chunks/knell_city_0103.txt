niors on the block Since they were not physically strong, they tried to impress the others with shows of bravura and hard work. The German atti- tude can best be illuminated by a pronouncement of its foreign minister, Bernhard von Bülow, in the Reichstag on 6 December 1897, when he said: "We also demand a place in the sun."3 One of the causes for the rise of the French feeling of revanche, which in turn contributed to the outbreak of World War I, was the peace treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871. It required France to cede Alsace-Lorraine, to pay 5 billion gold- 93 francs as reparations, and have German troops stationed in the Eastern Departments until this sum was paid. Together with the tactless ceremony in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles and the display of conquered French troop colors in a Berlin mili- tary parade in June 1871, French honor and sensibility had been badly trampled.4 Alsace-Lorraine became the cause celèbre for the French. It was the essence of the revanche move- ment against Germany. In Germany, Bismarck made the mistake of not grooming and promoting a successor who could take over his aims and policies. It left Wilhelm II at liberty to make a dramatic change in course when he forced Bismarck to resign the chancellorship on 17 March 1890. Bismarck tried to rein in the demands of emerging indus- trialists for colonies, which would give them sources of raw materials as well as markets for their products. The trade had gone overseas, was very successful, and the flag had to follow. Germany took possessions in East Africa, today's Tanzania, Southwest Africa, today's Namibia, and in West Africa, Cameroon, and Togo. In the South Pacific, Germany acquired the Marshall Islands, the Marianas, and the Carolines from Spain after it had lost the Spanish-American War and needed money. Germany also took Samoa and the Bismarck Archi- pelago. In 1898 it forced China to let it have Tsingtao on a lease for ninety-nine years and the adjoining province of Shantung
