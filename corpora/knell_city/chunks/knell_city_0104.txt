In 1898 it forced China to let it have Tsingtao on a lease for ninety-nine years and the adjoining province of Shantung as a protectorate. By 1900, the Kaiser could proudly survey his empire. With all of these possessions under the black, white, and red flag, Germany had caught up with its European neigh- bors. The colonies were also to absorb the population surplus. The German population had increased from 50 million in 1890 to 67 million in 1910, an increase of 34 percent; the reason being improved health and living standards.5 The British, French, Dutch, Spaniards, and others had established areas in Africa, Asia, South America, and the whole continent of Australia to accept emigrants, thus reducing the population pressures in their home countries. Germany and Italy now followed suit. However, that policy proved a failure. Of the 2.85 million emi- grants who left Germany from 1871 to 1914, only a mere 13,286  94 To DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR I settled in Africa, whereas 2.72 million went to the Americas most of them to the United States.6 Similarly, most Italians emi- grated to North and South America. If trade and commerce were to benefit from the colonies the statistics show that German imports from them never amounted to more than 0.54 percent per annum of the total imports. Nor did exports to the colonies amount to more that 0.73 percent per annum of the total exports.' Raw materials also came from other sources. In 1910, when the colonies were thought to pay off the investments and the efforts that had gone into them, only 0.25 percent of the imported cotton and 13.62 percent of the rubber came from the colonies.8 It was, of course, not only Germany that exercised colonial politics and acquisitions between 1871 and 1914. There was the Boer War between 1899 and 1902, which resulted in British annexation of the Boer territories in South Africa. That war is famous for the i
