olitics and acquisitions between 1871 and 1914. There was the Boer War between 1899 and 1902, which resulted in British annexation of the Boer territories in South Africa. That war is famous for the internment of Boer families in British concen- tration camps. About 25,000 Boer women and children died in those camps.9 As in German Southwest Africa, where a Ger- man expeditionary force quelled the Herero uprising between 1903 and 1907, it was war against women and children, a fore- runner of area bombing. Austria-Hungary occupied Bosnia-Herzogovina and formally annexed it in 1908. It was an act that offended the neighboring Serbs and their Russian supporters, and became another of the many causes of World War I. In 1899 a German consortium, supported by the govern- ment, succeeded in obtaining from the Turks a concession to build a rail line to Baghdad. The line would eventually end in Basra at the Persian Gulf. The Kaiser talked about "my rail- road" and a year before, on a visit to Constantinople, he pro- claimed himself the protector of the 300 million Moslems of the world.10 The Baghdad railway annoyed the British because it would give Germany a land/sea route to India and it annoyed the Russians because they had designs on Persia. The Italians fought the Ottoman Empire in Libya in 1911- 12 and established themselves there. This upset the British, who owned the Suez Canal and were heavily engaged in Egypt and the Sudan to protect their sea route to India. Italy 95 also occupied the Dodecanese Islands off the coast of Turkey during the Turkish/Italian War of 1911-1912, but had to retreat afterward. In 1895 the Italians tried to conquer Ethiopia, but were repulsed. There were overlapping interests for land grabs in West Africa, which were resolved by the Berlin Conference of 1894-95 under the guidance of Bismarck, who had called the interested powers, including the United States, to his capital. In the Far East, the Russians and the Japanese fought in Manchuria in
