from the affront to neighboring states, when one looks at the cost of this army one must question the sanity of its leaders. Germany had about 67 million people at that time. This meant that 1.4 percent of its population were playing soldier. Not only were these men in their prime not producing anything, they cost money to do nothing useful. Not only were the army and navy built up, their deploy- ment was just as offensive. Along the western German border railway sidings were constructed to facilitate rapid transfer of troops to these areas.
