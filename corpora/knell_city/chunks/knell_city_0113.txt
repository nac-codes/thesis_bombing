ar against women and children, starving them. The Germans retaliated with their U-boats. Again, not outlawed by the Hague Convention of 1907, but a dastardly way of warfare by the standards of the British navy. The Germans not only had invaded Belgium but committed atrocities against its popula- tion. At least so the British propaganda told the world. No doubt true to some extent, with the shooting and burning at Louvain as an example, but certainly not so bad that childrens' hands were hacked off, as the British press claimed.18 The Germans were powerless against this type of propaganda because their overseas cables coming out of the north German port of Emden had been dredged up by the Royal Navy and cut right after Britain had declared war on Germany. The news, particularly in North America, came from Fleet Street. But even then, it is my personal opinion, the Germans were never smart enough to use what can be called the fourth fighting service-propaganda. Attempts were made to outlaw propaganda at The Hague in 1907 but that effort failed and today nobody even thinks of it as immoral in warfare. The conventions had tried to outlaw discharging explosives from aerial craft. The effort had been stalled and was to be brought up again at the Third Hague Convention in 1914. The war interfered with that meeting, and since there was no code to prevent aerial bombing, and in particular bombing civilians, the road to that new means of warfare was open. But bombing civilians outside the battle zone did not happen until 1915. The arms race prior to World War I had been on for some time and aircraft had been added to the arsenals. Graf von Zeppelin was building airships, and the Wright brothers' invention was produced widely. By 1910 the major powers had the following aircraft in their armies and navies:19 Belgium Airships 2 Airplanes 2 Britain 2 4 France 3 36 Germany 9 5 Italy 3 2 Japan 1 2 Russia 3 3 United States 2 2 These numbers appear minuscule, but they impacted mili-
