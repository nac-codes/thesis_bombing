their armies and navies:19 Belgium Airships 2 Airplanes 2 Britain 2 4 France 3 36 Germany 9 5 Italy 3 2 Japan 1 2 Russia 3 3 United States 2 2 These numbers appear minuscule, but they impacted mili- tary planning. The Germans felt confident that they could avert the French threat of thirty-six planes with their "superi- or" Zeppelins.  102 To DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR I Substantial sums were invested by the major powers Between 1910 and 1914, budgets for aircraft production for the respective armed forces increased as follows:20 1914 1910 1,000,000 1,900,000 in pounds sterling Britain 160,000 3,200,000 France 312,000 Germany 300,000 These sums were small compared with what the German army and navy programs consumed or the cost of the dread. nought fleet in Britain. The Russians were not far behind and they can be credited with the achievement of having the first operational four-engine bomber. By 1914 there were ten Ilia Muromets, built by Sikorsky, the renowned U.S. aircraft de signer of later years. In August 1914, when the war started, the major combat- ants mustered for the time substantial numbers of aircraft as follows:21 Airships 2 Airplanes 16 Belgium 263 Britain 0 France 10 165 Germany 8 232 Austria-Hungary 1 48 Russia 4 263 Not all historians agree on the absolute numbers. Alexander Boyd says that the Russians had 250 airplanes, or 5 percent less. Von HÃ¶ppner lists 350 percent more for France, but that number makes the German general appear more hero- ic for struggling against great odds.22 The airplanes were of the wire and canvas type and most- ly used for reconnaissance. But it was not long before hand- thrown explosives were dropped from those contraptions. Within short order all governments and their military staffs recognized the advantage of aerial combat, and as a result there followed a tremendous upswing in the development and 103 production of planes. The Germans continued building Zep- pelins, but after substantial losses recognized
