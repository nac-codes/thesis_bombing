and fabricating improved versions of aircraft that could carry explosives and fire in the form of incendiary bombs into enemy territory. The following long-range bombers were operational and actively deployed:23 On the German side: The twin-engine Gotha, of which about 550 were built between 1916 and 1918. They could carry one half ton of bombs and had a crew of three.  104 To DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR I The four- and six-engine Riesenflugzeug, of which thirty- two were built between 1916 and 1918. They could carry two tons of bombs and had a crew of seven. On the British side: The twin-engine Handley Page 0/400, of which 507 were built between 1916 and 1918. They could carry one ton of bombs and had a crew of four. The twin-engine Vickers Vimy came too late to see action before the armistice. Similarly the four-engine Handley Page V/1500 did not see service in combat. It was to be ready by 1919. It could carry 3.5 tons of bombs. On the Italian side: The three engine Caproni Ca5, of which only a few were built between 1917 and 1918. They could carry about one ton and had a crew of three. On the Russian side: By 1914 the Russians already had the four-engine Ilya Muromets, of which eighty were built. They could carry a half ton of bombs. On the French side: Early in the war the French army had several squadrons of Voisin bombers. They were of the wire and canvas type, had one engine and a crew of three. Maximum bomb load was sixty kg at a radius of 150 miles. From the above listing it appears that the total number of heavy bombers was still relatively small compared with the number of other combat planes produced in World War I. The records, both in archives and literature, differ slightly, but show great numbers of military aircraft being used by both sides. In round figures from the available sources the following numbers appear:24 105 Number of military aircraft produced by the major com- batants in World War I: Austria-Hungary 5,000 Britain 55,000 Franc
