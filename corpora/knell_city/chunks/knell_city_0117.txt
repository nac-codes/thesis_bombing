n round figures from the available sources the following numbers appear:24 105 Number of military aircraft produced by the major com- batants in World War I: Austria-Hungary 5,000 Britain 55,000 France 60,000 Germany 48,000 Italy 12,000 Russia 5,000 United States 15,000 In summary: For the Entente: 147,000 For the Central Powers: 53,000 The most remarkable aspect of these production figures is that the United States did not start to produce military aircraft until 1917. That aerial bombing was still a minor effort in World War I is indicated by the fact that of 48,000 German machines, only about 2,000 were bombers, and of these most were single- engine tactical types. Aerial bombing started on a very small scale in 1914. The German army used its Zeppelins to bomb military installations at Liege, Antwerp, Ostende, Calais, and the Eastern Front. Of particular interest for the Germans were the disembarkation points of the British Expeditionary Force along the channel coast. The Germans always protested that they were only attacking military targets and went so far as to have their pilots carry written orders with them as proof in case they were cap- tured. It was not long into the war, however, before they admit- ted that civilians could be killed. In the beginning, all of the German bombing on military and not so military targets was by Zeppelins until, as a Christmas present to the British, a German airplane dropped a few bombs on Dover on 24 December 1914. The physical damage was negligible, but the moral one immense. War had been brought to the British Isles from the Continent. When the German Zeppelins started bombing from August 1914 onward, the British were not far behind. Before the war  106 TO DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR I the Royal Navy had recognized the airplane as an extension of naval guns. The Royal Naval Air Service attacked a Zeppelin shed at DÃ¼sseldorf on 8 October 1914. Unfortunately one of the planes flown by Squadron Commander Spencer Grey
