airplane as an extension of naval guns. The Royal Naval Air Service attacked a Zeppelin shed at DÃ¼sseldorf on 8 October 1914. Unfortunately one of the planes flown by Squadron Commander Spencer Grey missed the target and attacked the Cologne railway station instead Three civilians were killed.25 On 21 November 1914, the RNAS was in action again and sent three planes from their base at Belfort in eastern France to Friedrichshafen to attack the Zeppelin Works. One Zeppelin under construction was damaged. As a result the Zeppelin Works reduced their experimental flights over Lake Constance. 26 On Christmas Day 1914, the RNAS raided the Zeppelin base near Cuxhaven. The interesting aspect of that raid is that the Royal Navy used an aircraft tender, i.e. a freighter converted to carry floatplanes on its deck. They were lowered into the North Sea and recovered after the raid. A German Zeppelin scout saw the operation and returned to its base to have the German navy intercept the tender. But the Royal Navy escaped in time. Had the Zeppelin had wireless communication the German navy could have come out earlier The French Voisin bombers were used at first for tactical purposes. But on 4 December they attacked Freiburg, a city eighty kilometers behind the front line.27 There is no record of any casualties and no record anywhere else in literature or archives of the raid. One wonders whether it really happened, because it would have been the first ever air raid on civilians. By the end of 1914, tactical bombing was being used as a new type of warfare, but on a moderate scale. The war was still, within limits, a civilized undertaking. So much so that the enthusiasm was still there and there was even fraternization of the troops in no-mans land on the Western Front at Christmas 1914.28 There were infractions on treaties such as the use of mili- tary power against the enemy in the colonies. The Japanese had taken Tsingtao and the British had landed troops in German East Africa an
