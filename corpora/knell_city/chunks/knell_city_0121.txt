y putting thirty-nine British officers in arrest bar- racks. By June 1915 Mr. Churchill's successor had to rescind the order.31 The fighting and conduct of war was becoming tougher. During the entire war the German position to justify strate- gic bombing was that it was tactical and only exercised in the war zone. To justify raids on Britain, the attacked cities were declared in the war zone because from them originated sup- plies for the British Expeditionary Force in Western Europe. The same rationale was applied to France with the additional proviso that some cities such as Paris were also fortresses. That they were many miles away from the actual fighting did not interfere with that reasoning. Besides, German bomber pilots had strict orders to bomb military targets only(!). The British position was less ambivalent. The admiralty issued a communique on 16 February 1915 that the RNAS bombers had instructions to raid only military targets and avoid dropping bombs on residential sections of towns. 32 The French and Italian positions were the same as the British and all of them protested that their crews never attacked civilians or non-military targets. They would rather bring their bombs back if they could not identify their targets. In the end, all belligerents protested that their aircraft only exe- cuted justified reprisals; in other words, the enemy was to blame. Reprisal raids were flown not only for air raids com- mitted by the enemy before, but also for other infractions. As an example, after the "Baralong Affair" in 1916, in which a German submarine crew was executed by the Royal Navy after capture, the Germans threatened to unleash an unrestricted bombing of British civilians as retaliation.33 After German navy airships had raided the Norfolk coast, there were cheers in Germany, but the German chancellor berated Admiral Pohl, the navy commander, for dropping bombs on undefended places and causing bad press in the United States.
