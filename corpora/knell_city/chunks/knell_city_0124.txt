vate homes but also schools, churches, and hospitals. They had hoped to break the morale of British citizens and thereby force the British government to sue for peace. Nothing of the sort happened. As the bombardment minuscule as it was by later standards, continued, the riots stopped and public opinion rallied behind the crown and gov- ernment. But the cries for retaliations reached chorus propor- tions on all sides. In 1917 Churchill, by that time minister of munitions, issued a statement which declared it unlikely that a people would compel a government to surrender under the pressure of air attack. Good shelters and a strong control by police and military authorities would prevent that.40 This seems to be the first pronouncement by Churchill on that sub- ject. As we shall see later, he underwent several metamor- phoses during his political career, very much to the detriment of civilian populations. The German navy Zeppelins operated only against Britain. The army Zeppelins were active on all fronts. They bombed French and Belgian "fortresses." Paris was attacked by two Zeppelins on the night of 20-21 March 1915. The crews had received strict instructions to bomb only railway installations, docks, barracks, and factories. Afterward it was admitted that the raid not only hit military targets but also civilians. But, so the argument went, the French had started it all with the attack on Freiburg in December 1914 and only had themselves to blame.41 On the Eastern Front, the Zeppelins attacked towns along the front line but not in the hinterland. The Russian reaction was rather strict. They considered all aerial bombing a crime, even when executed against purely military targets. They threatened to either hang or bring to justice any captured Zeppelin crews.42 This actually never happened. It would also have looked irrational in light of the existence of the Muromets bomber. French Voisin bombers attacked the Badische Anilin and Sodafabrik at Ludwigshafen in January
