a strategic raid. In 1917 a navy tender with float- planes was sent close to Constantinople to attack the dam on Lake Terko.46 The planes tried to disrupt the water supply to the city, but hitting dams is not an easy task, as the RAF learned in World War II. The Lake Terko raid was the only Russian foray into strategic bombing. They had the Ilya Muromets, the first four-engine bomber ever built, but they did not use it. The main strategic air battlefield was Western Europe. The planning and clamor for bombing increased in pitch and by 1916 Britain and Germany were sparring off. Both sides had their factories design and turn out planes specifically for strategic bombing. The design parameters for that type of plane called for the highest possible bomb load, the longest range, and good defenses against enemy fighters. This meant multi-engine planes because single-engine planes, which had done the bombing to date, could not be built to these specifications. The German bomber bases were all in northern Belgium close to the British Isles. The British bases for defense against the German raiders were all in East Anglia and the bomber bases in the beginning were along the entire front in France but later concentrated near Nancy and particularly the Ochey Aerodrome. Germany added another reason for justification of the stepped-up bombing by 1916. It was considered that defense of Britain would draw on the forces that could other- wise be deployed on the Continent. Since the German bombers were on the offensive, the defense had to be pre- pared to meet them anywhere they chose. There was military logic in that because by the time the war ended there were about 30,000 British soldiers manning these defenses. That number represents about two infantry divisions. Against these considerable forces the Germans never mustered more than fifty bombers. Bomber fleets raiding Britain were small, with the biggest raid carried out by twenty-eight Gothas on the night of 19-20 May 1918. B
