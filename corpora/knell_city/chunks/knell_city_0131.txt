German Supreme Command made noises about more retaliation attacks. But resources were already stretched to their limits and Germany was retreating in the west. Later, Ludendorff, while aiming for an armistice, felt that upping the ante in this game would not help his chances. The civilians stood up well to the raids. just as British and French civilians had. There was never a moment of riots or civil unrest.
