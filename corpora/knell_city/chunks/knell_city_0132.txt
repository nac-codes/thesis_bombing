The IAF was ready to blast Berlin with Handley Page bombers in early 1919. The Germans had started bombing civilians for their own perceived reasons, but they were hit back and had learned that the morale of a nation cannot be broken by attacking its people with bombs.

The enthusiasm for war was gone. If it had not been for the United States entering on the Allied side, the war would have come to a stalemate, as the Entente powers of Europe were similarly exhausted. The cost had been unimaginable in 1914 when it all be
