r the United States entering on the Allied side, the war would have come to a stalemate, as the Entente powers of Europe were similarly exhausted. The cost had been unimaginable in 1914 when it all began. The military loss statistics stagger ones mind. The battle of Verdun cost 362,000 French and 336,000 German soldiers their lives.
