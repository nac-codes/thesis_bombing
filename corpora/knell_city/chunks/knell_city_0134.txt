had become powerless. The German delegation under Matthias Erzberger had to sign the armistice agreement in the forest of Compi√®gne. Germany immediately had to withdraw its troops from all occupied territories in the East and West and had to surrender Alsace-Lorraine to France. It had to surrender 5,000 field guns, 25,000 machine guns, 3,000 trench mortars, 1,700 airplanes, which included all its bombers, all its Zeppelins, all its U-boats, and 6 battle cruisers, 10 battleships, 8 light cruisers, and 50 destroyers. The term of the armistice was to be thirty-six days, during which the above conditions had to be met. In other words, at the end of the term Germany was to be in no condi- tion to fight again. The Germans found these conditions a violation of their national honor. However there was more in the agreement. All German troops had to be withdrawn from the left bank of the Rhine, where Allied troops would move in and occupy those territories. The upkeep of these forces was to be paid for by the German government. The question of reparations was left open for a later peace treaty but Germany had to surrender immedi- ately 5,000 locomotives, 150,000 railway wagons, and 5,000 121 trucks. The return of German prisoners of war was to be left for agreement in the forthcoming peace treaty. Allied POWs had to be returned immediately. The hunger blockade was to continue. That latter clause, Article XXVI, added insult to injury. The war against women and children was to continue. They were being held hostages to ensure that their men behaved. The continua- tion of the hunger blockade was in clear contradiction of Wilson's Fourteen Points, Article 2, which promised freedom of navigation upon the seas in peace and in war. The 36-day term was extended three times by conventions, the last signed on 16 February 1919 for an unspecified period. On 11 November 1918 the fighting was officially over and the question arose whether the victors had achieved what they had desired. Fr
