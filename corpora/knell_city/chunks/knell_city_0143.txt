Perhaps a Duke of Wellington at the Peace Conference of 1919 would have been as judicious as in 1815. Germany defaulted, and as a result French troops occupied the Ruhr industrial area on 11 January 1923. They took control of practically everything, from factory operations to public administration. Germans had to provide food and billeting, commodities that were very scarce already. Even bordellos for the occupying troops had to be established.6 A number of Germans were shot because they did not obey the 7:00 P.M. cur- few. On 31 March, during an anti-occupation demonstration at the Krupp Works at Essen, another fifteen Germans were  128 To DESTROY A CITY BETWEEN THE WORLD WARS killed. Anti-French feelings reached a postwar high throughout Germany. The rising politician Adolf Hitler made the occupa- tion the theme of every one of his speeches.
