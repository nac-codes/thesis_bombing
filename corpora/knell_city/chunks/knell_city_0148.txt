articles was ready. Article 17 stated that the 1907 Hague Convention on Maritime War would also apply to aerial warfare. That meant no bom- bardment of cities was allowed. Article 22 forbade aerial bom- bardment for the purpose of terrorizing civilian populations. Unfortunately, the jurists' work never advanced beyond a draft, not even proceeding to protocol, the step ahead of a binding treaty. The French government in particular rejected the draft, on the grounds that the existing conventions already covered the conduct of aerial war. In the end, everybody from Hitler to Chamberlain and Roosevelt paid lip service to these rules at the beginning of World War II, and conveniently forgot about them shortly thereafter. In 1924 the League of Nations condemned aggression as a  132 To DESTROY A CITY BETWEEN THE WORLD WARS means of politics. Theoretically that derailed the Clausewitz definition of war. If the politicians had come to the end of their ropes they would still have to talk to each other under the aegis of the League. The 1928 Briand-Kellogg Pact even went further by declaring war illegal as an instrument of national policy. In 1925 after France had invaded the Ruhr in 1923, Germany, under its chancellor Stresemann, felt threatened and a treaty was signed at Locarno, Switzerland. It guaranteed the borders of Germany created by the Versailles Treaty and was signed by all of Germany's neighbors, old and new. In 1920, Austria, Bulgaria, and Hungary were graciously admitted to the League, followed by Germany in 1926. Turkey, the trouble- maker of SÃ¨vres and Lausanne Treaty fame, was admitted in 1932, and in 1934 the ultimate pariah, the USSR, got in. Now the League of Nations was almost complete. Almost, because the United States, the father of it, and Switzerland, the host of it, had not joined. They never did. General disarmament, one of the main purposes of the League, was slow in proceeding. Not until 1926 was a prepara- tory commission established to flesh out
