host of it, had not joined. They never did. General disarmament, one of the main purposes of the League, was slow in proceeding. Not until 1926 was a prepara- tory commission established to flesh out the meaning and details. It foundered on technical details and definitions of what reserves and war materials meant. There was also the French insistence that Germany's armed forces would always have to be inferior to the French forces. Finally, in February 1932, a dis- armament conference began at Geneva. All League members were represented as well as non-members, the United States and the Soviet Union. Germany had pushed time and again for this conference. It and its WWI allies had implemented their contractual obligations, but the other treaty partners had not only failed to disarm but increased their arms. Germany felt threatened. The forces surrounding Germany were colossal in both quantity and quality. In 1928 the German army had 100,000 men. Around it were 755,000 French, 595,000 Italian, 614,000 British, 212,000 Czech, 263,000 Polish, and 600,000 USSR soldiers. Germany had no tanks; France had 2,500. Germany had no military aircraft; Britain had 1,300 and France 1,800. On its eastern frontiers Germany faced about 1,700 USSR, Polish, and Czech aircraft.13 Some of the Russian bombers had a range of 1,400 kilometers and could carry two tons of bombs. 133 Why the world was in arms at that time is difficult to understand. Seemingly there was this ingrained fright of the German army marching again, but the Allied Control Commission could and did verify that there were no more than 100,000 soldiers in Germany. There was the danger of Soviet Communism, but that was more a psychological threat than a military one. There was a noticeable shift of Japan and Italy moving away from the Entente to threaten, respectively, Chinese and U.S. interests in the Far East, and British and French interests in the Mediterranean. The conference began at Geneva on 2 February 1932. On 9 Fe
