n. Everybody became afraid and started to rearm in earnest. Not all victorious nations had demobilized after the Great War. There were enough conflicts after "the war to end all wars" to keep the military and their suppliers employed. In 1918 the Russian civil war was still raging. The Entente tried to interfere and sent 40,000 troops and combat planes into Murmansk and Archangel.17 A British aircraft carrier with its planes kept the Red Fleet at anchor in Kronstadt outside 135 Petrograd (as it was then called). The Japanese moved into Vladivostok. The RAF sent two squadrons to assist the White Russian General Wrangell to conquer Tsaritsyn (later called Stalingrad).18 The Bolsheviks employed the leftovers of the World War I Imperial Air Force to fight the White Russian forces and their Entente supporters. The four-engined Ilya Muromets with its three thousand pound payload was the main bomber.19 The newly formed Polish state fought the Soviets in 1920, but there was little air combat in that conflict. Similarly, there were few if any air actions when the Greeks at British behest invaded Anatolia in Turkey in 1919 and were expelled in 1921. The Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay from 1932 to 1935 cost 100,000 lives and 140,000 wounded, but no air action was reported.20 However, the concept of bombing civilians had not been forgotten. The imperial/colonial powers discovered that it had a salutary effect on rebellious natives, their rifle toting war- riors, and their families. The minor perpetrators of these peace missions were the French and Spaniards in their Moroccan dependencies from 1923 to 1934. The Italians did the same in Libya between 1923 and 1933. The major perpetrators were the British under the able guidance of Lord Trenchard and such effective commanders as Salmond, Game, Portal, and Harris. The United States, although politically it would never con- sider itself a colonial or imperial power, also let its eagles fly. From 1919 to 1923 U.S. aircraft ch
