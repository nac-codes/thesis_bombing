cal air opera- tions. They did not want the independent RAF to perform reconnaissance and frontline support and perhaps be told that it could not be done. The lobbying was intense with Churchill vacillating, even going as far as to propose a defense ministry (with himself as minister) that would control the three servic- es, and Trenchard staunchly upholding the need for an inde- pendent RAF. The fight went on for years. Trenchard won, cre- ated the RAF as it is known today, and has since been called its "father." His organizational and command skills are apparent in not having army titles for the officer corps and gradually involving the RAF in British Empire military control. Tren- chard succeeded in employing it in an economical manner to quell local colonial unrest. The bombing started in 1919 when Afghanistan declared one of its holy wars and together with the tribes in the north- ern Indian frontier area began to threaten India's security Handley Pages were sent to India and attacked the rebels and their villages. The RAF resources were sparse and there was no thanks from the army for their work. One Handley Page V- 1500 bombed Kabul on 24 May 1919.22 Dakka was also bombed as was the city of Jalalabad for three days in May 1919. There were heavy military and civilian losses. The RAF contingent was under the command of Air Vice-Marshal Sir Philip Woolcott Game. He has been described as more ruthless in his bombing methods than the bombers of World War II.

The action was investi- gated in London and found not only justified but necessary.25 India and its frontiers had to be kept safe within the British Empire, although the cost of it was also a consideration. The 1919-20 skirmishes required 29,000 combat troops and 34,000 auxiliaries to supply them. Trenchard, who had only twenty-five squadrons, stationed nineteen of them permanently across the empire. Eight were
