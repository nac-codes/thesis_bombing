British attitude after World War I was that air attacks outside the battle zone could not be prohibited.34 The Spaniards also dropped explosives on insurgents of the Rif Rebellion in the early 1920s. The conflict spilled over into French Morocco and lasted till 1926. In the end the French deployed 85 battalions and 22 squadrons with a total of 160 planes.35 Similar problems erupted in Syria, which France had accepted as a League mandate in April 1920. French colonial troops were brought in to fight the Druzes. Damascus was bombed on 20 October 1925 whereby the Moslem section of the city was badly damaged and 1,416 civilians killed. French sources published a toll of only 150 killed.36 Italy was another country to use its air force, the Regia Aeronautica, on people who had no means of defending them- selves against this menace.

He declared the Mediterranean the mare nostrum and thereby set a collision course with the Royal Navy patrolling the sea route to India via Suez. The Italian navy and air force were built up. Italy needed markets and land for its surplus population to settle on. During World War I it had lost control of the interior of Libya, taken from the Turks in 1912. From 1923 onward Italy was involved in an ongoing fight with rebellious tribes that lasted till 1932. Whole villages and their flocks were herded into five large concentration camps where thousands of them died. A 160-mile-long fence was erected along the Libyan- Egyptian border to prevent supplies coming into the colony. The Regia Aeronautica controlled the fence and attacked any Libyans still at large, whether men, women, or children.37 Under Balbo, who became governor of Libya in 1933, and after the "pacification" had been completed, Italian colonists came to settle.
