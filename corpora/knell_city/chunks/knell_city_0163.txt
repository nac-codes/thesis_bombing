Stalin's USSR was enamored by the Republicans's anticler- ical and Communist stance and in July 1936 decided to weigh in against the Fascists. By October 1936 Russian freighters had unloaded 50 tanks, 20 armored cars, and 108 fighter planes at Cartagena. The planes, mostly I-15 and I-16 fighters, and tanks, came complete with crews, who like the Germans arrived in civilian dress. The fighters went into action in November and helped to stall Franco's drive to Madrid.46 By midwinter of 1937 the USSR had 433 planes in Spain, which represented two-thirds of the Republican air force.47 The preponderance of fighters in the USSR/Republican air force in Spain resulted in a temporary air superiority, which lasted until the Condor Legion and Italian Aviazione Legionaria were equipped with better fighters.

Of about 277 planes of all types, 214 ended up with the Republicans and 63 with the Nationalists.48 The cost to the Spanish people for the "help" from both sides was immense. The national gold reserve, valued at U.S.$788 million, was sent to the Soviet Union for safekeeping.

Spain never saw its gold again. Another U.S.$250 million was sent to France for material help. The Germans were paid in iron ores and minerals, which they needed for the build-up of their armaments. They also obtained control of mining compa- nies, ensuring that they would get paid. The air force actions during the Spanish Civil War were mostly tactical.
