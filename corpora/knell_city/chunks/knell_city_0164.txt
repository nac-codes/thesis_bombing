Where bombing occurred it was in support of imminent ground assaults. The Republicans had few bombers because the main force consisted of Russian planes. The USSR's Red Air Force had huge bombers, which would have been useless for tactical support and easy prey for enemy fight- ers. They had few medium bombers such as those the Condor Legion and the Aviazione Legionaria had been equipped with. Only 340 aircraft of the 1,400 supplied by the USSR were medi- um bombers of the SB-2 and R-5 type.50 There were isolated bombing raids by the Russian/Republican Air Force against Seville, Zaragossa, Valladolid, and Salamanca.51 To the chagrin of the Republican military commanders, most of these raids were executed without authorization. The Nationalists, due to the help of their fellow Fascist supporters, regained air superi- ority by the end of 1937. Strategic bombing on a large scale did not fit this war. because it was brother against brother, and destruction of industry, infrastructure, and residential areas would have been counterproductive. The victor would have to pay for their reconstruction before he could use them again.

He had himself proclaimed head of state of Spain and needed the capital to bring credence to the title. There were numerous air raids on Madrid, causing frightful civilian losses. Exact casualties were never estab- lished, but some sources indicate 2,200 to 2,500 killed and 4,000 wounded.52 At the time, the superior Russian fighters inflicted heavy losses on the slow Ju-52 bombers. The advance on Madrid stalled and the city did not fall to the Nationalists until early 1939. When Madrid could not be taken by late 1936, Franco shift- 145 ed his campaign to the north
