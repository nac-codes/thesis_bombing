lanes of the Con Condor Legion and the Aviazione Legionaria from 4 to 7 P.M. All aircraft were under the direct command of von Richthofen. He had cleared the raid with Salamanca and timed it to prevent the retreat of Republican troops through the town; at least that is what intelligence had told him. The raid- ing fleet consisted of twenty-three Ju-52, four He-111, one Do- 17, and three Savoia-Marchetti bombers.
