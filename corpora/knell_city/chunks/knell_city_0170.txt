deteriorate and by 1937 the Japanese army and air force had invaded the northern Chinese provinces from Manchuria The Second Sino-Japanese War had started and would contin- ue until the Japanese surrender in August 1945. From 1937 onward Japanese forces advanced along the Chinese coast and took possession of all major cities from Peking to Canton. Fierce battles developed around the major cities and the Japanese army and navy air forces went into action. The army air force deployed about 300 planes and the navy air force 149 about 230 based on carriers off shore. Against them stood about 100 Chinese fighter planes.64 There was no planned strategic air war, but civilian losses were substantial because bombing was performed without any consideration of civil- ians. Except for the raids on Chungking, the far away provi- sional Chinese capital, the most notorious raids occurred around the battlefields. The Chungking raids were strategic, because they happened far away from the front lines. The city was attacked two hundred times with a total of 3,717 sorties.65 In the summer of 1939 during four months of continuous attacks four-fifths of the city was destroyed. Japanese planners had expected th I that with the destruction of Chungking, China could be blasted out of the war and its people would rebel. It did not happen and the morale of the citizens actually improved. 66 Other major cities suffering from the Japanese air forces were Nanking, Hankow, Canton, and the Chinese sections of Shanghai.67 Chinese civilian losses between 1937 and 1945 amounted to 77,105 killed and 78,394 injured.68 Between July 1937 and March 1940, Japanese aircraft flew 9,786 raids with a total of 43,000 sorties.

In late 1937, twelve hundred bombers dropped five hundred tons of high explosives, a considerable tonnage at that time. The bombing represented the prelude to the plun
