ed by the two tradition- al services. When the leading airmen were free of the shackles of the conservative army generals and navy admirals, they could convince legislators that air forces, and bombers in par- ticular, were needed. In Britain, the RAF had become inde- pendent in 1918. France created an independent air ministry in October 1928, which became responsible for all matters con- nected with flying, both military and commercial.71 L'Armée de l'Air became an independent service in 1933. The Soviets set up a Bureau of Commissars of Aviation and Aeronautics in November 1917, a few days after they had seized power from the Mensheviks.72 Similarly, Hitler, a few days after becoming chancellor, created an Air Commissionary with Göring as its head in March 1933. Mussolini, after his march on Rome in 1922 and being made prime minister by Victor Emmanuel III. created the Regia Aeronautica in 1923 and made Italo Balbo its first minister in 1929. The Japanese air forces remained part of the navy and army, respectively, until the bitter end in 1945. In the United States, as we have learned previously, Mitchell tried to convince Congress to create an independent U.S. Air Force. It did not happen until 1947, after World War II. Of the above listed states, Britain became the most bomber- oriented, with a ratio of bombers to fighters of 2:1 in 1932 and a total of one thousand planes.73 This ratio was maintained and manifested in the establishment of RAF Bomber Command in July 1934.74 In France, the ratio of bombers to fighters was kept at approximately 1.6:1 until 1928, with a total of 1,540 planes.75 The French military leaders never believed in the Douhet Theorem. In 1923 Marshal Fayolle, the air force inspector gen- eral, defined the purpose of the French air force as providing tactical support for the army.76 The bomber was to operate in connection with the artillery in the battle zone. Air superiority was to be a prerequisite for that. This in turn meant a well- equip
