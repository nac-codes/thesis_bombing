developments had come to a dead stop with the signing of the Versailles Treaty. Supposedly all front- line planes had been surrendered after the armistice in Novem- ber 1918. In 1920 there were still about fourteen hundred planes and approximately two thousand Air Corps officers and men in the German army.82 The German government called this  152 TO DESTROY A CITY BETWEEN THE WORLD WARS force Polizeistaffeln (Police Squadrons) and maintained they were required to keep law and order. The Paris-based Allied Control Commission went along with this explanation, pre- sumably for fear of a Communist takeover in Germany. Once the putsches in Bavaria and the Rhineland had been quelled. there was no further need for the Polizeistaffeln. The German government tried to obtain permission to keep them, but the Control Commission turned the request down in April 1920. It ordered the disbandment of the formations and their sol- diers in twelve days. 83 Since General von Seekt, chief of staff of the German army, had a keen understanding of the impor- tance of air warfare not all of the two thousand flying per- sonnel were demobilized. Von Seekt created the Sondertruppe (special formation), which was entrusted with the planning of logistics for a re-establishment of the army air force. Many officers joined that group to eventually end up as Luftwaffe leaders in World War II. The planes had to be dismantled and scrapped. But again, not all of them came under the wrecking ball. Many were hidden in barns and industrial sheds and surfaced after 1933. These were mostly single-seat fighters. There is no record of bombers being hidden; they would have been too big. The German government passed a law that made hiding World War I army planes punishable, but the law was just window dressing for the benefit of the Allied Control Commission. The Sondertruppe became part of the Reich War Ministry. It kept track of the hidden planes, prepared lists of spare parts stores, and investigated the old
