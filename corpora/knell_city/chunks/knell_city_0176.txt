planes purchased from Fokker were sent there. Selected offi- cers and men were transferred to receive combat training, after having attended private flying schools in Germany for basic training. The German flying schools were financed and oper- ated by the army, although on the outside they looked like commercial enterprises. The airfield at WÃ¼rzburg had such a school beginning in the 1920s. From 1927 to 1935 it was direct- ed by Ritter von Greim, a Reichswehr officer in civilian clothes.

A further part of the secret agree- ments was the delivery of Russian ammunition and other war materials to Germany. Reports reached the British press, but nothing was done about it by the Allied governments.89 Also in the Rapallo Agreement was a provision that Junkers, the German aircraft firm, would establish a plant at Fili, near Moscow, to produce military aircraft for the German army.

Junkers, the owner of the Fili factory, was interested not only in surviving on German army orders, but also pursued the pro- duction of commercial aircraft. The Rapallo Treaty allowed the establishment of a German commercia
