permitted only after 1926. Many of the manufacturers folded, whereas others established foreign subsidiaries such as Junkers in Russia, Dornier in Italy, and Heinkel in Sweden.94 After 1933 the industry suddenly received massive orders from the government to build up the Luftwaffe. The equivalent of U.S. $10 million was approved by the cabinet on 9 February, eleven days after Hitler became chancellor. In the first six months of 1933, a total of U.S. $12.5 million was appropriated.95 Erhard Milch, the ex-Lufthansa Airline president turned secretary of state of the recently estab- lished air ministry, issued strict orders to disguise the  156 To DESTROY A CITY BETWEEN THE WORLD WARS Luftwaffe build-up. Air force personnel continued to wear civilian clothes. The modest plans of the old Reichswehr Ministry Sonder- truppe were revised. Suddenly, struggling factories such as Junkers and Dornier had to work double shifts to meet the goals for 1934. These included, for delivery by October of that year, 210 bombers, 65 fighters, and, most important, 872 trainers.96 The Luftwaffe was also intended to have a strategic role, as first planned by General Wever. Prototypes of four-engine bombers were developed and called "Ural bombers," a clear indication of what their purpose and destination would be. After Wever's accidental death and after Hitler's plans toward Eastern and Western Europe had jelled, it was decided that the Luftwaffe would remain a tactical force, and further develop- ment of long-range bombers was stopped. Dornier's four- engine bomber Do-19 was scrapped, and Junkers's Ju-89 became a four-engine commercial airliner. The real turning point in the history of Europe came in March 1935 when Hitler openly declared the Versailles Treaty null and void. He confirmed that reparation payments, sus- pended since 1931 for economic reasons, would be suspended indefinitely. German troops marched into the demilitarized zone west of the Rhine. General conscription was reintro
