I. A British aircraft engine manufactured in 1935 would require 8,000 to 9,000 man-hours. These were five times as many hours as required for a 1918 aircraft engine. By around 1938, an up- to-date bomber consisted of 70,000 individual parts, which in turn required 6,000 to 8,000 drawings. The manufacture of a plane without its engines needed 14,000 to 18,000 man-hours.99 Not only had the costs escalated, the nations' resources were taxed to the limit. The armament race started before the Geneva Disarmament Conference failed in 1933. Who started it is a moot point. Every nation was pointing the finger at the other, and each claimed that its own efforts were dictated by self-defense. Most histori- ans prove in one way or another that rearmament was started by Hitler as soon as he came to power. The renowned British historian A. J. P. Taylor claims that German rearmament until 1936 is a myth.100 This view is supported by R. J. Overy, who maintains that British rearmament started before Hitler came to power.101 Other sources show that the German military budget for 1935 was U.S. $3 billion, whereas Britain and France had budgeted U.S. $610 million and $730 million respectively.102 The same source indicates that for that year the budgets for the respective air forces were: Germany, U.S. $900 million, about 33 percent of total military budget; Britain, U.S. $140 million, 23 percent; France, U.S.$160 million, 22 percent. As the race speed- ed up, the military budget figures had increased by 1938 to: Germany, U.S. $4.7 billion with 1.55 billion, 33 percent for the Luftwaffe; Britain, U.S. $1.76 billion with 420 million, 34 percent for the RAF; France, U.S. $850 million with 170 million, 27 per- cent for L'Arm√©e de l'Air. Yet another source shows that in 1934 Germany had the lowest armament budget as a percentage of gross national product.103 The figures quoted indicate: Germany 1.8 percent, France 8.1 percent, Britain 3.0 percent, Russia 9.0 percent, and Japan 8.4 percent.
