west armament budget as a percentage of gross national product.103 The figures quoted indicate: Germany 1.8 percent, France 8.1 percent, Britain 3.0 percent, Russia 9.0 percent, and Japan 8.4 percent. Misinformation and disinformation played a great role in this race. Churchill claimed that by 1936 the German govern- ment was spending U.S. $3 billion annually on rearmament.104 A. J. P. Taylor claims that total German rearmament between March 1933 and March 1939 cost U.S. $10 billion. This averages 159 to U.S. $1.66 bill illion per annum, slightly more than half the amount Churchill had stated. But then in 1939 Hitler bragged that he had spent U.S. $22.5 billion, a $3.75 billion average per annum to build up the Wehrmacht.105 Can one blame politi- cians, military planners, and historians for believing Hitler? From the political and economic point of view, rearmament made sense. It kept alive old hatreds and alleviated unem- ployment. There is no doubt that all major nations participated in the arms race. Even in the United States, a country far away from the hot spots of Europe, the armament fever was recognized. The Neutrality Act of 1935 forbade the sale of arms to countries waging war. However, there was no restriction on selling arms and particularly airplanes to anybody who was only preparing for war and who could pay for them. Payment had to be in cash if the purchaser was not current in payments on World War I debts, which no country was.106 Soon the orders for planes poured in from France and Britain. The industries of these countries could not meet the targets of their respective air armament plans. There was no money in either the British or French treasuries, but the threat to peace was considered such that gold reserves, sale of government assets, and budget deficits were used to pay for the purchases. Statistics show how rearmament fever gripped the nations after 1933. Not only were arms produced, but also new divi- sions created and equipped with these
