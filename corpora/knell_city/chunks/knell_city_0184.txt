deficits were used to pay for the purchases. Statistics show how rearmament fever gripped the nations after 1933. Not only were arms produced, but also new divi- sions created and equipped with these arms. In 1933 the major powers had the following bomber fleets: France, 320; Britain, 390; Italy, 270; USSR, 410; USA, 300.107 Germany, because of the Versailles Treaty, had none at the time. Smaller countries surrounding Germany did not yet feel threatened and had only small bomber forces: Belgium, 30; Czechoslovakia, 40; Poland, 28; Norway, 6. Countries having no bombers at all were: Holland, Switzerland, and Spain. Based on a German source, the picture had changed by 1936. Total frontline aircraft including bombers were: France 2,515; Britain, 1,270; Italy, 2,100; USSR, 4,700; USA, 1,800; Japan, 1,300.108 The source, a Luftwaffe publication, gives no indication of what Germany had. One can understand that because on one  160 To DESTROY A CITY BETWEEN THE WORLD WARS 161 hand the Germans wanted to show that they were threatened by the armaments of neighboring nations. On the other hand. Hitler and GÃ¶ring had already used the bluff of Luftwaffe strength to intimidate other countries. In the first case a low figure was politically useful and in the second case a high fig- ure was equally effective. The above source lists the air force strengths of Poland and Czechoslovakia as 765 and 650, respec- tively. The speed with which the major powers increased their air forces is best shown when one compares aircraft production of 1938 with 1939:109 1,382 3,163 Germany 5,235 8,295 Japan 3,201 4,467 Britain 2,827 7,940 France 1938 1939 2,195 USA 1,800 USSR 7,500 10,382 What is not clear from the above table is whether some of the aircraft produced were sold to other countries. Britain Germany, Italy, and the United States exported planes. For example, the Finnish Air Force had Blenheim bombers; Yugoslav Me-109s fought Luftwaffe Me-109s over Belgrade in 1941; France bought one thou
