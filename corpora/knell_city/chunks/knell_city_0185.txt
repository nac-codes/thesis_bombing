Germany, Italy, and the United States exported planes. For example, the Finnish Air Force had Blenheim bombers; Yugoslav Me-109s fought Luftwaffe Me-109s over Belgrade in 1941; France bought one thousand U.S. Curtis P-36 fighters in 1938; and prior to World War II Britain purchased Lockheed Hudsons from the United States. In 1933 GÃ¶ring bought eighty-five aircraft engines from Armstrong-Siddeley/UK under the pretext that they were to power "police aircraft."110 Much has been written about the arms race before World War II. The statistics of what was produced vary. German pub- lications, even of post-WWII vintage, stress low expenditures on the German side. British, U.S., and French sources state exactly the opposite for German rearmament. To confuse the issue even more, there are East German sources with references to USSR and other Communist literature, which are slanted against both the Fascists and the Capitalists.

In Europe and the Far East, Germany, Italy, and Japan, united in the Axis Pact with the professed aim of expanding their political and economic bases. The start had been made with the invasions of Manchuria, China, and Ethiopia, and by Germany abrogating the Treaty of Versailles. Between 1935 and 1937 Hitler consolidated his power in Germany, and to many people in the world he appeared as a shining example of how to pull a country out of the Depression. He even signed a naval treaty with Britain which guaranteed the supe- riority of the Royal Navy over the Kriegsmarine (the German navy). But then in March 1938 Austria became part of the Greater German Reich. The union was forbidden by the Versailles Treaty, but no actions were taken.
