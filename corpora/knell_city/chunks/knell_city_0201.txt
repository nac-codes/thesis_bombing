ordered to mine the British naval base at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands and to destroy the Royal Navy oil tank farm on Lyness Peninsula.26 This purely tactical operation caused the first civilian losses on British soil. The British air ministry jumped at the opportunity to retaliate and ordered the first attack on German soil. On the night of 19-20 March, the HÃ¶rnum seaplane base on the Island of Sylt became the target of fifty bombers dropping twenty tons of high explo- sives and 1,200 incendiaries. Later reconnaissance photos showed that the damage was minimal.27 Whereas previously both sides did their utmost to prevent civilian losses, the restrictions on bombing were now gradually reduced.

The Wehrmacht occupied Denmark and Norway in short order and evicted the British expeditionary force which had landed a few days after 9 April at Andalnes instead of Narvik. The battle for Narvik took longer. Allied forces landed there belatedly and then withdrew because they were needed in France.  176 TO DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II 177 Churchill had promised the Cabinet that the Royal Navy and Royal Marines occupying Norway would fatally weaken Germany. As did his Dardanelles plan in 1915, it failed. But this time Churchill's political stock was higher and he was not sent on a political vacation. On 10 May 1940, Germany struck out west and invaded Belgium, Luxembourg, and Holland. The planning for that strike had become known in early 1940 when a German couri- er plane with high-ranking officers st
