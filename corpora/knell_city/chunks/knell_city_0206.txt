The facts are that the German army halted its attack, that the Luftwaffe did considerable damage to the troops, and not least to the city of Dunkirk. Most important, the BEF escaped, although leaving all its equipment behind. While the campaign in the West was unfolding, RAF Bomber Command flew an ever-increasing number of strategic raids against targets in Germany. Reports indicate that most crews bombed their assigned targets of railway yards, troop assemblies, oil refineries, etc .; so the RAF files in the Public Record Office, London, state. The German reports of the time talk about little damage, bombs dropped on open cities and far away from any legitimate targets.

In August 1939 it had only 575 fighters and 300 bombers and many of them were sta- tioned overseas.37 French industry and orders from the United  O DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II 181 States doubled that number by June 1940 because the active replenishment program started in 1935 by nationalizing the aircraft industry was just coming into full swing.38 But the fall of France could not be prevented.
