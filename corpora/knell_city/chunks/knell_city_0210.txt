it turned out, the majority of the French air force and navy were transferred to French North Africa and in particular the more modern planes and ships. The armistice that was signed at Compiègne on 22 June clearly stipulated that no planes, ships, and colonies had to be surrendered. Hitler did not want French honor to be hurt. The fact that he then chose Compiègne, including the very railway carriage in which Germany had surrendered in 1918, for the French surrender of 1940 does not follow that line. Why he, the head of state of Germany, had to be present at the beginning of the negotiations is also difficult to comprehend. His French counterpart, General Huntziger, was a senior army command- er and had the authority to sign the document. If the French thought that the fighting was over for them they experienced a rude surprise on 3 July. French navy ships in British-controlled ports were seized on or before that date. On 3 July a Royal Navy squadron appeared outside the French naval station at Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria, and demanded surren- der of the ships at anchor. Among them were three battleships. The French admiral refused. There followed a short bombard- ment in which one battleship blew up with the loss of more than one thousand sailors, one ran aground and lost about two hundred sailors, and one escaped into open waters. History books are very critical of this unfriendly action against a former ally.
