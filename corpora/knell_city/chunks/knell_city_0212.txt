tentions in the West. He broke his word again. The echoes of 1871 and 1914 seemingly did not reach Hitler's ears. Western Europe had been overrun in a blitzkrieg. Holland, Luxembourg, Belgium, and large parts of France became "occupied enemy territory" and, already during the campaign, were subjected to bombing by the RAF. The German theory that an air force's role was to support ground operations had been proven correct. Douhet's and Trenchard's theories and feeble attempts to implement them, had not stemmed the German advance. If the Polish campaign and the Phony War can be called the first phase of World War II, the campaign in the West was the second. In the first phase, bombing was still very restricted.

The RAF lost 166 bombers and 219 fighters. French losses amounted to 218 bombers and 508 fighters. Luftwaffe losses came in at 635 bombers and 457 fighters.49 In essence the Germans had won, but at a price to their air arm.

Hitler made speeches and clandestine approach- es to inveigle Churchill and his cabinet into peace talks. There is even
