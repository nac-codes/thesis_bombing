t, Hitler had given the order that starting on 5 August (Eagle Day) air superiority over southern England had to be established in four days. Weather and Luftwaffe technical 185 problems delayed the start to 15 August. Instead of four days, the battle of Britain lasted until early September. Like Britain over the Reich, Germany had clandestinely sent planes over England before the war to take pictures of military installa- tions.52 The targets to bomb were known and many of them were destroyed or damaged. The campaign brought heavy losses to both sides and was finally won by RAF Bomber Command. It was the time of the famous Churchill pronouncement that so much was owed by so many to so few.

But the RAF was fighting on its home ground, whereas the German fighters could only spend short periods over southern England to shield the bombers, before being forced to return because of limited fuel capacities. It was a tough battle but facts prove that Churchill's statement was one of many wartime propaganda pronouncements. The Germans learned in short order what Bomber Command had experienced the year before. Bomber forma- tions flying in daylight take dreadful losses. The Luftwaffe was not equipped for this kind of war. It had no long-range fighters to protect the bombers. Losses on both sides were: RAF, 550 fighters; Luftwaffe, 956 fighters and bombers.53 Damage caused by the German bombs did not entail serious interruptions of RAF operations and life in general.

In an Air Ministry communication it is stated that the Luftwaffe made a mistake in calling off the attacks.54 In the months after the fall of France, RAF
