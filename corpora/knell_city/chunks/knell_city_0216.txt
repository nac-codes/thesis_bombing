panded and started working around the clock. For 1940 the British War Potential Program had projected a production of 16,000 planes.56 To this had to be added the deliveries from the United States, which stood at 14,000 aircraft and 25,000 aero engines on order in August 1940.57 That oil was the Achilles heel of the German war machine was correctly recognized early in the war. If its destruction had been persistently executed, the war would have ended sooner. But in summer 1940 Bomber Command had to spread its resources over such target systems as barges in the Channel ports, airfields in the occupied countries, and helping Coastal Command and the navy to chase U-boats. The German fuel sit- uation had always been difficult. It is best shown that despite its famous armored divisions, the majority of the German army still depended on the horse. There were more horses in the German army in World War II than in World War I. The Luftwaffe, for all its proclaimed strength and efficien- cy, was always just able to keep its planes fueled. In 1934 it depended entirely on imports for its high-octane fuel. In 1936- 187 37 the U.S. Ethylgas Corporation built a plant in Doeberitz to produce octane 86 gasoline. By 1939 synthetic plants were in operation using coal as a base. But one ton of fuel required six tons of hard coal, which had to be mined and transported. In case of war the demand of the Luftwaffe was estimated to be 100,000 cubic meters per month. In 1939 there were stores of 400,000 cubic meters. At that time Germany could produce 20,000 cubic meters per month and imported 9,000 cubic meters per month from Romania. Stores and production were only sufficient for a blitzkrieg. Another problem was tra transport. The Luftwaffe needed 9,000 tank cars, but had only 5,200 at the beginning of the war. Production, transport, and storage of fuel was a problem for the German air force.58 By the end of 1940 Germany had cap- tured another 200,000 tons of aviation fuel in the countr
