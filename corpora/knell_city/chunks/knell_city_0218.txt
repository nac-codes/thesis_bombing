targets. When it missed them it seemed log- ical that it was done with a purpose. German propaganda pub- lished a White Paper on RAF raids, which thoughtfully avoid- ed references to civilian losses, lest the people get upset, but mentioned such "dastard" willful destruction of heritage assets as the garden pavilion of GÃ¶the at Weimar and Bismarck's mausoleum at Friedrichsruh.60 Bomber Command must have been thrilled to be credited with such accuracy. Statistics show that from October 1940 till February 1942. Bomber Command killed an average of 219 Germans per month and destroyed about 120 buildings in the process.61 The number and the types of aircraft available to perform these raids was limited. On paper there were 532 twin-engine bombers in service; actually available for operations were rarely more than 150.62 But these relatively few and small air- craft flew raids whenever weather and moonlight permitted them. The main targets were still to be oil installations. Air Marshal Peirse, who had taken over from Charles Portal as chief of Bomber Command on 5 October 1940, was also com- manded to attack vital war industries in German and Italian cities, continue laying mines, and attack German military installations across the Channel; an invasion still being feared for 1941. Peirse protested that he could not possibly raid all these targets, with the result that damage was scattered and annoying to the Germans, but not much more. By contrast, the German Luftwaffe now initiated what has ever since been referred to as the Blitz. After the battle of Britain had to be called off because of heavy German losses and with no foreseeable success in sight, the bombers of Luftflotte 2, commanded by Field Marshal Kesselring from Brussels, Luftflotte 3, commanded by Field Marshal Sperrle from Paris, and Luftflotte 5, commanded by General Stumpf in Kristianstad, Norway, were let loose on Britain. In total these air fleets had about 770 serviceable machines between them.63 Depend
