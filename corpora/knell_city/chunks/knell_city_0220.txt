ore they would explode.64 From 7 September until 13 November, London was bombarded every night. A total of 13,000 tons of high explosives and 12,000 incendiary canisters were dropped. Other cities were raided too and the most famous raid is the one on Coventry on 14 November 1940, when 450 bombers dis- charged 500 tons of high explosives and 880 incendiary canis- ters.65 Civilian losses were appalling, mainly because there were few adequate air-raid shelters. In the raid on Coventry 554 people lost their lives. In the raid on London on 15 October over 400 perished. Hitler's eraser was at work but, if he thought it would stop British raids on Germany and/or that morale in the UK would crack and force the British govern- ment's hand, he soon realized his miscalculation. In 1940 the Luftwaffe dropped 37,000 tons of bombs on Britain and the  To DESTROY A CITY 190 BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II 191 RAF 10,000 tons on Germany.66 On the score of causing civilian losses the Luftwaffe was leading. By November 1940 German raids had killed more than 15,000 British civilians, whereas in six months of bombing Germany in 1940 the RAF had killed 975 Germans. 67 The Blitz was not justified retaliation, it was an escalation in the bombing war. British official policy, as expressed in the media and the House of Commons, was that the targets in Germany were of a military and strategic nature. Although not publicly announced, this changed on 16 December 1940 when the first RAF area raid was authorized. It was to be a retaliatory attack for the raids on Coventry and Southampton. Crews were instructed to hit the center of Mannheim. Of 134 bombers dis- patched, about 100 attacked the target. The German report list- ed 34 people killed, 81 injured, 1,266 bombed out, and about 500 residential dwellings destroyed.68 Compared with what the Luftwaffe could deliver, this was small retaliation. The morale of neither people wavered and the the respective governments became convinced that their own peopl
