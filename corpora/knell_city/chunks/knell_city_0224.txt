resources. Overall planning had been placed in the hands of Ernst Udet, a WWI fighter ace, who created a monstrous bureaucracy. Hitler gave orders without consultation and, as regards the Luftwaffe, these orders were often contradictory. As an example one must consider the jet fighter development. The Me-262 was to be a fighter. He wanted it to be a bomber. When it finally came into service in late 1944 as a fighter it proved lethal to U.S. bomber formations. But it was too late to make a decisive impact. Comparing German aircraft produc- tion with British output, one finds that German production was low. In 1939 the output was 8,000 planes, in 1940 it rose to 10,000, in 1941 to 11,000, in 1942 to 15,000, and then in 1943 and 1944 jumped to 25,000 and 40,000 respectively. In these years the Germans finally realised that the air offensive of the Allies needed to be responded to and the rise in output is due to increased fighter production.73 The respective aircraft industries of both Britain and Ger- many employed during the war years approximately the same number of people. But the output per manhour was much higher in Britain thanks to the employment of modern production methods. In Germany it was still the old-fashioned master- apprentice principle. In Britain i in it was mass production by semi- skilled workers. Few German women entered the war industry. Up to 80 percent of the workforce in the aircraft industry were foreigners. Some of them volunteers, most of them forcefully brought to the Reich, and a considerable number were concen- tration camp inmates. Morale must have been a problem. But surprisingly, quality and quantity of production were high. German air force strength in March 1940 was 3,692 machines. By March 1941 the number had declined, instead of going up, to 3,583, and a year later it was down to 2,872.74 1941: MORE BLITZKRIEGS In 1941 German military planning had to divert a considerable part of its resources and time to help Mussolini.
