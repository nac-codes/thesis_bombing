up, to 3,583, and a year later it was down to 2,872.74 1941: MORE BLITZKRIEGS In 1941 German military planning had to divert a considerable part of its resources and time to help Mussolini. Italian troops invaded Greece from their bases in Albania on 28 October 1940. More than 100,000 Italian troops started to march.75 They were supported by 187 RA aircraft, 55 of which were three-engine bombers. The Greeks had 150 aircraft of which 29 were bombers. Air raids in both directions started in November when Italian bombers, among other targets, hit Salonica killing two hundred civilians. The Greeks attacked Italian bases in Albania, reportedly only hitting airports. Britain became involved in the fighting and occupied Crete on 29 October 1940, a day after the Italian campaign had started. The RAF flew support for the Greeks from Malta by attacking Italian ports. Before long the Italian forces were pushed back into Albania and Mussolini's fortunes appeared bleak. He could not emulate his fellow dictator's blitzkriegs. In the meantime Hitler, who was planning on invading  194 TO DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II Russia, tried to secure the southern flank and oil supplies from Romania by political maneuvers. The USSR had forced the Romanians to cede Bessarabia, the Bulgarians felt threatened and both accepted German military help in materials and German troops stationed on their territories. Yugoslavia was to join the Axis, but that political feat faltered on the objections of the Serb majority in the Yugoslav ruling circles. Hitler had to delay the thrust eastward to establish his southern front and to help the Italians. In December 1940 Luftwaffe units had already been stationed on the Italian Dodecanese Islands off the Turkish coast and had flown raids against Alexandria and the Suez Canal. German transport planes had ferried 30,000 Italian troops from Italy to Albania. One feat of the RA should be mentioned here because it was one of the few strategic air strikes
