rength and intentions. It was believed that the USSR armed forces were leaderless because of the 1937 purges when 90 percent of the the generals and admirals were executed on trumped-up charges of treason. In addition about 35,000 lower-rank officers were shot. German estimates of armaments understated Soviet strength. Assessment of the Red Army per- formance in the Winter War against Finland confirmed these findings. Since October 1940 the Luftwaffe had flown many high-altitude reconnaissance flights over the USSR, but obvi- ously they had not revealed the full picture. Many of the Soviet armament factories were then already behind the Ural Mountains, beyond the range of the German planes. Hitler must have been so sure of his coming success that he ignored the possibility of having the USSR attacked by Japan from the east. The Soviet/Japanese non-aggression pact of 13 April 1940 explicitly eliminated that. The blitzkrieg developed as planned with German success- es and advances despite numerical and material inferiority. The Luftwaffe claimed to have destroyed 7,500 Soviet planes in the first few months. This supposedly represented 70 percent of the order of battle of the Red Air Force in the west.89 But this success had its price. German losses were 774 aircraft repre- senting 60 percent of its order of battle. When winter came, the  198 To DESTROY A BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II 199 German army was still outside Mos d not occupied Leningrad, and in short was stuck first m mud and then in snow and ice. Troops and their equipment had not been equipped for that contingency, losses and reversals mounted and the blitzkrieg had failed. There followed three years and four months of the most bitter fighting the world had ever seen, with horrendous loss- es of men and materials on both sides and in the end with the Red Army meeting the U.S. Army at the Elbe River in Germany in early 1945. At the eastern front the war in the air was ferocious but developed mostly along tactical
