l raids on the Romanian oil fields at Ploesti and in February 1944 there were three major raids on Finland involving up to 850 aircraft of all types to force Finland out of the war. A total of 2,386 tons of high explosives were dropped.91 Similarly, to force Hungary to quit, four raids with a total of 1,129 sorties were flown against Budapest in September 1944. Few publications and documents can be located which describe the actions of the Soviet strategic air forces; there was not much action. By contrast German strategic air actions were substantial. Moscow in particular suffered because it was another place which Hitler vowed to "ausradieren." Mass raids were flown between 21-22 and 24-25 July 1942.

There were 600 fighters, 796 antiaircraft guns, and numerous searchlights in position.92 Of the 127 bombers exe- cuting the first raid, 22 were shot down; a loss rate that could not be tolerated. Therefore, after the first heavy raids the Luftwaffe put aside the "eraser" and returned to tactical war- fare. To the praise of the Germans, downtown Leningrad was not attacked by the Luftwaffe. Of the magnificent structures of that city only the Kirov Theatre was damaged by artillery fire during the long siege. The Winter Palace with the Hermitage, the gold-domed cathedrals of Kazakhstan and of St. Isaacs and many other monuments survived the war. But the palaces outside of Leningrad were completely destroyed because they were in the war zone.

There were still concentrated actions which involved hundreds of German bombers and caused great damage. In June 1942 the
