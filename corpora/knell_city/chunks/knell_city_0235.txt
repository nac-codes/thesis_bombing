German troops under General Rommel had been dispatched to North Africa to shore up retreating Italian forces. To supply these units the ships had to pass the island of Malta, a major British stronghold between Gibraltar and the Suez Canal. La Valetta, the principal port, was pounded for years by the Luftwaffe and the Regia Aeronautica. These raids must be termed strategic, because they were not in the imme- diate battlefield and there never seemed to have been plans to land on the island. It was a formidable fortress and it was hoped that it could be isolated by air action. The plan almost succeeded, had it not been for the heroic defenders and the equally heroic ships and their crews which brought in sup- plies. The damage to this ancient and historic place was sub- stantial and over 4,800 civilians lost their lives in three years of bombing. 102 As 1941 progressed Bomber Command continued to fly raids into Germany and Italy, all the time hitting and/or miss- ing the intended targets. At first the targets were oil, trans- portation, and aircraft factories. As the German U-boat cam- paign in the Atlantic became more threatening, U-boat bases on the west coast of France and shipyards in northern Germany were added to the list. The Operational Record Books of the RAF at the Public Record Office in London speak of damage inflicted and increasing numbers of bombers dispatched.

I remember well the reports in the German media of increasing terror raids on inno- cent citizens and villages. Goebbels was walking a tightrope. To call the British, and Churchill in particular, war criminals-as he did-he had to admit that the
