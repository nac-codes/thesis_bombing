German government to call for an armistice. Depending on the weather and many other circumstances, such as bomber crew experience, the German civilian losses were mounting. Hamburg suffered eight deaths on 12-13 March 1941. A night later 51 died and at Kiel 125 died on 8-9 April. The number of sorties and the bombloads were increas- ing. Whereas for all of 1940 Bomber Command had delivered 203 10,000 tons of bombs, six months later an additional 18,000 tons had been dropped. But the effort came with a price. From 3 September 1939 to 14 July 1941 one thousand bombers had been lost. 105 If the only way to attack Germany was by air, and many political and military leaders thought this was the way to win the war, to continue and succeed Bomber Command losses not only had to be replaced but the number of planes had to be increased. A delegation was sent to the United States. Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Harris headed the RAF delegation. His post as deputy chief of the air staff was taken over by Air Vice-Marshal Bottomley.

On the other hand there were the glowing reports of the air crews of targets burning and designated installations destroyed. Upon Lord Cherwell's instigation, D. M.

The report, completed in August 1941, was a blow to Bomber Command and its leader, Sir Richard Peirse. The government decided to assess the bomber offensive and a halt to all major operations was ordered. It appeared that German rep
