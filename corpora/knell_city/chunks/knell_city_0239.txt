t of the world the United States had begun to rearm after the collapse of the Geneva Disarmament Conference. The start was later and the momentum smaller in the beginning. The B-17 four-engine bomber, the Flying Fortress, went into serial production in 1936. The B-24 four- engine Liberator came off the drawing board in 1937 and entered service in late 1939.106 In early 1939 Congress appropri- ated $300 million to increase the Army Air Corps from 1,700 to 5,500 planes.107 In 1940 Congress voted $11 billion for general rearmament. U.S. aircraft production that had been as low as 437 planes in 1934 jumped to 2,195 in 1939, to 6,000 in 1940, and eventually to 96,000 in 1944.108 Increasing the U.S. armed forces had dual benefits. It brought the United States out of the Depression and it showed any potential aggressor that it would face resistance. The expenses were financed through government credits. Supporting overseas democracies still had to jump the hur- dle of the Neutrality Act. Roosevelt convinced Congress and the general public that by helping Britain and France and being prepared at home, the United States could maintain its neu- trality and keep out of the war. The Neutrality Act was amend- ed in November 1939 to allow deliveries to nations at war. American industry, as in World War I, could employ people, reap profits, and through that, support the democratic princi- 205 ple. The development of the United States as a first-rate eco- nomic world power could continue. Foreign deliveries had to be on a cash basis. Britain sold assets such as Argentine rail- ways, South African gold holdings, and domestic gold reserves to pay the bills. In foreign politics the U.S. administration turned a blind eye to the British occupation of Iceland in May 1940 while all the time condemning the Axis grabs of European real estate. Secret staff talks were started with Britain after the fall of France. Three senior U.S. officers visited Bomber Command in August. 109 Capital Royal
