At 50 percent effi- ciency, i.e. bombs hitting the target, a square mile needed seven tons and eight hundred inhabitants needed one ton. All Harris had to do was do the soldier's thing and follow orders. Just in case the instructions were not clearly understood, Portal followed them up with a memo to Bottomley the next day stressing that the aiming points were to be built-up areas and not, for instance, dockyards or aircraft factories.117 On 29 October 1942 this was followed up with a directive from the Air Ministry to all RAF home and overseas commands on what could and could not be attacked in enemy occupied countries and what could be bombed in German, Italian, and Japanese home territories. The list of restrictions in enemy occupied countries is understandably long and ambiguous. The instructions on enemy home territories comprised one single paragraph and said: Bomb everything and particularly morale. 118 Improvements were coming and it would have seemed fair to let Peirse prove his mettle as commander. Instead he was replaced by a man who had shown since his early military career that he was a singleminded soldier who would follow orders, stick with them, and implement them beyond any sec- ond thoughts.
