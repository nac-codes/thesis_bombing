oup, in case the target could not be found to drop bombs on "any good looking built-up area" instead of bringing them home, "to get at least some sort of benefit out of the sortie."119 As early as 13 October 1940 Churchill had voiced his satisfaction with the Foreign Office for turning down a Red Cross offer to investigate German and British bombing. 120 He was afraid Britain would fare worse and bombing would have to be discontinued. Sinclair, the minister for air, had suggested that the less-qualified bomber crews should drop their bombs from greater height.121 On 31 October 1940 Churchill told Portal that the morale of the Italian people should be considered a military objective.122 The pronounce- ments on area bombing continued into 1941 when the chiefs of staff endorsed a memo from Trenchard to Churchill recom- mending German morale as a target. They proposed attacks on transportation because railway facilities are always located in big population centers. By hitting them Bomber Command would swat two flies with one stroke. German morale would soon break; last but not least because it was inferior to British morale. 123 One should of course not assume that all these British lead- ers were relishing the thought of their enemies' blood. An hon- est attempt had been made to identify vital targets in the German war industry. The Ministry of Economic Warfare had specified among many other targets the U-boat engine works of MAN in Augsburg, the spark plug factory of Bosch at Feuerbach, and the ball-bearing factories at Schweinfurt. If all these factories could have been 100 percent destroyed, as the MEW assumed Bomber Command was able to do, the German war effort would have collapsed. But Bomber Command despite the heroic performance of its crews, could not find and/or hit the targets. Upon the urging of Lord Cherwell a new commission under Mr. Justice Singleton was formed to investi- gate how Bomber Command could best be employed. The report, dated 20 May 1942, was
