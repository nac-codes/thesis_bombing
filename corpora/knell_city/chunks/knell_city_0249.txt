concluded in their meetings in 1942 that Bomber Command must be increased. Until that point had been reached the bombing should be concentrated on trans- portation targets. Harris ignored that suggestion and started area bombing with raids on LÃ¼beck on 28-29 March 1942, on Rostock on 23-24 April, followed by the one thousand bomber raid on Cologne on 30-31 May. That raid snuffed the lives of 469 civilians. It seems that while the chiefs of staff wanted the destruction of transport, Harris decided to dispatch as many Huns, as he liked to call Germans, as possible. Always follow- ing orders, of course, and apparently taking advantage of the confusion at the top, rewarding him in due course for not fol- lowing orders. In a memo requested by Churchill, Harris points out what Bomber Command had done to date, the date being 28 June 1942. Correctly he refers to the mine-laying oper- ations, the attacks on German naval and commercial shipping with the resulting reduction in German navy operations in the Atlantic, the deployment of German nightfighters, flak guns, and 3 million men to combat the RAF bombers, the destruction of industries in the German towns attacked, and the destruc- tion of French factories working for the German war effort. The 213 most interesting part of the memo regards the recognition that transport is one of Germany's "most pressing problems."129 But he gives scant information on past and planned attacks on this target system. German reaction and reprisals to the first mass area raids was swift but rather anemic. The Luftwaffe had no strength in the west. It launched small raids on British places which had little or no defenses. In late April and early May 1942 Exeter, Norwich, and York were bombed. In the second raid on Exeter three hundred civilians were killed. After Rostock, Bath was hit, but then again the Luftwaffe losses were too high. What has been called the (German) Baedeker Raids were abandoned. Britain could sleep quietly again. On 22 Sep
