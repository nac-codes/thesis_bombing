materials and overseas produced planes, the gasoline, and the bombs to Britain would take enough personnel to man four army divi- 215 sions. 135 To transport the 11/4 million tons of 100 octane aviation fuel would take 154 tanker loads away from the fuel supply coming by convoys to Britain. 136 The most significant document for what bombing was meant to be was sent to the War Cabinet from the chiefs of staff committee on 3 November 1942 under file C.O.S. (42) 379 (O).137 It was signed C.P. leaving little doubt the author was Charles Portal. The fourteen page script lists the old arguments that the German war industry must be destroyed. The number of German cities had been increased to fifty-eight and the ton- nages to be dropped were now 90,000 tons per month by December 1944. This was written in November 1942. By earlier estimates of 1942 the bombing campaign was to end the war in six months. The most brutal aspect of the document is paragraph sev- enteen: "Civilian casualties are estimated about 900,000 killed and 1,000,000 seriously wounded." Twenty-five million Germans would be rendered homeless, i.e. about 25 percent of the German population at the time. The document apparently passed without any comment on the human losses through the chiefs of staff and through the Cabinet. This aspect of killing civilians continued with Portal until after the war when he declared the then known number of 600,000 killed as inciden- tal losses in an address to Winchester College in late 1945.138 Evaluating the viscount's statements and deductions one can find some strange inconsistencies in his November 1942 submission: Appendix I: The 58 German towns house 17.5 million people. Paragraph 17: 25 million Germans would be dehoused. Were the Allied bombers to attack more than the fifty-eight towns? Even assuming that the towns would be 100 percent destroyed, the figures do not add up. In paragraph six he says that the German bombing attacks were examples of inferior techniques, n
