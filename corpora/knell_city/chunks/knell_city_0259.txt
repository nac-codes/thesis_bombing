the time. The Butt Report had shown how inaccurately the four-engine bombers placed their bombs. With the help of the OBOE system, a Mosquito could place its load within three hundred feet of the target. When the Danish Resistance requested destruction of the Gestapo head- quarters in Copenhagen, the Mosquitos did the precision job with minimal damage to the surrounding area. Similarly, they hit a diesel engine fac factory in Copenhagen on 27 January 1943 with the loss of only one aircraft. Mosquitos mined the narrow Kiel canal causing problems in supplying the northern end of the Russian front and the passage of ore ships coming from Sweden. Another successful raid was flown on 27 May 1943 at dusk when eight Mosquitos destroyed 90 percent of the Zeiss Works at Jena and, most notably, killed only seven persons.150 In the end Bomber Command had ten squadrons of Mosquitos and used them effectively for precision, diversion, and nui- sance raids. In other words, the RAF had a tool from mid-1942 onward that allowed them to hit what they wanted. Harris gives scant credit to the capabilities of this revolutionary aircraft in his "Dispatch on War Operations," causing the air staff in their comments on the dispatch to rectify that fact.151 The question arises, why was Bomber Command not equipped with more Mosquitos to perform a precision strategic campaign which would have destroyed German industry without the heinous losses of innocent civilians? Certainly the cost to the British war effort would have been much less. Since accuracy of bombing was better, fewer bombs would have been required. A Mosquito had two air crew, a Lancaster seven; the Mosquito was a wood covered plane, the four-engine bombers needed scarce aluminum; radar signals are absorbed by wood but reflected by metal. Harris defended his neglect of the Mosquito bombers with statements that many more Mosquitos would have been needed to deliver the same loads as the heavies.152 Had he ever considered the greate
