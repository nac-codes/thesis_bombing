hundred aircraft. Noteworthy raids of the time were the destruction of the Eder and MÃ¶hne dams on 16-17 May. A bouncing bomb had been developed to skip over the water until it hit the dam, where it sank and exploded at a set depth. It was a raid of immense bravery by the crews involved. Of the nineteen planes dispatched, eight did not return, putting the raid into the same class as the MAN-Augsburg raid months earlier. Over 1,200 people, again including many foreign work- ers, drowned in the flood waves rushing down the valleys. But the main damage was consequential because German hydro dams from that time onward were only kept half full, reducing the generation of badly needed power. Another raid had very tragic consequences. On 15-16 July the Pathfinders missed the Peugeot motor factory at Montbeliard, France, by seven hundred yards causing the bombers to hit the workers' houses instead of the factory; 123 Frenchmen who undoubtedly thought the war was over for them were killed and 336 wounded by their former allies. 154 In a similar raid on the Renault factory at Billancourt in March 1942 the French losses were 367 killed and 341 badly injured.155 Including the missions into occupied Western Europe, over 24,000 Bomber Command sorties were flown between early March and end of July 1943 from which over one thousand air- 223 craft did not return.156 Most of these losses occurred over the Ruhr which caused Harris to call off the attack on the German industrial heartland. The Ruhr continued to function until the end of the war, albeit under tenuous conditions. The next major operation of Bomber Command was the battle of Hamburg from 24 July to 3 August 1943. It was a full success from Harris's point of view. The battle was fought together with the Eighth USAAF which blasted the city dur- ing daytime. The gory details of that operation need not be repeated here. There is ample literature in both English and German which describes how 50,000 civilians died.157 Four majo
