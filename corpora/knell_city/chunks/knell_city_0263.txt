famous memo  224 To DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II 225 No. 22, had been obliterated by precision attacks, it would have been finis Germaniae. One must ask again: Why were there no more Mosquitos produced and employed and why did bombing civilians seem the only solution? On 17-18 August 1943 Peenem체nde, the German rocket research center, located at the Baltic Coast, was attacked by 596 aircraft. A feint raid by other aircraft had drawn the German nightfighters to Berlin. The main raid was a full success and caused many months delay in the start of the rocket cam- paign.158 Unfortunately again, of the approximately eight hun- dred scientists and workers killed, about five hundred were Polish or other foreign workers. Of the attacking aircraft forty were lost, mainly because Berlin is not too far distant and the Luftwaffe realized quickly where the action was. For the first time German nightfighters participated that were equipped with schr채ge Musik (literally, inclined music), cannons that could fire obliquely upward from the fighter. The RAF bombers, when attacked from below, had no defense in that direction. A few days after Peenem체nde, Harris returned to the area bombing technique and tried to tackle Berlin. On 23-24 August, 727 bombers flew to the German capital. Forty did not return, i.e. 7.9 percent, which proved too high a loss rate. The marking had been poor and the raid was a failure. The next two raids on Berlin were equally unsuccessful and Harris abandoned for the time being the battle of Berlin. But other German cities such as Mannheim, N체rnberg, Hannover, and Kassel were severely damaged in the coming months. Italy was also not forgotten and the northern Italian cities had their share of raids. Churchill had specifically approved Portal's plan of 1 December 1942 which called for 4,000 tons of bombs to be rained on Italian cities. The plan also foresaw a daylight raid on the Palazzo Venezia, Mussolini's home and office.159 It was realized in Lond
