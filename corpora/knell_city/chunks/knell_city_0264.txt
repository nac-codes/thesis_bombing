December 1942 which called for 4,000 tons of bombs to be rained on Italian cities. The plan also foresaw a daylight raid on the Palazzo Venezia, Mussolini's home and office.159 It was realized in London that Italy was never in a position to wage a war against the Western Allies. The situa- tion worsened when Mussolini declared war on the Soviet Union and sent troops to the Eastern Front. After Italy entered the war in 1940, the Mediterranean had become a major theater of war. The formidable Italian navy, particularly its submarine fleet, was feared by the British.

Food rationing was not introduced until 1941 after the first food riots had occurred at Carignola in January of that year. 160 Italy which had only 2.7 percent of the world's manufacturing capacity, contin- ued on a peace basis to keep its population happy. Between January 1940 and April 1943 Italy manufactured only 10,545 aircraft.161 In the Macchi C-202 it had a first-class fighter, but only 1,500 were ever produced.162 There was no flak to defend the cities and only a rudimentary civil defense organization. The RAF had no problems in attacking Italian cities by day or night. Southern Italian cities were bombarded from Egypt and Malta. Bomber Command stationed in the United Kingdom flew 1,800 sorties to northern Italian cities and dropped about 3,300 tons of bombs. Losses were sixty-six air- craft or 3.7 percent, well within the 5 percent rate accepted by Harris.163 By September 1943 the raids had reduced Italian industrial production by 60 percent.164 About 10,000 Italians had been killed in the bombing campaign between June 1940 and September 1943.165 Distribution of goods had broken down in southern Italy.
