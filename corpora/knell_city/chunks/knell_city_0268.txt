cess of the directive. The experts should have read Douhet's book. As it turned out German fighter numbers increased dramatically. In 1943 over nine thousand single-engine fighters were produced.171 To keep fighting, the American air force leaders returned to the less defended targets in the occupied countries. But here a  228 To DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II new problem arose. Bombing marshalling yards, U-boat pens and factories, even with the best intentions, caused losses among the friendly populations. The workers were warned to stay away from these places. But here again, the experts disre- garded the realities of life. Twenty-five thousand Frenchmen worked for the maintenance of the German submarines in the French Atlantic ports. The factories of Phillips in Eindhoven Holland, and the factories of Schneider Creusot, Peugeot, and Renault in France employed thousands more. The men had to work to make a living. They could stay away a few days, but not extended periods in anticipation of a raid which might or might not come. Although, no doubt, the occupied nations wished a demise of the German occupiers, once their places of work were destroyed so was their livelihood. As a result, there were posters printed in France which showed Roosevelt as "assassin."172 Two major raids were on Rotterdam on 31 March 1943, where 400 were killed and on Antwerp on 6 April 1943, with 2,000 dead. Many other Western European cities were attacked. Some of these raids did real damage and at least engaged the German fighters and flak. From 1943 onward the Eighth USAAF could deliver substantial tonnages of bombs. In 1942 it was mostly France which received the loads; 1,681 tons or 96 percent of the total. In 1943 Germany received 27,152 tons, France 17,977, Belgium 1,162, Norway 1,497, and Poland 358.173 But as we shall see later, this was only the beginning. The raids were all purportedly strategic to damage the German war effort and above all of precision nature. Unfortunate
