A total of sixteen missions were flown to Berlin ranging in dispatched aircraft from twenty-two Lancasters providing a spoof raid for the assault on nearby Magdeburg on 21-22 January 1944 to the 811 mentioned above. Most raids involved 500 to 700 bombers. Despite the difficul-  232 To DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II 233 ties, there was damage in the city.

He was right, panacea target bombing did not make the Germans throw in the towel. Harris's superiors all the way up to Churchill let him continue the area campaign, seemingly convinced that the strategy would eventually work. While the battle of Berlin raged, many other cities were vis- ited, partly to divert the German defenses and partly because the Air Ministry wanted them attacked to avoid a general recovery of German industry. Harris even laid on a raid on the ball-bearing town of Schweinfurt with 734 sorties on 24-25 February 1944. The Eighth had pummeled the town the day befor
