avoid a general recovery of German industry. Harris even laid on a raid on the ball-bearing town of Schweinfurt with 734 sorties on 24-25 February 1944. The Eighth had pummeled the town the day before with 266 B-17s, but this time under long-range fighter escort, probably P-51 Mustangs available since December 1943, to avoid a repeat of the disaster of 17 August 1943. Harris was right, the Schweinfurt raid was not a success.180 Other cities hit were Leipzig twice, Stuttgart three times, and Frankfurt four times. All of these raids were major operations causing sub- stantial damage but also losses to Bomber Command. The worst raid was on Nürnberg on the moonlit night of 30-31 March 1944 in which 795 bombers participated and 95 were lost, 11.9 percent of the force dispatched. It was a controversial raid, not only because it caused little damage to Nürnberg, but because there was suspicion that the Luftwaffe fighters had been tipped off.181 Was there a mole at High Wycombe? During the period of November 1943 to 31 March 1944, the RAF bombers had flown about 29,500 night sorties delivering about 78,500 tons of bombs on targets in Western Europe and losing 1,117 aircraft in the process.182 In January 1943, during the Baedeker Raids on Britain, the BBC German broadcast had warned us that for every pound dropped by German planes, British bombers would drop one ton.183 The Baby Blitz had dropped 2,000 tons on Britain in four months. The 78,500 tons dropped by Bomber Command at about the same time do not come anywhere near the figure of 4 million, as extrapolation of this boast would indicate. Allied planning for storming the shores of Western Europe had taken concrete forms by early 1944. It had become obvious that Germany was not to be defeated with the available bomber forces. Neither the RAF nor the Eighth USAAF had enough resources to bomb German centers continually. The report prepared by the Air Ministry on 22 September 1942, predicting that 4,000 bombers attacking f
