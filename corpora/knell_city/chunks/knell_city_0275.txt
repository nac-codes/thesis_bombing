s. Neither the RAF nor the Eighth USAAF had enough resources to bomb German centers continually. The report prepared by the Air Ministry on 22 September 1942, predicting that 4,000 bombers attacking forty-two German towns once per month over a six-month period would cause German surrender did not work out. Bomber Command could not even repeat its most effective raid, the battle of Hamburg. There were about 4,000 bombers in Britain and Italy, but weather, target finding, German defense, and crew problems had not been factored into the optimistic planning of the experts. The Allied army and navy leaders had, of course, never accepted Bomber Command's predictions. "Overlord," the codename for the Allied landing in France, was pushed onward despite the resources that were spent on the bombing war. There were also political considerations. If Germany col- lapsed while there were no Western Allied troops on the Continent, the Russians would walk right to the shores of the Atlantic, with nobody to stop them. Age-old Russian designs for an ice-free access to the high seas, and the more recent desire to subject Europe to Bolshevism, would become a reali- ty. Without doubt Churchill must have remembered the predicaments of 1919 when he, as minister of war, tried to stem the Bolshevik tide. Instead of Hitler, there would be Stalin as the master of the Continent.  234 TO DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II The army and navy commanders could point to a success- ful landing in Italy, although thanks to Hitler's Atlantic Wall they could expect considerably more resistance on landing in France. Like the Westwall (the Siegfried Line) the Atlantic Wall was nothing but a hastily constructed string of bunkers and gun emplacements around the major Atlantic ports. The disas- trous Dieppe raid had proven their worth, but more so by faulty planning of Combined Operations than by the strength of the fortifications. Many a Canadian soldier paid the ultimate price for this folly. The raid
