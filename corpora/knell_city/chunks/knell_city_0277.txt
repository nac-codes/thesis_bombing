ms. Hundreds of raids were flown day and night against railway yards, from Orl√©ans to Lille and as far east as Aachen in 235 Germany. Despite little Luftwaffe resistance, many raids were as inaccurate as before. One of the first, on 9-10 April on the railway yard of Lille, cost the lives of 456 French people.185 Two-thirds of the freight cars in the station were destroyed but many bombs fell on nearby houses inhabited by railway per- sonnel. There were other raids that were successful and did not cause any losses. Zuckerman had been asked prior to the railway campaign to estimate the possible losses to the friendly civilians living near the targets. Based on sixty-nine installations to be hit, his estimate was 12,000 killed and 6,000 wounded.186 Air Ministry estimates had placed the figure at 40,000 killed and 120,000 wounded. Zuckerman states that actually about 10,000 were killed. This seems a low estimate when compared with the total of 65,000 French civilians alone killed by Allied bombing in the entire Second World War. Perusing the Bomber Command War Diaries one cannot escape the observation that the most effective raids and least costly on civilian casualties were the ones that were carried out by Mosquitos entirely or with Mosquitos as target finders. The campaign was a full suc- cess and is credited with preventing German reinforcements from arriving in time at the No e Normandy beachheads. Bomber Command had dropped 42,000 tons of bombs on thirty-three assigned targets. The Eighth USAAF had been assigned forty-five targets but attacked only twenty-three, dropping 11,600 tons.187 The losses to Bomber Command were 203 aircraft out of a total of 8,800 sorties, i.e. 2.3 percent, well within Harris's limit of 5 percent. The referred to source claims that the French and Belgian populations did not resent the loss- es in lives and chattels. Consulting other sources one must put a big question mark behind that statement. As made clear to the bombers at the beginni
