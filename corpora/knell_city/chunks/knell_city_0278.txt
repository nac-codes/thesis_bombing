and Belgian populations did not resent the loss- es in lives and chattels. Consulting other sources one must put a big question mark behind that statement. As made clear to the bombers at the beginning of the cam- paign, they were free to continue with their raids on Germany when possible. Bomber Command flew about 15,000 such sor- ties, almost twice the number of sorties flown on the "Overlord" targets. Cities such as DÃ¼sseldorf, Karlsruhe, Duisburg, and many others were attacked. On 26-27 April 1944, Harris even launched another panacea raid on Schweinfurt; equally unsuccessful as the previous ones. The  236 To DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II Eighth also continued with daylight raids against German tar- gets but all under heavy fighter protection. The diversion of the bombing from Germany to the railway targets had allowed German industry and defense to recover. The supply of the Wehrmacht in the east and the west still functioned. Once the Allies had successfully landed on the beaches in Normandy, the bombers were directed to ground support operations. They attacked German troop concentrations. ammunition dumps, gun emplacements, and airfields to pre- vent airborne reinforcements from arriving. Many a French town was ravaged and places such as Caen, Le Havre, and Lorient afterward looked like bombed-out German towns. Bomber Command again could not always hit its assigned tar- gets for the same reasons and excuses as before. Harris was proved right when he said his command was not equipped and trained to perform tactical work when his bombers dropped their loads on Canadian troops. The worst destruc- tion was rained on the city of Caen. German troops were sup- posedly entrenched in the city, and together with massive artillery fire were to be pulverized. In actual fact there were few Germans in the city and the pulverizing left as dark a blotch on the RAF as Warsaw and Rotterdam had on the Luftwaffe. Caen was a mistake. It was a tactical raid gone wrong. Y
