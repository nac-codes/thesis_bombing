the launching sites being built earlier. About one hundred of them had been constructed with the help of 40,000 French and other foreign workers. But doubts about the existence and danger of the V-1 had been brought up by Lord Cherwell and thereby delayed instructions to Bomber Command to destroy the launching sites and the adjacent storage facilities. The cam- paign against them started on 16-17 June after a number of these bombs had landed in southern England. From then on it was a steady effort to wipe out this danger. The Doodle Bomb, as it was called, was a slow-moving pilotless aircraft with a jet engine. Its flight path and destination were programmed into it at the launching base. It carried a one-ton bomb load, had a ceiling of 3,000 meters, and a range of 250 kilometers with a speed of 500 kilometers per hour. By no stretch of the imagina- tion was it a weapon which would turn the fortunes of war. It could be spotted on radar and shot down by antiaircraft guns and by faster fighters. It had a high failure rate, but it also had the advantage of being cheap to produce and was of an unso- phisticated design. Over 30,000 of these flying bombs were produced, mostly by slave labor in underground factories. About 20,000 had been fired between 12 June and 3 September 1944 when Allied ground forces overran all the launching sites in northern France. But launchings continued until 29 March 1945 from sites located further back. Southern England and London in particular were hit about 10,000 times, i.e. 10,000 tons of high explosives came down and 5,864 people were killed.192 Later  238 To DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II Antwerp became the target after it had been captured by the Allies. About 4,000 V-1s were sent there and together with the later-appearing V-2 killed about 3,000 people. Next came the V-2 rocket, first launched against London on 8 September 1944. This weapon was completely different from the pilotless aircraft described above. It was a liquid f
