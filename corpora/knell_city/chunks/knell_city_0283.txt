and partisan movements in German-occupied territories received Allied and Soviet support. But in Germany the conspirators not only had to struggle against their internal enemies, but against their external ones as well. The aerial campaign to make the Germans rebel continued and increased to Armageddon proportions. The bombing not only cost hundreds of thousands of German lives, it also cost the lives of many young Allied airmen. The failure of the Western Allies to support the German resistance movement and the failure to recognize a chance to make morale bombing pay through this support has, to the best of my knowledge, never been investigated by any historian. There is no limit in hypothetical human and material savings that would have occurred had the war ended shortly after 20 July 1944.  240 To DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II WÃ¼rzburg certainly would not have come up for destruction at High Wycombe meetings. The bomber commanders were given their freedom again from SHAEF in mid-September. The day-to-day tactical bomb- ing was to be continued by the British and American tactical air fleets which had been assigned from the beginning of Overlord to the invasion forces. They were comprised mostly of fighters and medium bombers.
