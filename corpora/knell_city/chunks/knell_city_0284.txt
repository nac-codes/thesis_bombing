success. 198 While the bombing of strategic and tactical targets went on in northwestern Europe, the Fifteenth USAAF under General Eaker based in Foggia, Italy, continued the campaign to demor- alize the people of the Balkan states. Bulgaria, which had never formally declared war on the USSR, suffered numerous raids. A total of 40,000 bombs fell on that country killing 1,720 citi- zens.199 Sofia, bombed on 14 November 1943, was further raid- ed on 10 January 1944 by 143 B-17s, and the following night by 44 RAF Wellingtons. Raids continued, culminating in a raid by 300 heavy U.S. bombers on 4 April 1944, when 1,400 railroad cars were destroyed. But the majority of the bombs fell on Sofia itself.200 Bulgaria was invaded by the Red Army in September 1944 and shortly thereafter changed sides and fought the Wehrmacht on the side of the USSR. Similar raids with even bigger losses to civilian lives were flown against Bucharest and Budapest. Bucharest was attacked eighteen times killing 4,111 civilians.201 The twenty-seven attacks on the Ploesti oil fields cost 700 lives. In all about 7,000 Romanians were killed by Allied bombs. American bombing policy had changed. The main target had become the civilian population and any damage to strate- gic targets was a bonus. Whereas only a year before the 241 American leaders had scoffed at this inhuman British attitude, they now adopted it themselves. After all, morale bombing had been part of the AWPD-42 plan. The people in the Balkan cities did not react as predicted. Whereas before the bombings there was a sympathetic undercurrent for the Allies among the populations, fed by the Voice of America and BBC propagan- da, there now was a hostile feeling and the Americans and the British were called hypocrites. It was the same as had hap- pened in France. Why was it necessary to kill friendly civil- ians? Why this ruthless smashing of cities? The Russians made big propaganda gains out of this by pointing out that their air force was on
