utch understanding for the bomb- ing of their citizens and their homes must have talked to the wrong people. Now the Americans, as had already happened in the Balkans, were falling into this same category. The public, both in Britain and the United States, was told by the "free" press that only military installations were being targeted. American public opinion and ethics could not have it any other way. But the bombers being frustrated in their promise to win German surrender singlehandedly could see that their meth- ods did not work.
