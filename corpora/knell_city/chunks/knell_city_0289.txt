to let Harris go, many an innocent civilian life would have been spared and WÃ¼rzburg would not have been destroyed. The targets outlined in the instruction of 25 September were legitimate and important installations. Without oil and transport the German war machine could not function. Marshalling yards and oil refineries occupy large areas and the bombers, both U.S. and British, had by that time the means to locate them in good or bad weather and hit them with preci- sion. Because of the land they required, they were located out- side of city centers and the exposure of civilians was therefore much smaller. After the bombers were released from SHAEF, a Combined Strategic Target Committee was formed which took over from all previous institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Warfare in giving instructions on which targets to bomb. Zuckerman said it lacked expertise and experience. Zuckerman particularly criticized the qualifications of the committee members, pointing out that in civilian life they had no training to scientifically evaluate the targets and the weight of attacks required. The members came from such diverse fields as publishing, breweries, tobacco firms, and coal mer- chants.213 However the primary targets, oil and transport, were assessed correctly by the committee, although there was noth- ing new about this. What was wrong with the committee was 245 that on a weekly basis it produced lists of alternate targets to open the above referred to back door. Spaatz and Portal should have dissolved the committee after it had identified oil and transport and the other two manufacturing targets and insist- ed on implementation of these recommendations. After the war it became clear from captured German documents that the shortage of fuel for the Luftwaffe became insupportable.214 In interviews after the war Speer said that had oil been persist- ently attacked, presumably during the entire war (not only from late 1944 onward), Germany would have been rendere
