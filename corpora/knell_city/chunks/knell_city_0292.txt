in such as Duisburg, Essen, and Dortmund. Farther afield, Stettin and Kiel received their share of bombs and when they ran out of big and important indus- trial towns, the bombers crushed smaller places such as Heilbronn, Bonn, and Freiburg. German civilian casualties were mounting and one of the worst raids was on Darmstadt on 11-12 September 1944, when more than 12,000 people were killed by 226 Lancasters. Bomber Command also continued to fly tactical raids on French Atlantic ports still held by German troops, on V- weapon sites, and as far away as Norway. On 28-29 October 247 1944, an attempt was made on the U-boat pens at Bergen. The pens were not damaged but fifty-two Norwegians were killed by stray bombs. In summary, Bomber Command, while attacking tactical targets for Overlord, also flew 4 percent of its raids in 1944 on oil targets, 10 percent on transport, but 19 percent on urban areas.218 Between mid-August and the end of the year the bombers made 72,881 sorties and dropped 265,708 tons of bombs; 696 aircraft did not return.219 The total bombload dis- charged by the British bombers flying from the United Kingdom was 525,500 tons in 1944.220 Many of the American bombs fell on U.S. investments in Germany. The Opel/General Motors factory at RÃ¼sselsheim west of Frankfurt and the Ford factory at Cologne took heavy hits. How U.S. shareholders reacted to the losses of their for- eign holdings is not reported. The distillate works of Leuna and Poelitz had been built with earnings of Standard Oil, New Jersey and Royal Dutch Shell in the late 1930s when these mon- eys could not be exported because of German foreign currency restrictions. The plants operated unimpeded for the German war effort until late 1944.221 There are no reports how U.S. banks viewed damage to the plants on which there were still outstanding loans. The total tonnage of bombs discharged by the Eighth USAAF over enemy held territory was 387,500 tons in 1944.222 Adding Eighth USAAF and RAF Bomber C
