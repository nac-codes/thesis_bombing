December 1944 to March 1945, it is apparent that attacks lasted only two and a half to three seconds, during which the fighter blasted the tar- get over a flight path of 600 to 700 yards.225 No doubt these fighters wreaked tremendous damage. From October to year- end 1944 there were over 2,000 raids on German railway sta- tions and marshalling yards; 1,700 trains were attacked, 3,000 locomotives, 7,600 freight cars, and 4,400 passenger cars were destroyed.226 Although it was not always easy shooting; many German trains had flat cars attached with antiaircraft guns on them. It was not only Germans who were the victims. In their enthusiasm it appears that USAAF fighters had attacked trains, houses, and civilians in German-occupied countries. The director of USAAF Intelligence pointed this out to the director of operations of the Eighth USAAF. The deputy com- mander of the Eighth, F. L. Anderson, replied that some pilots may have been over-zealous and that in the future they would only strafe Germans.227 What is mentioned nowhere in English literature and Allied archives is how many farmers were attacked in their fields, the total of civilians killed in passenger trains, the indi- viduals chased on isolated roads, and other such exploits. One pilot boasted about having killed twenty-five cows.228 Their endeavor to hit anything that moved in Germany, as they had been instructed by their superiors, went so far as to strafe a col- umn of marching POWs, killing eleven officers and wounding forty-two.229 Bombing and shelling innocent POWs, their own com- rades, happened a few times. One of the most cruel was when on 23 December 1944, fifty-five U.S. officers and twenty-six enlisted men were killed by the Eighth USAAF as it bombard- ed the POW camp Stalag XII near Limburg.230 The magnitude of the fighter campaign can be appreciated when one peruses Carter and Mueller's Combat Chronology 1941-1945.231 Thousands of these planes were sent over  250 To DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN
