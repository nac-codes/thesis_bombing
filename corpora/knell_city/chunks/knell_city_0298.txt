of the USAAF and RAF crews were allowed to return to Britain, whereas others were interned and maintained their planes, which were returned after the war to their respective countries. Switzerland suffered the most from the bombers. Like Sweden, it had difficulty maintaining its neutrality. It protest- ed vehemently about overflights and bombings of its territory. There were about 6,500 intrusions into Swiss air space by Allied and Axis planes during the war.242 Like Sweden, Switzerland had commercial interests to defend which includ- ed earnings from the transit rail traffic via Switzerland between Germany and Italy, and imports from Spain via Switzerland to Germany. While in Swiss territory these trains were supposedly safe from Allied bombers. But not always, because both the RAF and the USAAF deliberately attacked trains and railway stations within Switzerland. The attacks were part of the Allied political and military maneuvers to force Switzerland to reduce trade with the Axis Powers. In January 1945 alone, 53,000 tons of coal were shipped via Switzerland to Italy and about 700 tons of clothing, food stuffs,  252 To DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II and textiles went the other way to Germany; all safely outside the vulnerable Brenner route through Austria. Though the RAF had stopped bombing Switzerland after 1940, the USAAF continued to violate and purposely attack Swiss air space. On 24 April 1944, one hundred U.S. bombers flew over Schaffhausen causing both human and material loss- es. The Swiss were defenseless against such numbers. Stragglers were shot down and many planes were forced to land. In the end there were over one hundred U.S. bombers and their crews interned in Switzerland. Men and machines remained there until the war was over, in adherence to inter- national laws. The price paid for such correctness was bitter for a country that wanted no part of the war: about sixty people were killed, about one hundred wounded, and at least six hun- dr
