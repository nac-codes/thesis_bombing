r clarifies at least the tenor of orders issued. My own experiences and those of members of my family certainly vouch for the bestiality of these fighter attacks. More than once did I have to dash into the ruins of WÃ¼rzburg to avoid the bullets raking the street I was on. My aunt and cousin were on a field path near Krefeld when an RAF fighter came down and hammered them. They survived except for a few scratch- es. It is these aspects of the fighter bombers which require a special mental effort to dispatch to the annals of history which this study has set out to achieve.

The report caused a stir in Britain and in the United States, but was soon forgotten and Vera Brittain was ostracised in her country for being unpatriotic.
