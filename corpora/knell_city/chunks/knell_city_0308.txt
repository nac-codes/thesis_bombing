Japanese bombers were all twin- engine, had a maximum bomb load capacity of one ton, a max- imum ceiling of 35,000 feet, a range of about 2,000 miles, and no more than four machine guns for defense against fighters.259 The enemy the Japanese air forces was facing was far superior in equipment, numbers, and training. Between December 1941 and August 1945 the Japanese air forces lost 38,000 planes. The Americans lost 8,700.260 The U.S. Naval Air Force with its carrier-based planes had been instrumental in the demise of the Japanese navy at Midway, Coral Sea, and other battles. The employment of the U.S. Army Air Force in defeating Japan did not reach a plan- ning stage until 1943.

In March 1944, General MacArthur and Admiral Nimitz submitted campaign plans for the conquest of Japan. Both plans foresaw a supporting role for the USAAF.

The USAAF generals from Arnold downward were unhappy about the assigned role and convinced General George Marshall that the B-29 was unsuitable for tactical work. But the Nimitz Plan was adopted and at the same time the Twentieth USAAF was cr
