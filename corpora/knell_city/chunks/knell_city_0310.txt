from Burma to later establish itself in southern China. Since 1941, before Pearl Harbor, General Chennault had organ- ized the Flying Tigers to help Chiang Kai-shek. The impact of these operations was minimal. The USAAF generals in Washington with General Arnold at the top were unhappy with the assigned roles and results. Arnold had spearheaded the development of the B-29 bomber from 1939 onward. It could operate at 35,000 feet and carry a bomb load of ten tons over a distance of 4,200 miles.265 It came too late for the war in Europe, but after many setbacks it was ready in numbers for bombing Japan, which had been the original thought behind its creation. With its high ceiling it was out of the range of Japanese flak and fighters.266 All that was needed was an air base close enough to Japan to bring this super plane into action. When Arnold had the Committee of Operations Analysts study where Japan was vulnerable, they had few facts to go by. The Japanese had been very circumspect in keeping their industrial and infrastructure build-up away from foreigners' eyes. The limited information available came from Japanese publications, reports of visitors to Japan, and such farfetched sources as insurance policies of British fire underwriters. As in Britain earlier in the war, the knowledge and judgement of sci- entists, industry leaders, and high-ranking civil servants was engaged to recommend how bombs could best be employed to defeat the enemy. And, in this particular case, how to defeat him without making costly landings on each of the main Japanese islands. It was the landing aspect that frightened U.S. planners, because they expected Japanese resistance until the last piece of real estate had been conquered. The potential losses of these amphibious operations based on the island hopping campaign in the Pacific were estimated at 500,000 lives. This is the figure which was quoted many times by President Truman after the war as justification for releasing the two atom
