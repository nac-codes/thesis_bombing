the Japanese have been warned, or should there have been a demonstration blast in a remote area? Was the A-bomb necessary at all since the Japanese government had already put out peace feelers to the still neutral USSR? Or was it a means for the United States to impress the Russians, the next adversary just below the horizon? These questions will be debated for a long time to come. Stalin had officially informed the Potsdam Conference on 28 July 1945 that the Soviet government had been approached by the Japanese gov- ernment about a peace proposal originating from the Japanese emperor.282 There would still have been time to stop the bomb- ing on 6 August. American military leaders were mostly against letting the bombs go, because they knew Japan was about to surrender. Arnold, Spaatz, and LeMay, in particular, agitated against it. From their point of view, as commanders of large fleets of bombers, this is understandable. If one single bomber could do what normally took hundreds of aircraft, there would be no need and future for most generals. It would take 210 B-29s delivering 2,100 tons of bombs to produce the same effect as the one bomb from the Enola Gay, the B-29 that released the bomb on Hiroshima. 283 The Twentieth USAAF had a list of cities selected for the atomic bombs. In order of sequence they were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Nigata, and the Kokura Arsenal.284 Mr. Stimson, the minister of war in Roosevelt's cabinet, had visited Kyoto  268 TO DESTROY A CITY > between the wars and insisted that it not be destroyed. Hiroshima took its place and Nagasaki was bombed because the assigned target for the second bomb could not be clearly located. The bombing of Japan was a gruesome affair. As in Europe, many civilians were killed. The estimates run from 330,000 to 900,000 Japanese dead and up to 1.3 million injured.285 The two atom bombs destroyed two entire cities, but the conventional bombing had flattened an area thirty times larger.286 When it came time to sign the armi
