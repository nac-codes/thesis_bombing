t them down. In World War I, the "masterbomber" of World War II, Arthur Harris, was in charge of a flight of RFC fighters to hunt first Zeppelins and later Gothas day and night. In 1916 over 19,000 soldiers were stationed in southern England in antiair- craft services including 110 aircraft which otherwise would 271  272 To DESTROY A CITY MILITARY AND CIVIL DEFENSE have been available on the Continent.1 By 1918 there were 304 antiaircraft guns, 415 searchlights, and 11 fighter squadrons of a nominal 24 aircraft each deployed in the Greater London area alone. A further 176 guns, 291 searchlights, and 5 fighter squadrons were stationed in the Northern Defense Area 2 These considerable forces would face single sortie Zeppelins and later a maximum twenty-eight Gothas per raid. Conversely, when the RFC and the Independent Air Force started to retaliate against the German hinterland, considerable German military forces were withdrawn from the battlefield The British bombers had the advantage of a much shorter route to Germany from their French bases and they could raid much larger area in western Germany. The Germans had to locate and spread their fighters and antiaircraft guns over a greater number of cities than Britain. By 1918 there were 896 guns, 454 searchlights, 170 fighters, and 327 barrage balloons deployed in Germany. Over 24,000 soldiers were required to man these defenses. Of the nearly 4,000 bombing sorties dis- patched to German territory in 1917 and 1918 the German defense brought down about eighty Allied planes.3 Evaluating the above statistics one can see the futility of the military planning and conclusions. Both countries claimed cor- rectly that a bomber offensive would draw enemy forces from the battlefield. The offensive forces, i.e. aircraft, required to invade enemy territory were a fraction of the opposing defense forces. But both countries had to station about the same num- ber of men and war material on their home soil to defend themselves. In o
