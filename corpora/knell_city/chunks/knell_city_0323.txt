Swiss border. There was no such belt. When war broke out, there were sufficient anti- aircraft guns and listening devices to station them around many western German cities. But that was all. There were experimental radars (one of them called the "WÃ¼rzburg" for some unfathomable reason), with a maximum range of forty miles. There was no tie-in to the fighter squadrons. The German fighter formations were not specifically organized to defend the Reich. Their main task, as for the rest of the Luftwaffe, was to provide tactical support for the army. All major nations had modern fighters by 1940-41 in the following numbers: France, 400; Italy, 150; Japan, 500. Facing each other at the start of the battle of Britain were: the Royal Air Force, 600; the Luftwaffe, 820.6 These aircraft were single-engine monoplanes, which could reach speeds up to 400 miles per hour, could climb up to 20,000 feet within five to six minutes, and had up to eight machine guns mounted in fixed positions in their wings. Their ceilings were maximum 40,000 feet, i.e. about 10,000 feet higher than any bomber could climb.7 They were praised for certain fea- tures, which supposedly made them superior to other designs and which were played up by the media during the war. The Japanese Zero fighter had great maneuverability, but lacked armor plate to protect the pilot, and its fuel tanks were not rub- ber lined (self-sealing). A tracer bullet penetrating into the fuel tank made it blow up. The first Spitfires had only .303" machine guns, whereas the first Messerschmitt Me-109 had three 20mm cannons. The Spitfires could turn more easily, but when the shells of the Me-109 hit there was considerable destruction. In other words, there were limitations in design which could not be overcome without reducing another feature. As the war progressed, improvements were made to make fighters more effective. In 1944 the first jet fighter, the 275 Messerschmitt Me-262, made its appearance. With its superior speed it wa
