feature. As the war progressed, improvements were made to make fighters more effective. In 1944 the first jet fighter, the 275 Messerschmitt Me-262, made its appearance. With its superior speed it was feared by the USAAF bombers. When it was realized that daylight bombing was too risky and costly, the RAF in October 1939, the Luftwaffe in August 1940, and the USAAF only later in the Pacific War in 1945 had to switch to night raids. Both Britain and Germany created in short order nightfighter squadrons, which consisted of heavier aircraft, mostly twin-engine types. With the help of ground- based radar stations and control centers, they were directed towards the bombers; onboard radar devices brought them closer, but the final engagement was visual. There are numer- ous accounts by bomber and nightfighter crews describing the viciousness of these fights. As the war progressed, sophistication of electronic devices to detect, approach, and destroy an enemy aircraft became leg- endary. Gone were the days when Britain considered, at the recommendation of Lord Cherwell, hanging steel nets seeded with aerial mines from barrage balloons hoping that, like a fly going into a cobweb, the enemy aircraft would run into these defenses.8 The methods of deceiving the enemy's electronic defenses also reached proportions which were at times bril- liantly scientific, at times just plain smart. The Hamburg raids in July 1943 were successful because the German radar stations had been put out of action by aluminum strips scientifically dimensioned to interfere with the wavelength of the German radar sets. Tons of these strips, called Window, were released from the bombers and floated to earth. On the other hand, when the German ground controllers switched one day from males to females, because Bomber Command had been giving misleading instructions to German fighters with transmissions from Britain, Harris had expected it and had German-speaking ladies on the air immediately.
