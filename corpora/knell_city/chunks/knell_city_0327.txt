he government of the USSR requested the opening of a second front in Western Europe from 1942 onward to relieve the pressure of the Wehrmacht on Russian territory, the Western Allies argued that the bomber offensive represented such a front. It was claimed, as in World War I, that the bombers tied large numbers of men and war material to the defense of the Reich. There is no doubt that fighters and anti- aircraft guns were drawn from the East. In 1944 only 22 percent of the Luftwaffe fighter force was stationed in the East where it was desperately needed to combat the ubiquitous Soviet ground attack plane Sturmovik. In the West, 60 percent of the Luftwaffe fighters were engaged to fight the RAF and USAAF bombers and 18 percent were deployed in the Mediterranean theater.14 Equally hard felt in the East was the assignment of the 88mm flak gun to the defense of German cities. The 88 was used in the East as an antitank gun against the overwhelming number of Soviet tanks. As for the dislocation of manpower, the picture was equal- ly grim. Over 750,000 men were engaged in the defense of the Reich. They included the fighter pilots and their maintenance staff. Manning the antiaircraft defenses was alleviated by the employment of 30,000 Luftwaffe auxiliaries, school-age boys sixteen to seventeen years old,15 and 50,000 Russian POW's who thereby escaped the deadly conditions of the POW camps.16 There were further untold numbers of Croats and members of other nations who were friendly to the German  278 TO DESTROY A CITY MILITARY AND CIVIL DEFENSE cause. These boys and men were trained to fulfill the work of gunners, ammunition carriers, etc. They were effective under the command of a few German soldiers who were not suitable for frontline duty. (Quite a few of the USAAF bombers lost in the 1943 Schweinfurt raid were shot down by high school classmates of mine who had been delegated to the flak posi- tions there. Three of them were killed in the raid.) German cities protected
