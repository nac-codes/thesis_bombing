The most extensive ones were taken in Britain and Germany. Other countries like France, Italy, and Japan did not spend much money to protect their citizens. As an example, the destruction of a part of Rotterdam by a small German bomber force was only possible because there was not enough fire- fighting equipment and no civil defense.17 In Germany, preparations for civil defense began shortly after World War I.
