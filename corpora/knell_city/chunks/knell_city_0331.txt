civil defense forces, to construct public shel- ters for hundreds of people, to construct big water ponds in public places (as reservoirs for the firefighters), to purchase and tear down houses to make fire escape routes, to correct damages caused by air raids, and to help other bomb-damaged cities.21 Civil defense underwent a steep learning curve during the war in Germany. The above mentioned water ponds and fire breaches were installed based on experiences of other cities. They saved thousands of lives during the main raid on Würzburg. People jumped into the ponds to escape the heat and sparks. Separate instructions and conditions were established for the German railways, the postal system, and certain important 281 industries. The idea was that these institutions should function normally as long as possible prior to a raid, even at risk to the workers. Not all areas of Germany were treated equally when it came to protecting the citizens. Rural areas were assumed safe from air attacks and no provisions were made. As the bomber offensive intensified it became clear that the in-house shelters were mostly inadequate and a program was begun of building bunkers of heavy reinforced concrete above and below ground. Cities in the Rhineland and Ruhr industrial area were selected to have bunkers for up to 20 percent of their population. Some bunkers had capacities for up to 30,000 people. Cities far away from the RAF bomber bases and cities with little or no indus- try were excluded from the bunker program.22 Würzburg, for example, did not have a single bunker air-raid shelter. Instead, underground passages of the medieval fortifications were opened and offered good shelter. But there were few of them because the wall and moat system of Würzburg had been demolished in the late nineteenth century. The bunker program had to compete for concrete and other building materials with the construction of the coastal defens- es along the Atlantic, the repairs to bomb damages, reloca
