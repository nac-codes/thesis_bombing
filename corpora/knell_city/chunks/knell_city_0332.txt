nineteenth century. The bunker program had to compete for concrete and other building materials with the construction of the coastal defens- es along the Atlantic, the repairs to bomb damages, relocation of industries underground or to safe areas, and last but not least with the construction of seven headquarters for the FÃ¼hrer. One located in Silesia and never finished consumed 257,000 m3 of concrete alone.23 Another part of civil defense was the evacuation of non- working citizens, particularly children, to areas considered safe. The welfare section of the Nazi Party orchestrated the evacuation of 5 million Germans, i.e. 5 percent of the Reich population of 100 million in 1939, to locations in eastern and southern Germany, including to the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (now the Czech Republic).24 Dehoused citizens were also transferred to such places and frequently, in the lat- ter stages of the war, experienced a second dehousing as the bombing moved deeper into Germany. In Britain, civil defense was also taken very seriously. As in Germany, it was shortly after World War I that the British gov- ernment felt Air Raid Precautions (ARP) had to be instituted.  282 To DESTROY A CITY MILITARY AND CIVIL DEFENSE As Prime Minister Baldwin stated in 1932-the bomber will always get through. In May 1924 an ARP subcommittee was formed in the Home Office under the chairmanship of Sir John Anderson, best known for the shelter named after him. The air staff of the Ministry for Air provided the committee with esti mates that London could receive 450 tons of bombs in the fire seventy-two hours of a new war. This information was based on extrapolation of World War I facts and assessment of late technological developments. It was estimated that in the first month of a new war London would suffer 25,000 fatalities 2 The committee concerned itself with disposing of such an unheard of number of bodies and estimated that 20 million square feet of lumber would be needed per month
