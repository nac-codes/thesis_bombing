our more precious personal belongings. clothing, and food to places in the country and to what we thought were bombproof shelters in the city. Not all of them turned out to be. As an example three boxes containing about fifty pieces of antique fayence pottery, some of them four hun- dred years old, did not survive in a "considered safe" air-raid shelter next to the "Dom." My father's valuable and precious collection was lost. The loss became a bit of a mystery because years later, during reconstruction, no potsherds were found in the rubble. Had the boxes disappeared before the raid? 9 GAS IN AERIAL WARFARE ropping gas-filled bombs on civilians did not happen between 1914 and 1945. Douhet's theory of aerial warfare identified gas, after high explosives and incendiaries, as a means of knocking out the enemy's population. Gas bombs were to come last in an air raid for two reasons: first, to kill the inhabitants of the attacked city and second, to prevent outside help from arriving. Trenchard did not mention gas as a weapon to be carried into the enemy's hinterland in defense of the United Kingdom. Gas and chemical weapons were never used in the bombing campaigns of both world wars. Only the Regia Aeronautica stooped so low as to bombard enemy troops with gas, in the Abyssinian War in 1935. In Article 23 of the 1899 Hague Convention, twenty-six major powers had agreed to outlaw the use of asphyxiating gases in warfare. At the end of World War I, gas was established as a weapon in land warfare in the same manner as the bomber, the subma- rine, and the submerged sea mine; all outlawed or at least attempted to be outlawed by the major powers which had con- vened twice at Den Haag. In 1925 Britain, Germany, the United States, and other gov- ernments signed a protocol at Geneva prohibiting chemical warfare and biological weapons. Germany ratified the protocol in 1929 and Britain in 1930. The United States never ratified it. It left the back door of gas warfare open for the
