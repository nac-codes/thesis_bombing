prohibiting chemical warfare and biological weapons. Germany ratified the protocol in 1929 and Britain in 1930. The United States never ratified it. It left the back door of gas warfare open for the United States. But all U.S. presidents after 1925 pledged that they would abide by it. The concern of the governments at the time was biological 287  288 To DESTROY A CITY GAS IN AERIAL WARFARE weapons. Gas as a tactical weapon was a known quantity from World War I. Even if used against civilians, as proposed by Douhet, the antidotes were scientifically available. Biological warfare, such as bacteria or simply poisoning water supplies of cities, was unknown, and its devastating effect was greatly feared. After World War I there was little doubt that gas and bio- logical warfare would be used in any future conflict. Douhet in his treatise on aerial warfare, predicted in 1927 that it would only take eighty to one hundred tons of gas to eliminate London or Paris.1 Both sides of the past conflict experimented with gas. The German army, as stated in the Versailles Treaty, was not to have any capability of chemical warfare, but as with other provi- sions of the treaty, clandestinely worked on on and developed methods to drop gas from the air. German research between 1925 and 1928 established that it would take thirty-four liters to poison a hectare from the air. Parameters were established as to what different heights, wind velocities, and other factors would do to the success of an aerial gas attack.2 To ensure a supply in the event of a new war, Weimar Germany cooperat- ed with the Soviet Union under the auspices of the Rapallo Treaty to build a poison gas factory at Samara.3 British experiments and industrial development of chemi- cal weapons were not far behind the German effort. The RAR participated actively and funded the expenses with 7 percent from its annual budget. What exactly was done cannot be ascertained, because some files such as PRO: AIR 9/123 are still close
