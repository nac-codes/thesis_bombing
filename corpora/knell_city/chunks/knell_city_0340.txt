ort. The RAR participated actively and funded the expenses with 7 percent from its annual budget. What exactly was done cannot be ascertained, because some files such as PRO: AIR 9/123 are still closed and will be until 2017. One wonders what there is still to be hidden. The attitude of the British military was that after the slaughter in the trenches in World War I, gas was a "humane" weapon because it had killed fewer soldiers than shells and bullets, and had been a good catalyst in attacking enemy positions. From the records and publications available it would appear that Britain was ahead of Germany in research in gas and chemical/bacteriological warfare. In 1934 the Cabinet approached the Medical Research Council to work on biologi- cal weapons.4 The scientists refused on moral grounds. By 1937 289 it was recognized that such weapons would be a two-edged sword, because they would contaminate the attacked areas for years and, because of the interdependence of the European countries in peace time, there was the danger of the bacteria coming home to the delivering country. That both sides were serious about the threat of gas aerial warfare is manifested in the effort to provide all citizens with gas masks. We were never told against what types of gases the masks would protect us and what we should do in the event of a gas attack. Could one smell the lethal gas? When would one put the device on and when would one take it off? Was there to be a public warning like the sirens indicating enemy aircraft approaching? The planning was sketchy at best and the saving grace was that, fortunately, there was never a need. The records reviewed also say nothing about how areas contaminated by chemical weapons would be decontaminated to make them livable again. Probably there was no money for that and the military did not think beyond the point of deliv- ering their own gas onto the enemy. The civil authorities were similarly unconcerned. When World War II broke out, both sides
