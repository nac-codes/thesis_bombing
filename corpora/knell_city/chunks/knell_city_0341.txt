money for that and the military did not think beyond the point of deliv- ering their own gas onto the enemy. The civil authorities were similarly unconcerned. When World War II broke out, both sides waited for the other to strike first because neither wanted to start such a hor- ror. It is said that Hitler was against gas warfare because he had been poisoned in the trenches at the end of World War I. Churchill considered using gas against German troops if they invaded the Isles.5 To what degree that would have hurt the local population cannot be ascertained from the files. It would have been a tactical application. The use of gas any- where was subject to Cabinet approval.6 The type of gases con- templated were phosgene and tear gas contained in bombs up to 500 pounds. Blenheim, Lysander, and Battle squadrons were trained in early World War II to deliver gas attacks. About six- teen squadrons were involved, i.e. about 150 planes. About 120,000 bombs of 30 to 500 pounds were in stock as of 1 January 1941. Further planning involved the poisoning of German crops, animals at pasture, and the defoliation of woods. Pellets con- taining bacteria were to be dropped. After a number of training accidents the scheme was cancelled.7 It was also found that  290 To DESTROY A CITY GAS IN AERIAL WARFARE reducing German food supply would require a considerable number of bomber missions. A compound was available in 1942 which could, with up to three pounds, destroy an acre of crop, but it would take 7,000 sorties to destroy one sixth of one German crop year. There would also not be enough chemicals available to sustain the campaign.8 More important for Churchill and his bomber leaders must have been the consid- eration that a campaign against German crops would reduce the area attacks and their expected impact on German morale As the war went on and the cruelty developed correspond- ingly, further means of poisoning enemy civilians and their countrysides were invented. Both sides, o
