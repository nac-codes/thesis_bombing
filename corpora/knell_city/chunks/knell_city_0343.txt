irst. Churchill ordered 291 500,000 of these 4-1b. bomblets from the United States, where there had been production facilities for this type of weapon for some time. 11 The main British research and development effort seemed to have centered around anthrax. The island of Gruinard off the Scottish coast became a proving ground and is to this day still contaminated and uninhabitable.12 Anthrax spores if inhaled would kill a person within one week. Cherwell, Churchill's sci- entific adviser, strongly recommended it in February 1944 as a weapon against the Germans.13 That it was never used depended on short supplies and the moral qualms of starting a new form of warfare for which the public neither in the United Kingdom nor in the United States appeared to be prepared. The official position of the British government was still that the enemy would have to start it. There were plans for how retaliation would be implemented. Operation Instruction No. 79 of 24 January 1945, superseding earlier plans, comprised two alternatives: Plan I: To fit into the existing bombing policy. Plan II: To make a maximum separate effort against German population centers. Gas weapons available were: 65-lb. Mustard gas bombs and 500-lb. Phosgene bombs. Plan I would employ 75% Mustard and 25% HE Plan II would employ 50% Mustard, 25% Phosgene, and 25% HE Advance notice would be: Plan I, 48 hours; Plan II, 7 days; but only strictly after enemy gas action had been verified.14 The operation instructions were updated when there was fear that Hitler, realizing that there was not the faintest hope for even a negotiated peace, would use gas and/or chemical warfare as the ultimate weapon. German planning, research, and development appear harder to trace. It seems that most records were destroyed at the end of the war. British intelligence knew that the Germans did little in this field. There were fears that the V-1 flying bombs would carry a biological warhead containing botulinus toxin, eight ounces of
