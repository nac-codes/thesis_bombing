Harvey which had one hundred tons of 100-lb. mustard gas bombs on board together with other explosives. It exploded and the gas spewed into the water and the air.17 The raid has been called the second worst air attack on Allied shipping after Pearl Harbor. The confusion was immense as could be expected after such a massive raid. Soldiers arriving at Allied field hospitals and Italians arriving at the city hospitals were treated for shock and the obvious wounds. But after a few days, many victims showed strange signs of skin blisters, and vomiting, and many of them died. The port was under British administration and it refused to divulge bills of lading. American hospitals soon found out that the victims died from mustard gas and treated their other 293 patients accordingly. The British refused to accept the fact of gas and treated their patients as normal air-raid victims. The Italians were kept completely in the dark and left to their own medicines. A total of 617 Allied soldiers were affected by the gas and 84 of them died. The exact Italian civilian losses were never established, but are estimated to be considerably higher.18 Did the Luftwaffe really drop gas bombs and start a new phase of warfare? Nobody at Bari knew for sure. Cooler heads prevailed and after a bomb casing was recovered from the har- bor and positively identified as having contained mustard gas of U.S. origin, the mystery unfolded. The shipping into Bari of gas was kept secret and Churchill, in particular, forbade any mention of it to British troops and media. It was feared that world opinion, and especially the Germans, would make a propaganda campaign out of it. Fortunately, aerial gas warfare in Europe was avoided. It would have been a mega-disaster because most countries were not equipped to deal with it, not even Britain or Germany, where gas masks of doubtful value had been issued to the people. However there were plans by the U.S. War Department for use of biological weapons against Japa
