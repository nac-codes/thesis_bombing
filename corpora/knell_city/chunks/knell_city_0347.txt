But fortunately, gas was never used because both sides were afraid of it and feared the retaliation. 10 LOSS OF CULTURAL ASSETS Türzburg, as most German cities, had a rich cultural her- W itage ranging from Celtic-times to modern art and arti- fact. By the morning of 17 March 1945 most had been destroyed. Bombs had blasted them to pieces or the fire storm had consumed them. A few miraculously survived the inferno and it is a pleasure to see and enjoy them today more than fifty years after their narrow escape.
