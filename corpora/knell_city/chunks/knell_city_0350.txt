Ger- man sculptor. Due to the foresight of owners and museum directors, most of his works in wood or stone survived. What did not survive were the busts, each about one meter tall, of the three Franconian/Irish apostles considered safe in the crypt of the Neumünster Church. Fire entered the crypt and consumed its treasures. Fortunately exact replicas were carved after the war. As Würzburg was a very Catholic place, with many mon- asteries and a university, the institutions of church and higher learning suffered immeasurable damages. The university clin- ics on the outskirts were only lightly damaged and could attend to the thousands of wounded citizens. Most other uni- versity institutes were destroyed, although the historical place where Professor Röntgen discovered x-rays in 1895 escaped damage. What cultural assets in private homes were lost will never be known. Würzburg, of course, was not alone in suffering cultural losses due to air raids. Bombing continued until late April 1945 a few days before VE Day. The last major area raid took place  298 TO DESTROY A CITY LOSS OF CULTURAL ASSETS on 14-15 April when Potsdam, the city of Frederick the Great of Prussia, with all its palaces, the famous "Garnisonskirche," the archives, and much more became the target of RAF bombs. But not only the RAF and the USAAF succeeded in destroying valuable treasures. The Luftwaffe, when it was still capable of dropping bombs, was equally effective. When the railway station of Cologne was attacked and some damage was sustained to the adjacent world famous cathedral, Göring in his blustering manner announced that: "If they bomb our cathedrals, we will bomb theirs." He promptly ordered a raid on Canterbury Cathedral. Other buildings of fame destroyed by the Luftwaffe were the London Guild Hall and the Coventry Cathedral, and raids were launched on historic Bath. Further damages in London were inflicted on the National Gallery, the Tate Gallery, and the British Museum Buckingham Palace
