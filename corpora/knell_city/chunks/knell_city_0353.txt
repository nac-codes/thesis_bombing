withdrawn their troops from the center to indicate their concern for the Eternal City. Churchill's reply via the foreign secretary to Roosevelt's plea was "to continue to bomb Rome remorselessly."8 The under- standable military reasons were that Rome was a railway center.  300 To DESTROY A CITY LOSS OF CULTURAL ASSETS Roosevelt's particular concern was damage to the Vatican He proposed that bomber crews be so instructed and be pro- vided with maps to avoid bombing the Holy See including the four churches in Rome, which per the Lateran Treaty are apos- tolic property. Air Marshal Tedder, the most cosmopolitan and intellectual of all RAF commanders, strongly favored caution in bombing Rome.9 But George Marshall and Eisenhower con- sidered only the military value of the marshalling yards and on 19 July 1943 at 11 A.M.
