the treasures, not the destination, and called it a typical Nazi art robbery. Of course, the removal of cultural assets by occupying powers is a fact of warfare. GÃ¶ring was not alone in this, although after the war his "acquisitions" received the most publicity. From antiquity to this day there is war booty in the hands of the victors but claimed by the vanquished. Many treasures are still in the British Museum, the Hermitage, or stored somewhere out of sight. In that category are works removed from Germany after the war by not only common soldiers of the Western Allies but by very senior officers.12 The Russians sent in whole brigades to plunder East Germany. It is interesting to note that the Japanese are reported not to have touched the art treasures of the territories they occupied.13 Although it would appear that the leaders of World War II 301 cared little about their enemy's cultural assets and their preser- vation for mankind, there are some outstanding exceptions. The Luftwaffe did not bomb Leningrad's famous Hermitage, St. Isaac's Cathedral, St. Paul's Fortress, and other buildings, although Hitler had given orders to flatten the city. When in late 1944 Hitler wanted Paris "burning" the Luftwaffe "could not do it." Kesselring pulled German troops out of Rome and Florence to avoid these places being bombed and shelled. The British effort to save enemy art treasures is not very pronounced because Churchill, Portal, et al, gave Harris a free hand in conducting the area campaign. Harris's statements during the war indicate that he did not waste any thoughts on the subject. The most active in saving art treasures were Americans from the president down to museum directors and people of scholarly inclinations. In the autumn of 1942 William Bell Dinsmoor, the president of the Archeological Institute of America arranged that Roosevelt be made aware of the danger to these cultural assets.14 Roosevelt reacted quickly and before long, in August 1943, he approved the
