nt of the Archeological Institute of America arranged that Roosevelt be made aware of the danger to these cultural assets.14 Roosevelt reacted quickly and before long, in August 1943, he approved the founding of the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas, ACPS for short. It consisted of church leaders such as Cardinal Spellman, rep- resentatives of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, professors of Harvard, and many others. They prepared lists and atlases of the locations of art works, not only in Europe, but also in Asia including Japan, China, and Korea.15 The information was passed on to the military who promised to use it and to instruct the soldiers accordingly. Of particular interest are the efforts of Secretary of War Stimson and Assistant Secretary John McCloy. Kyoto, the beau- tiful Japanese temple town, was in first place as destination for the first atom bomb. It was bombed several times, because it had been ascertained that a number of cottage industries had been established in its precincts. When Stimson heard about the atom bomb plans he vetoed them. He had been to Kyoto in 1926, had an appreciation of Japanese history and culture, and, aside from his personal feelings, listed adverse world opinion if the ancient capital of Japan would be destroyed.16 Kyoto was  302 To DESTROY A CITY 11 spared. A similar fate was experienced by Rothenburg ob der Tauber in southern Germany. Since medieval times it has been a walled city with houses, churches, towers, and fortifications built at that time.
