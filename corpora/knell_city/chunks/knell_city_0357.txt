It was estimated that 6,000 bombers could de- stroy many enemy assets and could kill, as indicated, 900,000 303  304 TO DESTROY A CITY PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF BOMBING of the enemy nation. But that still left about 99 million Germans with which to deal. To hope that a majority of them would force their government's hand, particularly under the well-known conditions of a dictatorship, borders on naivet√©. A dead civilian was too dead to rebel and a dehoused civilian too busy to rearrange his life. For help, the dehoused person had only the government to turn to and would certainly not wish to destroy that last resort.

It was against the warnings and input from people in influ- ential positions that the campaign was started and continued.
