t assessed whether the men were psychologically capable of enduring the stress. It was not in the planning of the bomber campaign that human nature might suffer from flying and drop- ping bombs on the enemy. To staunch that oversight the RAF invented "Lack of Moral Fibre"(LMF); a catch-all phrase to deal with anything from obvious cowardice to nervous breakdown. Little is written and said about LMF because the applica- tion of it was and is, today in particular, considered controver- sial.9 Airmen were judged LMF if they frequently aborted their missions for any possible reason, if they did not get over the target but bombed at the fringes, if they dropped their bombs into the North Sea to improve the maneuverability of their plane, or if they openly refused to fly. An escape from the rig- ors of bombing missions was to land in neutral Sweden or Switzerland and be interned till the end of the war. The pun- ishment of airmen for LMF was severe. Their flying badges could be removed on parade and they could be assigned to menial jobs such as cleaning toilets; all in front of their com- rades. Officers were required to resign their commissions and lower ranks could be drafted to work in coal mines.10  306 To DESTROY A CITY PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF BOMBING The stigma of being found LMF was a burden on the con- science of all flying personnel. LMF occurred more frequently in Bomber Command than in the other RAF commands. To avoid hysteria the Air Ministry kept casualty figures secret, but looking around on the base would show what was happen- ing.11 Badly shot up planes returning with dead or wounded comrades on board or planes not returning at all put a strain on the crews. What made most members of Bomber Command not succumb to LMF was self-discipline expressed in doing one's duty, or with many the very fear of being declared LMF. but in most cases it was the daredevil attitude that it "cannot happen to me."12 Seemingly LMF was in all RAF personnels' mind, but only 0.2
