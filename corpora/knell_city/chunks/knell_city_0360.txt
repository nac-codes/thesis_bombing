's duty, or with many the very fear of being declared LMF. but in most cases it was the daredevil attitude that it "cannot happen to me."12 Seemingly LMF was in all RAF personnels' mind, but only 0.2 percent of all air crew on the average were ever categorized as lacking moral fibre.13 In Bomber Command one third of LMF occurred when the crews were still in the Operational Training Units, before they were exposed to the flak and nightfighters.1 No other air forces had procedures in place to deal with the psychological effects of flying and bombing. There are some accounts in literature telling how USAAF crews, under the stress of losses over Germany during daylight raids, com- plained. However, how these instances were handled is not reported. When by July 1944 there were 94 and 101 of Eighth USAAF bomber crews interned in Sweden and Switzerland respectively, rumors circulated that the crews had chosen an easy way out and enjoyed a comfortable life in the neutral countries. General Spaatz ordered an inquiry which dispelled most of the charges.15 As mentioned above, the psychological damage of bomb- ing also effected the bombed. The German raids on London in World War I caused some mass reactions. Some people demon- strated for government action to protect them and their prop- erties. They looted and rioted, they smashed the homes of nat- uralized Germans, and they insisted on retaliation against German cities.16 But there are no reports of individual or mass hysteria. Similarly, bombing of German cities by the Independent Air Force caused apprehension but had no dam- aging psychological effects.

Basically one could expect three
