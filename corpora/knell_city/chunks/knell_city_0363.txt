s also a phenomenon that occurred after air raids. The difference between "mine and yours" became blurred and many survivors helped themselves to goods from damaged dwellings of other people.18 This syndrome developed so far that in the case of Würzburg farmers came into town with their horse-drawn wagons and removed goods which had been brought out of burning houses and were unattended while the owners were looking for transport.19 The least the perpetrators of the area raids might have expected was that the industrial workers would not come back to work. Here again, the assumption was based on undigested thoughts. The German industrial worker in general was glad 309 to have a job after the Depression. They all remembered the time only too well when unemployment reached unbearable levels. There always has been a loyalty to the firm. But most important, the worker needed the pay envelope and proof that he worked in order to receive the ration cards for food and clothing. Men wanted to work and thereby stay with their fam- ilies, because if they did not work, they were drafted into the armed forces. The scientists and planners had not evaluated these facts. During the months of ever-increasing attacks and after the main raid on Würzburg, I experienced a number of psycholog- ical phenomena which are worth mentioning here, because not all of them have been mentioned in literature. In conversation with other survivors they appear to have been a common expe- rience. During and immediately after the main raid I had a severe form of diarrhea. I was embarrassed. My father, who had been in the trenches in World War I, very understandingly explained to me that this was a normal experience for anybody exposed to bomb and shell bursts for the first time. I developed a sense of fatalism about being killed, but I had a tremendous anxiety about being buried alive in an air-raid shelter. After the main raid and after it was clear that we had all survived but had been bombed out, I
