treat RAF flyers caught in Germany in the same manner to stop the raids of Bomber Command. Some gauleiters and in particular Hildebrandt o Mecklenburg wanted the court-martialing of downed Allied bomber pilots in April 1942 following the Japanese example .? But no court-martial of Allied airmen ever took place in Germany. No other U.S. flyers were executed in Japan later in the war, although the Japanese government had issued a law which called for severe penalties for enemy airmen who had bombed civilians.3 In 1942 the bombing war in Germany had not yet reached proportions to enrage the public and/or the government. It was not until the bomber offensive gained momentum that on 28 May 1944 Goebbels published an article in the VÃ¶lkische Beobachter which called for reprisals against parachuted air- men.

The German population did not follow these suggestions and it was officially noted that up to that time their behavior was one of pity and compassion.4 On 3 September 1943, Hitler ordered the transfer of POW camps with Allied airmen into the centers of big cities.5 It could not be done and there was apprehension that it might lead to reprisals against Luftwaffe POWs in British hands. Other gov- ernment and party officials took it upon themselves to issue orders in their jurisdictions on the treatment of downed flyers. Himmler, as head of the German police, ordered that the police should not interfere when a civilian crowd or individuals were about to attack stranded airmen.

The worst incident of official crime against Allied airmen was the shooting by the Gestapo of fifty Allied air force POWs 315 of the seventy-six who
