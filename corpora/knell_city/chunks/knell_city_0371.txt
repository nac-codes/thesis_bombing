figures were based on fifty casualties per ton of bombs, i.e. 36,000 tons of bombs were expected to be dropped or 600 tons per day.15 The majority of the damage was expected in London. To cope with the imagined situation 2.8 million hospital beds were provided and £120 million foreseen as compensation for the victims. The actual events proved different.
