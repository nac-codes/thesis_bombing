THE VICTIMS AND THEIR TREATMENT To avoid the demoralizing effect of bombing on the soldiers on the front lines, the Wehrmacht granted leaves to visit bombed hometowns. The leaves were short and often the sol- dier had to return to his unit before he could ascertain the fate of his family. In Würzburg, where the main raid of 16 March 1945 killed about 5,000 citizens, about 3,000 were buried in four mass graves outside the main cemetery.

The number was too big and the authorities decided to cremate the majority. Funeral pyres up to three meters high were built. The treatment of the bombed out was in the hands of the Nazi Party. When in the beginning of the bomber offensive the police could not cope with the problem, Goebbels and Bormann took it upon themselves to push the party organiza- tion into the breach. It left the party in a non-legal position viz- a-viz Göring's Air Ministry, but no rivalries appeared to have developed, because the rescue and assistance measures worked.

The first major relief action came after the raid on Lübeck on 28-29 March 1942, in which 341 people were killed; yet the industrial
