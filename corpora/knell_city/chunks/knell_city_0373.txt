districts, arranged for emergency relief like hous- ing and food. The first major relief action came after the raid on Lübeck on 28-29 March 1942, in which 341 people were killed; yet the industrial capacity of the city was reduced by only 0.3 percent. The Party took over the relief activities. The government lav- ishly distributed food and other goods to the dehoused people. As a result, several Party officials took advantage of this 319 largesse and enriched themselves. They were tried and con- demned to death.

Many innocents were con- demned based on trumped up or incomplete evidence.17 The flying court-martials were initiated to keep the population in line. No official announcements were made of the verdicts, but the word spread around. The practices continued until the end of the war. The threat of legal action also helped to protect the chattels of people who were killed. The Party took control of them and added them to the goods to be distributed to the needy, such as food, suitcases of clothing, or even furniture. In March 1945, after the raid on Würzburg, the dissolution of law and order had progressed so far that there were no puni- tive actions against looters. But the Party relief apparatus still functioned and within two days, dehoused people were advised where to turn for help. Victims of destroyed city dis- tricts were assigned to villages outside where they were billet- ed temporarily, which in most cases became housing for a long time. Soup kitchens were established in parks where for sever- al weeks meals could be had for any comer at no cost and, above all, no surrender of ration stamps.18 Within days many essential government offices were nominally reopened, although only until the fighting approached Würzburg when complete chaos returned.
