The most important of these offices was the one which issued to the dehoused citizens a paper which confirmed that they had lost their home. With this paper one could obtain, again through government organized insti- tutions, help, ration cards, etc. As an example, the Luftwaffe had several motorized relief truck columns which were sent to bombed cities to provide food, clothing, and medication. The "Hilfszug Hermann Göring" was dispatched to Würzburg and provided such help for about a week. Other organizations tried to get the bombed cities running again.

When a bombed-out person or family had been accommo- dated in housing that had escaped the bombing and which was of reasonable construction and comfort,
