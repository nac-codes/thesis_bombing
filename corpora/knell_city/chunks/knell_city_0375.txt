fallen apart or were razed for safety reasons. When a bombed-out person or family had been accommo- dated in housing that had escaped the bombing and which was of reasonable construction and comfort, there was immediate- ly after the war a new danger of being dehoused. The victori- ous Allies, particularly the Americans, had told us during the war through the Voice of America that their troops would not requisition private homes to house the occupying troops and their families. That turned out to be merely propaganda. Many houses and apartments, where bombed out families and the original owners were crammed into one room per family, had to be vacated with all furniture remaining in place. Notice was seldom more than fifteen minutes. Compensation of victims or their dependents was spotty and slow in all countries affected by the bombing. The Japanese initiated a big effort to help the victims of the atomic bombs, but there was no help beyond immediate assistance for the victims of LeMay's B-29s.20 There was no assistance or even recognition forthcoming for relatives of the 67,000 French civil- ians killed by Allied bombs.21 Similarly, no support for the dependents of 15,000 Belgians, 5,000 Dutch, and 150 Luxemburgers killed by German bombs, V-weapons, and USAAF and RAF bombs. To the best of my knowledge there are no local, national, or international organizations which represent the civilian vic- tims. Governments and victims are not interested. They only want to forget because the war on the home front is a contro- versial subject. There were many heroes among the victims. But even the media showed scant interest. In Germany there was some compensation for losses incurred during the war. In 1952 a law was passed by the Federal Republic intended to equalize the losses between the citizens. It meant that persons who had suffered little or no losses ; were taxed to compensate people who had been expelled from the eastern provinces of the Reich after the war and people
