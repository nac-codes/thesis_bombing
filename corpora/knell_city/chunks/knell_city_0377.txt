terms and conditions of the conventions, the participating nations, despite all the humane clamor, had their own interests in mind and to protect. War itself was not to be outlawed. Only the conditions of war- fare were to be regulated. It meant that a military advantage a nation enjoyed had to be upheld, so not to jeopardize the next conflict. As an example the position paper prepared by the British admiralty on the naval bombardment of coast towns for the 1907 Hague Convention, stresses that a naval power, such as Great Britain with the the strongest navy in the world, could not be restricted attacking its enemies from the sea.1 The paper especially mentions that a short and sharp bombardment of the coast of an uncivilized tribe would convey an unmistakable object lesson from the dominant race. Many states were interested in outlawing naval blockades. Among them Germany which has always depended on feed- ing its population through overseas trade. Britain singularly refused to agree to give up its right for naval blockades during 323  324 TO DESTROY A CITY STRATEGIC BOMBING AND INTERNATIONAL LAW the Second Hague Conference in 1907. Germany in turn refused to have limitations attached to submarine warfare and the use of the contact mine. All powers objected to imposing limits on armaments in general. But all participating nations agreed in 1907 on Article 25 of the Hague Land War Regulations which forbade the bombard- ment of inhabited areas by whatsoever means. It is this article which is quoted by all scholars of bombing and, depending on the interpretation of it, whether it was out- lawed or not. To this day the jurists argue this point. The road to bombing populated areas by aircraft passed the following milestones: The First Den Haag Peace Convention of 1899 forbade the discharge of projectiles from airborne craft for a period of five years. The article was signed by all nations except Britain. The agreement was extended to last until the planned Third Den Haa
