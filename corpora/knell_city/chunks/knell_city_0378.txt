de the discharge of projectiles from airborne craft for a period of five years. The article was signed by all nations except Britain. The agreement was extended to last until the planned Third Den Haag Convention, to be convened in 1914. The extension was signed by Britain but not by Germany during the Second Conference in October 1907. Since the Third Convention did not take place the agreement expired. The outlawing of aerial warfare was defeated at the con- ference of l'Institut de Droit International in Madrid in 1911. The raids on Britain and France by the Zeppelins and later the Gothas ignored Article 25 of the 1907 Land War Regulations.
