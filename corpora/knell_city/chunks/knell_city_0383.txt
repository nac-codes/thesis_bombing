ed strategic area bombing unassail- able. Of all the crimes dealt with by the International War Crimes Tribunal at NÃ¼rnberg, that subject was studiously avoided. Neither the Luftwaffe as an organization, nor its top leaders were indicted for the killing of over 60,000 Britons in the Blitz, the Baedeker Raids, and the V-weapon bombard- ment. In the proceedings it was made clear that the court con- sidered Warsaw, Rotterdam, and Coventry as raids in accor- dance with the conventions.11 In later trials Kesselring and Sperrle were tried on other charges than area bombing of the British Isles. The Allies could have and should have done jus- tice to the victims of their countrymen.

This meant the tribunals could have had the defen- dants convicted on a very simple charge of mass murder, com- mitted by disobeying international law. This seemingly intentional oversight might have caused comments by the public and the media, but by the self-styled rules of the tribunals it would have been legally correct. Convicting the German bomber practitioners would have cast a shadow on the Allied bomber practitioners. Pronouncing the raids on Warsaw and Rotterdam legal made Churchill vulner- able for cancelling Chamberlain's orders and having the RAF start bombing German cities in May 1940. 329 In the conduct of area bombing there were clear infringe- ments on the law.

The transfer of Luftwaffe POWs from French to British custody at the time of the defeat of France in June 1940 was against the Hague Conventions. The intentional overflight of neutral countries by bomber formations on their way to targets in enemy territory and the bombing of targets in neutral coun- tries was against international law. The area bombing of enemy cities is
