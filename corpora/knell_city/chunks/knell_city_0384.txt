neutral countries by bomber formations on their way to targets in enemy territory and the bombing of targets in neutral coun- tries was against international law. The area bombing of enemy cities is only illegal since the Red Cross Convention on the Protection of Civilians in Wartime, signed in Stockholm in August 1948. The mass killings of civilians through aerial bombardment in World War II is still considered justified in the British and American camps, although there are many and loud voices condemning it. Most prominent is the British historian J. M. Spaight who already in 1924 stated that the Declaration of St. Petersburg of 1868 and The Hague Convention of 1899 are broad enough to prohibit the conduct of aerial warfare.12  14 330 CONCLUSION 331 CONCLUSION Why was Würzburg destroyed by Bomber Command in an area raid on 16 March 1945?

The media did not report, except for the raid on Dresden in February 1945, on the progress of destruction of German cities and the at-one- time expected decisive impact of the bomber offensive. After Dresden, Churchill had even called for a reassessment of the bombing in his famous minute to the Chief of Staffs Committee on 28 March. The bombing progressed as planned without consideration of the changed military situation. The destruction of German cities continued until the end of April. Seemingly once the mil- itary machine was moving it could not be stopped. It had a life of its own. There were now all the equipmen
