. The destruction of German cities continued until the end of April. Seemingly once the mil- itary machine was moving it could not be stopped. It had a life of its own. There were now all the equipment and soldiers on hand. It must have been that aspect that made Harris decide to have Würzburg attacked, but there are no records of why No. 5 Group was instructed to strike that city. Bomber Command, as all units of the RAF, kept Operational Records Books, which describe daily activities. The ORB of the headquarters of Bomber Command at High Wycombe does not contain minutes of meetings or abstracts of discussions in the morning meetings deciding which targets were to be attacked the following night. It would appear that Harris, who made the final decisions on all targets, and his staff played their cards very close to their chests. The ORB for 16 March 1945 reports on general issues pertaining to Bomber Command and nothing else.1 This leaves one to guess why Bomber Command chose Würzburg, which was so low on the list of recommended tar- gets. Some of the answers seem to be: 1) The experimental raids of the weeks before the main raid had shown that the city could be easily located with the electronic aids available at the time;2 2) There were no defenses such as flak or searchlights as the experimental raids had also shown; 3) The city was still about 150 kilometers from the advancing armies and therefore there was no danger of hitting friendly troops. Since the bomb- ing campaign was still in full swing Würzburg represented an easy and riskless target. The timing of the attack is strange. If the city had been important for its few strategic installations or for increasing the demoralization of the German population, why did the bombers not come earlier? Was it expected that attacking 107,000 Würzburgers would cause, at that stage of the hostili- ties, a revolt against the Nazis? Würzburg might not have been destroyed had Harris followed the orders of 25 September 1944
