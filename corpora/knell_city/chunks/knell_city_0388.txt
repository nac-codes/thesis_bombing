ethics of them ever since. From the economic point of view they did have an impact. The cost of the bombing in Europe and the Far East in World War II shows staggering statistics. The United States produced 98,000 heavy bombers at a cost of $259,000 for a B-17, $304,000 for a B-24, and $894,000 for a B-29.5 Britain constructed 28,000 bombers at an average cost of Â£150,000.6 Germany manufac- tured 18,000 bombers at an average cost of RM 269,000, and Japan 15,000. The USSR produced 17,800.7 The winner in the production of these aircraft was the United States. It was from the wartime effort of the U.S. aircraft industry that the United States established its leading postwar role as supplier of com- mercial airliners. Another economic aspect of the bombing is that what had been destroyed would have to be rebuilt. The destruction of the German cities helped the U.S. export industry after WWII. The Marshall Plan provided the funds and, as is well known, the credits were all repaid. From the military point of view, area bombing was not a success. It did not cause the collapse of the enemy war effort as promised by the bomber commanders. It could have done that had the campaigns been consistently executed. Though area bombing was to result in the defeat of enemy morale and cause the overthrow of the enemy political systems, that effort did not produce the desired result. What it did produce are appalling statistics of human losses. These victims are the forgotten heroes of the fighting in the first half of the twentieth century. Aside from monuments in places where they are buried, there are no national memorials, no mentions on armistice days, or any recognition of their sac- rifices. German bombs and V-weapons killed 60,595 British  334 To DESTROY A CITY civilians.8 The estimates of German civilians killed vary con- siderably. They range from 410,000, to 570,000, to 800,000.9 In Japan the toll was considerably over 200,000 people killed by the fire raids (nobody knows th
