the period between the wars, had much to do with it. Strategic bombing is best defined as the use of air power to strike at the very foundation of an enemy's war effort-the production of war material, the economy as a whole, or the morale of the civilian population-rather than as a direct attack on the enemy's army or navy. A strategic air campaign almost always requires the defeat of the enemy's air force, but not as an end in itself. While tactical air power uses aircraft to aid the advance of forces on the ground or on the surface of the ocean, usually in cooperation with those forces, strategic air power usually works in relative independence of armies and navies, although its effects may  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 2 Origins, Prelude, Doctrine complement those of a naval blockade-the operation of war most comparable to strategic bombing in its attack on the sources of enemy power. AIR POWER IN WORLD WAR I As with many other aspects of the modern world, air warfare came out of the trench deadlock of World War I. Air power did not break the deadlock alone, but it was an increasingly important factor in the fighting. Specialized bombers were developed. As early as May 1915, the Germans were bombing billets, transportation facilities, and dumps well behind the lines in Russia. And by 1917-1918, planes were being used en masse to support armies, in battles that increasingly resembled those that would take place in World War II. In the fall of 1918, Allied fighters and bombers helped turn the retreats of the Turkish, Bulgarian, and Austrian armies into routs. Aircraft also became important in naval warfare, primarily for reconnaissance but for other purposes as well. While German and British torpedo bombers scored minor successes, aircraft played a more important role in the Allied campaign against German submarines. They actually destroyed only half a dozen U-boats, but proved very effective at spotting them for surface escort ships and forcing them to submer
