orces at home. They pursued two lines of endeavor to overcome the British defenses, introducing airplanes, and new airships that could fly over the British defenses. New Zeppelins that could fly higher were introduced in March 1917. They had lightened frameworks, smaller control cars, and fewer machine guns and car- ried a maximum bomb load of just two tons. They attacked between 16,000 and 20,000 feet, above the ceiling of antiaircraft guns and the fighters that had stopped the earlier attacks, carrying oxygen for their crews. These "height- climbers" flew less often than their predecessors and were hampered even more by winds and weather, but were nearly immune to the defenses. Only two were shot down before the war ended.2 In March 1917 the Germans began sending twin-engine Gotha bombers against Britain. They flew high for planes of that day, over 14,000 feet, and the crews wore oxygen masks. Carrying auxiliary fuel tanks they could just reach Lon- don, but they caused a surprising amount of damage and were a considerable shock to the British. A single attack on June 13 killed 162 people and injured 432 more. The defending planes were old and unable to hurt the bombers, and late-model fighters were hastily rushed home from France. The army's Royal Flying Corps was greatly expanded, while an elaborate organization, the London Air Defence Area, was formed to deal with the attacks. The new defenses shot down enough bombers to stop daylight attacks; the Germans switched over to night bombing on September 3. When the decision to bomb at night was made, it was clearly understood that it was impossible to hit precise targets at night. The Germans would engage in what would be called "area bombing" in World War II, attacking a whole city or at least a  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 4 Origins, Prelude, Doctrine section of it, rather than a specific installation. There was no question of hit- ting targets that were of military importance, or directly related to the war
