trying to break the morale of a civilian population through bombing was impractical. (In World War II, Churchill was to take a very different position, as we shall see in Chapter 2.) Any damage to civilian morale from the air attacks of World War I was tem- porary and minor, but the attacks made a permanent impression on many British leaders. By contrast, many German officers who had hoped that bombing England would have a terrific impact were disappointed; they were disenchanted with the whole notion of strategic air attack. Others, however, realized that the attacks on Britain had had one very useful effect-they had tied down very con- siderable British resources. By the end of the war 384 planes, 706 searchlights, 480 antiaircraft guns, many barrage balloons, and a large number of men were pinned down to a defensive role at home. That made the Gotha and Giant raids worthwhile, from the German point of view. For a small expenditure of resources on their part, they had diverted a far greater British effort in 1917-1918. Whether the effort put into Zeppelin attacks had been worthwhile was more doubtful. Building Zeppelins, producing hydrogen, and manning their bases-which re- quired a great many men-was very expensive, and unlike the Gothas and Giants, the Zeppelins were being diverted from a potentially far more useful job. Carry- ing fuel instead of bombs, they could have patrolled over the Atlantic well west of the British Isles, locating Allied convoys for the U-boats.3 Some features of the German strategic air campaign were repeated in later strategic air campaigns: the failure of "precision" attacks aimed at specific targets of undoubted military 5 importance was followed by more indiscriminate attacks employing incendiary weapons and by efforts to evade defenses by flying at night or at unprecedentedly high altitudes. The main effectiveness of the attacks had not been in causing fatal damage to the enemy's war effort but in leading him to tie up resources in
