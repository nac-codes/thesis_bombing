de to begin strategic bombing; the French, in 1915-1916, had tried it on a small scale, sending planes deep into German territory to attack war plants at Essen and Ludwigshafen. But opposition had made them switch to night bombing in 1916, and they had been disillusioned with the results. When the British formed an Independent Air Force in 1918 to bomb targets well inside Germany, the French were unhappy, fearing that such attacks would merely inspire German retaliation against French cities-a reaction that reappeared in 1939-1940. The British went ahead anyway, and when the armistice came they were getting ready to bomb Berlin, using three of the new four-engine Handley-Page HPV/1500 bombers. (A similar plan to bomb Moscow during the intervention in the Russian Civil War-in 1919-was aborted when British officials lost their nerve.) The Independent Air Force was not very large-it mustered 122 planes-nor very effective. It dropped only 550 tons of bombs, on enemy airfields and railroad targets. But the Germans com- mitted 240 planes to counter it; like the German raids on Britain, the Indepen- dent Air Force tied down considerable forces in defense. Sir Hugh Trenchard, who commanded it, remained convinced that its attacks had done much to undermine German resistance.5 Trenchard, a man of commanding personali- ty, became the chief of the Air Staff during the RAF's formative years and helped to focus it toward strategic operations, at least in theory.  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 6 THE RAF BETWEEN THE WORLD WARS Up to the mid-1930s, the RAF's commitment to strategic bombing remained largely in the realm of theory, and rather confused theory at that. In the 1920s another world war seemed a remote horror, even to most professional military men. The general world view of British officials was embodied in the "ten years rule," which based defense planning on the assumption that no great war need be feared in the next ten years. The rule remained in effect until 1931.
