British officials was embodied in the "ten years rule," which based defense planning on the assumption that no great war need be feared in the next ten years. The rule remained in effect until 1931. The atti- tudes of the people at large, and their political leaders, were affected by an almost paralyzing fear of another war. In 1924, even Churchill remarked that in another war civilization would perish. This was a common view in the 1920s and 1930s. preserved for posterity in William Cameron Menzies's remarkable movie Things to Come. There was no need for nuclear weapons to render war "unthinkable"- that idea was already widespread in the period between the world wars. The general public, as did air power enthusiasts, believed that in another great war cities would be obliterated by an avalanche of high explosives and poison gas. (Fire, the real killer in air attacks during World War II, somehow escaped atten- tion.) People thus achieved the considerable feat of imagining that World War II would actually be worse than it was! Such fears, and a sincere revulsion against war-genuine pacifism was far more common between the world wars than it is today-were a strong influence in favor of appeasement in the 1930s. In its day-to-day work, however, the RAF did little that was relevant to anything it was liable to do in a major war. It executed a policy of "air control" in the more disorderly corners of the British Empire and its mandates-notably Iraq, Somaliland, and the Northwest Frontier of India-bombing rebellious tribesmen into obedience. Air control proved an effective means of policing the empire and enabled the British to economize on troops. This proved relatively cheap in both British and native lives, but it was an undemanding task that did not prepare the RAF for what it would face in the 1940s. Preparation for a major air war, such as it was, was dominated by Trenchard's ideas. He insured that the RAF would be overwhelmingly bomber oriented, even though its bo
