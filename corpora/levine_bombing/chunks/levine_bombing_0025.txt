porter, Flying Fortress, stuck. In another sense the name jibed neatly with the justification most often given for building the B-17; defense against invading enemy fleets. This was not en- tirely disingenuous; the Air Corps brass believed, until well into 1942, that high- flying formations of B-17s could deal with enemy warships at sea. They did not entirely hide its main task; in October 1935 Foulois's successor, Gen. Frank An- drews, publicly alluded to long-range strategic bombing of enemy factories, refineries, and power plants. An accident greatly hindered the B-17's development. In October 1935 an Army pilot crashed and destroyed the only existing prototype, and the Air Corps was forced to order the much feebler twin-engine B-18. With great difficulty, the Air Corps obtained permission to buy just thirteen YB-17s as well. The YB-17s were assigned to the Second Bombardment Group, which, as the first heavy bomber unit, played an important role in developing techniques and tac- tics. Using the secret Norden bombsight, it achieved remarkable accuracy in tests in California, often hitting within 50 feet of the aiming point from four miles up. Unfortunately, combat conditions in Europe, where the Fortresses would usually be a few thousand feet higher, rarely allowed the results attainable in the clear, dry, and peaceful air over the desert. There was a long struggle over whether to build more B-17s. The traditionalist elements on the Army General Staff and in the Navy both disliked four-engine heavy bombers. Against much resistance, a few dozen improved B-17s were ordered in spurts, from 1937 to 1940-the last batch just in time to prevent Boeing from leaving the bomber business. The Army also managed to initiate work on a newer heavy bomber, the Con- solidated B-24 Liberator, which was test-flown in 1939. Awkward looking, with a slab-sided fuselage, high wings, and a twin tail, it was faster than the B-17 and could fly farther with a ton more of bombs. It became a
