ion, going to four separate engines, was foreclosed by the development of a mania for dive- bombing, promoted by Udet. The Luftwaffe's best medium bomber, the Junkers 88, had unexpectedly proven an effective dive-bomber. Such a capability was Origins, Prelude, Doctrine 17 now demanded of the Heinkel 177. A conventional four-engine bomber could not be expected to dive-bomb, and the coupled-engine design would be vital if the new bomber were to do so. Many months were wasted before it was ad- mitted that the arrangement was unworkable. By then any chance to build a heavy bomber force was long gone; the Luftwaffe was in a desperate struggle for survival.14 Despite its perhaps inevitable failure to develop a strategic bombing force, the Luftwaffe proved a formidable enemy. In the Messerschmitt 109 it had a first- class interceptor, which until 1943 was superior to any Allied plane except the Spitfire. It had sound, although slow and poorly armed, bombers. Its pilots, crews, and technicians were well trained, many with combat experience from the Spanish Civil War. That war had taught valuable lessons about close support for ground troops and the need for radio aids for navigation and bad-weather operations. The Luftwaffe was far ahead of the Allies in "blind-bombing" devices to guide bombers at night. Without the still greater ingenuity of the British in developing methods of jamming these systems, Britain would have suffered even more damage in the Blitz of 1940-1941. In Spain the Germans learned that bombers required fighter escort when they would be opposed by interceptors. They also discovered, or rather rediscovered, the proper tactics and formations for fighters. The Luftwaffe had a large air transport force and a mobile organiza- tion. It could shift bases quickly, which proved helpful in the defense of the Reich as well as in the conquest of Europe. Lastly, the Luftwaffe controlled Ger- many's antiaircraft defenses, which were proportionately stronger than those
