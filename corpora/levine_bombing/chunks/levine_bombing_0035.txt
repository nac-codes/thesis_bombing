Although the Nazis pretended that Germany had been defeated because it was "stabbed in the back" by treason, Hitler, at least, knew better, and he feared subjecting the German home front to hard- ships like those of World War I. In fact, although these ideas about Hitler's war plans were roughly accurate, it is doubtful that Germany's economic preparations were closely geared to those plans, or that they reflected a coherent program for a "blitzkrieg economy." The Nazis' emphasis on what was called "rearmament in width rather than depth"- that is, a quick payoff in the actual production of weapons, rather than expan- sion of the base of the economy by expanding the production of basic industrial materials-did fit in with the "blitzkrieg" notion. Partly this was the result of underestimates of British and French arms production, which made greater ef- forts seemingly unnecessary. But Hitler had no great interest in, or comprehen- sion of, economics, and he did not impose an overall plan. Instead, the war economy, at least up to 1942, was the object of bitter feuds between elements of the Nazi party, agencies of the armed forces, and the ministry of economics. The result was that while in some sectors of the economy plan- ning was based on the expectation of a short war or wars, planning in other  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 20 sectors assumed the need for self-sufficiency for a long time and the danger of major air attacks. The Nazis were fairly successful in making Germany self- sufficient in food production. Elaborate industries to produce synthetic oil, rub- ber, fibers, and nitrogen were built. Yet reserves of raw materials seem to have been set up erratically. Stockpiles of oil, rubber, and materials for alloys were small, and in 1939-1941 the Nazis were lucky to be able to increase them by trade with the USSR and by conquest. The synthetics plants were concentrated, and vulnerable to air attack, alth
