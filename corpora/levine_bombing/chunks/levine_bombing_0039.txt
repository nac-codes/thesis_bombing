ued that modest alterations to the bombers would make all the difference They needed self-sealing fuel tanks (armor to protect the wing tanks was already being fitted) and guns to cover the side approach. Others blamed the plan of attack, complaining that a course involving a landfall far north of the target and a flight along the enemy coast had been unwise. Ludlow-Hewitt conceded the truth of the last criticism and suggested that the extent of the defeat had been because the Germans had committed "crack units," which in fact they had not done. He took steps to secure self-sealing tanks and "beam" guns. Slowly, however, the truth sank in, assisted by another disaster, when German fighters downed two of three Wellingtons over the North Sea on January 2. NIGHT OPERATIONS The RAF was faced with one of the fateful decisions of the war. It must give up strategic bombing altogether, use long-range escort, or resort to night operations, which would, apparently, reduce the danger of interception. The first choice seemed unthinkable, while the second seemed to be foreclosed by 23 fundamental engineering factors. Any fighter carrying enough fuel to accom- pany bombers to a distant target, it was believed, would be too heavy and un- maneuverable to deal with enemy interceptors. (In fact, Giro Horikoshi, the designer of the Japanese Zero fighter, had already disproved this notion- unknown to the British.) Night operations seemed the only choice. Leaflet dropping at night by Whitley bombers of Bomber Command's 4 Group seemed encouraging. They met no effective opposition during the bitter winter of 1939-1940, despite all sorts of operational difficulties. Without heaters or proper clothing, the crews were miserably cold. Oxygen supplies were limited. Planes iced up, and engines cut out or caught fire. Still, there were few losses. Bomber Command hastened to provide de-icers and heaters, but the problem of finding and hitting the target remained. Prewar tests of Bomber Command's
