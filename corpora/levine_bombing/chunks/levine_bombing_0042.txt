rmany; it could not reach Berlin or targets further east and return under cover of darkness. Geography was tremendously important to night operations. It was always easier to find targets on a coast or estuary, or along a wide, winding river, than inland. Also, the closer a target was to England, the easier it was to find it. Certain places-the Ruhr, with its maze of similar-looking cities under a perpetual layer of smog; Stuttgart, scattered among deep valleys; and Berlin, spread out over a huge area-were particularly hard to attack. Unfortunately, the geographical layout of the critical features of the German economy was not favorable to the Allies. The cities of the North Sea coast, the easiest to find, were important in a general way, but they did not contain either an overwhelm- ing percentage of German war production or (with one exception, which the Allies overlooked) the production of any critical item. Beginning as a force used to flying by day in tight formation and facing sim- ple problems of navigation, Bomber Command became a force committed to operating in darkness in an individualistic way. Until 1942 its crews took off at widely varying times and made their own lonely way to the target. There was usually little concentration of effort in time or even space. Overestimating the destructiveness of its small bombs, the RAF would strike several different cities on the same night, or would attack several different targets within the same city. In one attack on Berlin in September 1940 it assigned the bombers 18 different targets! German air attacks on the British fleet at Scapa Flow made the British less fussy about dropping bombs on Germany. On the night of March 19, 1940, fifty Whitleys and Hampdens with experienced crews set out for a German seaplane base on Sylt Island, off the German coast. All but one plane got home; forty-one reported bombing the target and claimed many hits and resulting fires. But reconnaissance pictures made on April 6 showed no
