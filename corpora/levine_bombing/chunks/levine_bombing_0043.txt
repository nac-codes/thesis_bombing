n Sylt Island, off the German coast. All but one plane got home; forty-one reported bombing the target and claimed many hits and resulting fires. But reconnaissance pictures made on April 6 showed no visible damage. The first analysis suggested that things were as bad as they seemed, and that the average bomber crew could never find a precise target even on the coast, except in the very best visibility. Then, half the crews might bomb the target. But the sort of rationalization that had earlier operated to preserve the concept 25 of the self-defending bomber formation now operated to uphold the effectiveness of night bombing. It was pointed out that the enemy might have repaired or camouflaged the damage before the pictures were made, and that the photos were of poor quality. Bomber Command remained subject to delusions of ac- curacy until the summer of 1941; in fact, during 1940 an increasingly optimistic reading of operational reports led to the amazing conclusion that some precise targets could be hit even without moonlight.2 For many months it was firmly believed that precision bombing at night was possible. THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST GERMANY BEGINS The switch to night bombing was made shortly before the Nazis invaded Den- mark and Norway. Bomber Command's sole role in that campaign was to mount ineffective attacks on the airfields the Germans had seized. When the Germans invaded Belgium and the Netherlands, restrictions on Bomber Command's operations were lifted. The Blenheims of Bomber Com- mand's 2 Group, operating in daylight, were hurled into the land battle and suffered from German fighters and flak. On the night of May 15-16, the rest of Bomber Command opened the strategic air offensive proper. Executing Western Air Plan 4C, (WA 4C), 99 night bombers set out to attack marshalling yards and synthetic oil plants in the Ruhr. These attacks did little damage. Bomber Command could not have influenced the Battle of France even had its operations been effective. But
