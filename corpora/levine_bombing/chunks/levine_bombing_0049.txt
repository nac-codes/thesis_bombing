ff had reminded Bomber Command that attacking the Nazis' oil supply remained the "basis of our longer- term offensive strategy." Bad weather, however, had rendered moot the direc- tives in October that made oil the primary target. There was little real evidence with which to evaluate early attacks on oil targets. The poor quality of reconnaissance photos, and convoluted arguments based on prewar calculations, were used by optimists to justify big hopes. In mid- December the War Cabinet's special committee on oil matters, chaired by Geof frey Lloyd, the Secretary of Petroleum, concluded that the 539 tons of bombs that had been dropped on synthetic oil plants-just 6.7 percent of Bomber Com- mand's total effort in the same period-had already cut synthetic oil output by 15 percent. It was further calculated that only 400 aimed 500-pound bombs, carried by 100 bombers, were needed to knock out an oil plant for four months. If only half of the bombers sent out attacked their primary targets, 200 sorties would suffice to smash each plant. Just 3,400 sorties over four months would be needed to knock out all 17 synthetic plants. Given nine clear, moonlit nights a month, this seemed within Bomber Command's present capabilities-and it was about to get its first true heavy bomber, the Stirling. By some standards this was a modest evaluation. There were group com- manders who thought their men, or at least their best crews, could hit oil plants even without moonlight. The British chiefs of staff were enthusiastic about an all-out attack on oil plants, believing that this would be a decisive blow. The War Cabinet-Churchill in particular-increasingly favored hitting German civilians. Churchill frankly doubted that the oil plan would work. Skeptical of any hard-and-fast calcula tions about how to win the war, he also thought that it was too bad that oil plants were mostly well away from densely inhabited areas. Shrewd doubts about whether the RAF could do what it promised were thus
