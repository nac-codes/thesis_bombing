bombing remained standing for a time. The weather in January and February 1941 was so bad that just two attacks were made on oil targets,5 and by March the threat to Britain's supply lines in the Battle of the Atlantic was so great that the oil offensive could not be pursued. On March 9 Bomber Command received a new directive giving the Battle of the Atlantic priority. For the next four months it concentrated on attacking naval bases, U-boat construction yards, factories making com- ponents for U-boats and for the Focke-Wulf 200 Kondor bomber, and the bases of the FW-200 units. (The FW-200s were converted airliners that flew far west of Britain and inflicted heavy losses on shipping.) Most of these objectives were on the French or German coasts and were far easier to find than oil plants. An attack on the Focke-Wulf plant at Bremen on March 12 finally proved Bomber Command incapable of precision bombing. Of 54 Wellingtons dis- patched, 33, carrying 132 HE (high explosive) bombs and 840 incendiaries, reported attacking the target. Photographs showed that despite a full moon and perfect conditions, just 12 bombs had hit the plant, a large and easily located target. It was concluded that the average aiming error, in the best conditions, would be 600 yards; normally it would be closer to 1,000 yards. This analysis, which was still too optimistic, ruled out hitting oil plants at all. Only area bomb- ing would be possible on dark nights-three-quarters of each month. This seem- ingly left the German transportation system the only critical target, other than German morale, that could be harmed. Until July 1941 the RAF persisted with the campaign against German sea power, although it was clear that attacks on naval targets in Germany itself often amounted to area attacks on whole German cities. Much of Bomber Command's efforts were directed against German warships in French ports, which were at  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 30 The Failure of Bomber Command least easier
