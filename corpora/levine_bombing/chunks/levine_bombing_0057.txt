ed a system called Hellenachtjagd, or illuminated night fighting. Warned of incoming British bombers by Freya, search- lights around the cities tried to light up the bombers for the flak and fighters. This did not work well. Kammhuber redeployed the searchlights in a belt across western Germany, forming a system of "boxes," which the British dubbed the Kammhuber Line. Each box contained a single Freya and searchlights and was patrolled by a fighter. As Wurzburgs became available, they were used to track 33 the bombers. Radar data was passed to the searchlights, which lit up the bombers for the fighters. The Germans had some successes with this system, but the British countered it by diving through the illuminated areas or flying around them. The Germans then transferred the lights to a backup belt behind the boxes; eventually they returned them to the cities to aid the antiaircraft guns there. In the summer of 1941 the Germans introduced Giant Wurzburgs, with a range of 40 miles, and introduced the Himmelbett (four-poster bed) system. Each box was allotted one Freya and two Giant Wurzburgs. The Freya detected the oncoming planes and gave bearings to the Wurzburgs; one Wurzburg tracked the bomber, while the other tracked the intercepting fighter. Data from the radars was plotted by Luftwaffe women on a Seeburg Table, a frosted glass screen, in a sector control room, and a controller coached the German fighters onto the bombers. Ultimately a maximum of three fighters could be brought to bear in each box. This system proved effective, and it was supplemented by a deadly force of night intruders. Late in 1940 a group of long-range night fighters with modified Dornier 17 and Junkers 88 bombers was formed. They followed British bombers back to their bases and attacked them as they landed. Sometimes the Germans, listening to British radio traffic, were able to steer the intruders onto planes that were taking off. These tactics were very successful, but Hitler ordered them
