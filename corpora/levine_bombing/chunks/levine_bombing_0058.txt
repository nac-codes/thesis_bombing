they landed. Sometimes the Germans, listening to British radio traffic, were able to steer the intruders onto planes that were taking off. These tactics were very successful, but Hitler ordered them aban- doned on October 12, 1941, because the German air crews' claims of success could not be checked and because he wished to encourage German civilians by shooting down the enemy over Germany itself. The unit that had perfected intruder operations was transferred to the Mediterranean. The ban was not total- ly effective; excuses were occasionally manufactured to let crews fly to Britain. But Hitler's order was an important relief for the British. Nevertheless, British losses mounted. On the night of November 7-8, 1941, thirty-seven planes, nearly a tenth of the force sent out, were lost. An inquiry exploded Peirse's alibis for the disaster. Churchill then enforced a "conserva- tion" policy, which should have begun right after the Butt report. Only small forces would be sent out; distant targets and bad weather would be avoided.8 During 1941 Bomber Command's strength had risen to over 500 operational planes, including some four-engine Stirlings and Halifaxes. It now had better bombs, including 4,000-pounders. It had done the enemy some minor damage, and forced him to divert some efforts to defense. But it had not delivered its bombs to crucial targets. It had not performed the task for which it had been formed. More than two years after the start of World War II, its efforts had been a failure.  3 The Reform of Bomber Command, 1942 During 1941 the RAF had been forced to acknowledge that Bomber Command was not succeeding at precision bombing at night. Since it usually could not single out a particular factory or installation in the darkness, it had backed, at first unwillingly, into area bombing. At least for a time, it had to be content to attack the centers of German cities, which, with pending improvements of technique, it could hit. Unfortunately, although there wer
