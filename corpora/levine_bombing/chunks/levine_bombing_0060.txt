ut the area bombing after the war than was  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 36 The Reform of Bomber Command felt during it. In later years there would be more doubts about whether it had really contributed much to the victory. After the war the reflection that it was the Nazis who started the indiscriminate attacks on cities, along with commit- ting far worse crimes, did not seem to provide the same reassurance that it had in 1941-1945. It is worth noting that the British civilian leaders were more enthusiastic about the shift to area bombing than most senior officers of the RAF. This was not a policy pushed by ruthless militarists, overriding delicate civilian scruples. And some important officers, notably the deputy chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Mar- shal Sir Norman Bottomley, and the deputy director of bomber operations at the Air Ministry, Group Captain Sidney O. Bufton, hoped to go over to precision bombing as soon as that was possible. But the forced resort to area bombing brought forward a military leadership that would cling to this originally unwanted expedient long after alternatives to it were available. By February 1942, the Gee and the new tactics were nearly ready. The suc- cess of the Soviet winter offensive suggested that it was desirable to hit the Ger- mans as hard as possible. On February 14 Bomber Command received a new directive, written by Bottomley, that ended the conservation policy and for- mally registered the shift to a policy of area attack, albeit with significant reser- vations. This directive governed Bomber Command's operations until early 1943, and the policy was not greatly modified until much later. It is a document that rewards close study. The primary objective was now to attack "the morale of the enemy's civil population and in particular, of the industrial workers." The directive emphasized incendiary attacks on seven big industrial cities in the Ruhr and Rhineland and on the German coast within Gee range (350 to 400 miles
