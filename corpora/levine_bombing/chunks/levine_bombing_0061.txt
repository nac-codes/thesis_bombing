particular, of the industrial workers." The directive emphasized incendiary attacks on seven big industrial cities in the Ruhr and Rhineland and on the German coast within Gee range (350 to 400 miles from Britain.) Some cities beyond Gee range would be bombed when conditions were particularly favorable. In case Gee made precision attack possible, some precision targets within its range were listed for attack, including the synthetic rubber plant at HÃ¼ls and several oil plants and power plants. The other major synthetic rubber plant, at Schkopau, and factories making critical parts for planes were listed too, although they lay beyond Gee range and it was hard to see how they could be hit. A few factories in France would be struck when the weather was par- ticularly favorable there but impossible over Germany. Such targets were few, since they had to be very big, and easy to hit without hurting friendly civilians. It should be noted that, except for some attacks on the U-boat ports in France, the British government never approved area bombing of the German-occupied countries, including, oddly, Austria. The selection of specific factories in oc- cupied Europe as targets, and some of Bomber Command's actual operations, constituted a left-handed admission that, although Gee had proved disappoint- ing, it was sometimes considered possible to carry out precision attacks even with the equipment available in 1942-a fact often ignored. The February directive was thus not entirely clear. As far as the near future was concerned, Bomber Command was unmistakably committed to area attacks 37 in Germany. But the directive left the way open to, and implicitly favored, preci- sion attack if Gee was equal to the task. Moreover, it left open the option of choosing a policy of "selective" rather than "general" area attack. Bottomley and the Ministry of Economic Warfare favored this idea. Instead of seeking the general dislocation of the enemy's morale and economy, area attacks could be
