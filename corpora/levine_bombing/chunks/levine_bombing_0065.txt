a system of special ground markers that must be laid by British agents on the spot. Later, Harris talked of a low-level attack in moonlight but did nothing about it. Although some British officials remained interested in Schweinfurt, it slipped into the province of the Americans. The Ministry of Economic Warfare continued to study bottlenecks. By late November 1942 it had settled on a list of five target systems: ball bearings, syn- thetic rubber, alkalis, fuel injection pumps and electrical equipment for planes, and optical and laboratory glass and instruments. All were concentrated in just ten cities, eight in Germany and one each in France and Italy. Not all these systems were good choices, and while some of them would be struck, it would mostly be by American precision attacks. By January 1943 the ministry had com- piled a guide to the economic importance of German cities, the "Bomber's Baedeker." The guide heavily influenced the selection of target cities for the general area offensive.3 Although Harris rejected selective attacks on particular industries, he did wish to hit economically important cities; those of little in- dustrial importance, such as Dresden, were given low priority for attack and were hit only late in the war. 39 Curiously, only in early 1942 was there a major debate in Britain about whether to pursue strategic bombing. Although the prospects for bombing had been weaker right after the Butt report the previous August, serious questions were only raised in the winter of 1941-1942. Until then many people had not ex- pected the Soviets to survive; that made an eventual invasion of Western Europe a much better prospect. More important was the shock of defeats in the Middle East and Southeast Asia and the U-boat threat in the Atlantic. Some politi- cians favored a radical change in priority. But they remained isolated, and Chur- chill's control of affairs was unshaken. The real clash over policy took place inside the government; the Royal Navy t
