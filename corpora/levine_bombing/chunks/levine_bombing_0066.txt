cians favored a radical change in priority. But they remained isolated, and Chur- chill's control of affairs was unshaken. The real clash over policy took place inside the government; the Royal Navy took the initiative. At first it did not attack the strategic air offensive directly; it just demanded the immediate transfer of six and a half squadrons to Coastal Command and two more to Ceylon for reconnaissance. The Navy's basic perspec- tive was summed up on February 18 by its brilliant scientific adviser, P. M. S. Blackett, who wrote that the present policy of bombing Germany was wrong; that we must put our maximum effort first into destroying the enemy's sea communications and preserving our own; that we can only do so by operating aircraft over the sea on a very much larger scale than we have done hitherto, and that we shall be forced to use much longer range aircraft. The only advantage that I can see in bombing Germany is that it does force the enemy to lock up a good deal of his effort on home defense . . . the heavy scale of bombing will only be justified in the concluding stages of the war when (or if) we are fortunate enough to have defeated the enemy at sea and have command of it.4 The First Sea Lord agreed. At first the Air Ministry weakly responded that Coastal Command was being expanded anyway, while planes taken from Bomber Command would not be of much use since they were not equipped for work at sea. More forthrightly, Sinclair grumbled that it was wrong to disperse to defensive tasks, resources that could carry on an offensive. Lord Cherwell generated a stronger justification for area bombing on March 30-one that has since often been wrongly supposed to be the basis of that policy. Claiming to have a simple way to estimate what could be done by bombing Germany, he reported that the German attacks on Britain showed that a ton of bombs dropped on a built-up area smashed 20-40 dwellings, making 100-200 people homeless. "Investigation seems to show that
