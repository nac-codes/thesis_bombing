ermany, he reported that the German attacks on Britain showed that a ton of bombs dropped on a built-up area smashed 20-40 dwellings, making 100-200 people homeless. "Investigation seems to show that having one's house demolished is most damaging to morale. People seem to mind it more than hav- ing their friends or even their relatives killed." The British could count on get- ting 14 operational flights from every bomber built; each bomber should drop about 40 tons of bombs in its lifetime, making 4,000-8,000 people homeless. Even half the total load of the 10,000 heavy bombers expected to be built by mid-1943 could render homeless most of the people of the 58 German cities that had over 100,000 inhabitants. That should break German morale. All this, he pointed out, ignored damage to factories, as well as anything the Americans  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 40 The Reform of Bomber Command might do. Cherwell did not submit any calculations of how many Germans would be killed or hurt while being "dehoused." It was probably assumed that the number would not be great, since people in shelters should survive much better than their houses would. It did not work out that way in practice, however Churchill, Sinclair, and Portal liked Cherwell's minute, but Sir Henry Tizard an able scientific adviser to the government, tried to expose flaws in it. Noting that bomber production programs were never fulfilled, he suggested that Bomber Command would drop only half the tonnage Cherwell expected, with less ac curacy. The damage would not be decisive. Tizard did not fundamentally op- pose bombing, but felt that defensive measures at sea must take precedence Cherwell replied that he had not meant his calculations to be taken literally: even if Tizard's figures were right, the bombing would still have a "catastrophic effect." But Churchill was content with Cherwell's arguments. He did not ex pect bombing to win the war by itself; it was only supposed to soften up the Germans. In
