iveness would depend on these three devices. Gee consisted of three ground stations in Britain and a receiver in the plane using it. A "master" station (A) controlled two widely separated "slave" stations (B and C); the three broadcast synchronized identical pulses similar to those used in radar. A navigator using Gee measured the differences in time of arrival 41 of the pulses from the three stations as they were displayed on a small cathode- ray tube. His plane's position could then be located on a special color-coded Gee chart. The resulting fix varied in accuracy from under half a mile (sometime far less, in skilled hands) to about five miles, depending on the navigator's abili- ty and the range from Britain. Gee's range also varied; in practice it could not be counted on east of the Ruhr. It could be used by any number of planes and, unlike the German devices used in 1940-1941, gave the enemy no clue as to the intended target. Gee has been proposed by R. J. Dippy of the Telecommunications Research Establishment (T.R.E.) as early as 1938, but its development was not pushed because its range was thought to be short. Concerted work began only in June 1940, when the Air Staff began worrying about the accuracy of navigation. It was successfully demonstrated late in 1940, but problems in producing a vital tube, and the Ministry of Aircraft Production's mishandling of the problem of installing it in planes, delayed its introduction. In August 1941 preproduction Gee sets were used by Wellingtons in trials over Germany. Only three missions were flown, but one of the planes was lost. The British feared the system had been compromised; the Germans might have salvaged the equipment or maps, or learned something from prisoners. Because of this, Reginald V. Jones, head of scientific intelligence for the Air Staff, set up an ingenious scheme to trick the enemy into thinking that the British were using another device, the J-Beam, so that the Germans would assume that they had
