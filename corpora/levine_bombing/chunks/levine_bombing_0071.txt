The Strategic Bombing of Germany 42 The Reform of Bomber Command and had a much longer range. Gee also guided ships and landing craft in the great amphibious operations of the war. The Germans finally paid it the ultimate attacks on Britain in 1944.6 compliment-they used captured Gee equipment and maps to guide their air Unlike Gee, Oboe, devised by A. H. Reeves and F. E. Jones of the T.R.E. proved to be a true blind-bombing device. It guided a plane right to the target itself. Two ground stations, Cat and Mouse, broadcasting on the same frequency. controlled a single plane. The Cat station's beam kept the plane on course, and the Mouse indicated the point at which the bombs should be dropped. A pulse repeater in the plane amplified and retransmitted signals from the ground sta- tions, enabling them to determine the plane's range. An Oboe-carrying plane normally navigated by other means to within ten miles of the target, then settled on the beam from the Cat. The pilot heard a continuous note in his earphones if he was on course, dots and dashes if he was off course. The Mouse warned the plane when it was near the target, then transmitted a bomb-release signal Oboe was very accurate-it could be used to drop bombs with an average error of 400 yards-but had severe limitations. At first, one pair of Cat and Mouse stations could control just one plane at a time, although later a system of multichannel control would enable them to control more. And Oboe was a purely line-of-sight device, with a maximum range of 270 miles for a plane fly- ing at 28,000 feet. It was of little use for targets east of the Ruhr until ground stations were moved to France after D-Day. A repeater system was developed. using planes to relay signals from ground stations in Britain to the Oboe planes. but the RAF hardly used it. A plane using Oboe also had to fly a very straight course. The British therefore used it mainly as a target-market device, putting it on Mosquitos, which could fly higher
