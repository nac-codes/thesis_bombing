but the RAF hardly used it. A plane using Oboe also had to fly a very straight course. The British therefore used it mainly as a target-market device, putting it on Mosquitos, which could fly higher and faster than the heavies; they would drop markers for the main force. In December 1941 a crude form of Oboe had been used by two Stirling squadrons to bomb the German ships at Brest, but it had proved unreliable. In April 1942 a better system was successfully tested, but its introduction into service, originally planned for July, was delayed until December. It turned out that Oboe was more accurate than the available maps; to calibrate map grids for it, the British had to undertake a special operation. Oboe Mosquitos bombed a German night-fighter sector headquarters in Belgium and the results were reported by Belgian agents, enabling the British to make the necessary correc- tions. Oboe made a gigantic difference in the accuracy of British bombing, and might have made an even bigger one had it been better exploited. The Mos- quitos were rarely shot down, and the Germans did not recover any Oboe equip- ment until 1944. They began trying to jam the original 1.5 meter Oboe in August 1943, but had little success until November. By then the British were introduc- ing a version of Oboe using centimeter wavelengths. Only near the end of the war did the Germans have some success in jamming this Mark III Oboe.7 H2S was the first major electronic aid sought by Bomber Command, but its development was prolonged and difficult. It had been noted, early in the 43 development of radar, that different surface features returned different sorts of echo; this inspired the idea of an airborne radar map-reading device. H2S was a downward-looking radar that scanned the area under a plane. The resulting picture was displayed on a cathode-ray tube called a Plan Position Indicator-a type of radar display far easier to use than earlier devices. Unlike Gee and Oboe, H2S was self-contained; it d
