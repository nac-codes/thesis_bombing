was first used by 2 Group for small, unescorted daylight strikes on precision targets deep in Germany as well as in the occupied countries; later an Oboe-equipped night bomber, a night fighter, a fighter bomber, and other versions of the Mosquito were introduced. The group also received new American light and medium bombers, which were used over France and the Low Countries for escorted day attacks. But these operations had little effect on, or relation to, the night offensive The Avro Lancaster was more important; it was the RAF's best heavy bomber of the war. It could carry an enormous bomb load. Normal loads were five tons or more (twice that of the American heavy bombers), and special Lancasters later carried a 22,000-pound bomb. It flew higher and was more rugged than the disappointing Stirling and was safer and easier to fly than the Halifax. Harris would have liked to convert Halifax production lines to the Lancaster but never got his way. He also tried to persuade the Americans to build it, but failed In March 1942 the British settled on a new standard organization for the crews of their heavy bombers, now largely men who had joined since the war began- many from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. They stopped carrying copilots and added a specialized bombardier and another full-time gunner. Relieving the overburdened navigator of the job of handling the bombsight was long over- due, but even some senior officers were unhappy about the lack of a copilot. One man had to handle the controls for a whole six- to eight-hour trip. Although perhaps somewhat less difficult than flying a B-17-unlike the Americans, British pilots did not have the strain of keeping formation-a night trip to Germany and back was physically exhausting. Unlike American pilots, many British pilots were only sergeants; nevertheless, they commanded the plane and a crew of six other men: navigator, bombardier, flight engineer, radio operator, and two full- time gunners.
