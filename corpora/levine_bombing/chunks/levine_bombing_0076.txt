pilots were only sergeants; nevertheless, they commanded the plane and a crew of six other men: navigator, bombardier, flight engineer, radio operator, and two full- time gunners. RAF four-engine bombers were lightly armed by American stan- dards; there were only three gun positions, all power-operated turrets. The top and tail turrets were manned by full-time gunners; the one in the nose was manned by the bombardier when necessary-the Germans rarely attacked night bombers from ahead. Later the Canadian 6 Group wisely added a belly turret and an additional full-time gunner to its bombers. The British turrets were excellent-it was only in late 1943 that a comparable turret would be added to the much more threatened nose of the B-17-but they were pitifully underarmed, with .303-caliber machine guns. Plans to rearm them with American .50s were aborted by Pearl Harbor and only resumed late in the war. The arming of the turrets may not have mattered much, for the German night fighters depended on surprise, trying to remain unseen until they opened fire. 45 The bombers depended mainly on seeing the enemy first and then taking violent evasive action. Gunners were mainly important as lookouts. The carefully rehearsed "corkscrew" maneuver, rather than their guns, saved many British bombers. The crew of a shot-down plane stood little chance of survival; only a fifth managed to bail out. Until late in 1944 the prospects for bomber crewmen were grim. Losses averaged about 5 percent; 7 percent was about as much as Bomber Command, as an organization, could stand for a long period. Only a fraction of the bomber crews completed a full "tour" of 30 operations. The sur- vivors then went to train new crews (in itself hazardous) for some months, then returned for a second tour of 30. (Occasionally, men serving in a squadron that had suffered exceptional losses were let off before 30 trips.) In May 1943 the second tour was mercifully limited to 20 operations.
