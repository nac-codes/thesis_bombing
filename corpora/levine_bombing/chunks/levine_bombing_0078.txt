3 elements of the new tactics were tried out in a precision attack on a French target, the Renault works at Billancourt, in the Paris suburbs, which made 14,000 trucks a year for the Germans. Gee was not yet available, and the target was not considered suitable for incendiary bombs, but flares were used to identify it, and the attack was far more concentrated than earlier ones. All planes were to bomb within one hour. The Renault plant was easy to find; it was a densely packed area right on the bank of the Seine, opposite an island. The moon was nearly full and weather was perfect; given the lack of defenses, the British planes could fly far lower than usual. The bomber stream worked even better than expected, concentrating the attack even more than planned.  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 46 The Reform of Bomber Command Many eager crews went in even lower than they had been ordered. Of 235 bombers dispatched-the most to a single target so far in the war-223 attacked, dropping 470 tons of bombs. Only one plane was lost. Production at the Renault works stopped entirely for a month and did not recover fully for several more, costing the Germans 2,272 trucks. They scaled back plans for increasing pro- duction. Unfortunately, 367 French civilians were killed, and the plant recovered more quickly than the British expected; this was a frequent vice of Allied assessments of industrial damage. After the war the United States Strategic Bombing Survey calculated that the attack would have had to be repeated at intervals of two to three months to keep the plant knocked out. (It was only attacked again by the Eighth Air Force in April 1943.) Nevertheless, the Renault attack was the first solid success by Bomber Command against a land target. But, as the British official history noted, such a combination of perfect weather and weak defenses seldom occurred over important targets in Germany. The attack was not typical of Bomber Command's capabilities.10 Gee, and the full-blown
