accurate bombing, while delays caused the bombers to reach their targets after sundown. For a time in late 1942 Harris even pondered returning to regular daylight operations, depending on the bomber's ability to defend themselves. Although he had advised the Americans  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 48 to drop their own plans for daylight attacks, their initial successes impressed him. But he soon dropped the idea; if anything, he was becoming increasingly fixated on "pure" area bombing at night. He launched only one or two more "mixed" attacks of the sort made on Rostock and Bremen. But for every suc- cessful area attack, there were two or three failures.13 4 The Climax of Area Bombing and the Defeat of Bomber Command, January 1943-March 1944 THE PATHFINDER FORCE Since March 1942 the Air Ministry had wanted to form a special target-finding force within Bomber Command. Harris and his group commanders opposed this. Finally the Air Staff ordered Harris to form a separate force with regular squadrons drawn from the other groups. He appointed an outstanding officer. Group Captain Donald Bennett, to command the new Pathfinder Force (later it became 8 Group), and gave him his full support. The pathfinders began opera- tions in August. They flew tours of 45 missions instead of 30, but were given a step up in rank and pay as long as they were on operations. Target-marker bombs were introduced; they were filled with benzol, rubber, and phosphorus to provide distinctively colored fires. The 250-pound "red blob fire" was first used in late August; in September the huge 2,800-pound "pink pansy" was in- troduced. These early markers were not very good, but the results justified the formation of the Pathfinder Force. The concentration of bombing increased greatly, although overall accuracy improved only slightly. The main force could see and aim at the markers fairly well, but the markers could not be placed ac- curately enough. Oboe and H2S would be needed to do that regularl
