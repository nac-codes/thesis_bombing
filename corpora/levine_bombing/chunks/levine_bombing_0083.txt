accuracy improved only slightly. The main force could see and aim at the markers fairly well, but the markers could not be placed ac- curately enough. Oboe and H2S would be needed to do that regularly. 14 During 1942 Bomber Command was finally hurting the enemy. Some damage was inflicted on German production, although not enough to prevent its actually rising during the year. More important, German efforts were diverted into defense and into ineffective retaliatory measures. The German fighter and flak defenses grew considerably. Reinforcing the small bomber and fighter-bomber force on their western front, they diverted it from mine laying and attacks on ships to costly revenge attacks against Britain, at a time when every plane was needed in Russia and the Mediterranean. The most foolish diversion of effort, however was yet to come. On December 22 Hitler would give the V-2 rocket the highest possible priority and authorized its mass production, at great cost in scarce resources. 15 Bomber Command continued blasting German cities until the spring of 1944. Harris was sure, and others hoped, that he could smash Germany before the invasion of France. He was largely allowed to ignore inter-Allied directives dealing with the strategic bombing campaign; he stuck to a policy of general area attack and only occasionally, and evidently reluctantly, tried precision attacks. Until February 1944 he evaded attempts to cooperate with the Americans by selective attacks on cities connected with the production of planes and ball bearings, although these were strongly favored by Bottomley and Air Commodore Bufton. Bomber Command had smashed much of Germany's cities to rubble, and damaged the enemy war effort. But it had not even come close to wrecking the German economy or morale. Instead, the attempt to evade German defenses under cover of darkness ended in failure. The very development of electronic devices that enabled the bombers to find their targets let the Germans find the bo
