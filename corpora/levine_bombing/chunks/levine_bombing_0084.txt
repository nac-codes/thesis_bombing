ad, the attempt to evade German defenses under cover of darkness ended in failure. The very development of electronic devices that enabled the bombers to find their targets let the Germans find the bombers and inflict prohibitive losses. NEW TACTICS AND DEVICES During the winter of 1942-1943 Bomber Command perfected the equipment and tactics that allowed regular, effective area bombing. During 1942 its numerical strength had not risen greatly; in January 1943 it numbered only 515 opera- tional planes, only about a hundred more than a year earlier. But it was now largely a force of four-engine bombers. It now had 178 Lancasters and 58 Mosquitos. During the winter it stopped operating on moonlit nights; moonlight was too helpful to the growing enemy night fighter force. Henceforth only a few preci- sion missions against very important targets took place when the moon was close to full. To confuse and overwhelm the German defenses, the bomber stream was even more compressed, and the bombers flew at varying heights.  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 50 Area Bombing & the Defeat of Bomber Command The bombers' effectiveness depended on the long-delayed introduction of Oboe and H2S, and marking techniques enabling the pathfinders to direct the main force. On December 31, 1942, Oboe-equipped Mosquitos went on their first mis- sion to Germany, marking for a small attack on Düsseldorf. H2S was introduced in late January, and a new, more effective 250-pound marker bomb was intro- duced in an attack on Berlin on January 16-17, the first since 1941. When a barometric fuse set it off in the air, the bomb showered 60 colored candles, which burst into flames before hitting the ground. Another device, the sky marker. was introduced on the December 31 Düsseldorf mission. Sky markers were parachute flares, dropped by Oboe- or H2S-equipped Pathfinder planes over the aiming point when the ground could not be seen. The main force then aimed at the sky markers. They drifted and were only
