parachute flares, dropped by Oboe- or H2S-equipped Pathfinder planes over the aiming point when the ground could not be seen. The main force then aimed at the sky markers. They drifted and were only briefly visible, and were basically inferior to marker bombs, but they let the RAF attack even through unbroken cloud cover. These devices made possible three basic techniques: (1) Parramat- ta, blind dropping of marker bombs on electronic guidance; (2) Wanganui, sky marking; and (3) Newhaven, a mixed technique in which flares were dropped on electronic guidance to light up the target and then the Pathfinders tried to aim the marker bombs at it visually. When Oboe, rather than H2S, was used. these methods were referred to as Musical Parramatta, Musical Wanganui, and Musical Newhaven.1 The British also took the offensive with electronic countermeasures. During 1942 they had learned a great deal about the enemy's radar systems. On February 27 a spectacular raid by paratroops on Bruneval, on the French coast, had cap- tured a Wurzburg radar and brought part of it back to England. (Later in the year, a largely intact Wurzburg was captured at El Alamein.) And in August 1942, during the raid on Dieppe, a radar technician was able to look over a Freya station. In December the British introduced Mandrel, a jammer to deal with Freya, and Shivers, a device to jam the Wurzburg. Another device, Tinsel, jammed communications with the night fighters. These devices were only moder- ately successful, however. The Germans had begun equipping their night fighters with an airborne in- tercept radar, Lichtenstein, in February 1942, operating on a wavelength of 62 centimeters and with a range of two miles. The British detected its broadcasts but were uncertain what they were. On December 3, 1942, a specially equipped "ferret" Wellington was sent to find out whether the Germans had an airborne radar and to determine its characteristics. Accompanying the main force to Frankfurt, it deliberate
