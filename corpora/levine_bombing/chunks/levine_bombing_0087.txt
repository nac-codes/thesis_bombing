stically referred to it as Happy Valley. The British were almost obsessed by the great Krupps works (Gustahlfabrik Friedrich Krupp), which covered 1,088 acres in Essen, a fabulous center of the German armaments in- dustry. In fact, the British somewhat exaggerated the importance of the Krupp plants, and of the Ruhr. Except for the synthetic oil plants located on the out- skirts of some of its cities, the Ruhr did not produce much that was immediate- ly vital to military operations. It furnished only about a quarter of Germany's war material; it produced only a tenth of Germany's tanks and had only one aircraft engine plant. Nor was the type of machinery in the Ruhr plants suscep- tible to bomb damage.3 The Battle of the Ruhr was the first of the major "battles" Bomber Command fought in 1943-1944. In each battle-more properly, campaign-it concentrated its attacks on a certain area: the Ruhr, Hamburg, or Berlin. But it interspersed its efforts against the main objectives with attacks on cities elsewhere in Ger- many. And it carried out several interesting and important operations against precision targets. The Battle of the Ruhr, which included heavy attacks on nearby Rhineland cities such as DÃ¼sseldorf, Aachen, and Cologne as well as on the Ruhr itself, began on March 5, 1943 with an unprecedentedly effective attack on Essen. Unusually, for this period of the war, the aiming point was an industrial plant, the great Friedrich Krupp works. (Since the works formed the center of Essen, the British could hardly have aimed at anything else.) The attack was a fine example of area attack using the Parramatta technique. The first Oboe Mosquito arrived over Essen at 8:58 P.M., two minutes early, and dropped its red target indicator bombs. Others followed at intervals of several minutes. Behind them, 22 heavy bombers of the Pathfinder Force dropped green marker bombs, at in- tervals of a minute or two, aimed at the red markers. To help with navigation  The Strategic Bombing of
