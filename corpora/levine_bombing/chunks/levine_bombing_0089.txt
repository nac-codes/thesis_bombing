fifth and final blow. The loss of life in the Ruhr and Rhineland, was far greater than from any earlier air attack of the European war. Two attacks on Barmen-Wuppertal in late May and June killed 5,200 people. The first attack on that city, on May 29, showed how ac- curate Parramatta could be in good conditions; 475 of the 611 bombers attack ing dropped within three miles of the aiming point, devastating a city just two miles across. Beyond Oboe range Bomber Command did not achieve accuracy of this sort. although it sometimes even attempted precision targets. Two attacks on the Skoda works, a target somewhat like the Friedrich Krupp plant, located on the edge of the small Czech city of Pilsen, failed badly. The Pathfinders could not find it. But the center of Stettin, which was industrial in character, was devastated on April 20. It is noticeable, however, that Harris dispatched fewer planes on these mis sions than he usually did on attacks on orthodox, that is, nonindustrial, are targets. His disbelief in the prospects of success, at least against distant targets, was not unreasonable in this period. But whether his pessimism was justified about targets covered by Oboe is a different question. Essen was the only place within Oboe range where the British aimed at a particular factory. The British official historians admitted that other very large factories might have been hit in the same way, but they insisted that aiming errors were still great, so attempting precision attacks on specific industrial targets would have meant that most of the bombs would fall on suburban areas or even open fields. "Nothing like 53 the devastation which was produced by the area offensive would have occurred and it is highly improbable that the destruction of factories and other 'military objectives' in and around the Ruhr would have been any greater than, or perhaps, even as great as, in fact it was."5 This argument is unconvincing, for damage to housing and commercial areas had no i
