objectives' in and around the Ruhr would have been any greater than, or perhaps, even as great as, in fact it was."5 This argument is unconvincing, for damage to housing and commercial areas had no impact comparable to damage to fac- tories. But it is true that in the spring of 1943 Bomber Command was an "effec- tive bludgeon," not a rapier. The very big industrial plants that might have been good targets for Oboe-guided attacks were rare. In general, area bombing was still unavoidable. By the end of the Battle of the Ruhr, on July 14, Bomber Command had badly damaged the Ruhr and some other areas and had caused indirect disruption. The important Rheinmetal-Borsig plant in DÃ¼sseldorf had been safely evacuated, but its machinery, sent away for dispersal, was never used again in the war. The Ruhr-Rhineland area as a whole probably lost the equivalent of about one- and-one-half months' production in this period. The British wishfully supposed that they had permanently crippled these areas, reduced overall German war production, and delivered a terrific blow to German morale. The lesser blow they had in fact dealt had been costly. They had launched 43 major attacks, comprising 18,506 sorties, with 872 bombers destroyed and 2,126 damaged- some of which had to be scrapped. On several attacks the British had sent over 700 bombers. The overall loss rate had been 4.7 percent-near the maximum Bomber Command could sustain for a long time.6 THE ATTACK ON THE RUHR DAMS While the Battle of the Ruhr raged, a small force carried out one of the most spectacular operations of the World War I, the famous attack on the Ruhr dams. Had it succeeded completely, it would have left much of the Ruhr's industry useless. As it was, it inflicted damage equal to that of many conventional attacks and helped to develop new methods, which ultimately made precision bombing at night a regular possibility. The British had long known that a system of dams supplied water vital to the Ruhr industries. W
