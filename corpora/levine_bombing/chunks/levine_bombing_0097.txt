the Sorpe. Had both the Möhne and the Sorpe been broken, the consequences would have been at least as great as the optimists on the British side had supposed. 57 As it was, only the recent installation of an emergency pumping system bring- ing water from the Rhine prevented a serious crisis in the Ruhr; had the attack been made a year earlier, it would also have been more effective. The Germans made frantic efforts to repair the Möhne and Eder in time to catch the fall rains. They brought 7,000 workers to the Ruhr to restore water and power supplies; another 20,000 were taken from work on coastal defenses in the West to repair the dams and other damage. The gap in the Möhne was closed on September 23, just in time to catch the rain. Partial repairs on the Eder were finished at about the same time, although its reservoir had to be kept at a lower level until complete repairs were made after the war. Speer was surprised, and Wallis was disgusted, that the Germans were allowed to finish the repairs on the Möhne. Both thought that even a few bombs would have wrecked the reconstruction effort. However, it is true that the Möhne, and many other dams, were now heavily defended by flak guns, rocket launchers, balloons, searchlights, wire aprons, and even mines to blow up low-flying planes. Nets and wooden deflectors were laid to block a second attack with Upkeeps. (The German precautions rendered Upkeep unusable over Germany, but Wallis thought it might still have been used against Italian targets.) Perhaps over 10,000 troops were permanently tied down in defense of the Ruhr area dams. The enormous effort the enemy had to expend in the repair and defense of dams would alone have made the Ruhr dams attacks worthwhile, despite the heavy losses that had been suffered by the small force-losses that were but a fraction of those suffered in orthodox attacks that had caused the enemy far less trouble. But errors in planning the attack, the ill luck of the planes assigned to the S
