force-losses that were but a fraction of those suffered in orthodox attacks that had caused the enemy far less trouble. But errors in planning the attack, the ill luck of the planes assigned to the Sorpe, and the failure to follow up the success against the MÃ¶hne prevented the operation from dealing the truly crippling blow that it might have. Low-level attack by heavy bombers was not likely to become a standard tac- tic, but the dams attacks saw the first use of what became known as a "master bomber," a leader who stayed in the target area and directed the attack. It had forced improvement of air-to-air communications and encouraged more atten- tion to precision bombing. Some inspiration, or a desire to placate Bottomley and Bufton, caused Harris to keep 617 Squadron in being to perform small- scale precision attacks. Techniques that it developed were ultimately applied by the rest of Bomber Command.8 FRIEDRICHSHAFEN A month after the Ruhr dams attack, when moonlight again made major air attacks on Germany too dangerous, Bomber Command carried out some more operations that pointed toward the development of greater precision in bomb- ing. On the night of June 19-20, 290 planes attacked the Schneider works. The weather was good and the defenses weak, and the attack was made from relatively low altitudes. The pathfinders dropped flares but did not mark the target; in- stead, the main force tried to aim visually-and missed. The attack failed.  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 58 Area Bombing & the Defeat of Bomber Command The following night the RAF departed from its usual methods more creative- ly. At the urging of Jones, it attacked the huge Zeppelin works, at Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance, which made Wurzburg radars. Unknown to the British V-2 missiles were also to be built there. Friedrichshafen, although a small city. had an amazing concentration of plants important to the German war effort A force of just 60 Lancasters-4 were pathfinders and the rest from 5
