be built there. Friedrichshafen, although a small city. had an amazing concentration of plants important to the German war effort A force of just 60 Lancasters-4 were pathfinders and the rest from 5 Group- flew to Friedrichshafen, from which they were to fly on to North Africa. A master bomber supervised the attack, in which several new techniques were used. The pathfinders were to mark the target visually, under the light of flares dropped by H2S guidance and under the direction of the master bomber, and then they were to use offset marking. A marker right on an aiming point would often be obscured by flames, smoke, and dust during an attack, so 5 Group had developed the idea of putting the markers on an easily seen point away from the target: the main force would then add a precalculated "overshoot" to their bombsights to compensate for the difference so their bombs would hit the aiming point In effect this was a modified version of Newhaven. Part of the force, however would not be using the markers at all. Instead, it would make a timed run from a clearly visible landmark outside the target area. This was a pet idea of 5 Group' able commander, Ralph Cochrane, a man who many later thought would have made a good replacement for Harris. The Friedrichshafen attack went well despite mishaps. The original master bomber lost an engine, so his deputy took over; heavy flak forced the British to bomb from a higher altitude than planned. An unexpected wind change caused the marker bombs to be slightly misplaced, so the bombing by most of the force was only moderately accurate. The time-and-distance runs, however, went very well. The Zeppelin works was wrecked, and the Germans gave up plans to build V-2s there. Neighboring plants making diesel and aircraft engines were damaged as well. No planes were lost. On the return trip from North Africa, the force attacked an Italian Naval base, but the master bomber technique failed because of radio interference. Jones later wrote, "
