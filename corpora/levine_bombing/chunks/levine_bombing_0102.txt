operational planes and a thousand ready crews. And it had some new tricks up its sleeve to deal with the German defenses, the most impor- tant of which was Window, or "chaff." It had been known for years that masses of metal foil strips cut to the proper size-preferably half the wavelength of the radar to be interfered with-would swamp the enemy's receivers with false echoes. Window could have been introduced as early as the spring of 1942, but an initial decision to use it had been reversed when some warned that the Germans in turn would use it to render Britain's defenses ineffectual. (In fact, the Germans were well aware of the ef- fectiveness of Window, which they called Duppel, but withheld it for the same reason!) Harris was uninterested in pushing its use. During April 1943 the  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 60 Area Bombing & the Defeat of Bomber Command decision was reconsidered, but it was found that the strips being produced were of the wrong size. The introduction of Window was delayed again until after the Allies landed in Sicily, when after a final argument its use was authorized for the Battle of Hamburg. Bundles of 2,200 paper strips with aluminum foil on one side, each strip 26.5 centimeters long, designed to interfere with Wurz- burg and Lichtenstein, were delivered to each bomber. Until automatic launchers were available a man would have to hurl them out, one bundle a minute, for one hour before and one hour after bombing the target. Bomber Command also had another new countermeasure, Cigar, a jammer designed to interfere with enemy VHF transmissions to night fighters. In June a more active measure against the enemy's defenses had been introduced: Serrate night fighter sup- port. These Beaufighters carried both their own radar and a device called Ser rate, which could home in on the Lichtenstein radar. But the Beaufighters were too slow to deal with the German fighters, and their operations were not vert successful. 12 On the night of July 24-2
