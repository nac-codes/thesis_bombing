of the Allied war effort. It is hard not to feel that the 8,000 tons of bombs dropped on the city would not have caused more damage to the Nazis if aimed at the industrial areas south of the Elbe.16 Peenem端nde After the last attack on Hamburg, Bomber Command attacked targets in Italy to prepare for the coming invasion there and to pressure its new government into surrendering to the Allies. The RAF did not resume major attacks on Ger- many until August 17. Then it launched an unusual and important blow against the German missile development center at Peenem端nde on the Baltic. There the German Army was developing the V-2 ballistic missile for use against Britain, while the Luftwaffe tested the V-1 pulse-jet powered cruise missile and the Messerschmitt 163 rocket fighter. The British had received reports about German rocket development as far back as 1939; reconnaissance planes had photographed Peenem端nde in 1942. But its importance was not realized until more reports encouraged a careful in- vestigation in May and June 1943. Aerial photos convinced the responsible of- ficials that something must be done. Had the British known how inaccurate the V-2 was and that its warhead held just a ton of explosive, they might have worried less. Even some Germans realized that the V-2 was not worth the vast expenditures on it, and that it would be wise to give the Wasserfall antiaircraft missile priority. But during 1943 and 1944 the Allies feared German secret weapons and invested considerable efforts to stop them. On June 29 the War Cabinet ordered an all-out attack on Peenem端nde, but the attack could not be carried out until August, when longer nights allowed trips to distant targets. Harris knew that his usual methods would not be suitable. Accuracy had to be high. He had to smash three small, widely separated targets: the main experimental station, the housing estate where the scientists and engineers lived, and the factory that was to mass-produce the V-2s. He even pondered
