three small, widely separated targets: the main experimental station, the housing estate where the scientists and engineers lived, and the factory that was to mass-produce the V-2s. He even pondered a daylight attack, using clouds to hide a force reaching the target at sunset. But that had not worked well in 1942, and he discarded the idea. In- stead, he decided to strike in moonlight at relatively low altitude, using the tactics employed at Friedrichshafen. A master bomber would guide the attack, while 5 Group would carry out time-and-distance runs in case the markers could not be seen or were obviously misplaced. A new type of marker bomb, the "red spot fire," would be used. It ignited at a height of 3,000 feet and burned on the ground for ten minutes with a very distinctive color. An elaborate bluff was prepared to put the enemy off guard. Small diversionary attacks by Mosquitos had been a feature of Bomber Command operations for months. Harris had Mosquitos fly past Peenemünde for several nights before the attack there. They struck Berlin from the north, accustoming the Germans to expect attacks on the capital and to ignore apparent threats to Peenemünde.  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 64 Area Bombing & the Defeat of Bomber Command The attack on Peenemünde used much the same route, while Mosquitos mounted another diversion to Berlin. On the night of August 17-18 Harris dispatched 596 bombers to Peenemünde- a relatively small force by this part of the war. Some planes had returned from Italy the previous night, too late to get ready for Peenemünde, and the number of available crews was reduced by leaves, which were usually concentrated in moonlight periods. To preserve security, Harris had not reduced leaves. Some pathfinders, using H2S, were to drop the new red spot fires on Ruder Island to establish a final checkpoint for the run into the target. They would then drop markers and flares over the targets. Finally, six planes would aim yellow markers visually
