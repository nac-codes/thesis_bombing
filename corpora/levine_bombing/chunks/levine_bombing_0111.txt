overoptimistic, for neither attack was a good model for "normal" operations. Both were carried out in moonlight from relatively low altitude, against easily located targets. Nor, in the case of Peenemünde, was the bombing particularly accurate. But the equipment, and nearly all the techniques, that made precision attacks possible in 1944-Oboe, H2S, good VHF communica- tions, red spot fire markers, the master bomber technique, offset marking, and time-and-distance runs-were already available by late August 1943. Harris, however, showed little interest in the possibilities they offered. He let 617 Squadron continue to practice precision techniques, and even made a few ex- perimental precision attacks with the main force, but on the whole, these were fewer than before. He resisted calls to bomb Schweinfurt and concentrated more than ever on area attacks. 65 Right after Peenemünde Harris had seemed ready to try new techniques. On the night of August 22-23 he sent 462 bombers to Leverkusen, aiming not at the center of the town but at a chemical plant. No master bomber was used. But the Oboe gear partly failed, and clouds hid the markers. Although this misfire was due to bad luck and unfavorable circumstances, Harris did not repeat the experiment. The fact that he had sent only three-quarters of his Lancasters and Halifaxes, and used the night to rest the Stirling units, suggests that he had undertaken it without much conviction. Harris apparently wanted to start a campaign against Berlin to force Germany's surrender. Given all-out concentration, he thought it possible to beat Germany in 1943. On August 23-24 he struck Berlin with 719 planes. The attack failed; 62 bombers were lost. Two more attacks on Berlin, on August 31-September 1 and September 3-4, also went wrong. The British estimated that for all three nights, just 27 planes dropped their loads within three miles of the aiming point, while losses averaged an unbearable 7.2 percent. Berlin was heavily defended, an
