loaded, and many crews jettisoned their blockbusters en route to gain height and speed. What were scornfully called "fringe merchants," who bombed as soon as they saw markers rather than aiming at them, became fairly common. More and more elaborate feints and evasive routing had to be used, forcing reduction of bombloads in favor of fuel. The Germans became harder to fool and their tactics more effective. There was an unusually long stand-down during and after the moonlight period in February. Losses were prevented from rising even more only by turning away from Berlin to other targets, especially in southern Ger- many, but the worst losses of all were yet to be suffered, over Leipzig and Nuremberg. After mid-February 1944 Harris launched only one further attack on Berlin. On January 14 he was directed to attack towns that housed key installations making ball bearings and fighters, with Schweinfurt given the top priority. He resisted the directive to attack Schweinfurt and insolently delayed doing so, finally striking it on February 24-25-too late to do any good. (See Chapter 6.) He was only now joining in a true combined offensive with the Americans, over half a year after one had been nominally agreed on. On March 4 he was ordered to attack Friedrichshafen to hurt the production of tank gearboxes and engines and radar, and to make "every effort" to do so during the March moonlight  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 68 Area Bombing & the Defeat of Bomber Command period, itself a sign of the importance attached to this target. But he did not attack it until April 27-28. In the meantime, it became clear that attacks deep in Germany were no longer possible. An attack on Leipzig on February 19-20 marked the real end of the Battle of Berlin. Harris sent 832 bombers there; winds scattered the bomber stream and gave the Germans plenty of time to steer fighters into it. The British lost 78 planes-9.6 percent of the force. Harris withdrew the older models of the Halifax fro
