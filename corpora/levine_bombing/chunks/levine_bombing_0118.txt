at the "long leg" of the course. But 795 heavy bombers took off. Strong winds dispersed the bombers, slowing them and forcing some off course. There were no high clouds, and the bombers left condensation trails, making them even easier to find. Over 200 night fighters attacked. Some desperate pilots deliberately left the bomber stream; others jettisoned bombs to gain height. Weather forced an emergency resort to sky markers, and the attack failed. In all, 545 British airmen were killed. Bomber Command lost 95 planes; a dozen more were junked. Although the extent of the disaster was clearly due to at- tacking on a night unsuitable for operations and bad planning, this was not a freakish episode.24 The Battle of Berlin had ended in defeat. From November 18, 1943, to March 31, 1944, the British had launched 35 major attacks (16 on Berlin), with an overall missing rate of 5.2 percent; 1,047 bombers had been lost, not counting the ones scrapped after return. Bomber Command was in no danger of destruction; its strength had actually risen, from 864 operational planes with crews in November 69 to 974 in March. But it could not go on facing the sort of losses it regularly suffered deep in Germany. (Losses on attacks on western Germany were still bearable.) It is arguable that Bomber Command had reached a dead end that had been inevitable, or nearly so, from the moment it switched over to night operations in 1940. The very developments that made it possible for a bomber to reach targets at night effectively exposed it, to an even greater extent, to a night fighter. If Bomber Command and other forces did not cripple Germany before the Nazis made their defenses effective-and Harris's obsession with general area attack sank any chance of that-then the British air offensive had to eventually hit the brick wall it encountered in 1944. Its diversion to preparing for D-Day, which will be more fully described later, prevented general recognition of the defeat. D-Day saved Bomber Com
