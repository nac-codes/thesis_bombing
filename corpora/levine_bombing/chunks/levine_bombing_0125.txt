created the Combined Chiefs of Staff, to settle issues of strategy and policy. Churchill learned that the Americans still aimed to defeat Germany first and that they shared his desire to send heavy bombers to Britain to attack Germany. The Combined Chiefs already knew that AWPD-1 could not be carried out without grave delays; they estimated that only 16 bomber and 5 fighter groups could go to England in 1942. The mission of these groups was left vague, but it was accepted that they would initially concentrate on "counter-air" operations against enemy air strength, and not on attacking Germany itself.4 THE EIGHTH AIR FORCE In January 1942 the Eighth Air Force, commanded by Gen. Carl Spaatz, was activated in Georgia. Its ultimate strength was to reach 60 combat groups by April 1943, including 17 heavy bomber groups and 12 fighter groups. But most of its units were still training; in fact, most were inadequately trained even when sent overseas. Nor were its fighter units adequately equipped, except for the few with P-38s. Some groups with P-39s and P-40s were reequipped with "reverse lend-lease" Spitfires. Spaatz sent General Eaker, who would take over VIIIth Bomber Command, and several staff officers to Britain to prepare for the Eighth's arrival. Despite differences of opinion over tactics and strategy, the Eighth's advance echelon 75 established a close relationship with the RAF that was vital to its success. Eaker became a good friend of Harris and arranged for American bases (the Eighth's most comfortable bases were prewar RAF stations), British training for air in- telligence officers and photographic interpreters, and a complete integration of communications. Until well into 1943, all of the Eighth Air Force's radar, and most of its radios, were British built, and it relied on the British Ministry of Aircraft Production for essential maintenance. In June 1942 the ground element of the Eighth's combat units crossed the Atlantic aboard the Queen Elizabeth. Had a
