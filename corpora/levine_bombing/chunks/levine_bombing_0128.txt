Churchill and Portal were particularly critical of the idea of the self-defending bomber. Portal predicted that the Americans would be unable to defend themselves or bomb accurately under heavy attack. At best, he believed they would be reduced to infrequent and costly area attacks on the Ruhr, and perhaps Hamburg. For an effective force, even by 1944, they would have to switch to night attacks soon. Churchill was even more vehement. He told FDR's special assistant, Harry Hopkins, that the Americans should turn to night bombing and build Lancasters. Sinclair and Harris urged restraint upon Churchill, lest too strong an attack on AAF policy play into the hands of the United States Navy and other elements that wanted to switch the American effort to the Pacific. Churchill stopped opposing the American course only at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943. However, some RAF officers, notably the assistant chief of staff, Sir John Slessor, were optimistic about the Americans' plans. The American's first mis- sions to targets in France and the Low Countries were mostly within the range of British fighter escort. But their apparent success, or at least low losses, and high claims of destroyed German fighters converted some British officers who had been skeptical earlier. In December 1942 Harris blithely predicted that the British and American heavies, operating together in daylight, could wipe out the enemy fighter force.7 By then not even Eaker was that optimistic. In the summer of 1942 the Eighth was not ready to strike a major blow against Germany. On August 25 Spaatz issued a list of specific targets, all in occupied Western Europe, including aircraft plants and repair depots, marshalling yards, and submarine installations. In September Spaatz agreed on a broad joint direc- tive with the British; they would continue to supply most of the Eighth's fighter support until the Americans could take over the job. Targets would be picked in consultation with the RAF's ass
