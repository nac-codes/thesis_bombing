to return to base. Even this system. however, fell down, because there were usually many gunners firing at the same plane and then submitting claims for it destruction. And "destroyed" planes sometimes reached home. Even the gun-camera films that normally served as conclusive proof for the claims of fighter pilots could mislead; in one case an Me-109 photographed as apparently exploding actually survived. Its drop tank had blown up, hiding it in a ball of fire.14 On October 21 the Eighth began the campaign against the U-boat bases with an attack on Lorient; this was its first venture beyond fighter escort. Attacks on the submarine bases, interspersed with a few strikes against air bases and transport targets, continued for the rest of 1942. It was already understood that the U-boat pens were immune to existing bombs, but it was hoped that the locks floating docks, power plants, railroad yards, and warehouses around them could be damaged, hampering the repairs and turnaround of the U-boats. Between November 1942 and March 1943 the Eighth Air Force sent out more than 100 bombers on just two days. Shortages of spare parts and replacement personnel ate away at it; in February 1943 the Eighth had an average of just 74 planes with crews ready for operations. No replacement crews arrived at all between February and May; for a time Eaker extended a crewman's tour from 25 to 30 missions. In 1943 the chance of an Eighth Air Force bomber crewman finishing a tour of operations was about 34 percent-barely higher than that of the men in Bomber Command. It was true, though, that his chance of sur viving the war was better. When a B-17 or B-24 went down, most of the crew usually bailed out; British airmen were less lucky. Fall and winter weather hampered the Eighth's operations. Only three mis- sions were completed in October, and none at all between October 21 and November 7. When they did fly the crews froze; ice even threatened to choke their inadequate oxygen masks. In terms o
