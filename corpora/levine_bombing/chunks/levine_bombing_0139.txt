in that period, went to countering the submarines. On January 27 the Eighth bombed Germany for the first time, sending 90 bombers against the submarine yards at Vegesack. Bad weather, however, forced a diversion to the less important target of Wilhelmshaven. Only 55 planes reached this objective, meeting less opposition than expected. Both the bombing and the interception were hampered by the weather, while the German defenders seemed less experienced than those met over France. Three bombers went down in exchange for seven German fighters. Subsequent missions to Germany were tougher, although they were limited to "fringe" targets on the North Sea coast and the Americans took advantage of the fact that most of the way to the target was over water. That reduced the Germans' warning time, and their single-engine fighter pilots were reluctant to fly far out to sea. On a February 4 mission to Emden, the Americans encountered twin-engine enemy fighters for the first time. These were no match for Allied fighters, but their heavy firepower and great endurance made them a threat to unescorted bombers. Later in the month, when they returned to Wilhelmshaven, the Americans met stronger fighter opposi- tion. And the Germans tried a new trick, air-to-air bombing. Fortunately this never worked very well. Over the next several months the Eighth Air Force periodically visited Ger- man targets, almost all concerned with submarine construction, while it pounded away at the French bases. In March, when not striking submarine targets, it mostly attacked French marshalling yards. From April on, it shifted the "marginal" effort to attacking vehicle plants in France and Belgium. On March 18 it finally bombed the Vegesack construction yards. Careful routing postponed the meeting with enemy interceptors until the last minute, and just 2 bombers of the 97 reaching the target were lost. (A third was scrapped after return.) On this mission new techniques produced the most accurate bombing, a
