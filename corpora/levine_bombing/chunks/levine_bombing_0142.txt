actually more important than the commanders of Luftflotte Reich and Luftflotte 3. (The latter command controlled the defense of southern Germany as well as of occupied Western Europe.) Despite everything the Allies did, the Germans remained able to replace lost planes. But one critical factor had begun to turn against the Germans. Their Der pilots were not as well trained as their predecessors, or as the Allied pilots they faced. In the summer of 1942 a fuel shortage and the desire to get new pilots as fast as possible had led to a reduction in the hours of training. The number of new pilots grew, but their average number of flying hours fell. 17 But the Luft waffe was far from the end of its rope, and even unskilled fighter pilots could be deadly opponents for the bombers. THE VIIIth FIGHTER COMMAND The Eighth Air Force's bombers were slow to get help from American fighters After delays caused by design difficulties, P-47C Thunderbolt fighters began ar- riving in Britain in late December 1942. Their engines and radios were still full of "bugs." The P-47 was a new plane, and VIIIth Fighter Command had to break it in. Clumsy looking, it was so big and heavy that many doubted it could take on the Me-109 and Focke-Wulf 190, its newer stablemate. The 4th Fighter Group's Spitfire veterans, in particular, grumbled that it was a "seven-ton milk bottle" and that evasive action in a P-47 would mean running around inside its roomy cockpit. But once some problems were solved, it proved a superb plane. even better in some ways than the famous P-51 Mustang, discussed in Chapter 7. It was more rugged; its air-cooled engine was more resistant to damage; and with eight .50-caliber guns, it was more heavily armed. Tests showed that it was faster than the Me-109 and FW-190, could outdive them, and could turn with them above 15,000 feet. But it was not good lower down, and its rates of climb and acceleration were poor, as was visibility from its cockpit. Later modifications-paddle-bl
