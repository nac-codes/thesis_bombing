Ball bear- ings to some degree replaced synthetic rubber as a "small" objective, concen- trated in a few plants, destruction of which would disrupt the whole enemy war effort. But the plan was modified before being presented to the Combined Chiefs of Staff at a Washington conference in May, when the aim of combining the British and American efforts was soft pedalled and the stress on selective attack weakened. By securing these changes the British leaders forestalled a serious debate on air strategy. The Combined Chiefs of Staff readily approved the plan and ordered a major attack on the Ploesti oil refineries. Operations from Britain remained under Portal's direction. The Americans had not forced a showdown over air strategy. This was unfor- tunate but probably inevitable; their own achievements, so far, had been slight. It remained up to the British as to whether there might yet be a real combined offensive, for the RAF leaders still disagreed among themselves. But Harris won the argument and got the directive he wanted. The specific objectives of the offensive were now for the Eighth Air Force alone. Bomber Command would engage in "the general disorganization of German industry," although its ac- tions were to be "designed as far as practicable to be complementary to the opera- tions of the Eighth Air Force."20  6 The Abortive Offensive of June-October 1943 In April 1943 four new B-17 groups reached Britain. They became operational in May. The 92nd Bomb Group, which had arrived in 1942 but had been relegated to training duties, returned to operations. In May and June seven more B-17 groups and four groups of B-26 medium bombers arrived. The Eighth Air Force was now ready to go beyond fringe areas. A mission on June 11 to Bremen and Wilhelmshaven, far beyond escort range, showed th
