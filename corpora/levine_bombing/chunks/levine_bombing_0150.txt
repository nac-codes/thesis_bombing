e drop-tanks. Ef. forts toward getting them, however, were slow. As noted earlier, the Ministry of Aircraft Production was at first unresponsive, but it eventually proved far more helpful than did the Air Material Command at home. Eaker did get a supply of 200-gallon paper "belly" tanks from the United States in March 1943. but they had been designed solely for ferrying fighters at low altitudes. Clumsy and poorly shaped, they caused considerable drag and tended to leak if loaded and left standing for several hours. Worse, they could not be used over 23,000 feet. At normal combat altitudes drop-tanks had to be pressurized, and to draw fuel from them the P-47s themselves had to be modified. While the VIIIth Fighter Command's able Air Technical Section worked on the P-47, it also, with the help of British engineers, designed a 108-gallon metal drop-tank. The tanks were successfully tested in May, but a steel shortage prevented the British from producing them immediately and as a substitute the British offered a 108-gallon paper tank developed for their own use. Production snags delayed the appearance of the paper tank until September. The Air Material Command in the States had been asked for tanks of comparable size, but moved sluggishly. The Fifth Air Force, in Australia, like the Eighth, had to get local help. Finally VIIIth Fighter Command obtained 200-gallon paper tanks from the U.S. which were introduced on July 28. Only half-filled, they were used to climb 91 to 22,000 feet and were usually dropped on crossing the enemy coast. Even this extended the P-47s' radius of action from 190 to 260 miles. Finally, in August, so-called 75-gallon metal tanks (they actually held 85 gallons) arrived from the United States; they were introduced in combat before the end of the month. These tanks extended the P-47's radius to 340 miles. The British began supply- ing 108-gallon paper and metal tanks the next month; when properly used the British tanks eventually gave a radius of
