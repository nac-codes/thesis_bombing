P-47 and getting new fighter groups into action, and they disagreed with him about escort tactics. Hunter favored sweeping well ahead of the bombers, while the bomber men wanted very close escort-too close, in fact. They also blamed Hunter for not getting more range out of the P-47s. He had been reluctant to use drop-tanks at all and then had favored dropping them at the earliest possible moment. Although many of his pilots thought he was out of touch with operational realities, be appreciated the fact that they wished not just to get rid of the clumsy belly tanks but to use up the fuel in the internal tanks behind their seats as soon as possible Those tanks were the most dangerous to them if they were hit. This was en- tirely natural, but the bomber men, just as naturally, took a different view of the risks. On August 3, to the relief of both fighter pilots and bomber com manders, Hunter was replaced by the abler William Kepner.2 "BLITZ WEEK" After the HÃ¼ls mission, bad weather prevented attacks on Germany. The Eighth bombed U-boat installations, airfields, and aircraft plants in France. In late July the weather cleared. As the RAF began the Battle of Hamburg, the Eighth Air Force launched a series of operations later called Blitz Week, with much heavier and more continuous attacks, deeper in enemy territory than before, largely against aircraft and naval targets. On July 24 the Eighth paid the first of its few visits to Norway, sending 309 bombers to attack U-boat bases at Bergen and Trondheim, and an industrial target at Heroya. It was a long flight; the Trondheim attack meant a round-trip of 1,900 miles and was the longest mission yet carried out by the Eighth Ai Force. Since the defenses were weak, the B-17s could bomb from lower heights and with greater accuracy than usual. The U-boat bases were assigned to the 4th Bombardment Wing, which had late-model B-17Fs of longer range. The Trondheim port area was severely damaged. The force sent to Bergen found it cov
