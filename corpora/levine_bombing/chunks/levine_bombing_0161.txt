They were commanded by Brig. Gen. Uzal Ent, who flew with the 376th Group's commander, Col. Keith Compton, but as the result of a last minute switch, not in the lead plane. The mission was already less than a com plete secret. The force maintained radio silence, but the German intercept service had picked up a routine signal between ground stations, warning Allied com- mands in the theater that an operation was on. Near Corfu, things began going wrong. As the force started climbing, the lead plane went out of control and crashed. The backup lead plane then aborted its mission. Then, as the B-24s approached the Pindus range, they encountered towering clouds. The 376th and 93rd Groups climbed further, to 16,000 feet. to get above the clouds. But Col. John Kane, the commander of the 98th Group. elected to fly through them. He knew that many of his planes had no oxygen, not having expected to need it. (They were already overloaded.) The force had split into two sections, which lost sight of each other. The two high-flying lead groups got the benefit of a tail wind and pulled farther ahead of the three groups behind Kane. With radio silence, such a situation was hard to avoid. The enemy, 97 however, repeatedly spotted the Americans, and Kane's planes were shot at over Albania. A German radar in Bulgaria detected the Americans, and ancient Bulgarian biplanes tried to intercept them; they sighted the B-24s but could not overtake them. The two lead groups pushed on. The 376th Group's leading planes were pass- ing the town of Targoviste en route to Floresti when Ent broke radio silence. He, or someone else aboard his plane, mistook Targoviste for Floresti. Visibili- ty was bad thanks to haze, and the two places looked alike-each had a castle and a valley running southeast with a railroad line in it. Believing the lead planes were mistakenly passing Floresti, Ent ordered a turn southeast. Several pilots warned that this was a mistake, but when Ent flew on down the Targoviste
