a railroad line in it. Believing the lead planes were mistakenly passing Floresti, Ent ordered a turn southeast. Several pilots warned that this was a mistake, but when Ent flew on down the Targoviste- Bucharest railroad line, all but one followed him. The lead plane ignored Ent and, all alone, took the right course. Badly damaged by flak, it bombed the Colombia Aquila refinery-not its planned target-and belly-landed. Fifteen minutes later, with Bucharest in sight, Ent ordered a turn north. He had probably known earlier that he had blundered, for the run from Floresti to Ploesti was supposed to take four minutes. But with visibility limited, he probably wanted to be absolutely sure of where he was. This was prudent, but what happened later suggested that Ent, a normally able man of undoubted courage, had become confused. Colonel Compton later said that Ent was seek- ing the Astra Romana refinery (assigned to Kane's 98th Group), but other pilots of the 376th Group thought he intended to attack the originally planned target, the Romana Americana refinery, from the south, or even take them all the way around to Floresti to get on the planned approach route. Ent, who was later paralyzed in an accident and died a few years after the war, never gave a full explanation. Ent's planes met a storm of fire on the way north. Flak guns emerged from hiding places in haystacks and railroad cars. Machine guns and even small arms shot at the B-24s. Ent sheered east of Ploesti and the ring of refineries-and guns-around it. He came near the Romana Americana refinery, but the enemy fire was so great that Ent gave up. He ordered the 376th Group to attack "targets of opportunity." Strangely, he then sent a signal, "Mission successful," to Libya. Most of his planes bombed nearby marshalling yards and storage tanks, or even open fields. One flight leader, Maj. Norman Appold, led some planes around to the northeast to bomb the Concordia Vega refinery, originally assigned to the 93rd Group.
