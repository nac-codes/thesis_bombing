The 93rd, meanwhile, had gone straight north from Bucharest and attacked the nearest refineries, Colombia Aquila and Astra Romana. It lost 11 planes over the target, including the group commander's. Meanwhile, Kane's force was on the way. Kane, too, was confused.

Then he resumed course. At Pitesti the 389th Group broke off for Campina. But like Ent, Colonel Jack Wood was confused by deceptively similar valleys.
