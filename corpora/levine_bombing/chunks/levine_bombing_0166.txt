lants, at Regensburg in Bavaria and Wiener Neustadt in Austria, which made 500 of the 650 Me-109s built every month, had not yet been attacked. Even before Blitz Week, an elaborate coordinated assault had been planned. The Ninth Air Force's B-24 groups would strike Wiener Neustadt from the south, as soon as possible after Ploesti. On the same day, Le May's 4th Bombardment Wing, with its long-range Fortresses, would bomb Regensburg, while the 1st Wing carried out a diversionary operation. The dual assault from north and south would allow surprise blows against both Messerschmitt plants, splitting and confusing the Germans.

Of 101 bombers put up, 65 bombed the target, taking the Germans by surprise. Only 2 bombers were lost.

Meanwhile, the planners had decided to combine the Regensburg and Schwein- furt missions. Ten minutes after Le May's force left for Regensburg and Africa, the 1st Bombardment Wing would take off for Schweinfurt. It was hoped that the 4th Wing would attract most of the enemy's fighters. The Eighth's heavies would be aided by a mass of diversionary operations. No one imagined that this would be an easy mission. The unprecedentedly deep penetration alarmed the crews at the briefings.
