extra miles of range out of the clumsy 200-gallon tanks, and it jumped the pursuing Germans. Three Thunderbolts went down with their pilots, but a dozen German fighters were shot down, probably saving several bombers. Along with the rescue of six B-17 crews from the sea, this was almost the sole merciful occurrence of the day. The Schweinfurt force had lost 36 Fortresses. In all, of 376 B-17s, 60 had gone down and 11 had to be scrapped. Seven Allied fighters were lost. The Americans alone had lost 601 men: 102 killed, 381 prisoners, and 20 interned in Switzerland, while 38 fell in enemy territory but managed to evade capture. The Germans had lost about 47 planes, but only 16 men killed. Only about 21 planes had fallen to the bomber gunners, who claimed to have shot down 288! The Regensburg attack did a lot of damage to Me-109 production, and it paid an unexpected dividend: it destroyed the fuselage jigs and acceptance gauges for the Me-262 jet fighter. But the attack was not the crushing blow that had been hoped for. The Germans recovered many machine-tools even though the buildings they were in were smashed. More tools were rushed from the Skoda works, and the factory was dispersed, first to "shadow" workshops in nearby towns and then to forest clearings. Production recovered and even increased.  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 102 The Abortive Offensive The Schweinfurt attack was a comparative failure. Only one of the three main plants was seriously damaged. Although many machines were moved from the badly hit Kugelfischer plant to a branch facility, there was no major effort to disperse the industry. Fearing that it would cost too much production, Speer gambled that the Allies did not really recognize the ball bearings industry' importance. However, he did secure still greater antiaircraft defenses for Schwein furt, and he took steps to increase production elsewhere.7 BREATHING SPACE AND BUILDUP The Eighth attacked aircraft factories and air bases in France and
