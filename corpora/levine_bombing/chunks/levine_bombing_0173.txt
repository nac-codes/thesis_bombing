first operation against Emden; this was also the first mission to a German target that was escorted all the way. The target area was an important port, giving a good H2S picture. Two forces, comprising 305 B-17s, were sent out, each led by two H2S planes. The lead wings bombed on signals from the Pathfinder planes, which dropped smoke markers to guide the following wings. The results were mixed; half the H2S sets failed, and the markers vanished before the last wings of each force could bomb. Another attempt on Emden would be made on October 2. The wings that bombed on signal had achieved a circular error of half a mile to a mile, but dropping on markers had been wildly inaccurate, producing an average error of over five miles. More and better radar was needed, but even with it, this sort of bombing would be no more than a poor way to keep up the pressure on Germany when visual bombing was impossible. Crewmen re- ferred to such attacks as "women and children's day." Strangely, the Eighth Air Force made little use of Oboe. In early 1943 the British did not want it risked over Germany in planes that were a lot more likely to be shot down than Mosquitos. Later experiments were plagued by equip- ment failure, while the limited range of Oboe probably discouraged more effort to make it work. Even in late 1944, with more and better equipment and far more experience, over half the radar missions failed. One advantage of such missions, however, was that the Germans were reluctant to send their pilots, who now were not usually instrument trained, through solid overcast. They even- tually formed two special "bad weather units," Jagdgeschwader 300 and 301, of pilots who could be trusted in such conditions.9 A SECOND BLITZ WEEK On October 4 a mission to Frankfurt and the Saar was foiled by bad weather. Then better conditions allowed a series of missions reminiscent of Blitz Week, culminating in the horrifying second attack on Schweinfurt. On October 8 the Americans attacked the
