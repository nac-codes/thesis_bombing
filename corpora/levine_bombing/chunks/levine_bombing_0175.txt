ets in other ways; transportation was not a high-priority target at this time, and even a destructive isolated attack would not hurt Germany's flexible rail system. (As we shall see later, however, attacks on a few targets. one near M端nster, could have wrecked the German waterway system.) M端nster was deep in Germany, and the Eighth was likely to meet strong opposition Morality apart, the mission was of doubtful wisdom. It was a nightmare. Plans to provide escort all the way to M端nster miscarried The 56th Fighter Group, which was to take the bombers to the target, joined the Fortresses late and had to leave early; 200 German fighters then piled into the leading combat wing. Twin-engine fighters, and even bombers, fired rockets and large-caliber cannon, while single-engine fighters attacked head-on, destroy- ing all 12 planes of the leading 100th Bomb Group. Then the Germans hit the 390th Group, flying the high position, and destroyed half its planes. The battle lasted until the withdrawal escort arrived. In all, 30 bombers were lost and 3 written off. Two groups of the relatively unhurt second task force, forced off the bomb run at M端nster by mistake, completed the disaster. Trying to hit an airfield at Entschede in the Netherlands as a "target of opportunity," they ac- cidentally killed 155 Dutch civilians. It was not one of the Eighth Air Force's better days. 10 SCHWEINFURT II Weather and the need for rest prevented operations for three days. The Eighth had already lost 88 bombers, as many as in the whole of the first Blitz Week. 105 Now it had to return to Schweinfurt, the hardest target of all. Photographs had shown that repairs there were proceeding rapidly. Eaker had put off the dreaded day, hoping to have some P-38s to sweep in front of the bombers most of the way to Schweinfurt. But the P-38s were not ready. There would be no escort most of the way, but the mission was carefully planned to take the maximum advantage of mass, while making it hard for the same
