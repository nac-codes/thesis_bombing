to Schweinfurt. But the P-38s were not ready. There would be no escort most of the way, but the mission was carefully planned to take the maximum advantage of mass, while making it hard for the same German fighters to hit more than one bomber division on a single sortie. The 1st Bombardment Divi- sion would lead the attack, and the 3rd Division would fly a parallel course slightly farther south and 30 minutes behind it. Near Aachen their courses would diverge; the 3rd Division would fly south for a time before turning sharply east to Schweinfurt. The 2nd Division's B-24s would fly farther south, and come in to the target right behind the 3rd Division. If the factories could not be seen, they would hit the center of the city. Morale was already low; the men received the news that they were going to Schweinfurt with shock. Some returned to barracks to change into their best uniforms, expecting to need them in the POW camps or to be buried in them. Gunners took aboard extra ammunition, sometimes so much that their officers ordered some of it removed; the planes were already overloaded. Weather hampered the force. Just 29 of the 60 B-24s got into formation, too few to enter enemy territory, so the 2nd Division flew a diversion over the North Sea. Many Fortresses aborted; 383 took off, but only 291 set out across the English Channel. Small forces of German fighters went for bombers of both divisions before the escorts left; the Thunderbolts destroyed 13 fighters, while losing two planes themselves. (Three more P-47s were junked after return.) Over the Rhineland, between Aachen and Düren, the P-47s turned back. Then the main German attacks on the 1st Division started. Stukas staggered above the B-17s to drop time-fused bombs, but fighters, aided by some rocket-carrying bombers, were the main enemy, in the most furious air battle of the war. The Germans used the same tactics as at Münster, concentrating on a single formation at a time. Single-engine fighters, some using r
