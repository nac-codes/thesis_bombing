the August 17 mission, this one had been as well planned and executed as such an opera tion could possible be; after hours of the fiercest imaginable attack, the bomb ing had been better than could have reasonably been expected. One or two more Schweinfurts could break the Eighth Air Force. It never again ventured in strength beyond fighter escort. Small ball bearings plants in France and Italy were hit, but the Allies did not strike Schweinfurt again until late February 1944.11 had expected. The Swedes had promised not to increase their exports of ball bearings beyond a certain monetary value, but they adjusted their exports to give the Germans exactly the types of bearings they needed most. Moreover, the Germans were able to redesign machinery to reduce the use of ball bearings much faster than the Allies had expected, and they substituted plain bearings for ball bearings far more easily than had been supposed. 12 Ball bearings as a target system had proven a false trail, and the fortunes of the Eighth Air Force had reached their nadir. This was a good thing for the Germans. The factories at Schweinfurt had been badly damaged; more incendiaries had been used than in the first attack, and fires raged. The flames did more damage to tools than anything but a direct hit by HE bombs would have done. The Americans, analyzing reconnaissance photographs and receiving pleasant reports from Swedish sources, were optimistic. Speer, in a near panic, appointed Philip Kessler, his most trusted associate, com- missioner of ball bearings production. The Germans belatedly dispersed the in- dustry and sought a porcelain substitute for metal bearings in nonprecision machinery. After the war Speer estimated that armaments production would have been crucially weakened after two months and brought to a standstill in four if the Allies had made an all-out, continued attack on the ball bearings industry. His views have been widely cited and sound impressive, particularly since they were
