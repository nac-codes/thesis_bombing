brought to a standstill in four if the Allies had made an all-out, continued attack on the ball bearings industry. His views have been widely cited and sound impressive, particularly since they were an indictment of his own failure to disperse the industry earlier. The immediate cause of the defeat of the ball bearings campaign was the American inability to continue the attacks and Harris's refusal to take part. But there is a good reason to think that Speer exaggerated, and that Allied analysts had been over- enthusiastic about ball bearings as a target. It soon became apparent that the damage to the ball bearings plants was less than the Americans and even the Germans themselves had supposed. The cleanup at the factories showed that perhaps just 10 percent of the machines were total losses. And the plants were so well organized that they could con- tinue some production even after heavy damage. And most important, the Germans found that they were not so short of ball bearings as they had sup- posed! Kessler instituted a rigid system of controls, to insure that every bearing was found and properly used. Under his system it was discovered that the in- dustries using them had six to twelve months' supplies of almost all types. Additionally, the Allies had overestimated the time needed to replace the specialized machines needed by the ball bearings industry-it took four months instead of nine. The Germans received more help from Sweden than the Allies  7 The Struggle for Air Superiority, November 1943-April 1944 The Eighth Air Force soon recovered its strength. A flow of replacements and new units, better trained than earlier arrivals, made it stronger than ever. The Eighth had grown from 20 complete heavy bomber groups in October to 25 by the end of 1943. VIIIth Fighter Command grew to 12 groups. The groups themselves were being strengthened, so that instead of putting up three squadrons of 16 planes each, some groups were starting to fly two separate, A and B group
