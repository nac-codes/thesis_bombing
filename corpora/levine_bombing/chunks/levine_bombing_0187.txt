ted that the P-51 could take the added weight, but tests with tanks filled with water showed that it could. The AAF ordered 2,200 of the Merlin-powered P-51Bs, but Arnold did not give the Mustang all-out priority until after June 1943, possibly fearing that it would interfere with pro- duction of the proven Thunderbolt. Nor were all P-51Bs allotted to the Eighth Air Force until October. But these were just the last of a series of unnecessary blunders made with the Mustang. Arnold later admitted that the fact that it was not available sooner was the AAF's own fault. It seems likely that, had the AAF shown more interest in the Mustang and tried Packard Merlins in it as soon as they became available, the Eighth Air Force would have had P-51Bs by early 1943. Belated or not, the P-51B was a remarkable plane. Its profile and big fuel tanks, and the low fuel consumption of the Merlin-half that of the Pratt and Whitney in the P-47-gave it tremendous range. On its internal tanks alone it could fly 475 miles and back; with two 75-gallon tanks under the wings it had a radius of 650 miles; and with two 108-gallon tanks its radius leaped to 850 miles, making missions to any part of German-held Europe possible. It was faster than the existing models of the Me-109 and FW-190 in level flight, and outclimbed both. It could easily outdive the FW-190, and overhaul the Me-109 in a prolonged dive, and could outturn the Me-109 and, usually, the FW-190. The first P-51Bs reached England in November 1943 and equipped the Ninth Air Force's 354th Fighter Group, which was assigned to escort duty with the Eighth. It flew its first mission, a fighter sweep, on December 1, and escorted bombers to Amiens on December 5. On December 11 the 354th took the bombers to Emden, and on December 20 it was engaged in a major battle over  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 114 The Struggle for Air Superiority Bremen. The P-51s and P-38s of the target-area escort stopped the German twin engine fighters from gett
