ld seem that the bombers would have been better occupied striking other targets. But the Germans could not replace good pilots. The true value of Big Week was the destruction of German planes, and pilots, in the air. The heavy bombers served as the anvil on which the escort fighters hammered the Luftwaffe fighter  122 The Strategic Bombing of Germany The Struggle for Air Superiority force. The effectiveness of the Mustang is suggested by the fact that the 354th Group, the only unit with much experience with it, claimed 46.5 German fighters for only 3 Mustangs lost during Big Week. Actual German losses are unclear; their records were jumbled, and a variety of figures can be extracted. In January they had lost 307 fighters (day and night) in the West alone, and 292 fighter pilots, or 12.1 percent of the total available at the start of the month, in all theaters. In February they probably lost at least 355 dau fighters alone, and a total of 225 pilots and crewmen in combat over Germany Other figures for that month suggest that combat losses in February may have beer as high as 533 planes in the West alone, including 65 night fighters, with 434 total fighter pilot losses from all causes in all theaters, of 17.9 percent of the total pilot force at the start of the month. Whatever the real numbers were-and pilot losses were probably more carefully recorded than losses of planes, something at which the Luftwaffe was sloppy-the Germans were losing a massive proportion of their trained men. After Big Week they no longer always resisted American attacks all. out. Some attacks were almost ignored, while others were fiercely opposed.15 Out side "Greater Germany" the Nazis did not seriously contest attacks, save on Ploesti BERLIN Big Week was just the opening blow of the climactic struggle for the air. During March and April the Eighth Air Force alone attacked aircraft and ball bearings targets in Germany on 27 days; when the weather there was impossible, it hit V-weapons sites
