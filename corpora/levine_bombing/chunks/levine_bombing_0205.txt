ir and another 8 on the ground. Conditions for bomb- ing were much better, and the Erkner plant was wrecked.16 The weather, none too good in early March, was even worse for most of the rest of the month. Later missions to Berlin and other targets bombed mostly on radar. Only on March 16 and 18 did the weather permit visual attacks on aircraft plants in southern Germany. The Germans strongly opposed these mis- sions and suffered heavy losses. After the 4th Fighter Group massacred another twin-engine fighter unit over Augsburg on March 16, the Germans employed them only in close conjunc- tion with single-engine fighters. One group of "heavy" fighters would be closely escorted by two groups of Me-109s, and FW-190s. But this dangerously restricted the freedom of action of the lighter planes, and assembling the large formations that the Luftwaffe had become accustomed to throw against the bombers had already proven dangerous. It consumed fuel and flying time, and the gathering formations could be seen a long way off. American fighters, now ranging far from the bombers, often interrupted their assembly with fatal results. Allied tac- ticians thought that the Germans should have used small formations and left it up to their ground controllers to insure that the fighters arrived at the right place and time.  124 The Strategic Bombing of Germany The Struggle for Air Superiority In March the Germans lost at least 357 day fighters downed, along with 94 night fighters, and over 300 German fighter pilots were killed over Germany alone. On all fronts from all causes during March, the Germans lost 511 fighter pilots, or 21.7 percent of the total at the start of the month. And several of those killed were among the Luftwaffe's ablest pilots.17 The hammering of the Luftwaffe continued through April, as the weather improved. The aircraft in- dustry continued to be the main target, as the Eighth revisited many of the plants in central and southern Germany that had been hit during Big
