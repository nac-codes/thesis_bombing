hrough April, as the weather improved. The aircraft in- dustry continued to be the main target, as the Eighth revisited many of the plants in central and southern Germany that had been hit during Big Week, as well as Schweinfurt. Strong escort allowed attacks on aircraft plants in northeastern Germany as well. An attack on Marienburg, which had required a tricky and costly diversion in 1943, now involved no unusual risk. When weather prevented the bombing of Germany, the fighters went alone on mass strafing missions against airfields and other targets. This was effective but costly; the Americans lost many more fighters to flak during strafing than to air combat. Few of their aces were shot down by German fighters, but many wound up behind barbed wire after one strafing pass too many. To flush out the Luftwaffe, the Eighth struck Berlin twice in April; the second mission to the capital provoked the reaction the Americans wanted. But the Nazis began replacing the twin-engined fighter units with the Sturmgruppen. equipped with heavily armed and armored FW-190A-8s. They were sluggish and unmaneuverable, so each Sturmgruppe was covered by at least two groups of standard fighters. The drawbacks of such big formations have already been noted but the FW-190A-8s were less vulnerable than their twin-engine counterparts and were deadly if they got at the bombers. When this happened, a single group of Allied bombers could suffer losses as bad as any over Schweinfurt, in minutes rather than hours. But the Luftwaffe only occasionally achieved a success of this sort. After April, direct support of the coming invasion absorbed most the efforts of the British and American strategic air forces. March and April 1944 had seen the bitterest air fighting of the war. The Allies had broken the power of the Luftwaffe. The Eighth Air Force had played the most important role in this costly victory. In April it suffered its heaviest losses in the whole war; 512 planes (361 heavy bombers) had
