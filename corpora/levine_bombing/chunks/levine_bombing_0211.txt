it to remain so. The Americans were insistent, and a nominal "compromise" reached on March 22, 1944, gave them what they wanted. The strategic air forces came under Eisenhower's direc tion, while Tedder would perform the actual task of coordinating them. Spaatz's USSTAF came directly under Eisenhower. The formal transfer of control over the strategic air forces took place on April 14, but Eisenhower had begun informally exercising his powers at the end of March. Already, on March 10, the Ninth Air Force had shifted from support of the Eighth to preinvasion tasks, save for its Mustangs, which continued escorting the heavies. On April 1 the demands of the invasion received priority for all the Allied air forces. This did not immediately cause a drastic change in the Eighth's operations. Eisenhower was sensible to the argument that missions to Germany were the best way to smash the Luftwaffe. Events vindicated this view. While the Eighth Air Force destroyed hundreds of planes in the air and on the ground in Ger- many itself, the tactical air forces' attacks in France were rarely intercepted; few planes were found on French bases. On April 17 Eisenhower's directive to Spaatz and Harris left "the destruction of German air combat strength" their immediate first objective. Their other main mission was to disrupt the enemy's rail communications, "particularly those affecting the enemy's movement toward the 'Overlord' lodgment area." The first priority for Spaatz's operations went to enemy fighter and ball bearing produc- tion; second priority went to installations supporting the German fighter force. followed by the German bomber force and its supporting installations. The enemy railroad system was the secondary objective. The directive to Sir Arthur Harris was, at least at first sight, vague. In view of the tactical difficulties of destroying precise targets by night, RAF Bomber Command will continue to be employed in accordance with their main aim of disorganizing German
