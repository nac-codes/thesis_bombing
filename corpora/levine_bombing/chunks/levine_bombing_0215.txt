le, although he would do his best to support it. He remarked, later in March, that the invasion could not succeed, but said, "I don't want any part of the blame. After it fails, we can show them how we can win by bombing."3 The tide, however, was against him, even though other opponents assembled formidable arguments against the Transportation Plan. They included Churchill. the chief of the Imperial General Staff, the British Joint Intelligence Commit tee, and the Ministry of Economic Warfare. Many agreed with Spaatz that in- derdiction would be more effective, and noted that wrecking the whole French and Belgian railroad system would hamper the Allies at a later stage. British railroad experts estimated that German military traffic used only a fifth of the system's capacity (the real proportion was a third), so that capacity would have to be reduced by more than 80 percent before the enemy would be hurt. Railroad centers were the worst place to try to interrupt service, because in such places many lines had to be cut to block traffic, and repairs would be easier than out in the country. Some, notably in the Economic Objectives Unit, questioned Zuckerman's analysis of operations in Sicily and Italy. They believed that the reduction of traffic into Sicily had resulted mainly from attacks on the ferries across the Straits of Messina. not from bombing marshalling yards, and that other results of bombing such yards had been exaggerated. Moreover, later experience in Italy was showing that bridge attacks were more effective, and less costly in bombs, than Zucker- man and Tedder had supposed. (Unfortunately, the evidence on this point was still inconclusive when the decision on the Transportation Plan had to be made.) 131 Last but not least, Churchill and the War Cabinet were horrified at the civilian deaths that attacks on rail centers would cause. An early estimate suggested that there would be 160,000 French and Belgian casualties, one-quarter of which would be fatal.
