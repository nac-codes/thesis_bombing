horrified at the civilian deaths that attacks on rail centers would cause. An early estimate suggested that there would be 160,000 French and Belgian casualties, one-quarter of which would be fatal. And Churchill thought that the Germans were using just a tenth of the rail traffic and could easily get around any trouble caused by the bombing. But proponents of the plan had a formidable list of arguments, and Eisenhower was unlikely to overrule both his deputy and the tactical air commander. General Lewis Brereton, the Ninth Air Force commander, backed them rather than Spaatz. Tedder and Leigh-Mallory pointed out the danger of waiting to start in on the enemy's transportation system until just before the invasion; among other things, it gambled too much on good weather. Harris had to reverse his position; Portal and others had become suspicious of him and on March 4 had ordered him to carry out experimental attacks on six French marshalling yards, as well as a precision attack on the tank engine and transmission plants at Friedrichshafen. The success of these attacks, which will be discussed later, showed that Bomber Command could participate in the Transportation Plan, and both Portal and Harris came to support it. The decision finally came down to Eisenhower on March 26. Spaatz made the case for the oil plan, arguing that the Luftwaffe would fight to defend oil installations, but not rail centers, and that smashing oil would hurt the enemy more. He did not stress the argument that interdiction would do the better job than attacks on rail centers. But the experts admitted that even a successful at- tack on oil would not hurt German military capabilities before D-Day. Ike was impressed by the potential of an oil attack and agreed to consider it when the first critical situation in Overlord was past. Although many present doubted that the Transportation Plan would be effective, Eisenhower commented that it was only necessary to show that there would be "some reductio
