The J-bombs were often duds, but when they went off, they sprayed spectacular jets of flame that hid the markers. Things went better over Munich on April 24-25. Cheshire led Mosquitos down through heavy flak to mark the marshalling yards, which were wrecked. This kind of success was not invariably repeated; an attack on the bearings plants and marshalling yards at Schweinfurt on April 26-27 was less ac- curate, and the bombers suffered heavily from fighters. The next night Bomber Command finally struck Friedrichshafen, nearly two months after Harris had been ordered to hit it. A force of 323 bombers (under half the number sent against Nuremberg a month earlier) dropped 1,234 tons of  134 The Strategic Bombing of Germany Strategic Air Offensive/The Normandy Invasion bombs on the place. Since the target was unusually far south and on the rim of the Germans' defensive system, the defenders were slow to react, although they did down 18 Lancasters. This, the sole attack by Bomber Command's main strength on that city during the war, proved the most damaging attack ever made on German tank production. Although in moonlight, the Friedrichshafen attack used standard pathfinder marking and showed how accurate British bombers could now be, even without dive-marking and beyond Oboe range. Cheshire's contributions were not finished; he devised a better formation for bombing in daylight and, borrowing a Mustang from the Americans, showed that it was even better for dive-marking than the Mosquito. Bomber Command could now hit German targets accurately but could not go deep into Germany regularly with reasonable losses. Trips as far as Brunswick. Munich, and Schweinfurt were atypical in this period. Most of its few ventures into Germany were no deeper than the Ruhr, and only in the most favorable conditions. Its new tactics reversed the process of concentration that had been underway since 1941. Instead of concentrating in a single massive bomber stream several forces attacked dif
