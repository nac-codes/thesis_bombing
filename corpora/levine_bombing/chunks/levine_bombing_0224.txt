4,400 tons of bombs were needed for bridge attacks, far less than against marshalling yards. Fighters of the tactical and strategic air forces helped to strangle traffic by attacking trains. These "Chattanooga Choo-Choo" missions, begun on May 21, concentrated on France and Belgium, but ranged as far as Poland. Napalm bombs were not yet available for fighter-bombers, but dropping belly tanks on stalled trains and setting them on fire helped persuade French train crews that working for the Germans was bad business as well as unpatriotic. Over 50,000 Germans and slave laborers were brought in, in an increasingly futile attempt to keep trains rolling; even so, daylight runs were sharply reduced even where the lines were not cut. By June 9 rail traffic in France had fallen to just 38 per- cent of the February level. Under continued pounding it fell off still more, and in the most critical areas it was even worse. German troops had to detrain far from the battle area, forcing costly and time-consuming road marches. The evidence strongly suggests that it was the bridge-busting campaign, not the bombing of rail centers, that wrecked the Germans' transportation efforts. Although some German officers were worried even before the interdiction strikes began, the immediate effect of the attacks on rail centers was to eliminate French civilian traffic from the railroads. Until the bridges were smashed, the German Army, at great cost, was still able to keep enough trains rolling to supply its vital needs and move troops. Bridge busting, largely carried out by medium bombers and fighter-bombers, was responsible for isolating the Normandy battlefield. The campaign against rail centers was thus a tragic mistake. It killed up to 12,000 civilians and was to hamper the Allied supply system at a later  136 The Strategic Bombing of Germany Strategic Air Offensive/The Normandy Invasion stage in the campaign. The bombs dropped on marshalling yards proved worse than useless. Much, if not a
