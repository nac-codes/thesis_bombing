air effort from important targets. Others feared that they were designed to house even deadlier things; poison gas or biological weapons were among the least fantastic guesses. The Eighth Air Force and, on a much smaller scale, Bomber Command, joined the tactical air forces in pounding the large sites and ski sites. They were damaged, but the results did not seem commensurate with the ef- fort. Although tests on duplicate ski sites, and an actual attack by Ninth Air Force Thunderbolts, showed that low-altitude strikes by fighter-bombers were far more effective on these objectives than the heavier planes, the British in- sisted on using the latter. Even if at unnecessary cost, the Allies seemed to have dealt with the ski sites, while Ninth Air Force bombers had damaged Mimoyecques; the Germans aban- doned half the site. But the Germans had merely given up on the ski sites and shifted over to a simpler launcher. These smaller "modified" sites, as the Allies called them, were more easily built and camouflaged, were simpler to repair when damaged, and were much more difficult targets. Although the British heard of them in February, none were identified in photographs until April 27. They did not seem to pose an immediate threat, and there was not much air effort to spare for them in the month before D-Day. From December to early June the Eighth Air Force alone had lost 49 planes and dropped 17,600 tons of bombs in attacks on V-weapons targets. This was a high proportion of the 154 planes lost and the 36,200 tons of bombs expended in the campaign. Probably much of this effort was wasted. While the Germans had hoped to start V-1 attacks early in 1944, it is likely that factors other than attacks on the ski sites caused the delay. The British attack on Kassel in October 1943 forced the movement of some production facilities; other area attacks reduced production. The first 2,000 V-1's built were faulty, and were scrapped. The attacks on the French railroads also slowed pr
