to deal with the oil installations, while Bomber Command at least had not been supposed to have the accuracy to help out. Germany's oil situation had actually improved in late 1943 and early 1944. Synthetic oil production had grown, along with that of natural crude oil from the new Austrian fields. Italy was no longer a drain, and after taking over most of Italy in September 1943, the Germans had found big fuel reserves there. Bad winter weather had restricted consumption. So German fuel reserves had actually risen. Stocks of aviation gasoline alone rose from 280,000 tons in September 1943 to 574,000 tons in April 1944. Still, if production were halted, that would only be enough to keep the Luftwaffe going for three months. In March 1944 before the Allied oil offensive began, the Germans produced or imported 968,000 tons of oil products: 341,000 tons made in Bergius and Fischer-Tropsch plants: 201,000 tons made in other synthetic plants; 191,000 tons domestically refined from natural crude oil; 49,000 tons produced in occupied countries; and 186,000 tons imported from Hungary and Romania. Aviation gasoline comprised 180,000 tons of this total. The refining of crude oil was concentrated in several areas: in northwest Ger- many at Hamburg and Hannover, at Vienna and Budapest near the Austrian and Hungarian oilfields, and of course at Ploesti. The Nazis had a surplus of refining capacity, so a good deal of destruction would have to be done before the amount of fuel refined was cut. The Nazis mainly relied, however, on synthetic fuel production, using several different processes. This was concentrated around coalfields in the Ruhr, in cen- tral Germany around Leipzig, in Upper Silesia, and in the areas of Czechoslovakia bordering central Germany and Silesia. That the targets, although numerous, tended to be grouped together would help the Allies, allowing a single mission to hit a whole set of targets without dangerously dispersing the fighter cover. Eighteen plants (s
