quarrel over priorities. Each major refinery there had a small marshalling yard associated with it. Restricted by weather, commitments in Ita- ly, and a lack of escort fighters, the Fifteenth Air Force had not been very ac- tive in the strategic air war since Big Week, but it was now getting some Mustangs. On April 5, while a larger force hit the Bucharest marshalling yards, 146 B-24s and 90 B-17s bombed the railroad yards at Ploesti, with intervalometers set  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 146 to space the bombs widely, enlarging the bombing pattern so that some would hit the refineries instead of the nominal targets. Thirteen bombers were lost, but the attack did much damage, as did further attacks on April 15 and 24. By the time of the April 24 attack, Eisenhower had approved an outright at- tack on oil as a measure to defeat the Luftwaffe. On April 19 he gave Spaatz permission to strike oil targets in Germany, on the next two days that offered good visual bombing. Conditions were not suitable until May 12. Then the Eighth dispatched 886 bombers, escorted by 980 fighters from the Eighth and Ninth Air Forces, against the synthetic oil plants in central Germany. The two leading combat wings attacked an aircraft depot at Zwickau to deceive the enemy about the real objective. The Americans expected a tough fight, and they got one. The force going to Zwickau ran into heavy opposition, as 200 enemy fighters plowed into the incoming bombers. A force of 50 twin-engine fighters, and more single-engine planes, jumped the bombers as they returned home. The Americans lost 46 heavy bombers and 10 fighters, while the Germans are known to have had 28 pilots killed and 26 wounded. Despite the heavy loss of bombers, the attacks were effective; 1,718 tons of bombs fell on Merseburg-Leuna and five other oil targets, knocking out several plants completely for a time. An attack on oil targets in Silesia misfired the next day; bad weather forced a diversion to targets on the Baltic
