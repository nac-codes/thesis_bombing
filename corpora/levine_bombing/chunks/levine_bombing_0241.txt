Leuna and five other oil targets, knocking out several plants completely for a time. An attack on oil targets in Silesia misfired the next day; bad weather forced a diversion to targets on the Baltic coast. Preinvasion tasks and weather delayed a return to oil targets until May 28; by then the targets hit earlier were recover- ing. The Eighth sent out a record force of 1,282 bombers, but only about two- thirds reached their primary targets, against strong opposition. The next day, while the rest of the force hit aircraft plants, 224 B-24s of the 2nd Division hit the Poelitz plant for the first time. For some weeks thereafter the Eighth concentrated on supporting the Normandy invasion, but the Fif teenth Air Force pounded the Ploesti refineries on May 5, on May 31, and on D-Day itself. Decoded messages encouraged persistence. On May 16 the Allies decoded a message from the Luftwaffe high command that disclosed that flak batteries were being shifted from other targets to the synthetic oil plants at Poelitz and Blechhammer. On May 21 a message from the Naval high command to Naval Gruppe West was decoded. It warned that oil production was failing. This, and photoreconnaissance pictures, helped lead the British Joint Intelligence Com- mittee to the welcome conclusion that continuing the campaign would produce a crippling effect within three to six months. The day after D-Day, a message sent by the Luftwaffe high command to the 1st Parachute Army on June 5 was decoded that gave dramatic proof that the Luftwaffe was already short of fuel and allocations were being revised and reduced.3 BOMBER COMMAND JOINS IN On June 3 the Air Staff asked Harris to attack ten synthetic oil plants in the Ruhr (which produced 30 percent of German synthetic oil) as soon as the Decisive Offensives I: Oil situation in Normandy allowed. The Ruhr oil plants remained the special, though 147 not exclusive, province of the RAF; it only hit oil plants elsewhere in December. Harris was unenthusiastic
