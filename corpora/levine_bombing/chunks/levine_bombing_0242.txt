I: Oil situation in Normandy allowed. The Ruhr oil plants remained the special, though 147 not exclusive, province of the RAF; it only hit oil plants elsewhere in December. Harris was unenthusiastic about the oil plan. He estimated that destroying the ten plants would require 32,000 tons of bombs, a relatively large amount. (The Eighth Air Force actually dropped only 5,166 tons in the whole first month of its campaign against oil.) But he could not reasonably refuse to take part. On the night of June 12-13, 271 Lancasters carried out an ordinary Oboe-directed attack on the Reich's third-largest Bergius plant at Gelsenkirchen; no master bomber was used. Seventeen planes were lost. The attack caused heavy damage; decoded signals showed that the Germans expected the plant to be out of ac- tion for months. On June 16-17 a similar attack on a plant at Sterkrade had less dramatic results at much higher cost. Attacks on two more plants, on June 21-22, using variants of the 5 Group visual technique, failed outright, thanks to solid overcast and fierce opposition. Except for the initial attack, Bomber Command's first venture against oil since 1941 had gone badly. Of 832 bombers dispatched, 93 had been lost, despite aid from improved jamming.4 If this went on, Bomber Command would do little to help Spaatz, and that at an intolerable cost. (It might have made more sense to send Bomber Command to the refineries at Hamburg and Bremen, which involved a less deep penetration of enemy defenses.) But as it turned out, there were not one, but two ways out of this dilemma. The first, in which the Air Staff had been interested for some months, was to return to daylight operations. In April, Bottomley had suggested that with escort Bomber Command could hit targets in France, the Low Countries, and western Germany in daylight. This would take advantage of American successes during the day and allow more accuracy against small targets. He conceded, however, that the poor armament and lim
