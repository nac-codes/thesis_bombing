ny at all in the first half of July; they concentrated on supporting the campaign in France. But they had a lucky break. On July 13 a Junkers 88G night fighter, full of the latest equipment, landed by mistake in Britain, giving the British intact examples of the SN-2 radar, Flensburg, and Naxos. During and after the Battle of Berlin. in contrast with their efforts in 1942-1943 (see Chapter 4), the British had been strangely lax or ineffective in countering German electronic devices. They now did what R. V. Jones thought should have been done months before. The Monica tail-warning radar on the bombers was hastily removed, neutralizing Flensburg. and a partial silence was imposed on H2S. It would be used over enemy ter- ritory, but only when absolutely needed. This neutralized Naxos and Korfu. (Jones believed that, if taken earlier, these measures alone would have largely frustrated the enemy fighters.) A new form of Window was quickly produced to interfere with the SN-2 radar. The 100 Group soon received Piperack, an airborne jammer for the SN-2, and its Mosquitos were fitted with Serrate IV. which could home in on the SN-2. Other electronic countermeasures devices also came into service: Jostle, an improved device for jamming German fighter communications, and Perfectos, a device that enabled Mosquitos to trigger the IFF recognition signals (Identification Friend or Foe) of German night fighters, betraying their position. From the summer of 1944 the British held an edge in the electronics war that they never lost. The Germans did develop some new devices, but with little effect.6 When Bomber Command returned to Germany on the night of July 18-19, it found the going easier. During the rest of July it carried out five successful attacks on oil plants in the Ruhr. Harris also used the improved conditions to revive the area campaign; the other five major operations of the period were area attacks on Hamburg, Stuttgart, and Kiel, by much larger forces then those sent to
