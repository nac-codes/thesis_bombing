round plants and dispersed facilities in Germany itself were developed but could not be executed. Much  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 152 Decisive Offensives I: Oil of the existing and projected underground plant space was slated for missile and plane production; oil plants could not be built quickly, and the work lagged behind schedule. The Strategic Bombing Survey later judged, however, that if they had been started early enough, underground hydrogenation plants near coalfields, and refineries located by oilfields might have supplied "respectable quantities" of fuel despite bombing, at least for a time. Bombing of transporta- tion facilities, however, would eventually have rendered them useless, and Tallboy bombs might have wrecked the plants themselves. Fuel production and imports declined from 968,000 tons in March, including 180,000 tons of aviation gasoline, to 511,000 tons in June, including 54,000 tons of aviation gasoline. (Allied intelligence estimated a fall from 1,200,000 tons to 670,000 tons.) In July total production fell to 438,000 tons, including 35,000 tons of aviation gasoline, and in August to 345,000 tons, only 17,000 of which was aviation fuel. According to Speer, that month automotive gasoline produc- tion within Germany had fallen to 60,000 tons and diesel fuel to 65,000 tons Nitrogen and rubber production fell precipitately.10 THE BATTLE CONTINUES The Allies were well aware of the German oil crisis, although they under- estimated its magnitude and side effects. To make the oil effort more systematic. a Joint Oil Targets Committee was set up in London on July 7, composed of representatives of Eisenhower, Spaatz's command, Bomber Command, the Air Ministry, British intelligence, and the U.S. Embassy's Economic Objectives Unit. Priority was given to the Bergius plants and to crude-oil refineries. Target selec- tion was now aided by specific information from decoded signals, giving details of damage to some targets. There was encouraging news o
