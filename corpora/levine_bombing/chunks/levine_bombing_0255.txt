Ploesti. On July 9 it returned to Ploesti using H2X for the first time to peer through the smoke screen. The results of this first radar mission were not especially good; they proved better on July 15 but less successful on July 22. On July 28 a new tactic to aid visual bombing was introduced; a master bomber like that used by the British at night flew ahead in a P-38 to see where the smoke screen was thinnest. Instead of being bound to strike a predetermined target, the bombers were directed to those refineries that were most exposed. This worked well, and worked again on July 31. Smoke and skilled repair efforts had raised overall production in July to 190,000 tons, but this was Gerstenberg's last success. By late July fighter resistance was definitely in decline, while cumulative damage from the more accurate bomb- ing was beginning to shut some refineries permanently. When the Fifteenth returned to Ploesti on August 10, the bomber force could afford to string itself out in a long stream. By the time the later groups arrived, the smoke screen had thinned out. On August 17-19 Allied attacks cut production to 10 percent of the March level. These last blows were designed more to stop the enemy from carrying off machinery than halt production; the Germans were about to leave Ploesti. On August 20 the Soviets began a major offensive in Romania and swiftly encircled much of the defending force, and Romania jumped over to the Allied side. On August 30 the Soviets entered Ploesti to find a shambles. The air campaign against Ploesti had lasted just over four months. Despite the early Soviet capture of the area, it had been worthwhile, denying the Nazis at least 700,000 tons of oil products. (Some estimates run considerably higher; the Ploesti campaign results were less thoroughly recorded than other aspects of the oil struggle.) The Americans had also helped the Soviet advance by pin- ning down fighters and flak in defense of Ploesti and damaging rail installations behin
