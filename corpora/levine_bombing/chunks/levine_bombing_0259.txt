service by 1942.15 The Germans were ahead of the Allies in another aircraft development: the rocket fighter. But the Messerschmitt 163B rocket fighter, while a remarkable plane in many ways, was not a viable weapon. On May 10, 1941, it had reached the then-fantastic speed of 601 miles an hour. Udet, although curiously cool to turbojet development, was fascinated by the Me-163 and did his best to foster its development even in 1940-1941. But for all its speed, it had many unenviable features. Its hydrogen peroxide fuel was costly, unstable, and difficult and dangerous to handle. Landing, on a skid rather than on conventional landing gear, was difficult. In a bad landing, unused fuel was liable to explode. The Me-163's worst limitation was its short endurance; it had an effective radius of just 50 miles. The pilot had time to fly straight to a target and make only one or two passes before gliding back to base. Bomber crews found the attacks of the rocket planes terrifying, but the Me-163s probably downed only eight Allied planes. Like the V-2, the Me-163 was a technological feat, but was not relevant to the Nazis' real needs. It represented the sort of "romantic" waste of resources to which the Nazis were prone. The rocket fighter proved to be a blind alley in aircraft development.16 The effort put into rocket planes would have been better expended on the less spectacular but more useful jets. The Nazis threw away some possibilities for early production of jet fighters. As early as 1940 two rival jet fighter projects 157 had developed at the Heinkel and Messerschmitt firms, the Heinkel 280 and the Messerschmitt 262. The He-280 seems to have been somewhat further along than the Me-262. The He-280 flew on admittedly inadequate jet engines in April 1941, shortly before the prototype Me-262 flew using piston engines; the Me-262 made a suc- cessful entirely jet-powered flight only in July 1942. Heinkel was sure that he had a lead time of a full year over the Me-262. Nevert
