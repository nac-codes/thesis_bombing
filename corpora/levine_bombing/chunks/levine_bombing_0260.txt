rototype Me-262 flew using piston engines; the Me-262 made a suc- cessful entirely jet-powered flight only in July 1942. Heinkel was sure that he had a lead time of a full year over the Me-262. Nevertheless, the He-280 was cancelled on September 15, 1942, and the Nazis laid all their bets on the Me-262; the reasons given were its longer endurance and heavier armament (four 30 mm. cannon instead of two.) Heinkel maintained that the real reason for the Air Ministry's action was political. Given Germany's desperate situation, whatever virtues the Me-262 had did not compensate for any delay. But shortages of critical materials, which would have hampered the production of any turbojet engine, made it doubtful that the He-280 could have entered combat in mid-1943, or even earlier, as has sometimes been suggested.17 The Me-262's development crawled along; official interest remained small. During 1942 it became apparent that its BMW jet engines were unsatisfactory; the Junkers Jumo 004 axial-compressor engine was substituted. In December 1942 it was decided to start limited production in January 1944, at a rate of just 20 a month. Milch and Messerschmitt were more interested in the Me-209, the cranky, propeller-driven successor to the Me-109. But in May 1943 Galland flew a prototype Me-262 and was delighted with it. He urged that all-out production begin as soon as possible and that the Me-209 be stopped to free resources for it. Milch agreed to the first, but Messerschmitt managed to delay the cancellation of the Me-209 until November 1943. Hitler wholeheartedly favored jet development, and it secured a high priority. On November 2, 1943, Messerschmitt mentioned to Goering that the Me-262 could haul 2,200 pounds of bombs. Hitler learned of this and decided that the Me-262 would make an ideal blitz bomber to deal with the coming invasion of France. His ideas were not totally unreasonable, but reflected overconfidence in the Luftwaffe's ability to defend Germany itself. And
