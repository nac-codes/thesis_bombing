lnerable when taking off and landing, and the British Second Tactical Air Force, now based on the Continent, mounted standing patrols of Mustangs and Tempests over the jet bases. The Germans countered by massing light flak guns to form protected flight lanes. A flight of conventional fighters covered each takeoff and landing, leading to full- scale battles. In a fight on November 8, Eighth Air Force fighters downed Nowot- ny and another pilot, while losing a P-51. Nowotny's unit had claimed only 22 Allied planes-probably an exaggeration-while losing 26 jet fighters. It was taken out of combat to become the nucleus for a bigger jet unit, Jagdgeschwader 7. The jet fighters did not return to action for some time, and then in numbers too small to make a real difference. The Allies did not fail to pay the forming jet units a visit. On November 18, a massive American fighter sweep of 402 planes went to the jet airfield at Lechfeld and destroyed 14 Me-262s on the ground. Decisive Offensives I: Oil 159 USSTAF had not been passive as the jet threat arose. On July 19 the Eighth Air Force began to bomb some known jet airfields and the principal develop- ment centers at Lechfeld and Leipheim. The Fifteenth's attacks proved more effective. On July 18 and 20 it attacked jet plants at Friedrichshafen, the deer park of the strategic air war. These attacks were later estimated to have cost the Germans 950 jets. They were probably the most effective strikes of the anti- jet campaign; otherwise, production was too well dispersed and hidden to be vulnerable. (Attacks on foundries making the complicated special castings needed for jet engines would have crippled jet production, but this was not realized at the time.) In early September General Spaatz gave jet plants second priority after oil for two weeks, but the resulting attacks had little effect. The jets were less of a threat than they seemed. Jet production had been too long delayed; the planes were too cranky; and above all, the
