September 25 Spaatz and Bottomley issued their own directive spelling out targets for the bombers. The German oil industry, with special emphasis on gasoline, retained first priority. No less than three target systems shared second priority. Of these, the (1) "German rail and waterborne transportation systems" were mentioned first, followed by (2) tank plants, tank depots and ordnance depots and motor transport plants and depots. "Policing attacks" would be made on the Luftwaffe as the tactical situation required. When conditions were un suitable for attacks on specific primary objectives, "important industrial areas" would be hit, using blind bombing when necessary. The September 25 directive gave new importance to transportation, albeit diluted by a continuation of attacks on tank and truck plants and ordnance 163 depots. A minor offensive against these targets had begun in August, but they were too many and too resistant to be easily smashed while oil had priority. The production of tank engines and transmissions, which had been concentrated and vulnerable, was now dispersed. The effort involved was too small to be decisive, but big enough to be a serious diversion. The Germans responded with their last successful "special action" to preserve an industry under attack. Although 10,000 tons of bombs were dropped, they still ground out tanks, albeit perhaps a fifth less than they had planned. They did suffer a particular loss of heavy Tiger tanks; the plant at Kassel that built them was hit hard. Truck production fell to a little more than half of the German Army's minimum requirements, and many of the "new" trucks were really rebuilt damaged vehicles. But the drop in production was due more to transportation difficulties than to direct attacks. Even had more trucks been built, it is doubt- ful that there would have been fuel for them.2 THE GERMAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM The Nazi economy and war effort depended on the efficient operation of a complex, dense, and well
