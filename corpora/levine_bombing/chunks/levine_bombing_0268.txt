n built, it is doubt- ful that there would have been fuel for them.2 THE GERMAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM The Nazi economy and war effort depended on the efficient operation of a complex, dense, and well equipped transportation system. Little cargo went by road even before the attack on fuel production. Older means of transport- inland waterways and railroads-carried most of the freight. Rivers and canals were important, and carried a tenth of the freight load. Three-fourths of all freight went by the railroads. Lavishly equipped, they had been designed to keep the regular economy running while moving troops. There was excess capacity in lines, railroad yard space, and engine houses and plenty of preparation for air attack. Bunkers had been built in the larger yards. The size of Germany's transportation system might have suggested that a crip- pling attack would be a gigantic task. But not all sectors were equally important; it was not necessary to wreck every bit of it to ruin Germany's economy. The main focal point for both rail and water transport was the Ruhr and neighbor- ing areas along the Rhine. The British had overestimated the Ruhr's direct role in armaments production, and the vulnerability of its plants to direct attack. It was nevertheless crucial. Its mines supplied coal not just to its own industry but to much of the rest of Germany, including the railroads. To keep going, the Germans had to ship massive amounts of coal and other products from the Ruhr to points all over western Germany, and bring raw materials to the Ruhr plants. Germany's two other coal-based heavy industry areas, Upper Silesia and the Saar, were far less important than the Ruhr and were more immediately threatened by Allied armies. German war production might limp along without them, but it could not last long without the Ruhr. As the Allies knew, the Ruhr particularly depended on inland waterways, especially the Dortmund-Ems and Mittelland canals. The Dortmund-Ems Canal connected the
