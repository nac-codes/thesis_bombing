upplies would no longer be made. Despite his numerous opponents, Tedder got his way. He cogently argued that enemy transportation was a "common denominator" on which the strategic and tactical air forces could cooperate, and that hitting transportation was com- plementary, not competitive, with hitting oil. It was a direct way to support the armies, and a better one than carpet bombing, which airmen disliked. Sup- porting Eisenhower's forces remained the paramount consideration. On September 12 Harris and Doolittle had already agreed to keep on hitting marshalling yards in the Ruhr. When clouds prevented visual attacks on oil plants, the Eighth would hit marshalling yards, using H2X. A massive program of attacks on rail centers, as well as line cutting by fighter-bombers, was launched to support the unsuccessful attempt to take a bridgehead over the Rhine.4 These attacks seemed to have little effect on German military operations. But on September 19 Harris agreed to attack the German canal system, and this had spectacular results. RIVERS AND CANALS On the night of September 23-24, 5 Group sent 136 Lancasters to the Dortmund- Ems Canal, near Ladbergen. Despite troublesome clouds, five Mosquitos marked  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 166 Decisive Offensives II: Transportation the target and 617 Squadron dropped Tallboys, while the rest of the force dropped smaller bombs. The embankments were smashed, and the canal was drained. This was the beginning of a long campaign against the canals. The Ger- mans mobilized masses of workers to repair the banks, but they were hampered by a lucky break: an attack on the Hamm marshalling yards destroyed 15 carloads of tools slated for the Dortmund-Ems job. One of the two passages of the Dortmund-Ems Canal was reopened on October 21, but another disaster for the Germans had taken place in the meantime. Allied officers argued about whether to mount a major effort to cut off the German forces west of the Rhine by bombing the bridges
