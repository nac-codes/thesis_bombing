ut another disaster for the Germans had taken place in the meantime. Allied officers argued about whether to mount a major effort to cut off the German forces west of the Rhine by bombing the bridges over the river. Only one bridge had to be destroyed to block the river, however, and on October 14 a lucky accident destroyed the Cologne-Mulheimer Bridge. An attack on the Cologne marshalling yards accidentally set off demolition charges on the bridge. It fell, blocking navigation on the Rhine. After November 13, high water caused by autumn rains let barges with light loads pass over the wreckage for a few weeks; then damage to other bridges slowed traffic to a crawl. Finally. the destruction by the Ninth Air Force of another bridge, at Neuwied, on January 16 blocked the Rhine completely. Hours after the Cologne-Mulheimer Bridge fell, two very heavy British area attacks, each mounted by over 1,000 bombers. had wrecked Duisburg harbor, the main Rhine outlet of the Ruhr. This disrupted movement even of local traffic on the lower Rhine. On October 26, 242 B-24s cut the Mittelland Canal at Minden. Repairs on both major canals were hurried, and by early November both had to be attacked again. On the night of November 4-5, 5 Group sent 176 bombers to the Dortmund-Ems Canal and again broke its banks. Only three planes were lost. The Germans again worked quickly. Attacks by the Eighth Air Force and Bomber Command on November 6-7 misfired, but on November 21-22 the canal was broken again, by 128 planes; this time none was lost. The Germans now sealed off the narrower of the two channels and concentrated on repairing the other one. Also on November 21-22. 143 Lancasters smashed the Mittelland Canal at Gravenhorst, losing two bombers. Both canals were repaired once again. On January 1, 1945, 5 Group returned; 104 planes smashed the Dortmund-Ems, and 157 cut the Mittelland. Only two bombers were lost. Another attack on the Mittelland Canal, on February 21-22, shut it for the rest
